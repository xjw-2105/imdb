Xstal,"Dec 16, 2022",9/10,"Colonel Kurtz has disappeared within the jungle, with his troupe of fighting fiends ready to rumble, you've been tasked to take him out, but first you have to search and scout, along a river where the residents are disgruntled (to put it mildly). Lots of bloodshed, bullets, ballistics then flow, there's napalm too that conjures up a glow, many lives are lost and taken, in this hell where you're forsaken, but don't ask why - because nobody, really, knows.Still a spectacular piece of filmmaking that demonstrates on many levels the destruction, physical and mental that armed conflict causes, and yet we perpetually fail to learn from past events."
Hitchcoc,"Feb 12, 2007",9/10,"There are films we watch because they are good, even though they are painful for us. This is a film I saw one time. At that time I thought to myself, this is enough. It was painful to make that journey down the river, wondering what was around every corner. Then we meet the products of our own id impulses, as we are the enemy, our souls have been brought down to this. At the end of the river is the man who came before us, and we see the uselessness of the journey. It is the Heart of Darkness. There are death masters like Robert Duvall. There are those who can only hope to survive, but the war is the master. The Doors music as the napalm settles gently on the treetops and across the ground, sweeps us up gently. Meanwhile it is consuming the flesh of the Vietnamese people, as well as an occasional American soldier. The ancient Romans could not envision peace without war. We and much of the world seem to have embraced those tenets put forth some two thousand years ago. This film gets into the marrow."
Nazi_Fighter_David,"Dec 11, 2008",9/10,"After the success of the first two 'Godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively, Francis Ford Coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in Vietnam, which had concluded with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975 The plot was loosely based on the book 'Heart of Darkness,' a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz, a trading company agent in the African jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the nativesCoppola retains much of this, including such details as the severed heads outside Kurtz's headquarters and his final words, ""The horror the horror""In the film, Sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into Cambodia, and eliminate, with ""extreme prejudice,"" a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities On his journey up the river to the renegade's camp he experiences the demoralization of the US forces, high on dope or drunk with powerAlthough, as a result of cuts forced on Coppola, the film was accused of incoherence when first released, it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of Vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre In 1980 the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound""Apocalypse Now"" was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored As a result, the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is"
GOPC,"Sep 2, 2005",10/10,"As I stated above, I think that the 2000 version of the film ought to be treated separately. The Redux is not just a longer version. It contains two new and important scenes, and one of them, the ""french"" episode, adds a whole new touch to a classic movie, WITHOUT breaking the atmosphere or disturbing the overall picture. I remember as I saw the Redux for the first time, that my whole understanding of the war in Vietnam changed, and how I had to go to the library and get an update on a few things. Also it is interesting that Coppola chose the year 2000 for the longer Redux. My guess is that he feels that the movie is as important today as it was back in 1979. He even went to the trouble of making an excellent piece of art even better, in order to actually make all the old fans see the new stuff, and to present a whole new generation with a very controversial and strong comment on one of the most bloody wars in recorded history. The movie is thought-provoking indeed, but also it has a visually very beautifully composed screenplay. Capturing the madness and chaos of war the storyline is also filled with more or less obvious metaphors and philosophical or existential riddles. A friend of mine called it ""the most philosophical of all movies"" - perhaps an overstatement - in my opinion it is just a very good film about war and the politics of war. But I can see that there is plenty for everyone here. What I'm saying is that it's one of those movies that you are likely to hear distinctly different opinions about, and you are most probably going to think again and again about it. I've seen the Redux 5, 6 or 7 times, and it is always a puzzling experience. Highly recommended."
jokeco68,"Dec 21, 2004",10/10,"My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious.This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers.Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.A little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie"
bob the moo,"Mar 27, 2004",N/A,"In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz. Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy. Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad. Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny. However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.That Redux was going to be anything less than brilliant was never in doubt: it was never going to be so different from the original that it would destroy or significantly damage the reputation or impact that the film has. What was in question to my mind was whether or not Coppola should have just left well enough alone.  I have seen the documentary about the making of the original film, wherein Coppola derides many of his scenes and decides to cut them out of his movie even as he finishes shooting them - the plantation scene being one of the key ones that he felt just didn't work.  It was for this reason that I was interested to see what the additions and rejigging of scenes had done to the film.The strengths of Redux is that Apocalypse Now was never about the straight story, it was more about the journey Willard undertakes rather than a build up to a traditional conclusion - while the ending is big, it is no more or less important that anything that has gone before it.  So for that reason it is a good thing that, simply put, there is now more of the journey to be enjoyed!  `49 minutes of new material' my dvd cover screams at me; combine this with the movement of scenes and certainly it does have the feel of a different (albeit familiar) film rather than just a bit of spit and polish with some new CGI effects (yes ET, I'm looking at you).  However this increased material also brings with it the problems that not all the material compliments the film in terms of total quality.None of the added scenes or sequential movements are bad or even average, they are all interesting, but some just don't seem to really fit.  The plantation scene has some great dialogue (that strikes a real chord so recently post-Iraq) and it makes it's points but it just didn't seem to fit. I can see what Coppola was trying to do and, if you watch Hearts Of Darkness, you can see that it frustrates him that it doesn't work, but he got it right first time, it doesn't fit despite it's standalone merits. Likewise the playboy bunny scene intrigued me as I tried to get more from the bunny's semi-speech about being made to do things and the theme of objectification, but again it didn't totally work and seemed out of place.Despite these two major scenes not totally fitting, they are still interesting and, if you came for the journey, then that is what matters and they present themselves as a flawed part of that journey - but a part of that journey nonetheless.  Some of the smaller additions actually contribute a lot more to the film.  Little moments in the boat show Willard to be more relaxed as a man than the original did - and this greatly benefits my understanding and appreciation of his character.  How he interacts with the rest of the crew is also improved.  Other minor additions to existing scenes serve to enhance them, but improvement in some areas is difficult when it comes to this film.I won't go into details on cast, performances and the themes of the film as I have already done that in my other review.  Suffice to say that, if you loved Apocalypse Now then Redux will likely both enhance your enjoyment and slightly irritate you at the same time.  The film easily stands up to the longer running time - as another user said, I could easily give the five hour version a stab (well, maybe once!) as the journey is the all.  The additions may not be without flaw, but then that's why they were higher on the editing hierarchy than the rest of the stuff!  However they add interest and minutes to the journey - both of which are good things.Overall, it is very difficult to take `one of the best films ever madeT ' and make it better - and Coppola hasn't done that here, but he hasn't damaged it either.  It isn't a brand new film and it doesn't mess around with the original so much that it could be called a different film - so I won't compare the two as to which is `better'.  Suffice to say that, while I don't totally agree that you `can't have too much of a good thing', certainly an extra 49 minutes is gratefully received where it doesn't damage or cheapen but only seeks to enhance and support."
dk777,"Oct 11, 2022",10/10,"Apocalypse Now is an interesting film, not because it is supposedly an anti-war film, but because it is surreal and shows an interesting journey into madness.Martin Sheen gives us an insight into his character here and we see the senselessness of the whole situation and how easy it is to lose yourself in certain situations.We follow his journey and the various events that befall him and a small group of soldiers in a patrol boat traveling deep into the jungle. On their way, really bizarre things happen.Along the way, we also see Robert Duvall in the role of a completely insane officer, whose episodic role has a profound impact on the film.The film should essentially be anti-war, but it didn't strike me as such, but simply as a film about the fate of various people who found themselves in unusual situations.Their whole mission doesn't really make sense, and in the end they accomplished nothing, but that's the point. Everything was really in vain.The direction is excellent, the music is perfectly integrated into the film and matches the tone of the film.For me, this is a film about the loss of reason and the journey to madness. If civilization completely collapses, and somewhere it has already collapsed a long time ago, this is roughly what we can expect, madness and insanity.I watched three versions of the film and I liked the Redux version the best.An interesting and brutal journey into madness and darkness."
Vartiainen,"May 5, 2015",7/10,"I have nothing but respect for Francis Ford Coppola. He is deservedly one of the greatest directors of all time and his style of film-making is pretty much inimitable. Yet I can't really say I enjoyed this movie. At least not the Redux version I saw.First the good parts. It's a damn beautiful film. The mood, as they slowly drift up the Vietnamese river, keeps building and building and you can smell the heat and wetness in the air, feel the sweat dripping down your back, hear the hollow echoing screaming around you. The script was heavily inspired by the classic novella Heart of Darkness and that's exactly the mood and atmosphere they achieved.The acting is also topnotch, with one glaring exception, and I've never seen Charlie Sheen do a more convincing role than here. You can almost see the cracks in their souls as the heaviness of the war settles around them as they are pulled from combat and send to face almost certain deaths as they hunt their elusive quarry.It's a well-made film. Everything from camera-work to sets to directing works, and works so well, but the fact remains that's it's just too long. At least the Redux version. You can only stretch the atmosphere and suspense for so long until you start to look at the clock. That's partly the purpose and to this film's credit, any other film would have crumbled way sooner, but crumble it does, eventually.I also have problems with Marlon Brando's performance. Apparently the man showed up hugely overweight, completely unprepared and pretty much being as unprofessional as you can be. And it shows. The final third of the film throws the suspense straight out of the window and pretty much the only question left is ""Brando, what happened, man?""I can see why people love this film. It's a haunting take on war, has amazing atmosphere, vivid imagery, memorable characters and as a whole there are very few movies like it. Personally I lost interest after the halfway point, but that's just me."
Theo Robertson,"Jun 23, 2004",10/10,"I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time . I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw itThis leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound , editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted , and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the borderHow about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director , I said "" was "" in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head , but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen , but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes , so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states "" This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam "" he's right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970 ) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of AmericaIt's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party , or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars , though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novelMy all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb"
kenjha,"May 12, 2008",7/10,"Coppola couldn't leave well enough alone. Redux adds an embarrassing scene where the Suzy-Q Playboy Bunnies sell their bodies for chopper fuel. There is also a long, boring episode at a French plantation where Sheen ends up sacking a Frenchwoman with an accent so thick that nary a word from her is comprehensible. Other scenes have also been expanded, making the film as bloated as Brando. However, the spectacular imagery remains intact, along with the soundtrack of classic 1960s songs and, in that rousing attack on the village, Wagner. Rather than improving the film, this overindulgent director's cut cancels out some of the positive qualities of the 1979 version, reducing the rating from 8 to 7."
draney-600-338393,"Jun 23, 2017",5/10,"Now, it would appear by judging the user and critic reviews that my opinion is in the minority. Nonetheless, I cannot for the life of me understand the extremely high ratings for this film. The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon and Good Morning Vietnam all much more enjoyable. The cinematography of Apocalypse Now is very good at times, the opening scene being arguably my favourite part of the film as the music is perfect. However throughout the whole film I just felt an extreme lack of consistency with the storyline, too much confusion and jolting between themes. Whilst some of the action scenes were brilliant, I just felt a real lack of connection to the purpose. Now I won't spoil the ending but let's just say I really could not make heads or tail of the decisions made, all logic was out of the window. I am never usually critical of a film and this must be the highest rated picture that I really do not get on well with, for some reason I just expected a lot more and was very disappointed."
squigemartin,"Jun 3, 2021",10/10,"This film is completely brilliant. The first half of the film has more violence and a lot more fun to the film but I'm the second half, the true physiological torment of Vietnam is shown. When they enter Kurtz's camp, the mood of the film completely changes from mildly disturbing and a bit mad, to incredibly disturbing and complete madness. The cinematography, writing, acting, direction and sound are incredible from one of the best films of the 20th century. I highly recommend you to watch this film."
Cinema_Hound,"Jun 25, 2001",10/10,"As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,""middle of the road"" comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film. ""Why would you like a film that's so confusing?"" ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality....This is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted ""standards"" of death and destruction (Am I the only one who's troubled by the fact that we have 'standards' for death and destruction????), so they send the ""Conformity Police"" out to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm....Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppola, whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intent of the movie, and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have 'grown' itself, like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold. So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then watch it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you that have seen it, watch it again with the mindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it, be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!"
surfisfun,"Jan 3, 2018",10/10,"Top 20 war moviein Redux they added long scenes that changed tempo of movie.
The one at the plantation didn't work well in context.
What a great film!"
jande9,"Jan 12, 2005",10/10,"This movie changed the art of film making, telling a complex story in a powerful new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke. The film uses music not as a score laid in later, but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers, radios etc. Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration, taking scenes and characters, and putting them into entirely different surroundings. That is a tricky and brave thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune, and films him so that you can barely see his face. The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding, and it works beautifully. This movie belongs in the top ten."
The Claw,"Apr 20, 1999",N/A,"So just how insane is 'Apocalypse Now'?  Well, let's say that it is the kind of film that makes you want to bang your head against the wall.  The beginning has no credits or titles; nothing.  The whole film seems like it's taking place on a different world, and as the story moves on, sanity itself is shed.  There was a French plantation scene that got cut out, and an alternate ending that would have had a massive battle scene outside Kurtz's compound.'Apocalypse Now' is not a realistic film in the sense that the presentation of the Vietnam War is far from correct: helicopters going in BEFORE the napalm strikes, a USO show in the jungle at night, and the final bridge all lit-up like a Christmas tree.  (for more realistic 'Nam War movies, try 'The Deer Hunter' or 'Platoon')But what 'Apocalypse Now' lacks in historical accuracy, it makes up in artistic and dramatic scripting.  Some of the best photography and lighting ever can be found here.The film also raises some severe philosophical issues, and gives us entirely new ones.  When the movie begins, the war is raging around us.  It is chaotic and nerve-racking, yet still rational.  When we finally get to Kurtz's base, the action has died down, but rational thinking has long since been vanquished to the point of total lunacy.  This shows us the truth about men of war in times of war and peace.  The voyage down the river has a sense of time travel (a sense that would have been much more apparent had the French Plantation scene remained.)  And when you get to the end, keep in mind the old phrase: The King is dead...  Long live the king.Is Kurtz insane?  Or are we not yet ready to understand him?  These questions and more are up to you as 'Apocalypse Now has no easy answers."
Quinoa1984,"Jan 6, 2000",10/10,"Apocalypse Now is not only my personal favorite work by Francis Ford Coppolla, it's also one of the great visions ever put onto cinema. It makes what was horrific, strange, and ironically exciting and mysterious about the Vietnam War into this mad tale of obsession, death, loss, and the dark side of humanity. While the stories behind the production of the film made it notorious and rather risky back in 1979, it works on its own terms and represents not just Coppola's genius but others in the Zoetrope team as well. It also paints a sometimes lurid, ultra-violent, bleak and curious view of what war does to people, both in the lower ranks, the big-guns, and those who go too far ""up the river"".Many have also been perplexed by Marlon Brando's performance in the film, but it's actually one of his very best turns on screen, albeit improvised and close to running off the rails. His few moments on screen (even in the somewhat unnecessary scene plopped into the Redux version) there's enough conviction in what he's saying- and what perhaps isn't said- that makes the trip down the river worthwhile on an intellectual and poetic level. And making up the bulk of the film are delirious turns by Robert Duvall (a Oscar nominated turn he should've won), Martin Sheen as the Captain with almost too much to ponder in an ever increasing state of everything but him being insane; character actors like Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne have some of the best work they've ever done. And it goes without saying that Dennis Hopper comes close to stealing any scene he's in, for better or worse, with the most to say in rambling, yet coherent words.Every time I watch this film (and mostly the original version which is what first drew me in completely as opposed to the very good if muddled Redux version) I am astounded with how operatic everything is, and how the variations on the madness and chaos of Vietnam is put together. Of course one can give adulation to Coppola for this as he completed it without totally going off the deep end or possibly dying, and his talents are pulled to their richest peaks here as a storyteller and director of actors. But it can't be said enough how much I can't get enough of Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which has in part come close to perfect for this kind of epic film. The music is perfectly eerie and insidious, with the Doors song used for one of my favorite iconic scenes in the movies (both of them). Walter Murch's editing- which apparently was what saved the film from being a four-hour disaster- makes the action move when it needs to and for individual shots to get their due. And even the production design is remarkable and, to the extent it goes to, original in its partial translation of both Conrad's fiction and the unfortunate realities of life on the river.If you haven't seen it yet, in short, get off your ass and get a copy; it might cause a kind of shell-shock for a viewer after first taking it all in, but it has some of the purest, most rewarding bits of cinema ever to come out of that all-too-brief American new-wave of the 1970's."

Martin Sheen was an excellent choice for the lead. The editing is very well done that one can feel the tension rising during the progress of the film while they go up the river searching for the renegade, every sound and music complement that tension rising, but when they reach their destination, that final part is a let down, for I was expecting to see the madness and monstrosity of that renegade so talked about throughout the movie, but Marlon Brando's performance for that role was weak and a bad choice, and it seems above all a flaw in the script about the characterization of his persona.About the Redux version, it was nothing more than a deceitful marketing strategy, because the almost 1 hour of new scenes add nothing worthwhile to the story, they cut the flow of the rising tension and ultimately make it a worse movie.Original: 7/10Redux: 5/10"
michael_the_nermal,"Oct 17, 2007",7/10,"Warning! Spoilers Ahead! This movie seems like the high-water mark for Francis Ford Copolla; nothing he has made since has been as favorably reviewed in the eyes of most critics. This is the third Copolla movie I've seen, and, while I admire Copolla's ambition, the film does not compare to his two classic Godfather movies. Simply put, the acting is not as excellent, and there are too many extraneous scenes.The movie is most definitely NOT a straight Vietnam war movie, or even a straight war movie, period. There is little attempt at realism here. It is, simply, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" set in the Vietnam War. Kurtz, as he was in the novel, is an idealistic white man who is the best of the best in his own civilization but, when exposed to the other-worldliness of a non-Western tropical society beset with colonial exploitation and the white man's savagery while trying to ""tame"" this landscape, he himself becomes the most demonic of the savages. Conrad's protagonist in the framework story, Marlowe, is reinvented as an out-of-it army officer assigned to kill the savage Kurtz. While he moves toward's Kurtz's lair in the heart of the jungle, he encounters the madness of Vietnam, including the Americans' disregard for human life, a battle without a commanding officer, and crazed GIs, bereft of the veneer of civilization, assaulting a USO show featuring Playboy bunnies. The results are ultimately uneven, and this may be due in large part to the difficulties of adapting Conrad's novel to the screen, especially when set in the context of the Vietnam War.Conrad's novel was meant to highlight the horrors of white cruelty towards Africans in the Belgian Congo in their pursuit for ivory and rubber wealth. The Vietnam War is a bit more ambiguous with regards to similar colonial ambitions. Historians today still debate the reasons for the Americans entering Vietnam, but it seems a bit of a stretch to compare Vietnam with the blatant colonialism Conrad was describing. Copolla made a rather odd choice by selecting Vietnam as a proxy for the savagery of Belgian colonial rule, and this made his adaptation all the more difficult. Secondly, Copolla also had difficulty translating Conrad's symbols in a visual format. The savage whites are shown as helicopter pilots who spray bullets and fluorescent napalm on helpless victims below. It all seems like too much for the senses to take in. The massacre on the riverboat seems too quick and abrupt, and does not flow smoothly with the theme of savagery Copolla apparently had in mind.Copolla, unfortunately, did not have the perfect cast of actors he had in ""The Godfather."" Martin Sheen is very good as the Marlowe character, but, as he is the ""narrator"" of the story, his participation is mostly subdued. Marlon Brando has deteriorated greatly since his role as Don Corleone. His delivery is monotone and stiff, and his acting utterly lethargic. He clearly seems to be going through the motions as the Kurtz character. The actors on Marlowe's boat do well, but do not compare to the ""Godfather"" cast.In all, this was a highly ambitious and worthy film, but the difficulty of placing this vision on screen makes it flawed. The best scene is in the ""redux"" version, where Martin Sheen faces the last vestiges of desperate colonialism on a French rubber plantation. That alone is a classic movie scene, and much closer to Conrad's work than most of the film's frantic, chaotic scenes. I recommend ""Apocalypse Now,"" but do not expect a masterpiece."
robert3750,"Jun 28, 2021",5/10,"I honestly don't find it all that interesting. Yes, it has some interesting, even spectacular images, but for me, it has no engaging story or characters. I simply didn't care what happened to Willard, Kurtz, or anyone else. Everything I've heard says it's not a realistic depiction of Vietnam, including the famous helicopter attack. The sound is good, but the cinematography is somewhat overrated. It's not even a large format film. I get that this film is supposed to be Big Important Cinema, and I'm certainly not one of those people who sneers at the likes of Citizen Kane or 2001 (I think highly of both of those films), but this one?

More than any other movie, there are scenes here that are seared into my memory. Rarely do I give 10/10. This is one movie where I gave a 10 without reservations. There are more iconic, original and impressive scenes here than any modern movie. There is no CGI, just real movie making.

Willard who's assigned to travel to Cambodia during the Vietnam War to terminate the demented Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz is in the midst of attempting unapproved and bloody operations in the deepest jungles lead by local tribesmen and U. S. soldiers. Willard is joined by staff members Chief (Albert Tucker), Chef (Frederic Forrest), Clean (a very young Laurence Fishburne) and Lance (Sam Bottoms). Willard teams up with loopy Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his helicopter brigade and some Playboy bunnies for entertainment purposes and a French family stubbornly not wanting to leave the premises. This leads up to an epic battle against the sadistic Kurtz.After finally seeing the redux version of ""Apocalypse Now"", I can admit that it exceeded everything the shorter version of this classic film has to offer. The AFI has ranked it as one of the top film in movie history and I have no reason to argue that analogy in any way possible. It was truly an amazing masterpiece film and I am just so greatly honoured to witness one of the greatest films ever made.If anyone was expecting a feel-good movie, well what the hell were you smoking? There's no feel-good elements to this film. This is the threshold to hell. The weak at heart is not invited to this party. I'm not trying to be mean, but if you can't take the brutal grimness of this movie, then it's really not for you to see. There are some comical elements, but not intended for chuckling, but for a much darker tone. Martin Sheen truly delivers as Capt. Willard a hired assassin sent on a dangerous mission to track down and kill one of his own kind named Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando who was his demented best), who has now gone on the brink of dementia has developed an operation set up the deepest darkest jungles in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. One thing I don't understand is why couldn't the Army just simply sent him home via Section 8? I mean lots of Vietnam vets fell too dementia during these harsh moments. Robert Duvall as a tough, but eccentric Lt. Col. Kilgore who enjoys the aroma of Napalm in the morning. Every scene that Duvall is in he just steals every scene he's in.It was very smart of Sheen to take this role, if anything, by the end of this movie, his character should have been rewarded a Silver Star or a Purple Heart or something. I mean he's aboard in a vulnerable navy boat as he crosses the jungle as he eerily gets closer to Kurtz and his insane demesne and as he draws near, I fear that Willard might be on the brink of the dark side himself. With the conditions they're up against, anyone can go bonkers Kurtz, Willard, Kilgore, anyone. You really can't rest on your laurels and say ""what will be will be.""By expanding the film to an extra 49 minutes, I don't know what the story would be without the French plantation in Cambodia. I think it would be lost in the shuffle that we see these people argue over issues like politics as they exchange brandy and cigars maybe it's a ploy for Willard to have his last chance in preserving his sanity.I had a chance to see it on my outdoor theatre. Just the whirling sounds of the helicopters and the explosions of the bombs sound so close to you that it could almost blow up right into your faces. This film is the perfect war movie with great acting, lots of intense scenes and a film that truly won't insult your intelligence. You're more crazier than Kurtz if you choose to neglect this movie."
glowback,"Jun 22, 2006",10/10,"Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning, it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate. How insane the world is and the power of will and friendship, love and passion. A must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever! Many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this!!"
cristiangrecu,"Jul 4, 2004",10/10,"Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named there). The greatest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician, most of his films lack depth.Saving Ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view, but its message is dull and while its very entertaining, it doesn't make you think about anything. AN is the best movie I ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things, starting from war in general, the clash of civilizations, the condition of soldier in wartimes (is a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he is neither, the french lady says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false. But a great movie, and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments, not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he isn't, nobody holds the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its outer beauty, amazing scenes, great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied. But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary.Both Copolla and Moore tackle similar issues, but while Copolla presents matters from an outside , objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary ... It is really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway, if you want to start to understand a little of the Vietnam war, the Iraq war, the second World War and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie, and not the other one ..."
alexkolokotronis,"Apr 24, 2008",10/10,"From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the:The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. Coppola though makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film. The writing was of course amazing too. It brought you write into the middle of the movie. It never made me bored and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm.The acting was bone-chilling. Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded, out of whack colonel. When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes. Like the movie he was freakish. To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal. It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies, among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming. Also Duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a cliché. Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both love.I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best. There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and great ending. Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now."
SoundJoeDunn1888,"Nov 25, 2023",7/10,Some excellent performances. And a decent cast of actors. With Brandos Gravitas hard to dislike. Sometimes the soundtrack can be physically off putting. But occasionally the music treats you with Valkyries and The Stones which is enjoyable. I would probably argue it is Horror before it is a war movie as the brutality and graphic depictions can be pretty grim. Similar vibes to Event Horizon on that front. Thought it was quite hard to understand the dialogue as it was loud and manic quite often making deciphering sentences difficult at times. But to be fair the dialogue is only marginally important. The story is also not overly important. Understanding the main plot is a must for most films. But watching the characters personal decents into their own madness and imagining the conditions which lead to horrendous circumstances becoming the accepted norm is where I feel the flms main objective lies and it does this reasonably well. I gave the movie a 7 as I was reasonably entertained and enjoyed it in spells. I did find it a little disjointed and unsettling at times and that's not really my idea of enjoyable viewing. But as its a well loved Movie. I can understand that this sort of artistic direction appeals to a large audience. Ticked off the Bucket Watch List.
Wuchakk,"Mar 14, 2014",10/10,"The original ""Apocalypse Now"" is an awe-inspiring masterpiece and is my all-time favorite film. Memorable scenes abound, starting with the mind-blowing opening with Willard (Martin Sheen) having a mental breakdown in his sweltering Saigon hotel room to the tune of The Doors' ""The End.""Speaking of Sheen, people overlook the fact that he expertly carries the film. His haunting commentary is one of the most effective narrations in cinematic history and hooks the viewer into the nightmare-adventure.I could go on and on about the noteworthy scenes, but I'll resist, except to comment on Col. Kurtz: Was he really insane or actually a bold genius? General Corman informs Willard: ""He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops."" And, yet, Kurtz was accomplishing what the US military couldn't or wouldn't do because of political complications and niceties. I bring this up because, as I've aged, I've come to see that I'M Kurtz in some ways -- operating ""out there"" beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work.The script was written by John Milius with alterations by Coppola as he shot the film whilst the narration was written by Michael Herr. The meaning of the story is obvious: The trip up the river led by Capt. Willard exposes him to two extreme viewpoints of war represented by the two colonels he encounters on his long journey, both of whose names start with 'K,' which is no accident:Lt. COL. KILGORE (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it, i.e. Glorifies it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning."" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war.COL. KURTZ (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's living horror and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard. The existential Kurtz becomes increasingly disillusioned -- even crazy -- after jumping ship from the system and now has no sanctuary. Death is the only way out. His consolation is that Willard will tell his son the truth.The ""Redux"" version was put together by Coppola and released in 2001 with the addition of 49 minutes of material that he originally cut, not to mention placing Clean's surfing scene later in the story.Coppola made the right decisions with his original 1979 edit of the film (2 hours, 33 minutes) since the extra footage of ""Redux"" tends to drag the film down with 1 or 2 scenes being dubiously scripted, e.g. The theft of Kilgore's surf board. Not every idea that is birthed during the creative process is worthy of the final product and ""Redux"" illustrates this. Thus the new footage of ""Redux"" should've arguably been relegated to the ""deleted scenes"" section.That said, I've warmed up to ""Redux"" and feel it's a worthy version of the film, but only if you've watched the Theatrical Cut and want more. ""Redux"" successfully fleshes out the characters and gives them more dimension, especially Willard and Kurtz. Plus the sequence involving Kurtz reading a couple of TIME magazine articles illustrates beyond any shadow of doubt that he wasn't insane and that the brass simply slandered him as crazy in order to justify the assassination of a decorated American officer.Coppola's preferred cut of the film is the ""Final Cut,"" released in 2019, which runs a half hour longer than the Theatrical Cut. In other words, it trims the fat off of ""Redux."" There's also a ""First Assembly"" version, a bootleg, that runs 4 hours, 49 minutes.The film was shot in the Philippines.GRADE: A+"
BA_Harrison,"Dec 17, 2015",5/10,"'This is the end' sings Jim Morrison as choppers criss-cross the screen. No, Jim, it's just the beginning. The beginning of a 202-minute, drug-fuelled Vietnam war epic that follows a group of US soldiers upriver, deep into enemy territory, where they witness madness, come to realise the futility of their conflict, and are reminded of the heart of darkness that beats in all men. And like their mission, it's extremely hard going at times.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this wild '70s classic starts off brilliantly, with war weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) being sent on a covert mission to assassinate renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), whose behaviour and methods are proving an embarrassment to the US army. An early set-piece—an air attack on a Vietcong village to the strains of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries—is hugely impressive, boding well for the rest of the film. The genius continues with Robert Duvall's unforgettable performance as bonkers Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, while a jungle encounter with a tiger, and a visit by some Playboy playmates to boost moral only add to the fun.Unfortunately, once the group of soldiers arrive at a French plantation, Apocalypse Now Redux becomes as bloated and unintelligible as its out-of-shape, mumbling star Brando: the action slows down to a snail's pace, and the vast amount of narcotics consumed by cast and crew becomes more than evident, the film turning into a dull psychedelic haze of drug-fuelled weirdness. Dennis Hopper, as a crazed photo journalist, is particularly spaced out, acting like he's single-handedly snorted the entire cocaine supply of the Philippines. This half of the film, as Hopper might say, is a real drag, man.If I ever decide to watch Apocalypse Now again, which I think is unlikely, I'll be sure to watch the original theatrical version. Many think it is better; even if that isn't the case, it's definitely shorter.7.5/10 for everything that happens before the plantation scene; 2.5/10 for the rest. So that's an average of 5/10."
Prismark10,"Aug 2, 2020",10/10,"I have seen Apocalypse Now so many times over the decades, with various different cuts that Francis Coppola has released. I even once went over parts of the Grand Canyon on a helicopter with Wagner's The Ride of the Valkyries blaring out. It was like experiencing a moment of the movie.Co written by John Milius, one of the most right wing guys in Hollywood. Apocalypse Now is not really anti war, it sat too much on the fence with the Vietnamese being cannon fodder. The Vietnam War had only ended a few years before the film started production. Major film studios were in no mood to be too overtly critical about the war. That will happen in the 1980s with Oliver Stone.Coppola uses Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness as a metaphorical journey. A war that started off with good intentions by the Americans. Help the Vietnamese and save them from communism. You have Colonel Kilgore's (Robert Duvall) gung ho performance that involves Napalm and surfing. It then ends with Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) a once brilliant soldier literally gone mad.Coppola said of the movie's production ""My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam."" A typhoon had destroyed the film set in the Philippines. Martin Sheen was encouraged to get drunk for his opening scenes and promptly had a near fatal heart attack. An overweight Marlon Brando turned up on the film set without reading the script. It led Coppola to shoot Brando with light and shadows to hide his girth.Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) a Special Ops officer is sent on a secret mission into Cambodia to kill Colonel Kurtz who has gone rogue. He has set up his own military unit with a local tribe using savage methods.Willard goes up river in a small navy patrol boat to Cambodia. A journey where they meet oddballs, a party of Playboy Playmates entertaining the troops, a trip to a French plantation (Special Editions), a journey that becomes increasingly dark, dangerous and nightmarish. Willard particularly does not care much for the crew of the patrol boat.Apocalypse Now is an audacious dazzling epic that becomes a journey into madness. I dread to think how much of the Philippine jungle was firebombed during the making of the film.Coppola was at the height of his powers after his success with the two Godfather films. There is wonderful craftsmanship on display. Also wilful disregard for animal life with the slaughter of the water buffalo in the climax. Sorry Francis, your excuse about that scene is lame.There are supporting roles from Harrison Ford playing Colonel George Lucas to Dennis Hopper playing a wacky journalist in Kurtz's compound. Even Scott Glen has a small non vocal appearance and Laurence Fishburne was only 14 years old when he played one of the crewmen of the patrol boat.The heart of the movie is Sheen. He looks young and innocent but is also suffering from his own traumas and cynicism before he embarks on his mission."
hamzaspencer,"Oct 8, 2020",10/10,"Words are escaping me.
First point, I think there always will be a before and a after ´Apocalypse Now' in the cinema history in my opinion.Outstanding casting, outstanding scenario, outstanding photography (these orange themes oh God), outstanding soundtrack, but most of all, I'm pretty sure the movie got one of the best last 15 minutes of history.
Now that all of that is said, can we seat 5 seconds and just talk about Marlon Brando's performance in the film ? Completely captivating & absorbing from the very first moment when we see him on screen to the very last one. Legend.Words are missing. Perhaps I don't even realize what I just saw this afternoon but believe me, I really, really really won't forget it."
sulaymen,"Nov 12, 2009",10/10,"There must be something inherent in man, something from long ago, that sits deep within us; a scary thing, frightening to those who would choose - or who are forced to - gaze at it.In making this movie, Coppola must have seen this thing that is not always visible. And if he did not see it in its entirety then in what must surely be a cliché by now, he saw enough of it to allow the heart of its darkness to pulse throughout this film.And just as Coppola was changed by his experience in the jungle, so too his most mysterious character. Something happened to Colonel Kurtz. Something he saw fractured his mind, the diamond bullet shattering his perceptions into a single struggle that he himself, deep within his heart, knew he was unable to comes to terms with. And this is the crux of this movie, that this journey into darkness can promise a truth so clear that it blinds you, a truth so powerful that is keeps a hold of you and does not let you go and traps you into staying exactly, exactly where you are.For the critics of this film, I wonder if they would ever admit to the existence of the dark place within. Admitting it, will they discover empathy? Art - and the film maker's craft is certainly that - surely requires the observer to join forces with the artist so as to see and to experience the world from the perspective of whatever the artist has discovered. Coppola, following the path of his own film making, ensures that his central character Captain Willard, journeying deep into the jungle, deep into his heart, has his own chance to discover the horrific artistry of the Colonel."
ptndle,"Aug 8, 2020",6/10,"Just watched the 3h final cut. First time I've seen this ""classic""
I've got to say, I really enjoyed the first 2 hours but the last 1 hour got slow and boring. From the french plantation to the end was really hard work not to turn it off and the last 20-30 minutes was disappointing. 6/10"
bahae19,"Jun 7, 2025",8/10,"I watched the long version of Apocalypse Now (Final Cut - about 3 hours), and honestly, it was a different experience compared to any war movie I've seen before.What really stood out to me was the cinematography, colors, and scenery. Every shot feels like a painting, especially the river and jungle scenes, with the fog adding mystery and tension throughout. The film truly immerses you in this dark, heavy atmosphere.However, to be honest, there are parts that drag on too long without a clear purpose, which hurt the pacing in some moments. That's why I can't give it a perfect 10 despite all the amazing technical aspects.The overall feeling I was left with after watching is one of confusion and being lost, just like the main character Willard. He's wandering through the war, fighting his own thoughts, and questioning who the real enemy is.I'm not usually a fan of war movies, but I liked this one. I think anyone who enjoys this kind of cinema will really appreciate it."
George-Allahham,"Jul 28, 2024",7/10,"Well, the film is good, but it is complex and deep in a strange way. The majority of the film's events feel as if they were random. The narration was good and appropriate for the atmosphere of the film, and it is as if you feel the transformation that befell Willard, but most of the story makes you feel bored. At the end of the film, here I began to feel the events. The cinematography is good, and the camera angles are perfect. Greetings to Coppola. The emotions in the film involve you in the story and its madness. The colors were wonderful. Many colors were used, and each occasion has a specific color. The calmness of the sound puts you in the atmosphere of the listener and you have to listen carefully. In general, the film is good but not as complete as a war film in my opinion."
dierregi,"Jan 4, 2023",2/10,"This movie is considered ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"" and selected for preservation and it is not a ""bad"" film, rather an overambitious, creepy, self-indulgent and slow-moving one.I saw it the first time as a young woman and I was totally unimpressed, so much that I had no idea who the actor playing Willard was, his acting being so unimpressive. For me it was a muddled story of a bunch of unpleasant soldiers in a very hostile location. Brando was a mumbling cipher and I exited the cinema thinking I'd rather watched something else.I had recently the chance of watch the Redux and my opinion didn't change much, except now I know Martin Sheen plays Willard, but he definitely looks spaced out and his performance is flat, probably because he was fighting alcoholism and bad health and his heart wasn't in it (literally and figuratively). I also could barely recognise a teenage, pimply Fishburne doing - I guess - his best as an overexcitable gunner's mate for which I had zero sympathy since he exterminates a bunch of civilians. The other main characters, all seemed overstressed and freaking out, understandably given the circumstances.Some of the sequences are indeed impressive, such as the helicopter attack, with or without the Valkyrie soundtrack, even if I found more interesting other minor moments, such as the boat passing by sinister plane wreckages along the course of the disastrous journey. On the whole though, the film is very slow, with overlong, useless sequences like the initial one with Willard doing weird stuff and punching a mirror, lots of staring in silence at the creepy jungle, etc...The soundtrack is suitably disturbing, so as to make the experience thoroughly unpleasant... and Brando.. well, my opinion did not change a bit.. he was a bloated, overrated, mumbling, fat man who should have given up acting years earlier and his pseudo-philosophical gibberish was intolerable."
tieman64,"Aug 19, 2008",N/A,"Francis Ford Coppola, once the most praised and powerful director in Hollywood, entered the Southeast Asian jungle to make a movie. Armed with Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", a small army of technicians, and a 15 million dollar budget, he emerged ten months later with thousands of hours of footage, two nearly dead actors and a nervous breakdown.The cause of all this personal trauma was ""Apocalypse Now"", a film in which Martin Sheen is sent up a river and into the jungles of Vietnam to find Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a Special Forces officer who has gone insane.Conrad's message was that savagery and apathy can wipe out the fragile gains of civilization within a single generation. A thin line stands between civilization and total collapse. Inject a little bit of barbarism, a little bit of chaos, and everything falls apart. Coppola's film tries to build on this, and states that America's inability to relinquish the trappings of civilization (ie- to get out of the boat), ensured its defeat. We lost because we weren't, as a nation, prepared to commit genocide. We committed horrors, but we weren't prepared to go all the way.The biggest problem with ""Apocalypse Now"" is that it was written by John Milius, the pro-war, gun toting ultra conservative whom the Coen Brother's based their character Walter Sobchak (from ""The Big Lebowski"") on. At the end of Milius' script, Kurtz and Willard team up to fight America. They represent the warrior savage, free from hypocrisy but lost in the darkness.Coppola, of course, found Milius' script largely silly. He removed Milius' violent ending and went in search of something more powerful. For some grand statement on war and human nature. But he found none. How could he? You can't paddle down a straight line for 10 months and then suddenly expect to reach a new destination.Throughout the film, ""Apocalypse Now"" tells us one thing, but shows us something else. The Colonel Kilgores of the picture actually fight the war, whilst the powerful warrior God, Col Kurtz, does little beside chopping the limbs off natives or hiding in the shadows. Milius' script saw Kurtz as the hero. A wise and seasoned rebel warrior who sticks his fingers up to the hypocritical veneer of civilization, but Coppola seems unwilling to go down that route.Coppola's ""redux"" cut of the film, though badly paced, is more interesting. It adds a French plantation scene which attempts to contrast the French period of colonial rule with America's war in Vietnam. The problem with this is that US involvement in Vietnam and the Colonial mindset of nineteenth century Europe, as seen in ""Heart of Darkness"", are completely different. American policy wasn't inspired by colonial aims but by ideological ones. The American experience in Vietnam was the opposite of Conrad's colonial experience. No wonder Coppola couldn't find a suitable ending. There isn't one.Late in the film, Kurtz accuses his country of hypocrisy. They are unwilling to fully embrace the darkness. If he were given a small army of savages, he says, then the war would be over tomorrow. The implication is that the Vietnamese were nothing more than barbaric savages who should be dealt with, not civility, but primal brutality.Worse yet, Coppola's ""war"" is one of gorgeous cinematography and exciting spectacle. When a Vietnamese village is raided, it feels more like the Death Star trench run than a savage massacre. Killgore himself is a figure of fun rather than the monster he should be. Milius' script painted a much darker character (hence kill and gore).Still, ""Apocalypse Now"" may contain no truths about Vietnam or war in general, but it is a film absolutely dripping with passion. Like ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"", ""Apocalypse Now"" is very much a Werner Herzog film. Herzog was a mad artist who wanted to lift a boat over a mountain. Why lift the boat over the mountain? No reason. He simply wanted to do it in the name of art!Same thing with Coppola. He wanted to do ""somthing"" great. He went into the jungle, went insane and came out with a couple thousand hours of mad footage. What is the merit of this footage? The merit is in surviving the journey. In making it down the river and back out again.And so what we have is a film about its creators. A film about the madness of the white man. The madness of the director. The madness of the crew. Ironically, the film's madness is all a result of indulgence. The indulgence of a staggering budget, studio leeway, accessible drugs, limitless resources and a giant ego. It's the shallowest kind of insanity. The insanity of unlimited power and a lack of boundaries.8/10 - ""Apocalypse Now"" ultimately amounts to nothing more than a series of memorable set-pieces. These set pieces don't enrich one another or gel in any way. It's an incomplete film, and even Coppola admits that he didn't quite know what he was doing or tying to say. The film goes up the river but doesn't know why.Far more interesting is ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"", a documentary shot in tandem with the film. As a study in ego-maniacal madness it's far more powerful than Coppola's film. Narrated by Coppola's wife, it's also very intimate and perceptive. It's also interesting to see how much Coppola relied on Brando's improvisational skills, hoping desperately that the great actor would whip up some kind of climax out of thin air. Brando, of course, was just in it for the huge pay cheque.Though a failure, this film is worth multiple viewings."
classicalsteve,"Jan 19, 2009",10/10,"Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Green Berets"" which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The ""Apocalypse Now!"" project, the production and resulting film, is ""Heart of Darkness"" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve. This is the plight of Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliot's ""The Hollow Men"" (Mistah Kurtz, he dead) of 1925. Although neither a straight telling of Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience, ""Apocalypse Now!"" stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential. ""Apocalypse"" is not just about the ""horrors"" of war per se, like ""Platoon"" and ""The Deer Hunter"", but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. Apocalypse Now! is not so much seen as experienced.The bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force performance), aboard a US military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few westerners would ever tread. His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a career army Special Forces Division officer who was the darling of the US Military until he went AWOL and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out, something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity. Sheen's mission is to terminate the colonel with the American public none the wiser.The movie is rather episodic. The journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as Sheen and his crew meet different self-contained ""aspects"" of the war at the ground level. American audiences of the 1970's had probably never seen this kind of film-making before, with the possible exception of ""The Deer Hunter"" which was released in the previous year. The first, and one of the most notable, is an helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves to play ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from Wagner's ""The Ring"" when he bombards helpless villages. His line ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" is one of those oft-quoted lines from the annals of cinema. Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies.Despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing. The original release (not the later Redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the shots of both Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film. Not even the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrific imagery. Brando's Kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within.Without giving too much away, Coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations. According to the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness"", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama, and the atmosphere of the movie's darker hues would be compromised. He wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz at ""his"" village. After the viewing, Coppola had his ending, and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American film-making. Love it or hate it, no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene.This film is not for all tastes just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It's not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb. It's the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban American life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle, which is as it should be. Coppola did not make a family picture. However, if the viewer can understand its larger point, there is a lot to be gotten out of Apocalypse Now!. If you're looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensibility and heroism, better stick with John Wayne. But if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been, even beyond ""the evils of war"" rhetoric, ""Apocalypse Now"" will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before, and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it."
dario_van_kuschn,"Mar 3, 2007",10/10,"Whoever says the the Redux version sucks, never saw a good movie... French plantation sequence to long? What's the problem, you're without a Steven Seagal flick for too long so the French part bores you? something is out of Willard's character? How do you know? Ever met the guy? This re-cut version is the best thing that ever happened to the movie. And anyone who says extra footage of Kurtz shouldn't be there obviously can't appreciate the genius of the late Marlon Brando.This is by far the best movie ever, and seeing the original after seeing the redux is like eating only half of your lunch, leaving the best bits on the plate."
ma-cortes,"Jul 11, 2005",8/10,"The picture talks about the captain Willard (Martin Sheen) who tells the story , he is assigned for a special mission : Kill Kurtz (Marlon Brando) , American general highly decorated who the army officers (Harrison Ford , G.D. Spradlin) believe has gone murderer and nut . Willard joins to misfit crew (Albert Hall , Sam Bottons , Frederic Forest, Larry Fishburne) make a risked and dangerous journey up river towards Cambodia . They'll find a mad marine captain (Robert Duval) fond of surf , playboy bunnies and French military and a civil group (Christian Marquand and Aurore Clement) living lonely on a plantation since Dien Bien Phu defeat (1954) . The travel is dangerously developed until the fateful meeting with Kurtz .Its a stunning and absorbing story that is based on Joseph Conrad novel : ¨the heart of the darkness¨ . The travel is narrated as a surrealist odyssey leading to the dreadful and horrible final but when the protagonists find General Kurtz the scenarios are darkest and gloomiest . Martin Sheen had a heart attack during the filming and some shots of Willard's back are of doubles , including Sheen's brother Joe Estevez who was flown out specially . The storyline by John Milius tackles issues of ethics and morality and the horror war . In 2001 was realized a ¨redux¨ , a new reediting adding footage , the episode of the playmates and the French people encounters , where there are a lot of nudism and is a bit boring but is pretty dialog and little action . This new edition is today considered to be the official version . Originally scheduled to be shot over six weeks , ended up taking 16 months . The movie in spite of the passed time is still powerful and astounding . Colorful cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is spellbound and breathtaking , he won an Oscar , a very well deserved Academy Award . Carmine Coppola musical score and time songs are atmospheric and exceptional . The picture was perfectly directed by Francis Ford Coppola , pacing with great sensitivity and artistic ambition . Rating: Above average . Awesome."
imaxxing,"Nov 25, 2020",8/10,"'Apocalypse Now' lays the common phrase 'war is hell' to bare. Vietnam was a war fought on dubious grounds. Birthed during an era of hawkish US foreign policy that wrought destruction to mainly fill the pockets of corporate arms manufacturers and further indebt the U.S. government to private banking interests. It was a dark chapter that has since metastasized into worse things.
The use of pop music in this film as an artistic mode is brilliant, it clearly conveys the normalization of killing as a recreational activity - the banality of evil.The movie reveals the idea that the Vietcong (VC) were created by the US as an elusive guerilla militant group - designed to be 'impossible to detect' for the very reason that they may persist indefinitely, for as long as the ruse was necessary - the casus belli (cause for war). The VC was a placeholder to create an excuse for the incredibly lucrative private sale of firearms, bombs, Agent Orange defoliant 'rainbow herbicides', missiles, military vehicles, and so forth. It enabled the creation of ensnaring government debt to private lenders, also.
The bottom-line purpose was to create a persistent U.S. military presence in these Southeast Asian regions, which also enabled the opportune seizing of valuable natural resources.The movie ultimately is anti-war in its premise. At various points paradoxical aspects of the war are revealed, the cult of 'Apocalypse Now' headed by the 'insane' Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) parallels the cult that was sent to destroy his - the U.S. Army itself, and those it was answerable to. Cap. Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) is the only properly trained soldier in his crew, he provides the point of view (POV); the sane looking glass by which the audience see the disaster that is the Vietnam war unfold before them.There is no point of moral authority in 'The Big Heat'; only chaos, only terror. This is where the film performs strongest, its screenplay is like a bad (artistic) trip on acid, with a political angle. Vietnam, for those years, was an adolescent soldier's playground, permissible by none other than the cult of the U.S. war machine.As Black Sabbath puts it; ""Generals gathered in their masses, just like witches at black masses.""8.2/10"
bradlyhumly,"Mar 26, 2021",10/10,I enjoyed watching this movie it was good. The story was great and so was the music and acting.
SM-033,"May 29, 2025",10/10,"Apocalypse Now is a descent. Into the jungle, into madness, into the human soul. Francis Ford Coppola took Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, transposed it into the chaos of Vietnam, and created one of the most hypnotic, brutal, and profound works in the history of cinema.From the opening notes of The End by The Doors, we are pulled into a world where time, morality, and reason disintegrate. Martin Sheen's Captain Willard is not a hero, but a witness - and a mirror. His journey up the river becomes our own unraveling.The cinematography is mythic, almost operatic. Helicopters swarm to the sound of Wagner, rivers glow in the dying light, and fire rains down like judgment. Every frame is textured with smoke, sweat, and symbolism.And then, there's Marlon Brando. His Colonel Kurtz doesn't just haunt the final act - he becomes it. A whisper in the dark. A philosophical ghost. ""The horror... the horror."" Few lines have ever echoed louder.This film is a fever dream of imperialism, violence, and the loss of self. It's about war, yes - but more than that, it's about the thin line between civilization and savagery, and how easily it dissolves.It's a baptism of fire. A masterpiece that burns into the psyche and leaves a mark you can't wash off."
636,"Mar 12, 1999",7/10,"This film could have been one of the best films ever made but Brando ruins it and is largely responsible for the weak ending. The film is a superbly photographed, surrealistic and dream-like odyssey of Captain Willard. Martin Sheen is outstanding. The bizarre, weird, horrible and morbidly funny intertwine themselves so skillfully that you almost feel like you are there. One of the quotes always remembered about this movie is ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"". But when Duval says ""Charlie can't surf!"" That does it for me. When Willard gets to where Kurtz is it feels like one of those extremely bad dreams where you have been on a long search and you are dog tired and scared to death.But when we get to Kurtz he seems inadequate and not even close to what you are led to expect. The last words he utters are ""The horror....The horror"". The horror is Brando's weak personna and lacklustre performance. The ending is less than satisfactory even with Kurtz ""terminated with extreme prejudice."""
callumfox,"Jan 29, 2021",9/10,"(This review is based on the 181 Minute Final Cut)This movie is really different from the other war movies I have seen in my time. This almost appears also as a psychological movie. I remember the last time I watched it I thought about whether this really was more psychological than war, and I guess I can say the psychological element in this movie fades in and out throughout the movie.Marlon Brando's performance in this movie is brilliant, almost as good as Don Corleone in The Godfather, also directed by Francis Coppola who directed this movie! I can also say the same for Robert Duvall, who really brought some charisma about his character (Kilgore).
The score is really different to the standard score you'll see in plenty of movies, and this score actually made itself a factor of my inner debate about whether this was really a psychological movie. The only score from another movie I could at least try and liken it to is Blade Runner (1982), mainly for the use of a similar sounding instrument, that's it! Blade Runner's score sounded more Sci Fi, this doesn't, in fact I dont really know what it sounds like..
The cinematography is stunning and beautiful. There are some moments in this movie that are written into history for the best cinematography of its time, and it makes me realise that even then back when Hollywood had left the golden age, filmmakers and cinematographers still has an almost perfect vision for the look of their movies!
Finally, my favourite part of the movie is the scene in which we join Kilgore on his helicopter assault on a Vietnamese village, while listening to ""Ride of The Valkyries"". I love all the practical effects used in this scene and it makes me appreciate this film much more for how ambitious the production was."
CantripZ,"Aug 19, 2008",4/10,"I saw this film once per decade in my first thirty years on Earth, and I've decided I don't need or want to see it again. It's a good film, and interesting from start to finish, but for me its I first saw this movie as a kid, and I was impressed (if rather confused). I had no idea it was supposed to be the best film ever, so it never occurred to me that anyone might think that.Next time I saw the film I was in my teens, and I'd read Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness - thus, I was less impressed. By this point I was a little more into movies, so I'd seen more critically acclaimed classics too - another contributing factor to the film's diminishment in my eyes.The last time I saw it was in my mid-to-late twenties, and I was honestly disappointed. When I next had the chance to watch the movie, a year or so ago, I passed.Fans of Coppola and lovers of this movie will be ready by now to condemn me as a moron or philistine, but I truly believe this to be an overrated Hollywood mess.It fails as an adaptation because of all the extraneous business: it's no longer about a man's journey to find Kurtz, it's about a seething mass of American national obsessions over Vietnam, war, race and imperialism.Also, unlike Conrad's spare, to-the-point writings, the film deals almost exclusively in hyperbole. There are quiet moments, but they ring false in amidst the craziness.As other reviews have pointed out, it's not really a war movie. However, its hard to see it as such since every scene is more or less obsessing over Vietnam.Other reviews have also pointed out that it's not meant to be realistic, but I question that perception. It looks to me as if it *is* intended to be realistic in many ways - and the fact that it isn't is another of the film's failings in my eyes.The racism of the film is also uncomfortable to me. Where Conrad's novel embodied the racism of its era (in which a white European did indeed have trouble viewing black Africans as human), this comparatively recent film embodies modern American racism by treating its nonwhite extras like so many cattle (no reference intended).None of them have personalities or recognisable aims and objectives - they're seen only as faceless savages, as dangerous enemies, a mindless force which can be harnesses either by clever Communists or manipulative madmen.The key performances are more interesting than actually good. Sheen isn't outstanding, certainly not at his best, and Fishburne is way underused. The big disappointment, however, is Marlon Brando. After such a long journey, so many death and traumas, its awful to realise that their objective is this old tubby loon who waddles around mumbling and being worshipped by unconvincing ""savages"".I've never been a fan of Brando, who for me is like an older, fatter Al Pacino. He knows no restraint, and while many film lovers rate him all his performances seem pretty much the same to me... in that these are actors whose personalities get in the way of their acting. They always seem like themselves, whether its appropriate or not.It's probably fair to point out that I'm not a Coppola fan, either. The phrase I used as a header here was originally something I said about The Godfather. Coppola's movies always come across bombastic and self-important, self-consciously ""big"" movies with heavy themes.I do understand the film, and I appreciate that it has many moments of inspired cinematography and several truly amazing scenes. But for me, it never connects emotionally.Too many characters and situations ring false. The structure is too messy, the use of pop music grates on my nerves, the plot-holes are increasingly apparent with every viewing, and to top it off I find the idea that this is adaptation of Conrad rather absurd. In many ways it's less true to the source than West Side Story is to Romeo and Juliet.It's not a bad film, as such, but a deeply flawed film... and, from a personal point of view, sententious and unnecessary."
cannaganjabisweed,"Feb 23, 2007",N/A,"Films like ""apocalypse now"", ""the godfather"" and ""the deer hunter"" all have a somewhat similar feel to them. They are all boring as hell, too long and way overrated. In my opinion, they really need pulling down a peg or two. OK, so maybe I just don't get it, and we'll leave it at that. But I see there are plenty of others here who feel exactly the same as I do, thank god. It's very hard to comprehend how films that are regarded as the best appear to me as some of the worst I've ever seen.I honestly don't know what to say. It really was that much of a snooze-fest for me. The only feelings I can describe to you of me watching the film, was boredom and me thinking about cutting the hedges back at the farm I help out on tomorrow morning. I really did just start to think of other things and forgot about the movie I was watching. 2001: a space odyssey? yup, slow, but brilliant and captivating. But this? man, I...I just don't get it. A man sails up a river....All power to you if you like this. But not for me, thank you"
Peg-3,"Aug 7, 1998",10/10,"I recommend reading ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad as a companion piece to this movie.Apocalypse Now is truly a modern day masterpiece,a mesmerizing and hypnotic slide into madness.Once you start viewing this movie it is almost impossible to stop watching, before you know it you are too far up the river to get off the boat.Also, a strong recommendation for ""Hearts of Darkness: A Film Makers Apocalypse"" about the making of this film.That Apocalypse Now ever made it into the theater is nothing short of miraculous.Coppola's heart and soul are in this masterwork-and it shows."
insect-09018,"Dec 4, 2021",10/10,"I am hypnotised by this incredible film. To date, I have seen the original version, the 'redux' cut, the so-called 'final' cut, and a crummy but just about watchable bootleg of the workprint.If you find this film as engrossing as I do, you will find much to enjoy in all versions, and you will want to see them. However, I return to the original version as definitive. Why? Because I think the additional footage unbalances the film. Kurtz is forgotten for the lengthy middle section, so that when he and Willard meet, the sequence from there on feels too brief.The first time I saw the film, the sequence structured around The Doors' 'The End' felt as if it were happening in slow motion, I didn't know what to expect, but also because the tighter narrative ratchets the tension up to an incredible crescendo.There is no question that Brando is one of the stars of the original; in the final cut his presence feels more like a cameo, an afterthought!I still enjoy the (as I say, so-called) 'Final Cut' and would recommend it, with the caveat I have given above. 'Redux' would be my second choice, since you may as well have all excised footage. The Redux version is more like 'Apocalypse Now; The Mini-series' and for me works better than the latest hybrid.The workprint makes for fascinating viewing for the obsessed, like me, for instance, though all versions I have seen are in dismal quality (however, exposure to pirate videos during my younger days has given me the power to decipher garbled video). It would be neat if Coppola would take a leaf out of Ridley's book and assemble a definitive box set which includes the workprint. On the other hand, it's fun to have a phantom version out there, and he likely doesnt want to legitimise a patently incomplete cut, even for the sake of film study.The workprint, as you have probably heard elsewhere, is escessively lengthy not because of numerous extras scenes, but because (for the most part) scenes run on longer (the helicopter attack (scored to Tomita's 'Venus', from The Planets Suite, in part!) must be three quarters of an hour alone).But there are numerous intriguing bits and pieces. Very out of character with the finished film, Willard jokes around with the PBR Streetgang crew, long takes betraying an obviously stationary boat, riffing on Nixon's 'I am not a crook!' Which, apart from displaying an incongrously jocular characterisation, doesn't fit chronologically, since Chef Hicks later reads a newspaper report about the arrest of Charles Manson in the released film(s), which places the onscreen events as taking place in 1970."
tbickle-2,"Sep 24, 1998",10/10,"Apocalypse Now is my all time favorite film.  From the very first scene, with shots a jungle being napalmed, superimposed with Captain Willard in a claustrophobic Saigon hotel room, with ""The End"" by the Doors playing, I could tell this film would not take me to a familiar place.  Coppola, takes you on an awe inspiring oddysey through the Vietnam war.  The dark frightening jungle, and the omonous river that snakes through it are amazing, and each scene takes you farther from reality and into a realm of madness. The movie takes a while for Willard to get up the river to meet Kurtz, however his character is so beautifully dramatized, I feel like I know him, respect him, and fear him before he is introduced.  The great acting, beautiful cinematography, wonderful editing, and excellent soundtrack combine perfectly to create what is, in my opinion, the greatest film of all time."
nparnold,"Dec 6, 2021",10/10,"Everthing about this film is fantastic, that it didn't win more Oscars is a travisty. The photography, editing, direction and acting are superb. The action is amazing with no cgi. I just saw the final cut version, what a different ending to the film from the original I saw in in 1980. Which is better?"
dancemacabre,"May 9, 2008",10/10,"I saw this movie in the late hour on TV. I decided to watch him because that was announced on TV as one of the best movies ever - I absolute agree with that! On the firs look this movie was hard and confusing. On the first half of the film I was thinking about to stop watching because I was tired of it, but I keep going forward because of publicity and the status of this movie. After three hours of watching this film and when it was finished I just have losing my breath about this truly masterpiece. I've realized how incredible this movie is - one of the most fascinating movies I saw in my life. I'm started to thinking about this film all night.If I had to choose what movie I'll give a 10 stars once in my life I ill choose this. There's many reasons for that and I think that Apocalypse Now is outstanding in several aspects. There's no need to talk about acting, scenes, dialogues,camera etc. - everything is perfect. It's already spoken that. What can I say more? I don't know why some people dislike this movie. I think that is not for everywone, especially teenages boys. Apocalypse Now isn't just a movie, it's experience. Something that may changes your point of thinking at some stuff, for example war or meaning of life etc. What can I say more? I think nothing. If you didn't see this movie, you have loose a incredible experience."
adrian290357,"Jun 24, 2008",10/10,"APOCALYPSE NOW is a masterpiece whether you see the truncated earlier version or the more recent, extended version. The direction is superb, the screenplay excellent with its ironical and occasionally over the top depiction of the uselessness of war and of the degradation of moral values. Duvall is memorable as the colonel who loves to wake up to the smell of napalm; Martin Sheen has his best role ever by a mile; Brando is an enigmatic larger than life metaphysic that appears to have won the minds of the enemy but lost his own; the photography is exquisite; and the sequence with the French family in a colonial setting is an absolute treasure. But there is much more to enjoy, from the much repeated helicopter sounds at the beginning of the movie to the vagaries of fighting a war you do not care for. I will always go back to this movie, watch it with pleasure and learn something new from it. A fabulous film that deserves 10/10."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 22, 2025",7/10,"Captain Willard is tasked with taking out Colonel Kurtz, a once-respected officer who has gone rogue and developed a near demigod status deep in the jungle.For the sake of clarity, I watched the Redux version, and in hindsight I perhaps should have started with the theatrical cut. I found the pacing to be an issue and, dare I say it, the film does veer into self-indulgence at times.What should have been a haunting and torturous story of war and death never quite touched me emotionally. I struggled to connect with several of the characters, and Willard's journey, while interesting, was difficult to relate to on a human level.Acting-wise, Martin Sheen is excellent and largely carries the film. Willard is dispassionate, distant, almost cold - and that restraint works very well. As for Kurtz, I'm less convinced. I'm not sure this is Marlon Brando at his best, though that may be unfair given how accustomed we are to him in his prime.Visually, the film is breathtaking. The opening sequences in particular are stunning, full of scale and menace, and much of the river journey is beautifully shot. The grandeur is undeniable.I did like how the film portrays the chaos of war - the uneasy mix of men taking it seriously and boys goofing around, often side by side. There's genuine terror here, and moments that hint at madness and moral collapse, though for me it never quite went far enough to be truly unsettling.The French dining scene didn't offer much for me. I assume it exists to show that even the icy Willard still has needs and urges, but it felt indulgent and stalled the momentum further.After such a long and arduous journey upriver, Kurtz's actual presence feels surprisingly brief. Given the film's extended runtime, it's slightly ironic that the character at the centre of all this myth-making feels underused.I'm glad I've finally seen it, and I fully appreciate its reputation. I was simply hoping for a bit more. Tremendous visuals, haunting music, a great opening, but it lags, and the ending felt quirky rather than devastating.7/10."
TheLittleSongbird,"Nov 24, 2010",10/10,"I am not completely sure whether to say this is Francis Ford Coppola's best work or not but it is up there with his best. It is a truly harrowing masterwork with nothing to criticise.Apocalypse Now is filled with memorable, mystical images, helped by the wonderful cinematography, splendid effects and authentic sceneries. The music is superb, the script is wonderful, I especially loved Robert Duvall's ""I love the smell of napalm first thing in the morning"", the story is always compelling and the film is brilliantly directed by Coppola. Apocalypse Now is long, but it is never boring.The acting is excellent, Marlon Brando especially is unforgettable, and Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper adeptly support him. Overall, this is harrowing I warn you but it is a brilliant film regardless. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
mfrost71w,"Nov 20, 2022",4/10,"Very slow paced to the point of turgid. It has some good vignettes, such as the Air Cav segment but overall is too much up its own arse.Apart from the few contemporary songs (Rolling Stones obligatory of course) the sound track is a real cheesy 70s synthesiser number more suited to a cheap TV movie or porn film.Brando is poor. He's suppposed to be menacing and esoteric but just comes across as the shambling, alzheimers-suffering, semi-delerious idiot that he then was in real life.You don't care about any of the characters, not even Martin Sheen's. They could all be killed or live, makes no odds. Dennis Hopper is probably the only cast member who turns in an acting performance."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jan 11, 2006",9/10,"Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.I still think Martin Sheen got ""dissed"" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout. It's one of the best narrations, if not THE best, I have ever heard in a movie. His voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible, nightmare-like adventure. I never fail to appreciate his work in this movie.The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes, ones I have never forgotten, such as......Sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie's first scene; Robert Duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then Brando's bizarre character. It goes on and on with strange scenes.That's not to say I enjoyed everything. No, there are a few very unpleasant scenes, such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (can't watch that anymore), an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheen's young stoned-out crew, and the crew is a little too goofy at times. Then, there is the huge amount of profanity, led by way too many f-words.So, there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this One thing for sure: it is a film you WILL remember!"
Jacques98,"Jan 26, 2009",10/10,"* Just to get it out of the way: I viewed the Redux version of this film, and that MAY be the cause of some of my negative statements. I cannot say for certain either way.If you've ever been a member of a message board and you've read the thread about the last movie you watched, you'll know that 99% of the replies have one word or less beside the official score. For a long time, I wondered how that could be. I used to think, ""Don't these people have any more of an opinion other than 'good' or 'bad' or 'average'? They just wasted their lives watching a movie; couldn't they say more than just a score?"" It took me a few months to figure the entire situation out, but when I did, it made perfect sense. Most movieseven good moviesare so predictable and unoriginaleven if they're enjoyablepeople still lack any real, definitive feelings about them. They see a movie on a Friday night and by Saturday night they forgot they even watched it. As a writer myself, I know first-hand there is nothing worse than an indifferent audience, but it seems that sums up most of the American population. Why? Because of films like Apocalypse Now.Apocalypse Now opens up with a semi-interesting beginning. It misleads the viewer into thinking that it actually has some physiological depth, then completely drops all depth into the gutter by the 10-minute mark and never picks it up again. Despite what you were lead to believe, there is no plot here. Or let me rephrase that: there is a plot, but it drops it after the 20-minute mark and never picks it up again until the final 30 minutes. Everything between those two points is exactly what you expect for a clichéd war drama . . .Talking. It almost amuses me that an ""epic"" movie can have the flattest characters in cinema history, but the screenwriters always have them talk and talk as if they're actually interesting to listen to. In Apocalypse Now's case, the characters are ALL walking stereotypical war clichés with legs andunfortunately tongues. They're all simply nothing but dumb animals created to carry the pointless dialogue out. They talk so much it's downright nauseating. What are they talking about? I forgot, and I just finished the film 10 minutes ago. Their dialogue is all predictable copy/paste war dialogue; I do remember that much. Naked girls, guns, cliché monologues about life/deathall the stuff you've heard thousands of times. I was never a soldier in the Vietnam War, but I can pretty much assure you the real soldiers talked about more than these unimaginative movies give them credit for.Besides talking, what do you get in Apocalypse Now? Well, there are only two main action scenes in the entire movie, so you can cross balls-to-the-wall war action off your list of expectations. No, this nearly 4-hour long film focuses on shots of boats going down the river with soldiers talking, and not much else. There is no emotional experience here. There is no ""horror"", as the tagline proclaims. The most ""horror"" you get is a bunch of PG-rated war scenes and some eerie music as the soldiers move through fog. If the director had focused on the true horror of realistic war, I wouldn't have to be sarcastic when I say: How terrifying! Instead, however, the director focuses things we've seen before. Hundreds of times. He focuses on the copy/paste Hollywood-style war, not the truly gritty, dirty war. He doesn't rub your nose in the true horror of war; he pats you on the back and gives you generic conversation scenes.My point here: Apocalypse Now is one of the most boring movies even filmed. It's also safe and predictable, adding nothing whatsoever to the overdone war genre. It doesn't leave you thinking, ""My God, this is terrible!"" It leaves you thinking, ""My God, I could have done the laundry with that wasted time . . .""And that's all. That's all there is to say about this nearly 4-hour long movie. The entire synopsis of every major event from open to close could literally be told in two sentences of text. Sometimes you have to sit back and realize that most award-winning, critically acclaimed, ""classic"" films are nothing but hollow shells. They boast great acting and cinematography, but they have no story. No soul. No moral. No thrill. No point . . .This is why I blame films like Apocalypse Now for the indifference people have toward movies. These films are supposedly the best of the best, but at the same time they're completely forgettable to anyone who doesn't try their hardest to find pleasure in boredom in hopes of becoming an all-powerful FILM BUFF on some cheesy website. There is nothing wrong with being intellectual. There is something wrong with being pretentious and internally forcing yourself to love a film just because the critics do. And those are the only people who could give Apocalypse Now a perfect score. Or even a mildly positive score.0/10"

The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the ""war is hell"" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. In particular, I found the final segment of the journey with Brando, which encapsulates Conrad's Heart of Darkness, to be rather boring. I finally got around to seeing Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws have been taken care of. Redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 films ever made. Brando's performance now seems full and complete, perhaps rather less mysterious, but much more profound. Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled. It's great to spot a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage. If you've never seen this film, skip the original and head straight for Redux. I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece."
johntheg123,"Dec 7, 2006",10/10,"I believe most if not all the extra scenes Coppola added were needed in Apocalypse Now Redux. Each scene I believe tells an important truth about life, death, and the horrors of war. The playboy camp is important, and it does not interfere with the the main story. The engine of the boat is broken, so they have to stop for a while to fix it. At that point, Willard makes the decision to trade fuel for sex. This is not out of Willard's character, because he seems rather charitable throughout most of the story. The scene between Lance and Chef with the girls is important because the viewer becomes those characters, and the scene itself is a game in which the girls are saying something important about exploitation, yet their naked bodies distract the viewer from this important enlightenment, just like Lance and Chef are oblivious to the same fact.The french plantation is also important because it helps give the view of the Vietnam war from the perspective of a neutral party not involved in the war. The scene with Willard and the french woman was implored to somewhat help Willard find out who he really is on the inside. Which also explains why he's nice and brutal at the same time.The Scene where Kurtz is reading Time magazine to Willard is meant to show the fallacy of propaganda. Despite the terrible outcome of the Vietnam War, the paper media was rather hesitant to show that. It is also parallel to today's ongoing war in Iraq, where there is a conflict between what is actually happening, and what is being told to the people what is happening.Over all, Apocalypse Now is a story about how and why we lost the War. It is also a story about going down the river of life, and stopping at the horrors and happiness along the way. The entire movie is a metaphor and the movie itself it filled to the brim with philosophical lessons about life."
pcs3746,"Dec 27, 2005",N/A,"Reading many of the comments here, I am stunned that I found none who actually got it. This is a film about the study of humanity and what it means to be human. Kurtz is not mad because of the war...he is mad because of what he must do to win against barbarians...he had to sacrifice his humanity and he did it willingly. He teaches us that in order for civilzied human beings to survive an onslaught of barbarians, you have to immerse yourself...defeat your own humanity. And then, when you have defeated the barbarian, you look around...and you are not human any more. In essence, the barbarian wins by forcing this sacrifice on civilized warriors. I left the theater in amazement that such a topic was even thought of for cinematic art. I got it just about everyone else missed it. And I felt contempt for those around me in the leaving crowd who were complaining they were disappointed in the film. They completely missed the point. Now, civilized people are faced again with a decision against barbarians who saw peoples heads off on TV. Will we immerse ourselves and our humanity to do what we must to survive...or will we surrender to the alternative if we don't? Is a surrender to barbarians as bad as becoming one of them? I think everyone should review ""Apocalypse Now"" once again because we are about to find out."
Sfpsycho415,"Feb 4, 2005",7/10,"I started watching Apocalypse Now with all the acclaim it has received over the years in the back of my mind. I learned a long time ago with 2001: A Space Odyssey that just because a movie is regarded as a classic doesn't mean i will like it at all. I sat down to watch the Redux (it was the only version i could get but i'm sure the overall film is the same) and fortunately, Apocalypse Now is better than 2001, but it is not a great movie.The film stars Martin Sheen as an Army captain who is sent into deep into the jungles of Vietnam to take down a decorated general (Marlon Brando) who went mad and barricaded himself. He rides on a boat with a squad of desensitized soldiers down a river. Along for the ride is a barely legal youngster (Laurence Fishburne), a would-be chef (Frederick Forrest) and a stern driver (Albert Hall). Everybody in the cast does a great job, and the ride down the river is eerily calm with random spurts of violence which makes for a mostly exciting movie. There is also a great supporting role by Robert Duvall as a hard-ass commander who is a overzealous fan of surfing.The movie really slows down, however, when the squad comes across a French family living in a nice house in the middle of the jungle. It really doesn't do much for the story and it seems to get forgotten in the later parts of the movie. Also, the ending is slow and just strange. I heard there was originally supposed to be a huge battle, which i would have preferred.For movie fans, Apocalypse Now is a must-see, because most people like it a lot, but for some it is a pretty good war movie that's worth a look.---7/10"
Don-102,"Dec 1, 1999",10/10,"Francis Coppola's descent into madness back in the late 1970's was all about APOCALYPSE NOW, one of the most incredible pieces of art ever placed on the screen.  It is violent, beautiful, ugly, and damn dark at times.  As a war film, APOCALYPSE NOW does not move me anywhere near the way PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did.  Those two pictures deal with war in a more combative, realistic way.  You grow and bond with the troupes in those flicks.  Here, you are engulfed in complete madness, something that seems apart from actual war.  It is more of a morality play into the soul and our ""hearts of darkness"" than a war film.Do I think Coppola made a mistake trying to base a story about the Vietnam War on Joseph Conrad's fictional ""Heart of Darkness""?  Sure, and I think he feels that way too.  Vietnam and the U.S involvement in the war has nothing to do with what Coppola was trying to do.  He once said ""My film IS Vietnam,"" referring to APOCALYPSE, but is it really? Not at all.  What results is unbelievably hard to assess except to say it is sheer brilliance. It transcends the horrors of war and seemed more of a personal film with Martin Sheen representing each of us as a complex human being on an impossible mission.  It is like traveling to Hell and back, many scars obtained, many feelings drowned out.Everyone who knows a dime about movies, knows the battle itself it was to make this ambitious film.  So many images burn into memory: nepalm explosions to the tune of the Door's ""The End""; Wagner blaring from speakers placed on some U.S. helicopters about to blow up a Vietnamese village; a soldier surfing to the Stone's ""Satisfaction""; the final ritualistic slaughter we witness during the film's dreary ending.  This is all fantasy. The war is nowhere to be found in these and multiple other sequences. Vietnam is merely a backdrop to display a truly insane trip up a river where one clearly defined character (Sheen as Willard) meets a fuzzy character (Brando as Kurtz) and no real resolutions are found.  It is the trip that does it for us.Wondrously eerie sights, sounds, and experiences pulsate throughout APOCALYPSE NOW and the first three quarters of the film are perfect.  Under the conditions Coppola and crew were working under, it is no wonder they had no ending.  Brando truly ruins what Sheen, in what is probably the most underrated performance of the 70's as ""Willard"", had done to the point of arrival at Kurtz' compound.  What the hell is Brando talking about?  At least Sheen comes through at the end giving us a hint as to what the journey meant to him.This film ranks way high on my list because of the mystery of it all and the absolute audacity with which Coppola paints his descent into madness."
govtmule-94509,"Dec 21, 2022",1/10,"In my opinion, most fans don't realize that this ""Vietnam War"" movie was conceptually based on an 1899 book called Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. The book depicts the ivory trade in Africa and is set in the Belgian Congo. The story follows a sailor traveling upriver to find an ivory trader named Kurtz, who is ill and being worshiped by the natives. To me, it seems like the writers added the Vietnam War theme to make it more marketable.Many reviews, in my view, are shallow-they treat this chaotic movie like it's some kind of profound documentary on Vietnam. Critics praise it as a ""masterpiece,"" but to me, it feels more like a disjointed, overhyped spectacle. Rather than offering real insight, I think it glorifies immature, reckless behavior, almost like it was made for people who equate chaos and destruction with power or strength.After the success of The Godfather, the next step seemed to be cashing in on another hit. What could be better than a movie packed with war, gratuitous violence, explosions, playboy bunnies, and rock and roll? To me, it feels like a fantasy tailor-made for audiences who want to believe this kind of behavior is cool or heroic.The production, in my opinion, was just as chaotic. On the set in the Philippines, the crew rented helicopters from a corrupt government, blew up anything they could, and even filmed the real killing of a water buffalo for shock value. To me, this choice was unnecessary and exploitative. While some argue the film is an anti-war statement, I find it hard to believe when so much gratuitous violence was used just to make it.As you can tell, I didn't like this movie. To me, it felt like a shallow excuse to show destruction and violence while pretending to be profound. The characters, in my view, acted like emotional teenagers with no depth, and the story seemed to revel in chaos. I think this movie appeals to the base immaturity of some viewers who want to believe this style of behavior is powerful or admirable, but to me, it's nothing more than a chaotic and empty fantasy."
agreigboy,"Apr 20, 2006",8/10,"It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz.(I don't say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary, ""Hearts of Darkness,"" I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is due for that quality). The tone of voice I'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: ""Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one. They sent it up with room service."" It is indulgent without being narrow and alienating. A good example of is Hopper's indulgence into aphoristic madness, generously installing lines written by T.S. Eliot and Rudyard Kipling into his stony monologues: ""I mean, the man's a geniussometimes he'll walk right by you without even saying a word, and sometimes he'll grab you by the collar and say ""did you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'if you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs"" and then ""I mean he's a wise man, he's a great man; I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas"" (The first one's Kipling, the second one's Eliot."
m-j-barrier,"Mar 22, 2007",10/10,"I was there. No, not on the Mung River, but I did venture into the highlands from time to time, where things were quite savage. The Mung and the Montangiards allied themselves with the US out of sheer hatred for Charlie and the NVA, not because they loved us so much. I spent most of my time in the 4th Inf. Div. I remember a point at which all of declared ""we're dead already, so what can hurt us?"" In Vietnam, not AA, one learned the true meaning of ""one day at a time"". A ""wake up"" was a victory. One night, several of us whose time grew short gathered at about 5 PM on a hot, dry season day for cold beer and some smoked weed. A new-be came in and someone tossed him a beer (normally, we would have chased him out - ""new-bes to themselves""). He took a pull and then said, ""technically, we're still on duty. What if they catch us?"" A buddy of mine, drunk and stoned already, replied, ""What're they gonna do? Send us to Vietnam?"" That wrapped it all up for me.

Phil_N_Stine,"Apr 5, 2009",10/10,"Colonel Kurtz: ""The horror, the horror"".Sums the film up perfectly. A pretty disturbing journey into war, madness and the dark side of the human soul, Apocalypse, Now managed to unsettle me several times. At one point, I resented the main character and more or less everyone on the boat. Later on, I felt repulsed and sympathetic for their eventual fates, particularly Chef (who is the character I didn't really resent at any point). The film really succeeds in drawing the viewer into this horrific journey, and the mind of Kurtz himself. The echoing between Kurtz and Willard was very well done, to the extent I wouldn't have been surprised if Willard took Kurtz place (which didn't happen, which makes a lot of sense really). Fantastic opening sequence as well, and a wonderful use of music."
briancham1994,"Aug 2, 2021",7/10,"I watched the Redux version of this film, which has a notoriously bloated runtime and a lack of pacing. This is apparent from the start of the film as banal scenes drag on without much of a sense of importance. The film only picks up as we encounter a disaffected colonel who is only interested in surfing, an iconic scene that shows off all the rogue personalities involved. This motley crew of incompetent, apathetic and impulsive soldiers head off on an ill defined path to wreak havoc and expose the futility of the American war effort. This thematic concern wears itself thin and becomes totally devoid of substance as soon as Kurtz is discovered. Despite its dark and symbolic content, the film appears to have nothing to offer beyond that point, meandering about with no resolution."
paul_m_haakonsen,"Mar 12, 2023",6/10,"Now, believe it or not, but I have actually never seen the 1979 movie ""Apocalypse Now"" before now in 2023. Yeah, I know, a mistake on my account. But I just never gotten around to sitting down to watch it. Of course I was familiar with the movie, but the movie's cover just never really appealed to me enough to make me give it a go.But as I had the chance to sit down and watch the movie here in 2023, of course I did so. And I have been curious to see if the movie is as good as I have been told.Writers John Milius and Francis Ford Coppola put together an entertaining script and storyline for the movie. And I have to say that I was adequately and genuinely entertained by the movie. Well, right up to the point where Captain Willard (played by Martin Sheen) got to the camp in Cambodia where Colonel Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) was waiting. The movie sort of lost its momentum there and changed direction quite dramatically, and not in a sense that appealed much to me.Something that really impressed me about the movie was the cast ensemble, because they had a lot of amazing talents on the cast list, with the likes of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishbourne, Dennis Hopper, Scott Glenn, Harrison Ford and others.""Apocalypse Now"" looked and felt like a Vietnam War movie, although quite a different approach to making such a movie from director Francis Ford Coppola. But it was definitely an interesting take on the subject, and it made for a watchable and enjoyable movie.The downside to this 1979 movie was the length. Running at nearly 180 minutes, it was a tad too long in my opinion, and could have benefitted from either a trim or more added action.My rating of ""Apocalypse Now"" lands on a six out of ten stars."
jeffpyle,"Mar 20, 2002",1/10,"IMDB needs seperate listings for the 1979 classic and the 2001 director's cut. The former is a classic while the latter is a bomb.I don't recall ever seeing a film where the director's cut was so inferior to the original. The extra footage adds NOTHING to the film but does make the movie seem both endless and meaningless.Sometimes less is more (ie, the 1979 theatrical release). It's unfortunate that the DVD doesn't allow the viewer to select which version to watch."
eddiez61,"May 27, 2009",10/10,"This comment is for the original cut, Not the Redux version.The myth of the ""Good War"" still persists, that there can be nobility in the horrendous acts committed in the service of Right. Francis Coppola took upon himself the task of exploring and refuting this notion, and found entry into this harrowing terrain by way of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness.""In the novel, commercial interests drive the British empire into the depths of the African jungle, and just as deeply into Britian's own severely corrupted soul. The ambitions of a ""civilized"" people have supplanted all notions of decency, Christianity, humanity. In the novel the inescapable corrupting force is the savage ivory trade. The African natives have been reduced to dispensable pawns, fortunate to receive even the most brutal treatment from their colonial masters. This horrendous industry supports a contentedly oblivious Empire. In the film it's the Vietnam war that inexorably disfigures all its participants. And for the great director, the irresistible flame of destruction is his film. Coppola's river of decent became Time, as a projected 15 week shoot in the jungle sprawled to more than 250 grueling days. Repeatedly prolonged by an ongoing brutal guerrilla war, severe monsoon weather, and the near fatal heart attack of Martin Sheen, the shoot evolved into a treacherous marathon, pushing everyone involved beyond their limits.In the film the character of Kurtz functions as the ideal civilized fighting man: educated, decorated, refined, virile, charismatic, brilliant, formidable. In the novel and perhaps more importantly, Kurtz is an artist; ""essentially a great musician,"" a journalist, a skilled painter, and ""a universal genius."" Coppola, too, is something of a universal genius; a larger than life character of enormous talents and capacities. Though we are ostensibly given access to his personal beliefs through the narrations of Capt. Willard, I suspect that Francis more deeply identifies with Kurtz. After all, Coppola had in fact become a renegade demigod leading a ragged army in the jungle, defying all authority, ruthlessly executing his own brand of creativity.Studio execs like to consider themselves Highly Principled Creatives. But, in the face of Francis' truly uninhibited, honest excesses they proved themselves to be timid sheep by cutting his budget. They had been complicit in creating the monstrous ego of Coppola and had profited hugely with his ""Godfather"" franchise. But they lost their nerve when they saw what was reflected in the bizarre mirror that Francis was assembling in that Philippine jungle. There were more than a few Studio execs that wanted the director terminated with extreme prejudice. This is perhaps the film's most salient point; that the Enterprise can only be corrupt because its Sponsors are corrupt. And more so, the Sponsors are further corrupted by the Enterprise. Vicious cycle. In the film the home office honchos wanted Col. Kurtz dead because his actions were revealing to them the folly of their own ways. Proof of their depravity is their need to have a great American soldier assassinated. As for Coppola, the Studio was embarrassed by the accurate picture he was painting of their industry; bloated, self-serving, and unprincipled.Francis commented at the film's Cannes preview that its production was so overwhelming that ""(it) is not about Vietnam, it IS Vietnam."" The herculean effort is evident in every frame. Not an instant passes without a heightening sense of ominous doom. Each klik up the Mekong into Cambodia is a slowly tightening tourniquet on the throat, breath barely moving over dry lips. The aerial battle scenes are absolutely the most grandly choreographed tableaux of grace and destruction ever put to film; an utterly Grotesque Opera. Everything is over-sized, disproportionate, absurd. And most disorienting of all is Brando, himself.Col. Kurtz (kurtz is German for short) is ill, weakened, compromised, but Brando's creation manages to tower above all else. He seems to be very gently rocking in a wind; a massive ancient sequoia listing to and fro on the verge of a mighty, awesome collapse. Brando/Kurtz is doubly mesmerizing because we only glimpse him in deep shadows and stark profiles. Accounts of the shoot explain that Brando arrived on location at nearly 300 pounds and felt very self conscious of his size, so Francis devised the high contrast lighting to conceal and appease the star. It's a fortuitous concession because it only magnifies his intense psychological presence. It's as though Kurtz is played by the spectre of Brando.War has long been a compelling topic for films. The visual spectacle and pyrotechnics serve the film medium well. The eternal theme of good versus evil is elegantly displayed against a backdrop of chaos and mayhem. The poignant interplay of suffering and sacrifice, the glory of selfless duty to a country that has our best interest at heart. What 'Apocalypse Now"" attempts is the complete negation of these values. These outdated ideals are so hollow, so feeble compared to what the tender human mind experiences under the influences of war. There is nothing good in war. There is nothing good as a result of war. Even when participation becomes necessary, there is nothing to be gained from war but loss. And what is most lost is our sanity, our humanity. Kurtz's ""Horror"" is not of what he has witnessed in country, but in the hypocrisy of Society and the behavior of the ""Civilized"".(Important Note: Redux is valuable as an example of how important good editing is. It contains additional scenes that help flesh out the history of Vietnam and the conflict, and attempts to make more human the star characters, but succeeds only in disrupting the rhythm and flow of the original masterpiece. The specifics of the Vietnam war are irrelevant to the larger theme of ""War's"" madness, and feels like a detour. Making Capt. Willard more personable only undercuts the tension that builds along his ""journey"" up the river. See the original cut first.)"
bob the moo,"Jul 1, 2002",N/A,"In an updating of `Hearts of Darkness' a soldier is given a mission to travel up a river During the Vietnam war in order to terminate the command of Colonel Kurtz.  Kurtz is operating without orders and is leading a group of natives in brutal violent strikes against the enemy.  Despite his history of brilliance and decoration he has clearly gone mad.  Willard joins a military boat and travels up river to his destiny.  However the further he travels the more madness appears to have become the norm.It is a film everyone knows, and a `making of' story that is familiar to everyone on some level.  The problems with the military, with destroyed sets right down to Keitel walking off set to be replaced by Martin Sheen who then had a near complete breakdown during filming.  However the story itself is what keeps this so popular.  The original book is set in Victorian times and is similar only in the concept of travelling up a river and confronting something dark and changed in the shape of Kurtz.  The modern day spin on it makes it even more interesting as it looks at the madness that comes with power within war.The journey itself is at times comic and at other times brutal.  The overall feeling is one of soldiers not knowing why they are fighting or who they are fighting.  The feeling of confusion and fear is inherent in the film and is very well delivered.  Willard's journey never fails to grip and is interesting on whatever level you watch it  whether it be for the famous set pieces or for the underlying themes.The performances are excellent.  Sheen has never been better and now seems so distant from his character that he is a different person.  While some of the emotion on screen was real, he does a great job as our guide through the journey.  The best performance comes from a surprising source Brando. Despite the fact that he was difficult, horribly over weight and hadn't learnt his lines, his eerie performance is still haunting.  His mumbling and reasoning in the shadows show that he may be touched by madness but, in the context of war, he is also touched by cold logical reasoning.  Likewise Dennis Hopper fits in well despite his stoned demeanour.  The support cast include some names as Albert Hall, Harrison Ford, Forrest and a young Larry Fishburne.Overall this will remain a classic on many levels.  The film itself is great and full of spectacle, the story of the making itself is interesting, the performances are wonderful despite everything and the fact that it has other themes makes it even better.  As an war movie it is great simply because it isn't about the war it IS war  in the words of Coppola `it isn't about Vietnam, it is Vietnam, it's how the Americans were in Vietnam.  We were in the jungle, we had too much money, too much equipment and, little by little, we went insane'.  Classic film on so many levels."
desurtstorm,"Feb 26, 2006",10/10,"Growing up in the 90's i haven't experienced many amazing movies. The closest i ever got to cinema salvation was the Godfather, which is my second favorite movie. Two years ago me and my friend became obsessed with movie making and movies. First, watching movies that dealt with subjects we were interested in, war and action. Then we got into movies that showed artistic edge in which we had never experienced. Apocalypse Now, one of the hundreds of movies I've watched is still my all time favorite. A masterpiece in cinema, a very edgy movie dealing with Vietnam. The movies starts out dark with a very twisted humorous feeling almost. As we see Martin Sheen travels down the river things become twisted and disillusioned, becoming a symbolic representation of war and life. I give it 10/10, it's not for everyone. The movie needs to be watched more than once to fully grasp its artistic nature. I hope this helped, pz."
utsavmaitra,"May 2, 2005",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppolla is a genius,a brilliant mind that should never stop working on movies like this.This is an absolute blinder of a film.Just yesterday i was looking for some good movies to watch until i rediscovered one of the best ever made...Apocalypse Now.It is the most gut-wrenching movie that i have seen.It is a very disturbing piece of ART.The story of a Captain who was secretly assigned to a mission to assassinate a legendary Green Berret colonel Walter E. Kurtz who has gone insane due to the horrors of the war and set himself up as God among a local tribe.This movie truly explains the horrors of war at it's worst.IF anyone out there is looking for a mind-blowing war film,see Apocalypse Now first....then move on to Saving Private Ryan,Platoon etc.As for the acting,it was magnificent.Martin Sheen (Willard) gave an absolute gem of a performance.As for Marlon Brando(Kurtz),what can be said of him.....he is flawless.Though he played a small role,it was highly important and brilliant.All in all....if u miss this movie,u missed something exceptional."
Deckard42,"Mar 5, 2006",10/10,"If you haven't watched this masterpiece yet, you missed one of the deepest experiences that a movie could provide. This movie is about war, about politics, about the beauty and the horror, about the human nature in itself. Many have written extensively about it, so I will rather comment on one certain issue:The Redux version:Whilst there exist almost only negative comments about it, I think it is even better then the original. The Redux version has been released many years after the original and contains 49 minutes of new footage (taken from the original materials). Coppola explained, he felt the necessity of making this version. Mainly for the fact, that the original version was cut in an atmosphere of extreme pressure and desperation (read about the making if you don't know why). They cut the huge amounts of material to some simple format, leaving out scene after scene in the desperate attempt to make sense of something that could not make one certain sense. The Redux version was meant to give the original some of the hectically cut out footage back.The new scenes contain nothing that would change the story or meaning of the old movie, instead they either continue the story parts in more details or open up completely new scenes. There is the continuation of the famous Playmate scene for example, showing the perversion and insanity that briefly shines through in the original when the soldiers are heading for the playmate stage. The logical continuation takes place when Captain Willard and company meet the playmates stranded further up the river, being delivered to their goodwill.Then there are some small additions, like a really intense close up of Marlon Brando, whose acting in this movie is legendary! You will hardly find anything to criticize about these small additions, you could perhaps argue about the changes in background music, but this is mainly a question of individual taste, since the spirit of the music did hardly change. Its still a psychedelic mix of synthesizer sounds and music by the doors.Now other things, like the rather infamous scene on the French plantation, leave more room for debates. This scene, which was completely left out from the original, opens up a new story part, taking place on a French plantation. In my opinion, this scene added much to the movie's atmosphere, fitting perfectly into its beautiful psychedelic style. Also it was making even clearer that this movie is not simply about war: ""There are two of you, don't you see ? One that kills and one that loves."" This is exactly general Kurtz's dilemma: being caught in a world of insane double morality, looking for a way to find a ""true"" way of acting, Kurtz finally decides to break out by choosing his role as murder, by abandoning the role of jurisdiction in his (a)moral world. At the same time this sentence points to an even deeper conflict inside human nature or the world itsself: The existence of unimaginable horror and beauty next to each other. The desperate situation everyone faces who gets to see both.Overall, the new scenes do not contain anything that would really change the old movie (whilst there was hardly anything removed from it), whilst in my opinion they add much to it. The movie is longer, it has an even more epic character and becomes an even more breath taking psychedelic trip trough the dark corners of human nature and morality. If you really hate the Redux version, ask yourself why exactly. I think it is pure perfection, as long as you don't judge it simply for the fact that it is a changed version of one of the best movies ever made. Enjoy."
Manthorpe,"Jun 17, 2004",10/10,"Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is hard for Capt. Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has, killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands. What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds him?Any movie that can start out with The Doors' ""The End"" is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does this perfectly. I can't think of anything better for it to be set to, the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders' minds that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam, the ultimate destination of which is murder. Through it's use of music and score alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence, and insanity. A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here.An overall great cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread. I just don't like Fishburne, ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold. I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date. He simply nailed his character, which is one of the best in the entire film, as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf. Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning.The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself. In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey. I don't feel they take away anything though, it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original. Through this journey, the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it...in fact, that's the entire point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz' to go completely mad.A big war movie lover, this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all of them classics. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I've said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War....so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless...even if after having most recently view AN I think it's a tad better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given. As a fellow reviewer has previously stated, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made."
Bored_Dragon,"Oct 11, 2016",6/10,"Excellent movie, in a way top-quality sociology textbook is excellent. Acting 10/10, directing 10/10, all technical aspects are top quality, dialogues, monologues, layering of the story and depth of the message this movie brings... and at the same time, it is painfully boring to watch that I fell asleep five or six times and then I was snapping out and rewinding and watching further, and the only thing that forced me to endure till the end is its reputation of one of the greatest movies of all time. The film may be excellent in many aspects but it failed in one very important thing - to hold viewers' attention for over three hours. If it was a bit shorter or if it was made as a mini-series for example, maybe I would enjoy it more, but this way I give it 10/10 for quality and 2/10 for interestingness. So...6/10, and if I include The Doors music into the rating, then 5/10"
itamarscomix,"Oct 1, 2011",9/10,"Apocalypse Now is a strange anomaly in the history of cinema. It's a complete disaster of a film, that ran into every catastrophe and hurdle imaginable, and failed on almost every level (just ask Francis Ford Coppola himself). And yet, it's also one of the best films ever made.Apocalypse Now's wild chaos stands in complete contrast with Coppola's three previous films - The Godfather parts 1 and 2, and The Conversation, all of which were precise, complete and, especially the first one, practically flawless. Apocalypse Now, on the other hand, is filled with flaws; it's messy, inconsistent, at times incoherent, and large parts of it appear (and often are) completely improvised. This is, of course, the one film on which Coppola, having financed most of it himself, had complete creative control. It's the film that brought the age of the auteur to its logical end, and it's also the beginning of the end for that period; one year later the auteur was finally killed by Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate. But while Heaven's Gate is a pompous, pretentious, self-indulgent mess, out of the chaos of Apocalypse Now emerged one of the strongest creations in cinema history.No description of Apocalypse Now can really capture what it's about; it can be said to be a film about the Vietnam war, or a loose adaptation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but it's far beyond either one. It's an exploration of the human psyche when it's taken to the most extreme situations of stress and violence - the Vietnam war is used as the setting for that. But, as can be seen in the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"", the production itself qualifies as well. Both Coppola and the cast explored the full range of human emotions on the film, and that's what makes it more powerful and more timeless than war films like Platoon and The Deer Hunter. Apocalypse Now is the human condition. As Coppola himself said - it's not about the Vietnam war, it IS the Vietnam war. Every failing the film had during production only helps create the chaos and distress that make it so unforgettable and such a landmark in cinema history."
asd29,"May 5, 2024",6/10,"Again this is one of those classics that is overated , superb cast - brando, sheen, duvall , hopper, and a young laurence fishburne , there is also a small role, cameo even for harrison ford which comes across as odd after the success of star wars , ok the film is
Well directed the acting , cinematography , settings ; which is an authentic depiction of the vietnam war , the acting peformances are on par but some of the characters are too upeat and over charactarised for the situation they are in, so to me the film feels uneven slightly in tone ,it fails to feel as gritty as say platoon or FMJ, and i prefer the tone of the latter, you have to admit this movie is boring and aimless in some spells and the final showdown between sheen and brando although well acted is disapointing and anti climatic, sorry to all the fans of this classic , but as a whole i dont think this movie is entetaining enough to be great."
cygnus58,"Mar 31, 2001",1/10,"It's a pity to see a director put so much time and effort into a film and come back with something so awful.  This film is pretentious, chaotic, self-indulgent and ridiculously overrated.  The first half has its moments, even though Robert Duvall's character is a cartoon, but once Dennis Hopper and Marlon Brando show up and start chewing the scenery as if it's all you can eat at the diner and they've been on a three-day fast, the movie dies. The last twenty minutes or so look as if they were filmed by a three-year-old playing with his father's movie camera.  I'm sorry to be so harsh, but this was one of the most unpleasant experiences I've ever had watching a film."
buck-71,"Jul 8, 2004",N/A,"This is a film that could be remembered as much for what happened on the set as what ended up on the screen. Both stories are complex and quite uncanny. Let it be said I loved this movie. To be harshly critical any of the performances is ignorant to the times and the works that inspired the film. Sheen is something to behold and it wasn't until I witnessed this film I understood the emotion he could convey on screen. You could say Hopper, Duvall and Brando have almost cameo like rolls... and you'd be wrong. They were used to their potential and you have to disregard the fact that their screen time was limited. This film is a brilliant spectacle. Hardly ever does a person examine life on the scale of life and after seeing Apocalypse Now, you will never be able to see war on the scale of war. It is made up of actions much more insignificant. Coppola saw it, Sheen acted it, I felt it."
wotsonurmind,"Aug 14, 2019",9/10,"I don't rate a movie as a 10 but this is the closest I've come to doing that.As someone who has watched the original, the redux and the 6 hour workprint versions, I can tell you this is the most perfect version of this classic.
Firstly with Dolby atmos and 4K,it looks and sounds spectacular on IMAX save for the first 10 minutes for technical reasons,I'm told.
This version is shorter than the redux but longer than the original at 183 minutes. But importantly, this is the most cohesive and watcher-friendly version.It is not just that some scenes were added but importantly a lot of small changes made to a lot of scenes which makes the narrative smoother and a very pleasing descent into the madness towards the end.
This version makes the entire role of Bob Duvall so so clear and perfect;Brando is given exactly the right amount of scenes and the unnecessary scene with the playboy playmates included in the redux is axed which is perfect for the movie.The french plantation scene is included but edited and added to make it so much more coherent with the story. Some scenes at the last bridge on the river are also edited to show the madness but not drag the movie down.
I cannot recommend more to buy this version for fans of this classic.This for me is a must-buy!"
krazymuffin,"Nov 27, 2008",10/10,"I'm a 16 yr old teenager and i gotta say that this movie straight out fried my brains. Someone told me that this movie was said to be the most realistic thing to the Vietnam War and i can understand why. The madness of it all just scars you, it makes you really think. The chaos is to much for the mind. After i watched this movie i just sat there in silence and thought ""..........woah........"". This is film-making outside the box. Martin Sheen is brilliant and takes us on the journey with him, the boat crew is great each of them is an individual, Marlon Brando is just mind-blowing, scared me to death, I was left in suspense every scene in case he had another outburst of rage.This isn't a movie where you say to yourself ""i need to kill some time, so i'll watch it"", this isn't a movie to watch with a bunch of friends (maybe if you're high). No. You really have to prepare yourself for this. Before you watch this movie, set up some snacks, drinks, sit back and observe the pure experience that is Apocalypse Now and watch as you experience a trip so intense that afterward's you won't be able to think straight for the next hour.Enjoy"
bkoganbing,"Nov 12, 2016",8/10,"We have to wait until there is only a quarter of the running time left before Marlon Brando comes on as Colonel Kurtz. But it's worth the wait to see him give a fabulous performance as a decorated US Army Colonel who has gone over the hill and off the deep end.Until that time we watch Martin Sheen as an intelligence officer given an assassination assignment to terminate Brando. Brando as a soldier did his job well, too well maybe. Now he's set himself up with an army of Montagnard tribespeople as some kind of potentate deep in the jungle across into Cambodia where Americans aren't supposed to be in any event.Francis Ford Coppola gave this film almost a surreal quality, it gets more surreal as the PT boat aka swift boat journeys up river to the Kurtz compound. It starts with the real war enough, but even that is a Sam Peckinpah like violence ballet with Robert Duvall replete with western cavalry hat leading a raid on a Viet Cong stronghold at the river mouth with the strains of Wagner's dance of the Valkyries. Duvall loves his aroma of napalm in the morning.I liked the river journey when Sheen sets out on that PT boat with the ever present mist over the river. It has Hitchcock like suspense, you never know what they will encounter and neither do they. You also see what war has done to the crew in that kind of atmosphere never knowing when they might meet death with an enemy who doesn't operate in the traditional ways of war.I was lucky enough to see the Redux version with the sequence of Christian Marquand and his plantation. It was cut for length in the original film, but it's worth seeing now. All of those countries used to be called French Indo-China, still remember it on Atlas maps when I was a lad. He's got his manor house there and it's home to him and nobody is going to push him out. An attitude similar to people who followed Ian Smith in Northern Rhodesia when the rest of Africa was shaking off colonialism. I'm glad the scenes have been restored.Brando is only in briefly, but his performance as the cracker doodle, but perceptive Kurtz is something to see. Also note that Scott Glenn previously sent on Sheen's mission and freelance reporter Dennis Hopper have become Brando acolytes and also standout in their cameos.Apocalypse Now is not the best Vietnam War film. My own preference is Casualties Of War. But it's definitely worth a look."
SpelingError,"Feb 19, 2022",9/10,"I watched the Redux version several years ago and, while I loved certain parts of it, it dragged for me in some other scenes and I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would. Since I hadn't seen the theatrical version prior to this Hall, I was curious as to how well I would respond to it. I expected for it to be an easier watch than the Redux version, but what I wasn't expecting was for it to trump my own expectations. To get it out of the way, yes, the animal cruelty scenes (the water buffalo being killed and the rough handling of the dog) are hard to watch and indefensible, but other than that, this film is truly excellent and is quite possibly the best representation of a descent into madness I've ever seen. I've seen many critics argue that the journey to Kurtz's compound is a metaphorical descent into madness and that was what stood out the most to me while watching this film. The first stop with Lt. Col. Kilgore shows the first stage of this descent. On the surface, it's a fairly conventional raid scene (albeit one which is technically outstanding), but that Kilgore orders some soldiers to surf during the raid and expresses his gratitude towards a Vietnamese soldier who fought in spite of being seriously wounded adds an undercurrent of surrealism to to that sequence. The second stop where hundreds of soldiers watch a Playboy show at a supply depot shows the next stage of this descent. Many soldiers in that scene yell sexual remarks at the women and try to rush the stage, showing more of their unhinged behavior. The third main stop at a remote U. S. army outpost expands on this descent. Several soldiers seem desperate to get into their boat in an attempt to return home and the other soldiers in the outpost seem to have no idea who their commanding officer is. There doesn't seem to be much order in that outpost and the whole scene maintains a hellish atmosphere. And, of course, Kurtz's compound is the final stage of this descent. I love how his monologues in that scene feel simultaneously avant-garde and narrative-driven at the same time. Though Kurtz appears to be talking about great insights in his speeches, half of what he says doesn't make any sense. Topped with how his face is either partially or entirely obscured in darkness throughout those scenes makes them some of the best movie monologues I've ever seen. Topped with some excellent cinematography and some outstanding soundtrack choices (Ride of the Valkyries and The End), this film is definitely a top 10 war film for me."
abrahm,"Jan 17, 2004",10/10,"I know there are conflicting views concerning this subject.In my book, both versions get 10 of 10, but if you have the time it is definatly worth watching the redux version.  Its just the little additions in the beginning and middle of the film that add to the mood and themes of innocence, desperation, and the dwidling goodness of man that can be found in the war.  The French plantation scenes seemed, when I watched redux for the first time, a bit long and unnecessary, mostly because I wanted to arrive at the Kurtz complex. But, the history and politics discused at the dinner are a great addition to the original movie."
kennprop,"Aug 23, 2021",9/10,"I agree This is the End. The end of the myth of the US as a competent force for Good in the world. The end of belief in our govt. The river journey is a twisted voyage of the US inVietnam. At the mouth of the river, the US rules. As you go up, it's VC country. Then you reach the ruthless compound of Col. Kurtz. Kurtz is not God worship, it is leader worship. He can defeat the VC or NVA. The US with its deteriorating commitment and lack of cause cannot. Today we have the end in Afghanistan also. Vietnam 2. That was why I watched this again. I was reminded of that time. The younger generations cannot know the role this war played for my generation and our country as as whole. It's boring? It's slow? It's a fitting metaphor for a war that ruined the lives of many people. All for nothing.I saw the original short version years ago and as I remember the story was choppy and was not that ....complete. Redux puts in parts that flesh out the story much better. The end is different. The original had the airstrike destroying the Kurtz compound. In redux Captain W takes the insane Lance and just leaves. I guess the Chefs message did not get thru. The French plantation scene is rather odd but good as an explanation of the
vapid thinking of The USA. Any Vietnamese Communist govt.,would be Vietnamese. I mean they fought everyone for 30 years. I thought this scene would be a dream or a drug trip. It seems unlikely they would have survived since the 1950\s in a war zone.The whole Vietnam War is madness in this movie. Surfing nuts like Duvalls character for instance. He helps a wounded little girl,but incinerates people in the forest so he can surf. He offers water to a wounded VietCong but forgets the man when the surf star is found.. Col. Kurtz is destroyed by his battle between ruthless soldiering, the morality of that ruthlessness, and the guilt born by soldiers who do the deed. Captain Willard finishes off an innocent wounded girl on a boat. To take her to an aid station would delay his mission to kill Kurtz. Kurtz feels that determination , training, and ruthlessness is lacking in the US effort. He criticizes the US leadership strategy. He must be killed. This final crazy solution is to nuke the whole country !The S Vietnamese are double agents and corrupt. The NV are determined ruthless warriors. They will do anything to win. They have a cause, the US cause is weak. The whole bunny scene shows,how out of focus the US effort is.I found this to be well cast, had excellent photography ,and a fine coherent story in the longer version. It's like a long dreamlike trip, on drugs ? Or a nightmare, lived by the soldiers, caused by lying sit at home politicians and incompetent rear echelon strategists. I find the whole mess to be incredibly sad. It was the end of our nation."
IceCream-57,"May 21, 2025",10/10,"I have always enjoyed this film from the first time I seen it probably 20 years ago to seeing it now. It just brings the grit of the Vietnam War and the jungle to the big screen and to the viewer. The film is about a military man that, honestly, has lost his sanity a little bit in the jungle. He cannot cope with going to society and returning to the jungle. He has ruined his marriage and just wants a mission. And to quote him, for his sins they gave him one. He is charged with going through the Cambodia rivers and jungles to find a soldier that is sharp as they come, but has gone even crazier then he has and the government wants him terminated. This film is a American classic."

banerjeekousik92,"Aug 29, 2021",10/10,"After watching this 3¹/4 hour long cut of Apocalypse Now I can proudly say that there is a war movie which actually addresses the evil of war and the trauma it leaves on people's mind for eternity without steaming judgemental thoughts about its chracters keeping aside all those moralistic preaching about courage, valour, sacrifice, patriotism. This is a movie where people seemed like people instead of some made up chracters. This story evolves around a US army assassin who has been sent on a mission to kill an special operations officer gone rouge committing mass killings inhumanely without any regard to chain of command. On his journey with other four teammates through the river metamorphically equivalent to circles of hell he only discovers the truest darkness of self and others indistinguishable from the target he has been ordered to neutralize. Multiple layered themes about hallucinations , psychological disorder denials, sexual intolerances, racism has been dealt with such artistic neutral asthetic approach that some times may disgust you to your core accompanied with top notch acting performances, beautiful cinematography atmospherically significant back ground music with engaging screenplay from start to end will make your experience psychosomatic. One of the rarest gems in world which will kéep on being significant throughout the ages."
dj_xand325,"Nov 13, 2008",10/10,"The Vietnam war genre has become proliferated throughout the cinematic world. The repertoire of Vietnam films is vast. Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon. Yet Apocalypse Now is not only the best Vietnam film, it is the best war film I have ever seen and ranks as one of the most mesmerising films ever created.Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's superb novella: 'Heart of Darkness'; Coppola's adaptation is both reasonably faithful and demandingly original. In a way, this is a reinvented and rethought version of Conrad's book. Coppola is subtle with his particular references to the book.Coppola's daring direction and chilling music makes this film an experience to say the least. You experience the horrors of the Vietnam War as the alpha-male group of soldiers trudge up this river famously described as a snake uncoiled in Conrad's novella. Apocalpse Now is also one of my favourite beginnings of a film. The chilling blend of REM and the jungle's exploding in flames was the best possible way to open the film.I would love to say what exactly this film is about in a deeper manner but its just too difficult. It raises issues about the morals of the war, the treatment of soldiers and the government's view of the soldiers.Apocalypse Now is an astonishing war film. It has the depth and maximised style to rank as one of the greatest films ever made.I preferred this to Godfather.10/10"
raebari,"Sep 13, 2004",N/A,"There are about 10 films ever made that leave indelible images branded into your brain, and this is one of them. Those who comment that the film ranges beyond war into the nature of human beings are on target. The film, like the book, spirals farther and deeper, down into the hot center of the degenerate human heart. Yes, it's a slow, crawling sensation, and like many artists before them, Conrad and Coppola use a river as the symbol of the life's journey we are all floating on, like it or not, as the riverbanks gliding by present ever-changing conflicts. The mad young surfer--the only survivor besides Willard--is yet another version of all the demented or alienated characters in literature who see the truth realized--the Seer in Greek tragedies, the cabin boy in Moby Dick, Jim in Huck Finn, the Pilot's Boy in Rime of the Ancient Mariner, the jesters in Shakespeare's dramas. In never-ending cycles of trauma and peace, both individuals and nations are repeatedly mired in moral dilemmas that create suffering and horror, and reveal the perversity of the human heart. But the soul is never extinguished."
ntvm,"Jun 29, 2024",6/10,"Decent movie but parts of it are hard to follow. Unusual, one of a kind. I recall when this movie first appeared on HBO back in the very early eighties (I think around 1981). I had watched this several times and was trying to figure it out, Then I had just started watching again and a friend came by and he pulls out a killer joint ( I was still single and wild in those days), anyway we smoked that thing and watched the movie. Amazingly, it made complete sense. Then a few days later I was on again and I decided to watch it again, and lo and behold I could not quite understand it all again. Definitely one of the most unusual movies ever made."

claszdsburrogato,"Dec 11, 2023",5/10,"Francis Ford Coppola is a director much loved by the public, mainly because of The Godfather. Shortly after releasing the two cinema classics, Coppola released Apocalypse Now, which for many is the best war film in history. It's a really cool and interesting film with many beautiful scenes. However, I couldn't connect that much with the narrative and characters. Even so, I admit that it is very interesting to see the characters going crazy in many moments. Some dialogues are perfect and really thought-provoking. The details that caught my attention the most were the visuals, because the story didn't manage to capture me as much as I wanted. In short, Apocalypse Now is a good film, with some very interesting scenes, but it didn't manage to fully capture me from start to finish. In my view, it is not the best war film in history and is far from that position."

Apocalypse Now manages to shock, he shows what war does to people.´I love the smell of napalm in the morning´In the first moment you think, did he really say that? Maybe you smile first and then you realize, no, he means it. There are several such moments.Apocalypse Now captures the mood in the country, he shows what is going on in the soldiers.You have to remember at what time this film was made. Apocalypse Now is over 40 years old and you can't tell that from his face. The film is a masterpiece and ahead of its time. Definitely one of the best in its genre.I have watched the normal cinema version, but I will definitely watch the Redux & Final Cut. But I have to say that I liked the normal version very much.Only the last part, when Captain Willard meets Colonel Kurtz, is too lifted off for me. The rest of the movie is on the dot."

drstrange231264,"Aug 21, 2006",10/10,"Contrary to Martin Zimmermann above I would actually believe the Redux version very much adds to the development of the characters and the film as such ... there are as far as I remember three scenes added to the original. The first add (the mugging of the surfboard) shows some of the characters (Lance but also Kilgore) as the kids they actually are, plus the humor adds to the shock of the upcoming disturbing scenes ... The second scene (the tête-à-tête with the bunnies/hookers) is quite surreal and reminds me a bit of ""Catch 22"" ... it also explains why Chief Phillips is so bullheaded in frisking the Sampan (release of tension) ... The third added scene (the visit of the french plantation) is somewhat more difficult ... on one hand the dialog is highly valuable (seems like nobody is willing to learn from the mistakes of others) on the other hand the plot is not very credible ... personally, I would have put the scene at the very end of the movie, where the impact would gain more gravitas: once Willard takes a shower the dirt seems to be washed away, however the stains remain though invisible ...."
jackstarr777,"Jun 7, 2012",N/A,"It's not a surprise this film is considered one of the best of all time. Right from the start it's compelling, pulling you right in, and as the story paces along it turns exhilarating.Right from the start the haunting, chilling atmosphere is built and never faults. The musical score sets the scene perfectly.The script is brilliant. Some of the writing is the best I've ever seen in a film, the voice-over narration particularly. Those iconic opening words - ""Sh-t. Saigon."" - really stay with you, not like I've ever really experienced before.But the main point of brilliance is that fantastic scene where the napalm strike is called onto the beach. Not once with a film have I felt so excited and entertained, the whole sequence was heart-stopping. That alone was enough to give the whole film a ten-out-of-ten.But the excitement didn't stop there. As the story progresses, as we see more, more interest develops. The scenes with the calendar models and the soldiers meeting are compelling, giving us more of an insight of the characters. It's really more than JUST a war film.It goes without saying that Marlon Brando's performance was simply superb, as with all of his performances. But there isn't a single bad actor in the whole film. Every famous face never faults.Of course, the film's epic length may be strenuous for some viewers, and less patient viewers may find it tedious, but for me and many others it's a sure classic.Overall: 9.7/10"
moonspinner55,"Feb 9, 2008",6/10,"Francis Ford Coppola's vision of Vietnam, seeing the eccentricities inherent in the horrors of war and also the indescribable visual beauty running parallel with all the ugliness. Martin Sheen plays an Army Captain who's been traumatized by his first tour of duty in Saigon; but, left without a family and haunted by memories of the jungles, he is almost anxious to accept a new mission: track down and kill a renegade Green Beret Colonel, a poetic martinet who has apparently lost his mind and is hiding out in the ""heart of darkness"". Elephantine production quickly gets out of hand, and Sheen seems to struggle with his wobbly, mushy character (he's rudderless throughout, acting mostly with his wide eyes). The locations and the rock music selections are impeccable, stamping the film with a distinctive (and artistic) mark, but Coppola loses his identity somewhere along this unseemly journey. ""Apocalypse Now"" has the look of genius, yet it could be a picture directed by any number of brazen auteurs. Some incredible supporting performances--including by Marlon Brando, as well as Robert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Dennis Hopper (who just evaporates) and Frederic Forrest--give the proceedings some muscle, but it's a wayward and occasionally woebegone picture, a war film that throws its punches in the dark like a blindfolded boxer. **1/2 from ****"

The film is effective in bringing this message to the surface, and the message is still important today.
Apocalypse Now is important for all to see so all could know that war isn't how we think it is. Other movies romanticize war, but this one shows the tough and gritty side of war, without shying away from the horrors you see in the film. This film is undeniably disturbing, but one of Coppola's great films which will have you thinking about it for a while. And, yes, Kurtz's words still ring today. ""The horror...the horror..."""
The-Mov1st,"Apr 30, 2022",5/10,This movie had ups and downs wasn't that enjoyable and didn't like it at all waste of time. Was too long and didn't find it amusing like all the reviews of people that we're enjoying this film watched it one time and not watching it again.
pushanbanerjee,"Apr 14, 2021",10/10,"Very very few movies get this close to perfection. I've read the book after watching the movie.Martin Sheen is so very good and what haunted me are the eyes. Every single time. The photography is genius, none more so than in that now famous helicopter scene.However this movie is all about the master Coppola. How he made this is history. Boy did he make one of the best ever. And yes, Brando is magnificent as ever. How could he not be. This is one movie that other movies get measured by, and so it should."
damianphelps,"Oct 23, 2020",9/10,"I have watched this movie maybe 10 times and it is epic.I can't recommend which version to watch, they all have merit, although I do wish someone would just pick one and delete the rest :)Its dark, confronting, different, deep, too deep and mindblowing.Its hard to write a summary for something so wonderfully large.To make your cinematic journey complete I highly recommend watching Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, the documentary about making the movie that is as good if not better than the movie!"
wouterstaut,"Aug 7, 2021",10/10,"I saw this movie and was blown away by it. This is a war
epic like you've never experienced it before. Don't expect lot's of battles but prepare for a psychological anti-war movie that is just the perfect movie. It tells a full story like for instance The Lord of the rings trilogy. Francis ford Coppola is a genius and he proves it once more. Watch it whenever you can, watch it now!"
Soumyadeep9190,"Sep 1, 2025",9/10,"Apocalypse Now is not just a war movie... it is an unforgettable cinematic journey into the darkness of human nature. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is nothing short of brilliant. The way he presented the story... the style of storytelling... and the slow but powerful build-up made the film a true masterpiece.The acting was exceptional. Martin Sheen gave such a raw and layered performance that I found myself completely drawn into his character's struggle. But of course, Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz was something else entirely... even with limited screen time, his presence was larger than life. His final dialogues were haunting... they touched the soul in a way only a truly great actor can deliver. Watching him made me realize how rare it is to find such talent in today's generation.The writing was outstanding... poetic yet brutal. Every scene felt crafted with care, and the supporting cast and crew also delivered remarkable work. The visuals, sound design, and atmosphere created an experience that was both terrifying and mesmerizing.The final act stayed with me long after the credits rolled. The horror... the horror. Those words echo not only in the film but in the history of cinema.Overall, Apocalypse Now is a timeless classic... a film that goes beyond entertainment and forces you to think, feel, and confront the darker sides of humanity."
yashup-23033,"Sep 12, 2021",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola is one of the best directors of all time,This is his fine work. The movie so intense and Hats of for every crew members,Martin sheen took it to an another level. This one of the best movies of all time."
rankfilm,"Jan 20, 2005",10/10,"A stunning masterpiece from the director of the Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola. Apocalypse Now is set during the Vietnam War. It follows the quest of a man called Captain Willard who receives orders to travel up river and locate a renegade officer, the mysterious Colonel Kurtz. Once located Willard is ordered to 'terminate his command with extreme prejudice'. The only problem with this is that as the quest progresses Willard begins to see parts of himself in Kurtz and begins to identify with is intended victim.With an infamous reputation and a cast to match, I built Apocalypse Now up to be a life changing experience. One thing I can say about it is that it stands out among the bombardment of films that my brain has been subjected to over the years. It had a reputation as being a bit of a let down in Coppola's eyes as he spent far too much money for what the film eventually grossed at the box office. To be fair to Coppola, anything that follows a film as prolific and influential as the Godfather would be hard pushed to surpass its predecessor. I believe that Apocalypse Now does this and at the risk of making myself unpopular with all you film buffs out there I believe that Apocalypse Now is twice the film The Godfather is. It is a film that I attempted to watch numerous times but just couldn't concentrate on it, dare I say it I found it tedious. I just couldn't understand how it had the reputation it does. As a film man I very rarely switch a film off but I did this one, at least the first ten attempts. I then was sitting bored the other night and swore to myself that it was something I just had to do so I sat down, stuck the DVD on and started drinking a large cup of coffee. Two and a half hours later I was mesmerised. Some may say it was the coffee, I say it was the film, but never the less that night I just could not sleep with excitement. Apocalypse Now is one of the most disturbing and powerful films of all time, it reflects the true limits of the human mind and demonstrates ideally how our ideology changes in different situations. A true masterpiece of epic proportions, that if stuck with will make you a truly richer person.5/5"
TSHunter,"Jul 16, 2006",N/A,"I have to admit, the first and only six times I saw the original version of this film (not ""Redux""), I fell asleep during the film. I was convinced that the original film was made catastrophically unwatchable by the muddled and misguided editing. Several of my friends were angry to the respect that I could actually fall asleep to the ""best film ever"", in their opinion. As a result, I was relieved when I found out that there was going to be a release of a new version to theatres, a ""director's cut"", if you will. I purposely waited until it was released on DVD to watch it, and turned the English subtitles on, and I was glad, because I remember lots of the dialog being lost in the original mix (as I think it is also in this as well), but I feel the subtitles help you get through it. You see, I am the kind of person who likes director's cuts, uncensored versions, restored with new footage films, and even letterbox versions, basically the best way a film is intended. There are some exceptions to the rules, like when different editing processes are used, such as ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", which I still think was a mistake that George Lucas didn't correct some of the very noticeable errors in digital vs. analog editing and prints (i.e. he really should have either re-filmed the original Jabba-the-Hut & Han Solo conversation, instead of a digital re-creation and insertion/replacement of an analog filming of someone different {Jabba}, or just kept the scene cut indefinitely), or when studios take control of films and try to make their own edit and commercial cuts, which is almost always monstrous, just as I've heard with Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"". To summarize, it is possible for someone who has issues with this original film to like the ""Redux"" version, if it is for the reasons as I stated, because I feel that ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" actually is a better film than the original ""Apocalypse Now"". Yes, I am bold enough to say it. I am positive that this will offend people who think the original cut is the ""best film ever"", and I know it is even probable they won't like -this- version, but I don't care about that, just like I didn't rate this version 5-stars, or even think of it as the ""best film ever"". This film clearly travels the waters between pure evil and insane genius. This is the only version worth watching. 8/10"
W011y4m5,"Jul 14, 2022",6/10,"Discovered that ""Apocalypse Now"" is overrated... Doesn't bode well for ""The Godfather"" but ah, well. I'll reserve my judgement of that Francis Ford Coppola project until I see it.All I will say is film fans need to learn to differentiate a ""masterpiece"" from an adequate movie with exceptional filmmaking / cinematography. They're not the same thing. The story's tediously slow, unengaging & dull. The monologues bore & despite the visual impressiveness, there's very little substance beneath the plethora of style."
juliette-20138,"May 6, 2018",9/10,"This film was incredibly well done, and the similarities to Conrad's Heart of Darkness were amazing, creating a similar message in the end. The first scene is everything: the cinematography was perfect, and The End by the Doors as the soundtrack worked eerily well. Lighting throughout the movie, especially surrounding the mysterious Kurtz (although it was needed) also worked well to establish the mood.Throughout the movie, we are encouraged to see that Kurtz' inhumanity likely stems from being put in a situation where he answers to (essentially) no one, where there are no rules, and where morals he thought he once had fell apart. Maybe, it is more the absence of ""civilization"" that leads to the ""civilization"" that encourages inhumane treatment. It is human nature that is at fault, not any individual or group. The encouragement of American society for Kurtz to act in this way also definitely had an effect on him, but this is also human nature in a way. Human nature includes the elite's love for power and their ability to send others off to do the dirty work as well as the quality of obedience in those ""others"". All of these are human biases, and it seems like only the people who have a great deal of self-awareness/control would be able to overcome them. Coppola's genius in Apocalypse Now encourages us to recognize that we all have darkness inside of us, but it is our ability to overcome this madness, even in the face of no authority or laws OR in the face of authority that is evidently incorrect, that is what matters. This movie, like Conrad's masterpiece, also raises the following questions: When to ""shield"" the truth? Who should do so? Does anyone have the right to do so? Should the public have full access to all knowledge? It makes sense to think that the general public is sometimes not in the position to make a good judgement call and that emotions would cloud our judgement. But this mindset is also dangerous for the people who ultimately make the call, as it places them on a pedestal that could then cloud their judgement. Hard question that we need to ask ourselves...There are also apparent differences between Apocalypse Now and Heart of Darkness. For example, in Heart of Darkness, the British Empire stands firm, with Conrad seeming to respect the British Empire endlessly. With such a positive view of the motherland, the implications in Heart of Darkness in terms of England seem to be that all is not yet lost and there is some hope for mankind after all. The film is entirely different; after watching it and learning of the Vietnam war, few people would dare to advocate for the US as a solution to any problem today. This then leads us to the opposite conclusion: that America has absolutely no right to put itself on a pedestal that creates 'good' in the world. And of course, in today's view, this idea is much more realistic and applicable. I appreciate that Coppola urges his audience to recognize that America is not some heaven and also to look back on history and our mistakes. This movie was very well done, with aspects like sound and editing coming together to create a masterpiece, and raises difficult questions that we must ask ourselves."
Erick-12,"Dec 1, 2005",7/10,"If you're looking for a masterpiece, read the short novel this is based upon: Joseph Conrad's _Heart of Darkness_. The film is merely OK in comparison.I like the idea of translating Conrad's anti-imperialism from the Congo of 100 years ago to Vietnam in the '60s. The Idea is relevant, once we look through the alibi, the self-serving excuses, and the supposed idealism of the US taking up a former French colony after they cut and ran from the independence fighters there.But the film's ponderous ambition tends to become bombastic at times, rather than the bottomless ambiguity of Conrad's novella."
Teh_Face,"Dec 5, 2006",1/10,"After seeing the high rating I decided to take a look at this film, for the first hour and forty minutes I was bored to tears. After that point it looked like there might have been some slight hope things were going to pick up, but that was only for ten minutes then it went back to the boring drab and dullness until the end of the film.There's not a lot I can say as hardly anything interesting or worth watching is in this film, just seemed like the same thing happening over and over again just with different camera angles until they finally got to the island. Even then it doesn't live up to the expectations of what the characters in the film have been trying to imply all along.There was nothing insane about this film or the guy on the island, there was maybe a few minutes of very mild gore, nothing scary, no horror and no craziness.. just dull dull dull.I would find the beeping noise of a reversing truck more exciting than this film."
adam_pittavino,"Oct 21, 2017",10/10,"""Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable plugged straight into Kurtz"" that piece of dialogue from Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, sets the psychedelic tone for what is widely considered Francis Ford Coppola's most ambitious project. Based loosely on Joseph Conrad's novela Heart of Darkness, 'Apocalypse Now' tells the tale of decorated soldier Walter E Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, and the frightening journey of his assassin Captain Willard. Kurtz, who has abandoned his military obligation, has recruited an army of tribal locals deep in the heart of a war ravaged Cambodian jungle. He has in every sense of the word, gone insane. Just like Willard, we know very little of his enemy Colonel Kurtz, and as he descends further towards the Colonels compound, the more he learns about him, and most importantly, himself. As the two men collide, Kurtz's rants and confessions portray a ghost of somebody lost in time and space, reeling with pain and profound hurt, as we hear tales of a renegades life that put Willard's assumed past into some sort of moral perspective. Does Willard have the guts and instinct to carry out the responsibility placed upon him? One of the reason's why 'Apocalypse now' has a lasting legacy over other Vietnam war films is not only due to its cast, but it's director Francis Ford Coppola and his desire and will to defy modern convention and deliver one of motion pictures most analyzed and lorded movies from a near flawless and revolutionary period of cinema. To say Coppola had reached the peak of his creative and artistic powers would be a mere under statement, and to acknowledge the depth and underlying detail he has outlined can not only illustrate the brilliance of his film making psyche, but position the audience in the same chaotic realm as its cast and crew. We see the fanatic struggle of Captain Willard and we see the madness of Colonel Kurtz. The other essential character is the jungle itself, just like an actor, it transforms and evolves many times through out the movie. We first see it as a harmless estuary slowly bend into a tunnel toward hell. We also see a far more primitive tug of war between Willard and the jungle, a war that can only be won and lost in his own mind. 'Apocalypse now' is not a horror movie, but it is so much more frightening. The mark of a great film is it's power to defy categorization, and Coppola's 1979 masterpiece does just that."
you_smell360,"Oct 26, 2005",9/10,"Last year at school, everyone was talking about this movie and everyone was saying how good it was so I had to see it. My friend burnt me it and I hated it, I thought it was boring. I was some what disenchanted after watching it expecting a really action packed movie. The first hour didn't disappoint but after that it was boring. I was only 15 then and I never really got over what a let down it was.So, for English I picked this film as a related text. This time I knew what to expect and this time I was really impressed and touched by the film. I think it had something with me being an age older. This time I actually listened to what they said and it made the story much more fascinating and bearable to watch, in fact it even moved quickly.The storyline of this film is very simple. Based on on the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who has lost all hope in humanity is given the unenviable mission of traveling up the Nang river in order to bring the wayward Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) under control. As the film progresses the viewer is confronted with numerous scenes raging from insanity to chaos, which not only shock, but make you reflect and sometimes even disturb you. An example is when they come to an outpost, the soldiers jump in the water screaming to be taken away from their perspective of hell. Another scene, is when Lance puts war paint on. When questioned about it he says ""they're everywhere"", which is ludicrous when you think about it, because he is not in the jungle and could easy been picked off in the boat.Some of the films concepts are hard to be grasped and I wont go into them here. Suffice to say, it is better left for you to find out yourself. Apocalypse Now is sometimes said to be an inaccurate film about Vietnam and that films like Platoon are more accurate. That is not true though. The film accurately shows Vietnam, as a place literally gone mad. A war without any purpose other than the evil motivations of politics and the army. It is hard for the characters and the viewer to find hope in this film, because in Vietnam, there was none for the soldiers. This film is beautiful it really shows what the human mind is capable of, and if you can understand it, you will be changed forever by this powerful and moving film.Simply STUNNING"
EamesTheForger,"Oct 8, 2011",10/10,"The film's opening scene alone is worth the price of the DVD - the haunting image of helicopters flying low over a jungle that is suddenly engulfed by an explosion of napalm is not easily forgotten, but Coppola's real genius lies in the the overlaying of a soundtrack that immediately evokes the time and place of these events - The Door's The End (surely the epitome of 60's psychedelia) providing a drugged-up anaesthetic to the violence of the images on the screen.Based on Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now follows an American soldier travelling upriver into the depths of a Vietnamese tribal culture which seems to become more and more savage. Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on a confidential mission by the US army to eliminate Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz, once one of the finest officers the army had seen, has apparently lost all sense of reality and has gathered his own private Vietnamese army deep in the jungle.Early in Willard's mission we witness one of film's most powerful scenes; an attack by US helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village. We see the simple way of life in the village as the helicopters appear on the horizon, with their on-board loudspeakers blasting out Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. Robert Duvall's psychopathic US officer gives remorseless orders to gun down the women and blow up the bridges. This scene is starkly real yet magnificent to watch, and leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. Few films have portrayed the chaos and randomness of war so clearly or so shockingly.As Willard progresses further up the river the film becomes more and more surreal and foreboding, and we begin to realise that Kurtz has experienced something which has led to his 'madness'. This all becomes apparent in the philosophical, spaced-out ending in which Willard finally finds Kurtz's jungle sanctuary.Apocalypse Now should not be seen as an overview of the Vietnam War; it is instead a film about one man's journey into darkness, and about the people he meets and the events he witnesses on the way. There are no heroes in this film – just ordinary (and not so ordinary) people trying to survive the best way they can. It recognises that each soldier is different and that each has a story: one young soldier is shown dying while a letter from his mother is read aloud, another soldier screams hysterically as he forced to get off a helicopter and go into war, while Robert Duvall's character famously describes his love of 'the smell of napalm in the morning'. While the viewer is left in no doubt as to the horrors of war, Coppola does not set out to create a sentimental account of 'war being hell'.While immersed in the breathtaking sound and visuals I have to pinch myself to remember that this film was made in the 70s. It is still as technically spectacular as any film I have ever seen. Ignore the hype surrounding the gimmick of 3D; the realness of the visuals in Apocalypse Now has a far stronger effect. The film is one of the most important and pioneering in history; without it the modern war film would be very different.It seems a pity that every film more than a few months old is confined to the small screen. Is cinema not the ultimate way to view a film? Imagine only being able to read books or listen to songs released in 2011. There are dozens of forgotten films screaming out for a re-release, from Once Upon a Time in the West to Blade Runner. The magic of acting legends and veteran directors should be seen the way it was meant to be seen. Do not miss the re-release of Apocalypse Now for the world."
muamba_eats_toast,"Aug 14, 2019",9/10,Having never seen it before went to the 40th anniversary screening in imax last night and what an experience despite its length I was totally consumed for the majority of the film and despite normally struggling to watch older films due to the special effects and poor image quality the quality of the film surpassed any issues. I was almost st the point of giving it a 10 but I was waivering slightly the last half hour and with brando's introduction. Maybe this would have been different with the original cut as the extended cut was just that little bit to long for me. Other than that a sublime piece of film making.
sfraasch-1,"Apr 20, 2006",10/10,"I really don't think the movie has much to do with insanity as it has to do with the fact that war is simply not civil. If it is fought in a non-committal way, it is a waste of time and victory cannot be sought. Those who would fight it brutally might be considered insane, but they are actually rational.The Darkness or ""Horror"" is not insanity, but a realism by Col Kurtz of what is required to win war: Total commitment by the US to wage total warfare resulting in total annihilation (recall his penciled notes in red ink, ""Drop the bomb. Kill them all"").When Coppola commented that the movie IS Vietnam, I think this is at least one point he was making: the futility of fighting a dedicated enemy with limited means. Recall Kurtz's comments of what he could accomplish with 10 divisions of troops of the likes that cut off the arms of innoculated children. He was referring to the brutality AND will required to win war. In contrast to his and Willard's will to accomplish their missions, there is ample evidence of those who are trying to escape Vietnam: Lance and LTC Kilgore's surfing obsession during supposed combat, the troops swimming in the river trying to escape the bridge outpost, the lack of officers present and in control, the high ranking general living a pampered existence in his comfortable airstream trailer, and Lance's escaping thru dropping acid.Those that advocate total war to seek victory (like Kurtz, and implicitly Captain Willard) are probably correct, but made out to be insane. This is not unlike previous history, when Gen MacArthur advocated invading Manchuria and bombing across the Yalu river, essentially fighting Red China and using nuclear weapons. Truman, Marshall, and Bradley agreed that the Korea conflict had to be limited, and MacArthur removed as the UN forces Commander. The same principle was applied in Vietnam, where limited war was micro-managed by Secretary MacNamara and the pentagon. Uncontrolled escalation by the Army could lead to conflict with China and the USSR. Loose cannons such as Col Kurtz were dangerous and could not be tolerated in the officer corps.I still wonder if the reason to eliminate Kurtz were his views, or his actions ?"
WIVEGI,"Sep 19, 2022",1/10,"I've been hearing about this movie for most of my life, so I finally gave in and watched it. I expected it to be brutal movie abt the Vietnam War but other than that didn't really know that much about it.It was pretty much what I expected. A lot of hype, violence and gore. One of those movies that people watch so they can mindlessly agree with popular opinion that this is a groundbreaking film. The storyline was not that interesting or complex and the ending was very anticlimactic.Couldn't watch the scene of them brutally killing that water buffalo and was horrified when I found out they actually killed a live animal for the scene.The backstory with all the challenges they were faced with while trying to make this movie was the more interesting than the movie. It's a bigger horror story and shows how far Hollywood will go make money. This movie is only a few steps away from being a snuff film."
robzitnik,"Mar 19, 2006",9/10,"This film is arguably one of the most important cinematic achievements of the 20th century. Based on the book ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad this movie is a provocative display of the Vietnam War and the surreal, yet utterly human experiences of its combatants. In the story, Lieutenant Willard (Martin Sheen) travels down a river to seek and assassinate the crazed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has isolated himself from U.S. forces in a remote outpost. As Willard gets closer and closer to his prey though, he finds himself idolizing and obsessing over the invisible, god-like figure of Kurtz rather than preparing to kill him.What sets this movie apart from other war movies is not its ""hell no, we won't go,"" theme that appears in films such as Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket,"" nor its ""no guts, no glory"" theme that appears in movies such as ""Patton."" Instead, it is its dreamlike portrayal of war as an experience which brings out our most savage, yet undeniably, our most natural tendencies. Everything from the soundtrack, to the screenplay, to the acting furthers the notion that every person who spends time in a war begins to understand the most basic of human desires, and learns to eliminate their consciences. And this, evidently, is ""the horror"" that Willard refers to throughout the film.The sweeping scenes of the blazing jungle, and the incessant whir of helicopter blades, are mere supplements to the brilliant performances of Brando, Sheen, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, and Dennis Hopper among others. This movie in itself is a dangerous odyssey, for it takes more than a clever film critic to truly understand its importance. The message is hidden deep in the jungle and takes a keen eye to divulge and appreciate. This is a movie about escape from civility, ""the end of our elaborate plan,"" and a descent into chaos and madness, the only question is, are you ready for the Apocalypse?"
psionchronicles,"Aug 31, 2019",10/10,"My stepdad was an MP in Vietnam, and his comment after watching this was, ""This wasn't Vietnam... it was somebody's nightmare."" My mother's take was that it was ""the most satanic movie ever made"". The problem with most movie reviewers and critics is that they evaluate every movie based on the same criteria, which only benefits cinema majors. My stepdad's evaluation was based on how closely it portrayed his experience in Vietnam, and that wasn't really the premise of this movie. Vietnam is only used as a setting here for a re-telling of ""Heart of Darkness"" to make it relatable to modern audiences; anyone with no familiarity with the Conrad novel will completely miss that and dismiss this as a psychotic maligning of the Vietnam War.
This movie was a personal turning point for me. What it excelled at was making me question much of what I'd been taught and shown in my life and my perspectives on things. Willard's line sums it up: ""The more I saw of lies, the more I hated them."" I came to admire how he abandons any notions of being any more or better than what he is. The real grit of this narrative is how you may not agree with his or Kurtz's methods or understandings or morality, but you can clearly understand how they could arrive at them. So based on the criteria of ""movies that made me think"", I give it 10 stars. If I were to rate it based on historical accuracy, I'd have to bump that down to 3; at least it depicts the Vietnam leadership as buffoons, which by all accounts they were. If I were to rate it on memorable scenes and quotable lines, again a 10. Casting and acting I'd give a 10. It did a fantastic job of taking a war movie beyond mere battle scenes and into the larger issues of morality and judgment."
didi-5,"May 18, 2004",9/10,"Whether you're viewing the original version of Coppola's Apocalypse Now', or the Redux version (which restored an hour of deleted footage from the 1979 release), there are certain things you remember:  the mad colonel shrouded in shadow (Marlon Brando in perhaps his last great movie role); the showy performances of the actors travelling through Vietnam (Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper, and especially, Martin Sheen as Willard  who replaced Harvey Keitel in the role and probably did it much better than he would have done); and the music  not only Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, but also one of the most effective uses of a single song (in this case, The End', by The Doors, which is just perfect).There are other images, too, of the war-torn province, the soldiers coming to terms with the ripping open of their souls  this is a war movie, pure and simple, yet there is much more going on here than is instantly apparent. Much better than Platoon' or The Deer Hunter', perhaps because it takes more risks and ultimately has a more lasting point to make?"
buzzkill99,"Nov 12, 2005",9/10,"It includes added footage that absolutely wreaks havoc with the original story line and, more crucially, character development. That said, the original (which I saw in 1979 in what was then a rare widescreen cinema,) is still the best Vietnam movie of all time. I've always considered the trip up river, and the way events get more and more surreal and insane the further up the river they go, as a metaphor for the the entire American experience in Southeast Asia. Every performance is a gem -- it's especially cool to see a very young Lawrence Fishburne in his debut role. Coppola was never this good again."

Everything is perfectly paced, characters are amazing, and it's one hell of a journey to the very end! Don't miss this one for sure! In my top 5 movies. 10/10 perfect!"
jesssellers,"Mar 13, 2006",N/A,"Apocalypse Now is quite possibly one of the best films i have seen, that is after watching it numerous times. In order to really appreciate it i would highly recommend reading Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness as this is the novel the film is based on.The film has depth and the more times you watch it the more you pick up on. Martin Sheen plays a diamond role as the narrator. What makes it such a clever role is that we are never sure whether the narrator is trustworthy or not, or does he become affected by whats happening around him? A question that is difficult or impossible to answer, you really have to trust your own instincts whilst watching this one. As for the slightly unreal war simulations, the simple answer is that they are of no consequence. The real point of the film is the focus on Marlon Brando's character and 'The horror' that is when one looks into the abyss of nothingness. The nothingness that is life when you try to become your own God, the ultimate question that arises is of course; is there a difference between a good or bad God? If you become that God then there is none but yourself to judge you."
christiehammel,"Aug 5, 2022",7/10,"This is probably the most famous anti-war movie of all times. It's in the IMDb top50, but definitely not in my top50. However, I still thought it was a good film. Especially Robert Duvall (Kilgore) succeeds in displaying the insanity of war as he treats combat like a painting, plays classic music to the horrendous scenes and has his guys surfing at the same time. Excellent portrayal. He was the much better Coppola reunion in this movie and the Golden Globe and BAFTA wins were absolutely deserving. And when there is no visual horror...horror (e.g. A severed head or the death of the character played by the very young Laurence Fishburne), we hear people talking about it, for example Kurtz' story on severed children's arms.The redux version of the movie runs for considerably over 3 hours, about 200 minutes, and I would lie if I said there was not a single moment when it dragged. It did, occasionally, for example when they meet the French guys. I could have done without that part. The cast is pretty spectacular. Apart from everybody I already mentioned, there's also Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford and Frederic Forrest in this movie, all 3 Academy Award nominees themselves. It's an interesting take on soldiers' lives during this difficult time. But apart from all the brutal battle scenes and (during one scene) the unsuccessful longing for leadership, we also see a bunch of playboy bunnies giving the troops some pleasure with their mere presence."
Movie-ManDan,"Dec 10, 2014",10/10,"In high school, I had to read Heart of Darkness. Although it was a good book, I did not understand any of it so my teacher had to explain everything. It was a harder read than a Shakespeare play. Apocalypse Now is a loose adaptation that surpasses the book. A few years after Coppola does the best movies ever--The Godfather Part 1 & 2--he directs arguably the best war movie ever made. Apocalypse Now is inferior to The Godfather movies, but is a much better piece of film. This was ten times harder to do than Coppola's other flicks.I think Schindler's List is the best movie ever made about war. But it is not a straight-up war movie like this. As a straight-up war movie, this is the best. Saving Private Ryan is pretty close. But Apocalypse Now has a different kind of approach. Spielberg tried to make Saving Private Ryan to look like actual footage. Coppola tried to make Apocalypse Now look real too, but make the look more revolutionary and usable in every kind of film. Another thing that sets this apart is the weirdness that Coppola incorporates, used from the story. Martin Sheen (in an underrated performance) plays a soldier who seeks out Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando. Along the way, he encounters many odd tribes and rituals. When he gets to Kurtz's kingdom, the weirdness reaches an all-time high and the result of his stay changes him forever. Coppola creates some odd tribes that is genius for movies. The general filming with stuff like cinematography is revolutionary and mind-blowing. Coppola never did better than this and very few directors have done better than this.Apocalypse Now is a story about how war can change people and does the best job in showing how and why.4/4"
russell100uk,"Oct 5, 2005",9/10,"Apocalypse Now is a movie bordering on a masterpiece, created using a canvas even the most legendary painter would be envious of. The striking elements of the film are the exceptional usage of colour, the clever manipulation of lighting and the start contrast of each and every frame. Marvel at the picture postcard presentation of the jungles of Vietnam, before suddenly all hell breaks lose and it becomes a torrent of machine gun fire and blood. Apocalypse Now aims for the gut and skewers the viewer, assaulting the senses with a masterful display of cinematography, lighting and direction. Unlike so many ""Hollywood"" productions of today, ""Now"" is a labour of love, each frame expertly crafted by a man at the very pinnacle of his film-making career. Very few films would be right at home next to a Monet or a Van Gogh, yet this is one of the few exceptions, displaying some of the most beautiful photography ever seen on the silver screen.While the look may impress, ""Now"" is rendered complete by its phenomenally powerful story, based on Joseph Conrad's novel ""Heart of Darkness"". The full horror of war is explored to the depths, with the absurdities of war emphasised by the central plot of eliminating the enemy, not the Vietcong rebels, but an American Colonel with delusions of grandeur. The movie takes many unexpected twists and turns, always flirting with the bizarre and surreal, and always coming off as a fresh and invigorating slice of life behind enemy lines. Martin Sheen is superb as Captain Willard, a man who knows no other world, who lives and breathes war. Brando is suitably chilling as Kurtz, the object of his mission, and Dennis Hopper, as a hippy photojournalist, gives a typically neurotic turn, converted by Kurtz's seemingly infinite words of wisdom. And who could forget Robert Duvall, as the gung-ho Lieutenant Kilgore, lover of Wagner and napalm.""Now"" is a remarkable film, a breath of fresh air amidst PC modern day film-making. Even 26 years on, its impact is spellbinding and its message is timely. Coppola, as a filmmaker, should be applauded for having the courage to make a movie about the truth and not a fabricated Hollywood tale where the true horrors and inhumanities of war are neatly swept under the carpet. I doubt we'll see another war movie of its calibre for a very long time to come."
frankwhat,"Sep 12, 2004",10/10,"There's really no other way to say it except that this was a spectacular movie. Everything about it was just so perfect...the acting, cinematography, music/scores, directing, and action sequences just to name a few. I mean film doesn't get much better than this and the fact that this escaped with only a couple Oscars completely baffles me. Some classic quotes were also spewed throughout the duration and it really makes you think about a lot of things. Robert Duvall was probably my favorite character even though he was only in it for a smidge. I couldn't believe Laurence Fishburne was only 14 when he was in this, he looked a lot older. Martin Sheen was spectacular and believe it or not I think he did a better job than Harvey Keitel would've in this role (even though I'm one of his major fans), so when he dropped out I don't consider that to be a tragedy by any means. Marlon Brando is just Marlon Brando and despite all the problems he gave everyone before and during shooting I still really liked him in this role. As for Dennis Hopper, well he was very comical. This is hands down a classic and an absolute must-see!Final Recommendation:Movies : Man I wish I could've seen this on the screen.DVD Purchase : I have ""Redux"" and it was a good investment, though the added scenes are kind of slow moving they still add a lot to the story.Rental : We all got to get started somewhere."
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oct 11, 2006",8/10,"I really didn't think it was possible to get through Apocalypse Now, over three and a half hours! Well, unfortunately, my sister gave me the Director's Cut to watch, so it was a bit of an ambush of a film. But still, now that I can take a breath, I can honestly say that was one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. Definitely one of a kind, to be honest, I didn't realize also that Marlon Brando really only has a cameo in the film, but it was so memorable that I can see why he is praised when it comes to this movie.It's about a captain played by Sheen, he is sent to Vietnam to capture and kill Captain William played by Brando. William has made himself into a God of a Vietnam tribe and you can tell by his appearance, he's been through Hell. But that's exactly what Sheen has also been through just trying to get to William, through the bloody jungles of Vietnam, he has seen the most horrific images and watch his friends/troop get killed off one by one.Truly an epic motion picture, I can see why this movie is praised. It's so incredibly haunting and disturbing, the soundtrack really does add so much. The sets are incredible but very scary to look at. Sheen and Brando are just amazing in this film, but it's great to see the ""new"" faces of the time, including Harrison Ford and Lawerence Fishbourne, not to mention we have Dennis Hopper and one of the most amazing directors of our time, Francis Ford Coppola.Although, I'm not sure if I could make it through this movie again, for the simple sake of my sanity, I really can't see how this movie could be anyone's favorite to be honest. It's so friggin' depressing! But I will never ever ever doubt what an incredibly moving and disturbing picture it was to watch. I'm going to have nightmares these next few nights!8/10"
henryonhillside,"Apr 16, 2023",9/10,"I love this movie. I'm reviewing it in order to pass on Peter Arnett's observation about it. He was a noted journalist who covered the war, risked his life doing so, got shot at, etc. In a Q and A in the San Jose Mercury News in the 1990s he said ""Apocalypse Now"" was the best Vietnam War picture, that it captures the madness of the conflict quite brilliantly.I would also mention that every role in the film is beautifully acted. G. D. Spradlin -- Dennis Hopper -- Frederic Forrest -- etc. And Marlon Brando, who is handed an impossible role -- a role where our expectations are built up, built up, built UP over the course of the movie before we meet him -- he pulls it off somehow."
Cloud20,"Feb 4, 2006",N/A,"Apocalypse Now (1979, 2001)Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Albert Hall, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford.Twenty-five years ago, Francis Ford Coppola had created a ground-breaking masterpiece. It was called 'Apocalypse Now'. It was based on the novel Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, which was written in the late 1800's. It obviously wasn't about the Vietnam War, but instead was about a man named Kurtz in the jungles of Cambodia. Now that was a great example of film-making. Three years ago, they released an extended version called 'Apocalypse Now: Redux'.Captain Benjamin Willard is a man just waiting and urging for a mission. He is assigned one: To terminate (...with extreme prejudice) Kurtz, a former Colonel who is a leader of a tribe in a Cambodian jungle. Willard travels with a group of soldiers: Chef, Chief, Lance, and Clean. He meets surf-crazed Lt. Col. Kilgore, who leads the military during an island attack. When Willard arrives on Kurtz's island, he finds that Kurtz has set up his own army. While learning about why Kurtz despises the war, Willard drifts further and further from reality.'Apocalypse Now: Redux' gives us a version of the original with more detail. I thought that the original was outstanding, but adding almost an hour (49 minutes to be exact) of more footage made the film drag a bit.The acting is very good, especially from Sheen and Duvall. Brando gives a good performance. This wasn't his best performance (Last Tango in Paris and The Godfather come to mind),but it was very chilling. Other familiar faces include a very young Laurence Fishburne (18 years old!), Dennis Hopper, a younger Harrison Ford, and a cameo by R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) as a helicopter pilot. Duvall and Hopper give good comic relief. Coppola's direction is very good. Probably his best.The picture on 'Redux' is restored and looks better than ever. At times, I don't really consider it a war film because it doesn't focus on the Vietnam War. My favorite is the original, but watching 'Redux' was interesting. Fans of the original won't be disappointed by the film, even though we get no special features on the DVD but a trailer.'Redux' only has a few scenes added in. But they are long scenes. They don't really add much to the story, and don't have much meaning. However, it is good that they made a new version, to remind us of how good the original version was twenty-two years before.'Apocalypse Now' was one of the best films made about war. It is more like an anti-war film. It is like a personal journey to hell. It shows the power of a man, and how it effects others. It is one of the most unusual, brilliant, and yet bizarre films that I have ever seen. 'Redux' gives us a better look through Willard's adventure to keep his sanity. An excellent achievement (for both versions). 5 stars out of 5."
estebangonzalez10,"Jul 25, 2012",7/10,"¨I love the smell of napalm in the morning.¨There is no doubt that Apocalypse Now will be considered by many as one of the best films of all time because it is a very memorable and unique film. It feels surreal at times and has some great performances. It's also hard to define what genre the film belongs to because it doesn't seem to have a structure or a pattern we find in other films. Apocalypse Now is a classic and powerful film, but I really wasn't blown away by it and didn't enjoy it very much. The problem I had with it was that I watched the Redux version which is almost one hour longer than the original, so there were several moments that seemed to drag forever. What I did enjoy about this movie was the first hour which I felt was an absolute masterpiece. Those first sixty minutes were a lot of fun and had the best moments in the movie. Then the next two hours dragged way too much with all the surrealism. I got the point, the soldiers were getting crazy over the minute and the film succeeds tremendously in pointing that out as we see how nonsensical this war really was. The minds of these men seemed to be lost completely and there was chaos reigning all over the place. For me nothing will replace those brilliant first sixty minutes with a performance from Robert Duvall for the ages. He was perfect in those few scenes he was in and I wish the film would've dealt with him instead. The entrance in the helicopters with the classical music and then the surfing in the middle of the war zone was so hilarious; one of the best scenes in film history. I was really feeling good about this movie, until the film went completely in another direction and lost my interest.The movie takes place during the Vietnam War and it begins with a voice over narration of the main character, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), who has recently returned from the United States to continue fighting. He is beginning to lose his mind while he awaits his mission. He says all he wanted to do when he was in the jungle was return home, and once he was home all he wanted was to return to the jungle. War has taken its toll on him. Finally he receives a new mission from Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford) that is highly classified. He has to go down the Nung River all the way to Cambodia and find a former Colonel who has seemed to have lost his mind and gone haywire. He has built an army of his own and is killing off several Viet Cong officials without taking orders from anyone. Colonel Lucas wants Captain Willard to locate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) and kill him. Willard is sent on his mission along with a Navy patrol boat to escort him. Chief Phillips (Albert Hall), Chef Hicks (Frederic Forrest), Lance Johnson (Sam Bottoms) a known surfer, and Clean Miller (Laurence Fishburne) are Captain Willard's only companions on this classified mission. In order to begin their course down the river they first have to infiltrate a Viet Cong outpost so Lt. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his cavalry help them do so. As Captain Willard and his men begin their descent through the river they come across several bases (friendly and enemy) and the further down we go the more chaotic and wild things begin to get.The descent through the Nung River was probably my least favorite part of the film. I enjoyed much more the scenes with Lt. Kilgore and his men that helped them begin their mission. Duvall as Lt. Kilgore steals the movie and he is brilliant in every scene. He is more concerned with surfing than he is with the actual War. It's as if he is living in an alternate reality. This is just a small glimpse of what we are going to see further on in the movie as we encounter different outposts that seem to get weirder every time. Everything is escalating up to the very end and seems to get more and more chaotic thus making the title, Apocalypse Now, very appropriate. This isn't your typical war movie, people are losing their minds and the film becomes more and more surreal and harder to fit into one specific genre. Francis Ford Coppola was at the top of his game during the 70's with The Godfather films and you can see how brilliantly directed the scenes were. The cinematography and lighting was excellent. The reason I don't give this film a higher grade despite admitting it is a memorable and unique movie is because I really wasn't entertained that much with it. It would be hard to watch it again, unless I could just see that first hour with Robert Duvall. The all star cast makes it a little easier to watch: Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Harrison Ford, and Laurence Fishburne.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
argento88,"Jan 30, 2005",10/10,"This is the most ""emotional"" film I have ever watched. I do not mean in the sense that it made me cry for hours, but I meant that it had so much substance to it. The film follows Captain Benjamin Willard as he is sent up a river into Cambodia during the Vietnam war to assassinate a Colonel (who has gone insane). From the very opening scene (which shows a jungle being immersed in napalm) to the very last moment, you are completely engrossed. This film has elements of comedy, violence, gore, and (in the redux version) some nudity. Needless to say, this film has had good reviews and is a very famous war film. It must be said, however, that this film is not for the squeamish. It is not over the top in gore (like the Kill Bill movies) but it does have some very graphic violence in it. This said, I enjoyed the movie very much but don't expect to make any plans on the day you watch it (the redux version is 3 hrs and 20 min long or something like that).I have seen both the original and the redux and thought that both were excellent. People with shorter attention spans probably shouldn't watch the redux version. Nor should they really watch the original either, most of the beauty of the movie will fly over their heads like a 747."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"May 13, 2018",7/10,"'Apocalypse Now (1979)' is a beast of a film. It's an odyssey unlike any other, one that's just as interesting and tumultuous behind-the-scenes as on the screen, and you can almost feel the blood, sweat and tears dripping from every frame, with our protagonist's sanity coming only as close to breaking as Coppola's must have been. The result of the entire ordeal is an experience that's difficult to describe. It has an impact but also lacks a certain something, that intangible connection, that would really make it 'pop', so to speak. It's much easier to appreciate from a technical stand-point than it is from a narrative, as the latter is loose and unfocused while also lacking a real resolution. It may be the lax structure, which doesn't place all that much outward emphasis on character growth or 'plot-points', that leads the ending to feel less like a completion of an arc and more like the fulfilment of an inevitability. Still, there is a compelling exploration of theme occurring here. The way the piece uses its central conflict of Willard and Kurtz, who aren't really at odds but are simply told to be 'enemies', as a way of exploring the wider conflict is subtle but inspired. The story is a very personal one, but moments of Vietnam War examination and commentary seep into the narrative in interesting and unconventional ways. It's these moments that work perhaps the best, with the genuine spectacle combining with the horrors of war to make a comment on the 'validity' of - or Coppola's general feeling towards - the whole situation. When the piece slows down, however, the contemplative tone and harsh, hard-boiled narration can't always keep up with the expectations that have been previously set by vivid montages and brilliant practicality. There is a palpable dread that builds up as we float along the river, though, and eking out the meeting of our hero and his supposed foe is a wise move. When they do meet, their clash is marred slightly by Brando's ill-prepared performance which, while occasionally commanding, is generally not up to par and doesn't meet the admittedly elusive standards set by all the flick's foreshadowing. There's also a sour note when the real slaughter of a water buffalo comes into play, something which Copolla has since tried to downplay. This is an uncomfortable moment that is unfortunately extended and interwoven with a key scene, making for a cringe-inducing finale that honestly plays in pretty poor-taste - even if the contrasting symbolism of the two in-universe events works well. Overall, the film is an engaging and strangely hypnotic one that works when it works but does suffer from slow segments and some areas of discomfort. It is built upon spectacular spectacle and clearly took a lot of time, effort and talent to make. 7/10"
coolinuf,"Jan 24, 2009",1/10,"This movie was just plain bad. I have never reviewed a movie here in my four years of browsing the site, but never in my days of watching movies have I been so infuriated by a film. For starters, the movie just doesn't make any sense. There is no logical transition from scene to scene. As I was watching this movie, I found myself actually TRYING to convince myself that it was good, that at some point during this overdone, self-righteous piece of poo, that some semblance of a theme or motif would come into play. No: The movie continues to lead you down the linear path of the story. I now see where Charlie Sheen inheritted his blank stare acting prowess from that he so consistently displays on a weekly basis in his new sitcom. Well, I guess it is the apocalypse NOW because I've read that Two and a Half Men is the top viewed sitcom on network television. And guess what, this is the 36th ranked FREAKING movie on IMDb. I never thought that a single movie could cause me to never want to watch another movie of the same GENRE. THATS how bad this movie was. 3 hours and 20 minutes of my life, wasted So I thought that, although I normally don't review movies here, why not put in another 2 minutes so maybe, just MAYBE, I could have done some good by watching this movie. That good will be if I can manage to convince even one potential viewer to avoid this overdone pretentious Francis Ford Coppola bullshit. So as far as I'm concerned, IMDb and every movie critic out there has lost all credibility."
PCC0921,"Aug 16, 2022",9/10,"This film is one of the most fantastic war films ever made. The nightmarish scenes, that director Francis Ford Coppola created, are some of the best ever filmed. Add in the riveting, freaky soundtrack by Francis and his father Carmine Coppola and it is a drug-induced entry into the darkness of war from there. All of these factors help enhance the brutal situation that Martin Sheen finds himself, in Apocalypse Now (1979). A tired, drunk, American military officer, Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen), stationed in Vietnam, has to go on a mission to kill a highly decorated officer, Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has lost his mind and gone rogue. He is in this condition obviously due to effects from the war. Willard is escorted on his mission to Cambodia by a group of wet-behind-the-ears soldiers on a small river boat. They also run into a lunatic helicopter officer, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who loves to surf the Vietnam beaches. Before I go further, I also should mention, that I have seen the original, 147 minute, theatrical version of this film many times, however for this review I watched Coppola's 2001, 202 minute long, Apocalypse Now Redux.The use of slow-motion photography, editing and atmospherically generated imagery is uncanny. The utilization of different colors and the use of audio is brilliant. Willard makes his way down the nightmarish Nung River, to locate Kurtz and runs into a nutty photographer (Dennis Hopper), who also has lost his mind. The natives of the area think of Kurtz as something, much like a god. Willard must then figure out what he should or should not do in deciding Kurtz' fate. There is not a single actor, seen with a flaw, in the film. The film does slow down near the end a little, but it really does not take away from the film's overall, brilliant impact. You must see this film in order to see the greatness of Francis Ford Coppola. You also must remember, that Coppola went through his own personal nightmare, while making this film (see Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991). That nightmare is seen as the mood of the film. That mood reflects off the screen Coppola's feelings, which are mixed in with the plight of the characters, making the film perfectly descriptive of the nightmare of war. You also should read up on what Martin Sheen sacrificed for this role. It truly is a film of epic processes in filmmaking.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."

That was the only scene where I was bored.Other then that I was fully engaged on the story.
The cinematography alone is something to marvel at. Every frame looks astounding and well captured.This is truly one of Francis Ford Coppola's greatest films.

thinker1691,"Jan 27, 2009",8/10,"Americans have always won wars which involved great patriotism. World War I and II were global and fought in conjunction with our allies and were eventually brought to successful conclusions. After that, American wars were not successful as the goals and their ultimate purposes were hazy at best. The Viet-Nam war was a case in point. As the film ""Apocalypse Now"" tells it, a 'special opts' soldier, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is selected to travel up-country in Viet-Nam to assassinate or as they put it, 'terminate' the command of Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he is doing something which the pentagon officials have promised the politicians they would not do. This determined American individual is winning the war and doing it with such field tactics and savage methods which in their mind boarder on the criminal. Williard is torn between admiration for his target and conviction for his mission. Along the way, the Captain sees just how insane the Viet-Nam war really is. One commander he meets Lt. Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall) borders on sheer lunacy with statements such as "" I love the smell of Napalm in the morning."" Another individual he meets is a photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) so impressed with Kurtz' ability to win the war, believes him to be not only mystical, but divine. The story is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's book 'Heart of Darkness' where the hero is sent not to kill him, but to save him. However in this adaptation Willard the assassin, who mimicking robot-like soldiers will follow orders regardless how insane those orders are. The great cast includes Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford and Scott Glenn as Lieutenant Colby make this film one of the truly memorable pictures of our time. Winning so many awards, its difficult to tell which aspect of the movie helped make this story a Classic. ****"
christian_fournier,"May 21, 2022",10/10,"I have just watched ""Apocalypse Now Final Cut"" (2hrs 50mn of it) after having watched the original release more than 40 years ago. I must say I have been totally gripped by this so-called Final Cut, released in 2019.I have read quite a number of the viewer's comments & I do not share the opinion of those who do not like the ""Final cut"". For me, this version is - in spite of its length - better than the original release.The obvious reason is that the screenplay of the film is made more powerful by becoming at last understandable! In the original (1979) ""Theatrical release"" there were so many cuts that the progression of the story was almost impossible to fully understand.A more diffuse reason is that this film is not the tale of a ""hit and run"" military operation: it is a journey into the mind of a man who is fascinated by the study of the mind of the man he is sent to execute; the progressive acquaintance of Willard with the file of Kurtz cannot be rushed without depriving the film of some of its meaning.Similarly, the final events in the Montagnard's base under Kurtz command gain considerably by not being rushed: this makes for a deeper comprehension of the sequence.I understand why several reviewers have been made uneasy by the ""Plantation sequence"". Being French, I too was uneasy at the disagreements openly expressed in the Planter's family and the whining about Dien Bien Phu. But, although it might have been handled better, there is a reason why Coppola has included this sequence in the screenplay:
The itinerary of Kurtz has many similarities with that of a number of French officers in the Expeditionary Force who were totally committed to winning the war, up to the point of emulating the tactics of their Vietminh foe - seeking to intimidate by cold blooded cruelty, but also seeking to win hearts and minds by adopting the mores and mindset of the population of their assigned district.This ""Indochinese syndrome"" is exactly what has seized Kurtz, and one can better understand the order to have him killed when one thinks that several French officers of a similarly misguided extreme devotion to their self-defined duty have rebelled later (in Algeria) against their legitimate government! __ ."
anonymous124,"Apr 1, 2006",N/A,"(part of 30 essays I am writing on the 30 greatest films of all time. They are written in no order) I'm not sure if there could possibly be a more fitting title for this film than ""Apocalypse Now."" The famous opening scene shows a line of trees for about a minute as we hear helicopters chop-chopping in and out of the frame. We begin to hear the first notes to The Doors' ""The End"" and as the first words are spoken the entire forest is hit by napalm and bursts into flame silently. Then it fades on one half of the screen to a shot of Martin Sheen's face, and the helicopters are really the ceiling fan? ""And all the children, are insane! All the children...""The first lines spoken in the film is Sheen narrating ""Saigon. (expleteive). I'm still only in Saigon."" He continues to narrate his life story. How he fought in Vietnam, went home. Couldn't stand being away from the jungle. Only word he said to his wife was yes to a divorce. And now he was back here. Still only in Saigon. ""Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker, and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger. Each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter."" Sheen, drunk, tears apart his room and cuts himself punching a mirror. Having fun yet? The next morning he is in luck - HQ gives him a top secret mission up the river into Cambodia, to kill a Green Beret colonel who has lost his mind and commands his soldiers to commit atrocities while they worship him as a king. Willard narrates: ""I was going to the worst place in the world and I didn't even know it yet. Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable - plugged straight into Kurtz. It was no accident that I got to be the caretaker of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory - any more than being back in Saigon was an accident. There is no way to tell his story without telling my own. And if his story really is a confession, then so is mine."" Shoot, who wrote the narration? Because those are pretty classic lines. Make a good Sig but it has to be under a hundred characters. Here's something probably under a 100: ""charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets in the Indy 500."" He is sent up with Chef (Fredrick Forrest), Mr. Clean (a 14 year old Larry Fishburne), Lance (Sam Bottoms) and Chief (Albert Hall), who are all (except Chief) young and inexperienced soldiers. In the films most famous scene, they are chauffeured to the mouth of their river by Robert Duvall and his air Calvary, who bomb a Vietnamese village to clear the area for surfing. The famous detail is that the helicopters are blasting Wagners ""Ride of the Valkeries"" as they attack the village.From there the film descends, one scene after another, into a world of chaotic insanity and madness. One of the most memorable scenes is when they pass the last American outpost on the river. Soldiers carrying suitcases swim into the river desperately, crying out ""take me home!"" When Willard goes onto the crazily lit bridge (we only see his face every time a flare goes up) he asks a soldier who the commanding officer is. The soldier looks horrified and replies ""Aint you?"" Finally, the film reaches the end of the river. Only a couple of the men are left. Men hang from the trees and skulls decorate the sides of the river. Heads and severed limbs and graffiti (one which says ""Apocalypse Now"") cover the ancient temple. The beret, Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) recites poetry and Willard is disturbed to discover the many parallels between him and Kurtz. Kurtz's biggest admirer is ""The Photojournalist"" played by Dennis Hopper, who says things like ""You don't talk to the Colonel. You listen to him...he's a poet-warrior in the classic sense."" This is a stunning film to watch, and what is more stunning I can see this again and again and again and never get bored of it.Original or Redux? There isn't much difference between the two versions. You might want to see Redux for an interesting new way to look at the film (the scenes have been rearranged into a different order) but I would see the original first, which stays closer to the novel on which the film is based, Conrad's Heart of Darkness.""Arresting a man for murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500""...good line."

WaltuhRed,"Oct 25, 2021",9/10,"Apocalypse Now - The best vietnam war movie ever, nothing comes remotely close. This is a very different approach on a war movie, but Coppola executes it flawlessly. Brilliant suspense building, cinematography is great, special effects are some of the best in all of war movies and the performances are amazing. Sheen and Duvall play fit their roles smoothly. Although Marlon Brando has very little screentime, he deliver's an absoulutely mesmerizing performance with some iconic lines.Overall Apocalypse now is one of the best war movies ever.9/10."
dragon-90,"Oct 6, 2003",7/10,"Tortuous anti-war epic that ultimately disappoints despite the fantastic cinematography and superb overall production. The performances by Robert Duvall (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor) and Marlon Brando, meant to be highlights, only reduce the picture's gritty realism and lose the viewer's interest with overly dramatized performances and, with Brando, at times unintelligible dialogue.What saves the film, and makes it great, is the narrated journey of Captain Willard up the Mekong and into the dark reaches of Indo-China. Martin Sheen gives a tremendous performance as the super-serious unofficial operative Willard whose mission is to seek out the mutinous Colonel Kurtz (Brando), creator of a dysfunctional Shangri-La deep in the jungle. Plenty of action and more than one bizarre sojourn (particularly in the less edited Redux version) greet Willard and his riverboat crew of war movie personalities--wonderfully performed by all including a very young Laurence Fishburne as the gunner's mate, ""Mr. Clean.""Together they traverse through all the ironies and confusing realities of warfare and keep you on the edge of your seat. Once on land, however, the movie bogs down into a badly scripted climax between Willard and Kurtz.Definitely worth watching only give yourself enough time to appreciate the pacing and by all means, don't worry if you never see the end!"
videorama-759-859391,"Dec 17, 2014",9/10,"Here's that offbeat Vietnam Coppola masterpiece, with the whop whop whopping sound of choppers cutting the air. Unlike a few Vietnam films, this one is plot driven, and I must say, the story is an original. It's the journey there that makes the film, as well as the fantastic performances, all round, notably Sheen and wildcat Frederick Forrest, although of course it's Duvall as the gung ho Lieutenant, spouting that film's famous line, who steals their thunder, before a couple of bombings happen behind him, where he hardly flinches. Is this guy invincible or what? It's the most memorable part of the film. Sheen plays a Colonel, who's been to Vietnam and back, where he's back in Vietnam, positioned at Saigon. He's summoned on a mission, to find an outstanding Colonel, Kurtz (Brando, giving us an enigmatic character in an unbelievably masterful piece of acting) and terminate (kill) him. Sheen must travel up the river, of course, through the likelihoods of attacks. It's the first Vietnam film I've seen, that features soldier surfing. Did they really do this? It seems surreal, but as a Vietnam pic, it's very real. Hopper, a bloody unappreciated actor, so much so, it's criminal, is unforgettably brilliant as Brando's master and protector who gives us that wonderful monologue, while talking to a caged Sheen, where it's fates being decided. The script is top notch. If ever getting a chance, read itr, it's brilliant. Sheen's tired, wearied voice so much suits the role, from which Harvey Keitel, was originally cast, but just wasn't delivering the goods. Even great actors have their flaws, as even I was dropped from a short movie once. The playboy bunnies that came to visit the troops, via helicopter of course (check out one of Frederick Forest's requests) is beautifully shot. As for the Redux I prefer the original, as it did stall the story, as with the French family, the movie didn't benefit from it all, as this bit, didn't maintain interest, and wasn't warranted. We as an audience, didn't really need to be informed about this. As for gore, it's very restrained, only occasional, but there is that sick, and little disturbing scene near the end, involving a goat being sliced up. Forever a Vietnam masterpiece, AN is an ambitious and larger than life Vietnam film, crafted by a masterful director, whose got unforgettable performances out of his actors, in a brilliant choice of casting. But AN is brilliant, in about everything. What's also unforgettable is the state of that shrimp, before Willard treks off on his mission, to terminate a man, who's mind has flipped one too many switches. Willard does have the choice of roast beef too."
shilohmedia,"Mar 25, 2021",10/10,"The levels of genius in this film is hard to rate or put into words. In simple terms, this is the greatest war movie ever made. I would even rate it as one of the best movies ever made in general."
williampsamuel,"Dec 6, 2014",10/10,"I feel that I have gazed into the abyss, and that the abyss has gazed into me, for I have experienced Apocalypse Now. Sheer unremitting madness is what it is about, and madness is the form that it takes for much of its runtime. Coppola has taken the classic Heart of Darkness, crossed it with Herzog's Aguirre, The Wrath of God, and set it against the madness of the Vietnam War to produce a film that is darker, more disturbing, and perhaps more profound as any I have ever seen. Watching this, you will see the face of true horror, and you will be changed.For any who do not know the story, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) must travel far upriver into Cambodia to confront and eliminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlin Brando) a once ideal soldier who has gone rogue and is presumed to be completely insane. And on his journey he will see more darkness than he could have imagined, and discover that the truth is far worse than any had believed.Since this is a movie review, I suppose I should comment on the acting, production values, etc. They are excellent. The sets and jungle locations are gorgeous. The battle scenes, especially the airborne assault, are among the best Hollywood has ever produced, with massive scale, incredible camera work, and pyrotechnics that would be the envy of Michal Bey. And the cinematography has lent much of the film an otherworldly feel, like the most horrifying acid trip possible.The acting is likewise excellent. Sheen's performance as the haggard, mentally exhausted, and increasingly disturbed Captain Willard has changed my entire opinion of him as an actor. His haunting narration sets the tone for the entire film, and his eyes speak volumes in every scene. They tell the story of a man who thought he had seen it all, only to discover that he was horribly wrong. And Brando, despite having relatively little time on screen, is truly unforgettable. He is the very essence of a man who is profoundly unwell, and utterly detached from sanity.And that is what Apocalypse Now is all about, the retreat from any semblance of sanity. On the journey upriver, we are confronted with madness of every form and color. There is the blood-lust and near suicidal bravado of Kilgore (Robert Duval) who lives and breathes war, and simply does not give a damn about his personal safety. It takes someone more than a bit off to go surfing as enemy bullets are ripping overhead or to remark that napalm ""smells like victory."" There's the utter detachment of Dennis Hopper's photojournalist, who seems to float along in a state of perpetual high, mistaking the madness of others for true wisdom. And the sheer idiocy of Lance, who drops acid in the midst NVA invested territory, and who yells 'Look guys, purple haze"" as he envelopes his own boat in thick clouds of colored smoke, never mind that they're on an uncharted stretch of river deep in Cambodia.And there's the more generalized kind of madness that pervaded the whole war. The madness of forcibly moving entire populations in the hope that they would be grateful to us for protecting them. The madness of rebuilding a bridge every day and defending it against attack every night, just so the generals can say the road is open, casualties be damned! Or the madness of sending high strung, inexperienced, dope smoking kids on a sensitive dangerous mission. Other than Willard and possibly the skipper, no-one on that boat had any business being in a war zone.But all of this pales in comparison to the sheer insanity of Colonel Kurtz. He is a man who has decided that not only do the ends justify the means, but that only the most horrifying means will achieve those ends. He has absorbed every ounce of the madness he's encountered, he has fully embraced that madness, and he has been transformed into a fount of madness, spewing forth pure horror and infecting everything it touches. The truly scary thing is that even half dead; rarely stepping out of his quarters, Kurtz still wields more absolute power than any man ever should. His madness is mistaken for divinity by followers who will commit any act for him. He's like an aged Charles Manson, with an entire tribe of true believers rather than a handful of dropouts.Even scarier is that on one level he's right. By embracing the horrors of war, he and his people have done more damage to the enemy than any comparable force. If we'd had ten divisions of troops as ruthless as his, we could have destroyed the Cong and the NVA, but only at the cost of our souls. And yet in his rare moments of lucidity, Kurt knows and understands that what he has done is completely beyond the pale of decency or civilized humanity. Deep down, he hates what he is doing and what he has become. He no longer fears death but craves it, because it is the only escape from the nightmare he has created. His only wish is others may understand what happened to him and why he became what he did.And I do. I cannot condone, excuse, or forgive any of what he has done, but I understand. And seeing this film for yourself, perhaps you will too. I cannot lie. This movie is dark, frightening, and at times downright depressing. But it is magnificent. If you have the fortitude to gaze into the jaws of insanity, you owe it to yourself to watch Apocalypse Now."
rs-ughc,"May 19, 2014",10/10,"One of the best movies ever created. It's amazing how Mr. Coppola could create pictures on such epic levels. Apocalypse Now is definitely one of the top 10 movies of all time. A Classic. Excellent story, combined with amazing direction and cinematography, audio visual... perfection.As a Film Maker I highly recommend the documentary called Heart of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse. It's about what went into the making of Apocalypse Now. All the problems Mr. Coppola faced from studios, to actors. Even replacing a well known lead actor after filming had already started.

MojoVGB,"Jan 22, 2020",N/A,Apocalypse Now is absolutely phenomenal. Not only is the plot wildly interesting and it's characters perfect for character studies but it is also a visual masterpiece. Colors are blended studiously to create a mind-blowing experience for the viewer. Can't wait to watch the Redux version in the coming future.
gbill-74877,"Sep 15, 2024",7/10,"""This is the way the fucking world ends.""America trying to come to terms with having lost the Vietnam war and a bit of its soul in the process, Francis Ford Coppola's vision for the experience is mapped onto Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but also feels like a surreal nightmare journey into Dante's nine circles of hell, accompanied by film noir like narration. You may also get the feeling of Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo (1982) here, both in the harrowing voyage and the maniacal way the film was made amidst all sorts of trials and tribulations.From the beginning we're hit with beautiful, discordant, disturbing imagery: announcements over loudspeakers to locals that ""we are your friends"" while women and children lay dead on the ground with ""death cards"" callously tossed on their bodies, so that ""Charlie will know who did this."" A prayer being offered with devastation in the background and a cow being airlifted by a helicopter. An American officer offering a wounded North Vietnamese soldier some water until he's distracted by one of the soldiers who's arrived being a well-known surfer. The cinematography and the general feeling of absolute madness is the film's greatest strengths.I can't say that I saw this as the best films of all time, however, or even one of the best war films either. For one thing, the discombobulated state of the American military is slathered on far too thick to be realistic. In fairness, to be dreamlike and surreal was a conscious choice, and the film is more poetry than prose, but I thought it went too far in its journey up the river. We get surfing during a bombing, a strip show, playboy bunnies, water skiing on the river, and a soldier on acid with a puppy in his jacket ffs. We come across an outpost whose commanding officer was killed, and now its soldiers scurry about as if they're in an insane asylum, completely directionless, like a lost tribe. We get ditzy playmates who allow the soldiers to take turns with them without a care in the world; as with the French woman at the plantation, the women in this film exist to bare their big boobs, in case the viewer wants some sex to go along with the violence. We get another leaderless outpost, shrouded in a surreal haze, firing into the night. And then of course we get the rogue colonel, with his bizarre cult like following in the jungle.Another issue is perspective and the treatment of the Vietnamese by the film. We hear how intelligent they are a couple times, but we almost never see them as people, or their perspective. You could excuse some of that as this being an American film coping with the terrible decisions of its leaders that led to a prolonged war and massive number of casualties, but when it's coupled with a Heart of Darkness story line and the native people are shown as primitives, worshipping the rogue officer as if he's a god, it's too much. This officer tells a story of the Vietcong cutting off the arms of their own children who've received a Western polio vaccine; they go through a ritualized killing of a water buffalo (and beware, a real animal was butchered); they bow down like the natives in King Kong to the man who kills their deity. While the film has Heart of Darkness as its template, I'm not sure it really understood or communicated the message from that work.Along those lines, I'm not sure it's quite as antiwar as its reputation. There is a fair degree of macho posturing in Robert Duvall's character, who seems nearly insane, but also struts around unphased in his cowboy hat as shells explode nearby, after his helicopters have done their thing to the soaring music of Wagner. Similarly, while we may recoil from Kurtz (even if Brando's performance was too sleepy) he's far from condemned - in fact, it's as if he's achieved some higher plane of enlightenment through embracing the necessity of cruelty in war. The ""crazy"" officer is the only one who's good at his job. If only we had more discipline in our leadership and in our soldiers, the film seems to say, we could have won the war. This sentiment, ""you can win if it you want to,"" is expressed in that interminable scene at the French plantation, where a version of history is doled out in a heavy-handed way, and by Kurtz when he says ""We need fewer men, and better; if they were committed, this war could be won with a fourth of our present force.""This nightmarish fever dream of the American experience in Vietnam all leads up to a rather anticlimactic ending, which was a letdown for a 202 minute film (I saw the Redux version). I'm not even sure mapping the American experience in Vietnam to Heart of Darkness was the best decision, but regardless, there is a certain lack of cohesion in what should have been a simple story. However, I have to say, the film made me think an awful lot about what it was trying accomplish, the visuals are astonishing, and through its imagery it captures a sense of the insanity of war."
rw266,"Dec 7, 2014",10/10,"A brilliant piece of film making that shows just one thin fictional slice of that disaster.Most Vietnam Vets I have talked to either loved it or hated it depending on their personal experiences and their IQ.This film is a not a documentary but it captures the total insanity of that war.

james-forrest,"Dec 24, 2007",1/10,"Well, after watching Full Metal Jacket and seeing the high rating here on a movie on a similar topic, i decided to sit through AN: Redux. What a mistake i had made.I really expected to get my socks blown off with its rating here on IMDb, it even got to the point where I was making things out to be better than they really were...thinking- the people on IMDb must know what they are talking about! By the end of the movie seeing Sheen's blank expression for the billionith time...ugh! How can you guys say this guy nailed the role perfectly and compliment his acting, he doesn't have much to nail or act! There are other comments here which i disagree with. Such as, the opinions of time-less lines ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"" Zomg! Classic! ""The horror...the horror"". Wow! The last parts bordering on Art? What the hell? Um. No. Bad movie guys. I really do want my time back on this one. How some users can call this the best movie of all time is beyond me. Each to their own i guess."
Jcombat,"Jul 2, 2006",9/10,"First of all, I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"", the book that was the literary basis for the movie. With that said, I believe that this movie is astounding. It is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict, but more the psychological toll that it took on the young, inexperienced ""kids"" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making, using many visuals to help tell the story. The acting I felt was definitely all-around up to par. Marlon Brando's part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting. His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film reels you in, and reveals the hollowness of a man that you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie. Those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film, because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculptured and best-made films of all time."
CriticalHilarity,"Sep 17, 2020",10/10,"This is the film all other war movies must contend with. What it doesn't provide on the comedic scale (it provides understated scenes at best), it does provide in sardonic visual commentary treats, like Francis Ford Coppola's appearance as a TV journalist directing scenes (as if for a reflexively ambitious Coppola movie).Kurtz, Marlon Brando's character taken from the original story of his namesake (Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness), is alone the tour de force in this film. Without Brando, there is no forte allegro to this masterpiece, just as without the protagonist, Captain Willard, there is no hypnotic narrative.But it's the commentary that is so stinging in this film. Far from rallying for peace, the film reveals the underbelly of how the world works, and why Vietnam is ""unwinnable"" at its core, as well as providing stunning understated hints as to why.For dramatic sweep, musical and cinematographic vision, and method acting at its finest in probably the last real method acting masterpiece, this move alone justifies the digitization of classic films, but then again, Sunset Boulevard or M already does that. Okay, so as far as 1970s films go, AN is in the top 10 films in a decade that made the top 80 out of a hundred or so timeless classics that give more than they take from (or in some cases, kill in) the viewer.This happens to be the only film with my express permission (including the film, The Doors), to use hit tracks from the Doors official catalog."
JLJH89,"Aug 11, 2004",10/10,"I'm almost embarrassed that as a big movie fan I had not seen this title sooner so I finally rented it and decided to see what it was all about. I went into it expecting a good film as just about all of Coppola's are but what I found was an incredible experience that takes you straight into the hearts and minds of the actors. I think the two keys to the film's success in the sense of pulling the viewer in is its acting and the cinematography.Firstly, the cinematography is absolutely masterful and shows Coppola's supreme understanding of the camera. The shots which I was most enthralled with were the POV shots from the boat is which as the viewer you would feel like you were on the boat, being pushed through the smoke and humidity. At times I almost felt as if I was on a theme park ride, something like Universal's Jurrasic Park ride, it gave that much of a feeling of putting you in the point of view of the actors and their situations. I also liked his use of rack focus shots where during conversations he would use the technique rather then adding more unnecessary cuts. Really a supreme example of cinematographic mastery.Secondly, the acting was outright incredible, Martin Sheen completely played his roll down to the nuances and was backed up by a seamless cast pinnacling with Marlon Brando. Definitely felt for them to the point where when they greeted someone, I almost nodded my head with them. This could only have happened through the superb acting and cinematographic POV. Definitely one of the great films up there with the Godfathers!"
one9eighty,"Nov 2, 2022",9/10,"Martin Sheen is Captain Benjamin L. Willard, an alcoholic soldier holed up in a sleazy hotel with his hallucinations of the war to keep him company. He receives new orders to find and kill Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has gone AWOL in the Cambodian jungle. Kurtz is a decorated military hero who has excelled in the dirty work that others have failed at or just avoided. The top brass in the military has become fearful of Kurtz because he has gone rogue doing his own thing, and the military fear his past and his potential. He has inspired a breakaway guerrilla militia - and is being idolised like a living deity. Captain Willard and his small team begin the journey to find him, sometimes aided along the way, but quite often hindered just as much too. The road, or in this case, the river, is long, and it is not going to be a smooth journey to fulfil the orders he has been given. Captain Willard and his small team begin the journey to find him, sometimes aided along the way, but quite often hindered just as much too. The road, or in this case, the river, is long, and it is not going to be a smooth journey to fulfil the orders he has been given.Based on Joseph Conrad's boo, ""The Heart of Darkness"", Francis Ford Coppola and John Millius set about converting the original story into one more relevant to recent events for them. Instead of the plot being based in Africa, it is centered on the Vietnam War. Carmine Coppola's eerie and sometimes hypnotic score really compliments the cinematography that Vittorio Storaro brings. The end result is something that some people find challenging while other feel enlightened. Either way the film was a massive success with plenty of awards and recognition - some people still have ""Apocalypse Now"" in their ""Top 10 Films of all-time"" lists, and that's despite the film being over 40 years old now.There are a lot of household Hollywood names acting in this film, some in plain sight and obvious, so not as much - Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, R. Lee Emery, & Robert Duvall. But don't worry too much about the names though, because the film is littered with gritty and authentic performances throughout. The stand out's here though are Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando. Sheen carries the film throughout, not just the face the audience follows but the narrator that moves the story on too. He does really well in transitioning from the broken soldier, to the machine that's just ""doing his job"" without letting emotions interfere. He then goes through various other transitions before seeing the reality of war and being horrified by what he's part of.Much has been made of Brando's performance in this film. Some documentaries and commentaries say unhinged, some say brilliant. Considering he only has a small part in the film, something about his performance stands out and sends shivers down my spine. I'm not sure if it's because we have been part of Willard's journey, obsessively searching for Kurtz, and when we eventually find him after going through so much madness along the way, he's just human after all. But then the longer we spend in his presence, the more we see a character that is out-of-bounds mentally, spiritually, and physically. Considering the small amount of screen time, Brando brings real presence to the screen, and Francis Ford Coppola manages to work with that well by putting him shadowy situations where you can't quite see him and are forced to listen extra carefully to interpret the mumbled dialogue.The could have been... Steve McQueen was Francis Ford Coppola's first choice to play Willard, but he didn't want to leave America for the shooting period - and he was too expensive. Al Pacino was offered the role having worked with the director before, he declined because he feared getting ill like he had done in the Dominican Republic while shooting ""The Godfather Part 2"". Other people that were offered parts, or declined parts include: Harvey Keitel, James Caan, Gene Hackman, Clint Eastwood, Nick Nolte, Tommy Lee Jones, Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford... the list is massive, not just in the acting stakes, but all around, for example - George Lucas was nearly the director. He got the green light for ""Star Wars"" though and decided against this.In many ways this film nearly broke Coppola, and the cast too. But the level of pain experienced feels like it dropped through into the celluloid that audiences got treated to. There have been plenty of stories about the problems that making this film created, and there are some great documentaries of behind the scenes. If I was to call out one it would be ""Heart of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"" (1991) by Eleanor Coppola, George Hickenlooper, and Fax Bahr.""Apocalypse Now"" is challenging and at time psychedelic and even painful to endure. It is not something that everybody will enjoy it, but for those who do, there is plenty of room for your own interpretation of what is unfolding. I once read a review of it that likened Willard journey to that which may be experienced if descending Dante's ""Inferno"" and experiencing the different levels of Hell. Each step along the way brings with it more and more horror and depravity, before finally the gates of Hell are opened - or in this case the canoes that guard Kurtz's temple part, so that Willard can go into the heart of darkness. That's kind of my interpretation of what happens at the end too, Willard is reborn when he comes out of the water at the end, he embraces evil as a c hanged man and takes the heart of darkness from Kuntz for himself.If you haven't seen ""Apocalypse Now"", my advice is start with the original version. The ""Redux"" does add more to the film but not all of it is essential in my opinion. It's more something that hardcore fans of the film may want to try out."
noroomforyouth,"Mar 16, 2005",10/10,"This is by far the best war movie to have come out yet. As the story progresses you become more engrossed in what is happening to Captian Willard and the crew. The Viewer doesn't feel detached but rather engulfed in the insanity and decreasing mental stability of the men caught up in Vietnam. It also blends images, music, and moods well not to mention has great special effects that look like the movie was filmed during the war. Redux version offers us a little more into the characters. One of my favorite lines in Redux is when the crew asks Willard if he likes it hot while ditching the air cavalry. He replies by saying "" it's sure as ---- better than seeing what you can become in some factory in Ohio."" Willards journey into the jungle makes him start realizing how Kurtz the renegade colonel has been affected by the war into what seems like insanity but is clarity. "" Never get off the boat. Kurtz got off the boat, he split from the whole program."" Apocalypse now never gets old and each time you see it you delve deeper into the jungle."
Old Joe,"Oct 8, 2003",N/A,"Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now' is one of the most controversial movies that our world has been privileged to see. I have heard many rumours about what happened on the set of this film, causing many problems, but I believe that does not distract from how good a movie I think it is. But I warn you, Apocalypse' has a very long and confusing story that might make it hard for you to appreciate what Coppola was trying to show. There have been many war movies made by Hollywood, but none are quite like this.Nominated for 8 academy awards, Apocalypse Now tracks the journey of Captain Willard, a US Army intelligence officer sent on a hazardous mission up river in Cambodia to terminate with extreme prejudice' an American renegade, a colonel named Kurtz' who has spun out of control (and out of his mind!), in a remote jungle compound.Apocalypse Now was really well made by Francis Ford Coppola (as director, producer and screenwriter). Coppola had many moments in the film where he wanted to say something and that is what he did. I love the way he shot the war scenes in this film, as they were not only very dramatic, but also very funny as well. I am certain that he was trying to deliberately show the irony of war', a real highlight of the film.Helping Coppola write the film's screenplay were Michael Herr and John Millus. They all did a fantastic job, incorporating the mind-boggling story of Hearts of Darkness', by adventurer Joseph Conrad. It is my view that this story, while being hard story to understand, is important for people to learn about. All the writers did with this story was replace the trip up the Congo Marlow has in the HOD' story, with the river trip thorough Cambodia for Captain Willard and his crew. Some people could criticise this movie's story, saying that Coppola used it for his own convenience. However I think it is good to try and learn about an old story, in a modern kind of way, in a story that has undoubtedly affected our world, for many years now.This movie shows many characters that have gone mad (or indeed are about too end up that way!). Its main star is Willard (Martin Sheen), the captain that is given the unenviable task of trying to find the ex-army colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). While Sheen was good in certain parts of his role, I must say that I found Willard to be a very mysterious character that lacked in dialogue. For me, this made him very hard to like.A lot has been said about the small role taken on by legendary actor Marlon Brando. He might have been paid one million dollars for the performance, but he does show he was the right person for the job. I believe Brando comes across perfectly as this army colonel, gone insane. When Brando says The horror, the horror', it brought back some fond memories of the HOD' story for me. It is also funny to see the Photojournalist (Dennis Hopper), who is a really strange guy, harassing Willard when he finally finds Kurtz at his jungle hideaway. This character is another man that could be considered crazy', as all his actions signal that to me.The other cast members in the film take a lot less of the limelight in the film, as that is how the story wants them to be. But they still do have an impact at certain times of the movie. At the beginning of the film we meet a few officials that give Willard his mission. One of them is a Colonel (a very young Harrison Ford). Then on the boat that is helping take Willard on his mission through the Cambodian river are Chef (Frederic Forrest), Chief (Albert Hall), the boat driver, Lance (Sam Bottoms) who has a disturbing death scenes, and Clean (an almost unrecognisable Laurence Fishburne), whose death is much more dignified than that of the chief.When we see the war zone in Vietnam for the first time, we meet a most unusual personality, Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall). The scene with the Kilgore in it at the earlier stage of the movie, is truly great, as we see the war going on around him (with no shirt on mind you), but what is even more amazing is that he tells his officers around him, it is ok to surf, get out there or fight'. Now in any normal war film, that would be the last thing on anyone's mind, let alone an order from a top ranking official.However, the most disturbing scene in the film happens when the navy boat crew stops, suspicious about the occupants of a Vietnamese boat. The massacre that follows is very hard to watch, but it does show what can happen, when men are trained to fight and kill in war. Willard as Captain shows absolutely no compassion to these people at all.I am not worried if there are people out there that hate this movie, but I hope you at least gave it a chance before feeling that way. I hope that in some way my review has given you an insight into what the film is about. I must reiterate that this film has an historical story attached to it. If you are a fan of literature, I can only recommend you read the Hearts of darkness' story, but be ready for heavy bit of reading. If this movie gets a bit heavy for you, keep reminding yourself what it is trying to show - Captain Willard and his mission, which is to find this brilliant army colonel that has gone completely mad and kill him. This is a brilliantly made film, with a remarkable story, cast and direction. I can only recommend you that you see it.CMRS gives Apocalypse Now': 4.5 (Very Good  Brilliant Film)"
jcanettis,"Oct 17, 2005",10/10,"It is difficult for me to write a comment for ""Apocalypse Now"". The numerous reviews that have been made by prestigious critics and experts about this monumental film since its release, make my comments seem a bit redundant. Nevertheless, I strongly feel obliged to submit some thoughts about this fantastic movie.First of all, I subscribe to the view expressed by many, that ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of the best films in the history of cinema. It combines many things: Drama, action, emotions, art, mysticism, scenery, philosophy, are some elements that come in mind when one talks about ""AN"". In fact, there are so many angles that this film can been seen through, that it is nearly impossible to categorize it: Is it a war film? Is it a philosophical one? Is it an art movie? ""AN"" partially fits in lots of categories, and doesn't fully fit in any one of them at the same time...Under the masterful direction of Coppola, ""AN"" recounts the story of Capt. Willard (Sheen), who while serving in Vietnam, is ordered to carry out a rather unconventional mission: He must find and ""terminate"" Col. Kurz (Brando), an erstwhile brilliant officer, who has now gone insane; Kurz has gathered a private ""army"" by locals who worship him like a god, and he has disappeared with them somewhere in Cambodia. Willard begins his journey with a handful of accompanying sailors, and during their voyage they encounter several surreal situations. Moreover, Willard, who is in the border of insanity himself, studies the file of Kurz and starts to deeply admire the man. What will happen when he finally meets him?I wouldn't need here to say anything about the breath-taking performances of Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando, as they are the point of reference for many drama classes. I would only like to add that ALL the performances in ""AN"", are worthy of the film's status.There many things to be said about ""AN"", and as I explained in the beginning, if someone wants to explore further, there are several sources to look at. The only thing I would like to add here before concluding is that this is a film which will never lose its beauty, no matter how many years pass. 10/10."
Slobo91,"Jan 5, 2007",7/10,"Apocalypse Now is a pretty good movie for the first half, but the second half of the movie turns really weird and confusing. The acting is A+++ and the suspense is great. Its just ashame the second half of the movie isn't so good as the first half. The cast is awesome with Hollywood's best legends including: Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen (Charlie Sheens father. The viewer of this movie will like it very much during the beginning but as they keep watching it as it goes further and further into the movie the viewer will be disappointed. There are also some pretty good action scenes where the American army comes in with helicopters into Vietnamese territory and let hell loose.Not a bad movie. My score: 7/10"
Kaepora_Gaebora,"Feb 11, 2002",10/10,"Saw this, mr. Coppola's classic Vietnam movie, just yesterday. I expected an ordinary war movie, with all it's stereotypes and macho characters doing macho stuff in a macho war, and got a brilliant, at times surrealistic, journey into the madness and chaos of the pressured human mind. Highly recommended for everyone who likes really good movies."
spiderfriend,"Aug 26, 2022",10/10,With the entire film intact so many of the ambiguities that made the original release seem uneven are smoothed out. Every scene is a work of art. This is cinema on the grandest of scales.
Danni2009,"Dec 7, 2003",9/10,"This was more diverse though times seem slow but more DISTURBING! Well,the movie based on Oscar award original added footage though not reallysignificant, still made more of a diverse dimension, thus more likely howrealistically disturbing bizarre, Vietnam war was. The complaints of the playboy bunnies added footage was typical of a USO Bob Hope Entertainment gavemore moral boost to an already downtrodden depressed US troops felt hung out to dry, by US Gov. since the USA was so divided over Vietnam, seemed more ofa political war at expense of American troops, lost the war to the communists anyway.

hitchcockthelegend,"Jul 24, 2011",9/10,"Apocalypse Now is directed by Francis Ford Coppola who also co-adapts the screenplay with John Milius from Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad. It stars Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms and Albert Hall. Cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro and the music is primarily arranged by Carmine Coppola.The Vietnam War and Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) is approached by American intelligence to go on a secret assignment: he's to follow the Nung River into the remote Cambodian jungle to find and assassinate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a member of the US Army Special Forces who has gone insane.One of the most talked and written about films of all time, Apocalypse Now remains to this day a harrowing and haunting experience to first time viewers. With a production shoot that has in itself become legendary, Coppola's flawed masterpiece has been dissected and argued over to within an inch of its magnificent life. People will continue to write about it for ever more it seems, perhaps there might even be the odd new confrontational spin on what resides within? But ultimately it's what the individual takes away from the film that matters, our own interpretations key to the enjoyment of such a disturbing vision of war and violence.Many of the set-pieces, dialogue and characters have long since passed into folklore, and rightly so. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter assault, Kurtz's surreal death camp, the boat people massacre, purple haze, the playmates, Kilgore, and of course the horror, the horror..indeed. The performances match the quality of Storaro's sumptuous Philippines photography, Sheen is fiercely committed and Duvall and Hopper in turn are powerhouse and edgy. While Brando, doing his own bizzaro thing in the last third, brings a little chaos unintentionally in keeping with the madness at the heart of this particular darkness.Personally that last draggy third does stop it from being a complete genius type whole, but everything up to it is so damn good it's arguably churlish to expect perfection? But as near perfection movies go, Apocalypse Now proudly sits with the best of them, sitting there with a harrowed look upon its face. 9/10"
lolique,"Oct 5, 2001",10/10,"Let me first state that I consider ""Apocalypse Now"" in my top 5 best films of all times and the botched, bloated Redux version will not change my opinion. When I first saw the film it was more than just a motion picture, it was a horrifying exploration into the Vietnam war and just like Coppola has stated that it ""was not a film about the Vietnam war, but the Vietnam war"", the picture gripped me more than any before or any after. It is truly a film masterpiece in every respect. Unfortunately the new Redux version is something else. First of all, it incorporates three sequences (the Playboy bunnies in a stranded helicopter, the French plantation and its strange ghost-like characters and the ridiculous scene of Kurtz reading paragraphs from Time magazine to a tied-up Willard), which should have remained in their natural habitat: the cutting-room floor. The rest of the film is a strange mixture of scenes successfully extended to give more insight into the characters, or the excellent dissolve montage at the beginning with the ceiling fan, the stealing of Colonel Kilgore's surfing board, the expansion of Kurtz's dialogue near the end where he comes in and out of shadows, but gone is the tight and to the point editing that turned this river journey from a terrifying and gripping nightmare into a milk run or travelogue more suited for the Discovery or History Channels. They should have followed Willard's advice after the tiger incident: ""don't ever get off the boat again"". One scene in special comes to mind: the one where they open fire on the innocent Vietnamese on the boat that they meet in the river. In the original version this scene came at a moment that the tension in the film was so high that the gunner's reaction was totally motivated and came about as a release to the nervous tension that had everyone in the boat on the edge of insanity. In the new version the killing becomes just a senseless massacre without any motivation at all. And there are many other instances just like it, but hard to pin down from seeing this version only once. Also, the absence of the original ending is a big disappointment. Anyhow, it is sad to see that even with 22 years of hindsight, Coppola still doesn't have the necessary objectivity to manipulate his material again. A prettier, larger package doesn't necessarily make a better film."
c_hookham,"Aug 28, 2003",10/10,"Loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness' This is a stunning,disturbing and even sometimes humorous look at the insanity of war and mankind's dark side. As well as being one of the greatest war films ever made it is also a study of insanity similar to 'Aguirre Wrath of God' (1973) and is one of only about 3 films that totally stunned me when I first saw it. Brilliantly staged and both chilling and memorizing it delivers amazing action and characters where we we see the animal that lurks in all of us and, in Kilgore in particular, we see the ultimate human insanity: the fact that we deep down enjoy killing and destruction."
claudonio,"Nov 8, 2000",7/10,"""Apocalypse Now"" in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all time. It is not a bad movie but it is not a great one either. I kept waiting for this film to climax, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. I liked a few of the attack sequences and the cinematography but other than that, nothing. I just don't get what is so great about this film."
Dainius8888,"Jul 18, 2011",7/10,"''Apocalypse now'' has two versions. The original, which was out in 1979 and the Redux version from 2001, which extends the whole picture by approximately 49 minutes of cut out footage. So let it make it perfectly clear. I am reviewing the REDUX version and NOT the original, which, in my opinion, is outstanding and MUCH better than this pointless waste of effort. Now. Every technical element from the picture such as sound effects, original soundtracks, camera quality IS actually as decent as from the original, perhaps even better. But this is not actually important, is it now. I mean, you most certainly do not want to watch an extended version of ''Apocalypse Now'' just for a 'smoother' result, now do you. The main point of this new version was to get to see the movie completely uncut, to view the original with all it's cut out footage. And that, dear friends, is an absolute let down. The majority of the new footage is mostly simply pointless and boring to watch. In fact these missing scenes are SO dull, that they actually cast a sort of a shadow on the original movie in this version, thus making the whole 3 hours and 16 minutes of this film look weak and frustrating to sit through. Never have I been so disappointed in an extended version of a great film.NOT Recommended. It's pointless, TOO LONG, and boring. And if you already saw the original, you can just see it once more. It is definitely better than watching this extended version, which, in conclusion, is A WASTE OF OVER 3 HOURS."
showtime22282,"Oct 11, 2006",1/10,"This movie was filled with melodramatic acting, bad humor, horrible character development, no action, sub-par editing, awful music, and oh yes the Redux version is over 3 hrs long! I loathe this film, and will never understand its appeal. Come to think of it I'll never understand the appeal for the Godfather either. Give me Goodfellas any day. I think Francis Coppola is the most over rated Writer/Director of all time. Give me Robert Zemickis or Steven Spielberg and I'll be a happy little boy. Whatever ""it"" is that people see in his movies I will never understand. You know what I think... It was the 70's and everyone was on drugs. That must be the reason why everything was so weird. I know people are gonna respond to this and say ""You just didn't get it."" I got it. I got the whole stupid movie. And I thought it stunk."
keith-264,"Mar 10, 2004",10/10,"HEALTH WARNING: comments reflect the film in toto if you need not to know the end don't read on.                               I find this film to be a commentary on the dispute between Conrad-who set a meditation on the void at the heart of European society-in Africa and Achebe who found this an affront for the same reason; the Africa of the story is rather distant and the Africans shadows in the distance. Not only do the Europeans nick the continent off its rightful owners but they don't even give the locals a cameo appearance! This is reflected in the film where Vietnamese people exist to get shot or fall for Kurtz's not so crypto-fascism. By the last third of the film the action is in Willard's head-will he join Kurtz like Colby the first assassin-or do the suits' dirty work. He does neither-killing Kurtz allows Kurtz to expiate his sins and release the locals from their false God at the same time releasing Willard from his dependence on the suits for a ""mission"". By killing Kurtz Willard confronts his heart of darkness gaining the possibility to become older and wiser."
nomoons11,"Apr 6, 2010",10/10,"I saw this one some time ago and it's a film that you can never forget. Sure it's about War and Vietnam and all that went along with it but what I got from it was the sanity that these guys had, and lost.I could be lambasted for saying this but I surely loved the Redux version of this one. Anything added to it was fine by me (please release the Blu-Ray redux version Mr. Coppola, I'd actually buy it). What an amazing film. All I can say is if you've never had the pleasure of seeing this one, do this...grab a drink, start watching it at around 1 in the morn and be prepared to be mellowed out for the next 3 hours. This film is what a real ""movie experience"" is all about."
Offworld_Colony,"Feb 7, 2020",10/10,"It was surprising, shocking, frightening and hypnotic; I was amazed that the film played out completely different to how I remembered it. It really is a masterclass on delivering something esoteric and meaningful and really the quintessential (as it should be) journey into the Heat of Darkness, and yet also still utterly and completely a movie, and not an experiment or a passion piece so awkward as to not be able to enjoy it just as a movie. It strikes a perfect equilibrium and harmony with its message, cultural zeitgeist, its creators (Milius and Coppola), and its inspired material.
Regarding the image, it's mind-blowing, the rich colour-timing pops and yet is seamless, and the quality of the image is used to tremendous effect on those close-ups, where the actors are looking right into you.
Regarding the cut itself I almost knocked half a star off for the plantation scene; a scene that is fine on home video, but on the silver screen breaks the pace; stalling the way on to the ending, it provides commentary to something best left to stings of dialogue and visuals and editing instead of table scenes, and then culminates with a cringe-inducing score while Willard is seduced by the French Woman. A brief dinner scene showing the generational opinions and then the opium scene would have still held the essence instead of feeling completely out of place. There's also a palpable smidge too much of Duvall.
Watching it this time, the sound effects were so ahead of their time, they are perfect, and I've never really heard the score for this movie before, this time I thought it was sumptuous; a mix of dreamlike and grounded, somewhere else; modern and timeless.
There was a pre-filmed QnA afterwards with Soderbergh which was nice to watch, but alerted me to the excellent and enlightening Coppola/Miulius 2008 interview that can now be found on YouTube which made me appreciate the collaboration and humility of the filmmakers even more.
Apocalypse is unique, it's perfect, it's powerful and important in both the human heart and cinema. It's a masterclass and the scope, amount of extras, breadth of sets, intensity of the realism; of it all speaks to a bygone era in a powerful way; the way helicopters land so close to us in a way they never could now without CGI, the destruction that connects us to the destruction of the American machine during Vietnam, it's out of this world."
mimackenzie1972,"Apr 25, 2005",10/10,"If there was ever a movie that explains the horrors, atrocities, and abuse of power during wars, this is the movie all people should see. Even before seeing it for the first time, whenever I look at the title of the movie, the song that came to my mind is ""The End"" by the Doors because it is so true that once you enter warfare, all things normal cease to exist and you are out in your own world with eventually will end whether by death or by destruction of your sanity.This movie is beautifully done. I was hypnotized by the scene of darkness and the nihilism that the movie showed. The direction of Francis Ford Coppola was just incredible, the actors were brilliant. I couldn't imagine what Martin Sheen went through in order to prepare for the role of Lt. Willard and the animalistic approach of surviving and adapting to the situation was breathtakingly stunning. Marlon Brando lived up to his image as an American icon with his portrayal of the maniacal, god fearing Kurtz and Robert Duvall was almost comical, yet surprising incredible as Col. Kilgore.The attitude of the Americans as the superhero was evident in this movie and with the defeat of the ""superhero"" by the ""villians"" the communists, the movie showed that with wars - no one really wins and with only lives lost. It is incredible that the movie was made barely three years after the ending of the Vietnam War."
Jonathon_Natsis,"Aug 21, 2011",9/10,"Between 1979 and 1987, three of the most poignant, relevant filmmakers of the time all left their stamp on different aspects of the Vietnam War. Oliver Stone addressed the duality of men in Platoon, Stanley Kubrick showcased breeding insanity versus the will to stay alive in Full Metal Jacket, and Francis Ford Coppola presented a mind-bending insight into war as an illusionary trip. And while my personal favourite among these films changes regularly, one thing I am sure of is that they are all masterpieces, and Apocalypse Now, for this week at least, may be the best of the lot.Martin Sheen is Captain Ben Willard, tasked with the covert mission of venturing deep into the jungles of Cambodia to locate and assassinate Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Kurtz, a once-promising soldier, has since abandoned the needs of his country and gone completely insane, setting himself up as a god among a native tribe and ruling with dictatorial brutality.The movie is more road trip than firefight, but I don't mean to sound condescending at all. Most of the film consists of Willard and his small group of soldiers making the trek to Kurtz's stronghold, encountering bizarre characters and scenarios along the way. The most prominent of these is Lieutenant Kilgore (Robert Duvall, rounding up the Godfather reunion), a surfie soldier who'd be terrifying if he weren't so welcoming.It is from this point onwards that Apocalypse Now transcends the standard parameters of a war film and becomes a hallucinogenic cinematic experience. Many scenes convey such unique, unheard-of aspects of war that they leave you wondering whether what you just saw was real, or an alternate perception of reality seen through the eyes of the drug-taking soldiers. Visual bewilderment is on high supply during the set action pieces as well, with their abrupt ending having the effect of taking repeated blows to the head, then having to get back up as quickly as possible.But the otherworldly nature of the film is best reflected in the cinematography and sound. Deep shades of orange, gold and purple engulf almost every moment, and the sparing yet effective use of superimposed imagery compounds the eeriness. As for audio, it is easy to point to the excellent use of Ride of the Valkyries during Kilgore's air raid, but that is just scratching the surface. A haunting half-electronic, half-orchestral score dominates the rest of the film, while extracts of The End (by The Doors, a band that has always had a strange resonance with the Vietnam War) complete a flawless technical display.As Willard and Kurtz meet for the first time, Apocalypse Now goes into thematic overdrive. Most obvious is the old notion that absolute power corrupts absolutely. As the film progresses, we learn that Kurtz's desire to return home diminishes in contrast with his growing godly stature. But the film goes on to raise all sorts of questions regarding vanity and pride in the self, as well as the moral implications of death, and if it can accepted in certain circumstances.Finally, I feel obliged to mention an event towards the end of the movie, without giving away any major plot points. The climax is intercut with the infamous real-life slaughter of a water buffalo, which occurs in a most inhumane manner. Whether Coppola was justified in his actions (by simply filming an event that was going to be carried out by the natives anyway) depends on which sources you choose to believe. From a purely cinematic perspective, though, it compliments the climax in spectacular fashion. But just as concerning is the aftermath. As the characters that continue to live ponder their actions, the ending is ambiguous in the way that we, as the audience, can only imagine how the evils they have seen will torture them long after the film's events have ended. All the while the war rages on.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"
orko_dutta,"Jul 13, 2019",9/10,"A masterwork of cinema. Heart of Darkness is one of my favourite books and a movie filmed on the same concept but on a different place and time won me over. The film raises some severe philosophical issues - but in a brutal and realistic way. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It might cause a kind of shell-shock for a viewer after first taking it all in, but it has some of the purest, most rewarding bits of cinema."
martin_luzu,"Jul 5, 2020",6/10,"Confusion all along the way. It has great ideas and messages, and above all it's good to see a picture about war that shows how nuts it is. Also a movie being unkind with the craziness and horror not only enemies commit in war, but at home as well.Anyways other than that the movie gets rather boring and confusing. It has it's beauties that make it unique, but I'd rather not watch it again and let it live in memory as a fine movie with great messages. Kind of."
alexanderliljefors,"Sep 2, 2024",5/10,"Had very high hopes on this one, based on it's extremely high rating here on imdb and among top 250 on imdb. Said to be a classic and a must watch!I don't understand how it could have a such high rating!Its just as many other of the typical US war film! Nothing new or original!Though however i like the focus of the psychological aspects!I would definitely say that the environment and the scenery is extremely well made to feel realistic! Other then that it mostly fails at feeling realistic with the acting and the lame, non original and boring manuscript.Very boring, wierd and slow!Not really good storytelling either, sometimes abit confusing, failing to give answers and explanations, and some movies does that good and its very suitable, but not for this one. Poorly written characters!Definitely overrated!Worth to watch, but don't expect much at all!"
brucecoughran,"Aug 29, 2001",10/10,"The re-cut version of this famous film (""Apocolypse Now: Redux"", 2001) takes this classic to a new level.  Ten years removed from the near-mythic stories about the film itself and the making of it, as well as from the actual events of Viet Nam (which it is not about, by the way), serves this film enormously. It allows the film itself more room to stand on its own somehow.But more importantly, the added footage (which is quite significant, 49 min. I think) makes the film a much more profound and more eloquent piece of cinema.  The emotional life is filled out, the journey itself is more understandable, and the theme of the film more powerfully explicit than in the original release (which followed the ""action"" more closely).  See this film if for no other reason than to see how small the aspirations of current filmmakers seem to have become."
vaultoverseer_15,"Oct 19, 2017",10/10,"Whenever someone talks about the best Ford Coppola film, most will tell you its the Godfather, and when someone talks about the best war film most will tell you its Saving Private Ryan. While both films, huge in popularity, are undeniably masterpieces, I personally this film surpasses both of them. To a degree its just my personal taste, I like films that are stylistic and more abstract but still engaging, but I think that it definitely needs to be considered one of the best. I know many people consider it as a classic, but according to IMDb user reviews, interstellar is a better film, and saying that is a sin. Interstellar needs to be pushed down, this one being pushed up. What makes Apocalypse Now such an interesting war film is how it handles the war it is in. The book, Heart of Darkness, isn't even set during a war, being a story on insanity. I think setting it in the Vietnam War is great, because not only does it feel familiar to the African Jungles with the natives, but it also focuses more on the psychology effects rather than the physical. I like films like Platoon, Deer Hunter, and Casualties of War, but not only do the feel quite similar in tone, but they feel like the focus on the brutal aspects of Vietnam too much to me. In the war casualties weren't high (for the American side at least) and it wasn't particularly difficult, compared to WW1 or 2. But psychologically, it was damaging, forcing soldiers to kill civilians, de humanize the enemy and eventually themselves. For those reasons that those films fail, both Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and this film are able to ascend the typical Vietnam film, and to me, actually become poignant. I don't want to ruin any particular scene for anyone who might actually want to watch this film (YOU SHOULD) but just know that 1. The performances are all great, especially from Robert duvall, martin sheen and Marlon Brando. The film can get pretty intense, and sometimes a bit difficult to watch. The last 30 minutes or so are insane, and to me great. To me the film isn't a movie with one highlight, and then the rest not being able to top it. I love Saving Private Ryan, but it is a good example of a film where the Beach scene is so good that nothing ever tops it again, making some scenes personally not as powerful. In this film, you think nothing will ever top the Flight of the Valkyrie scene, everything is constantly proving this film doesn't just have one great scene, but is a variety of great scenes folding together with context, and a film that greatly shows the dehumanizing aspects of war. Overall this is definitely a film in my top 5, my personal favorite Coppola and war film. If you haven't seen this film, you are doing yourself a disservice."
Zoopansick,"Dec 14, 2003",9/10,"Well maybe not the best movie I have seen but it's in my Top 10 for sure. I think it's one of those rare films that is better then the book (Heart of Darkness which is of course different).  A lot of people debate whether it's a ""war movie"" I take the position that it's a war movie but that's only part of it.  I think calling it only a ""war movie"" is taking away from how great this movie is.  It doesn't just have the simple ""war is hell"" message that many war films have.  It asks more piercing questions about human nature and character.  It is drama, war, action, art, and manages to be entertaining as well as thought provoking.  Even if the ideas don't grab you there are 3 things you cannot deny of this movie. 1)the acting is all top-notch  2)the cinematography is some of the best ever 3)it is well written.  If you didn't like it or think you ""got it"" the first time, go back again it's well worth another trip up the river.  Afterall this film's quality pretty much terminates all others...with extreme prejudice.Zoopansick"
OriginalMovieBuff21,"Jul 9, 2004",10/10,"Apocalypse Now is one of the best war films out there even with it's relatives Saving Private Ryan, Glory, Braveheart, Black Hawk Down, Platoon, and Schindler's List. Robert Duvall had the best performance in the film as Colonel Kilgore. He had a small role but he had a great performance. Now that's a military dude. The story of this film was excellent, a plot for the ages. I liked how Francis Ford Coppola made the characters of the film develop with explosive performances like Lance, The ""Chef"", Clean, and Captain Willard. The performances of this were remarkable and timeless. Marlon Brando had also a small role but proved his role was even bigger. This was an amazing and bizarre Vietnam flick full of mystery and horror of the realism of Vietnam. Highly recommended!!10/10!!"
janet-55,"Oct 21, 2005",10/10,"On first viewing of this film I found the story so awful it was painful to watch. I wanted to forget it; but once seen this film lives on in one's memory. Clearly it is a highly allegorical work as is the novel it is derived from : ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad. It says much about the human condition in general not only within the context of war. Strictly speaking the film charts Willard's path through hell and ultimately to redemption. In reality Martin Sheen, who plays Willard, did practically the same thing. Reputedly smoking and drinking just a shade too much until half way through the filming he suffered a heart attack. Coppola's own path through this jungle of a film was equally harassing (watch ""Hearts of Darkness"" to get a better perspective on the making of the movie) resulting on the shoot taking far longer than originally planned. It's difficult now not to elide fact with fiction when discussing this film. Even before it was released I can remember newspaper headlines asking ""Apocalypse When?"" In the event the film was at last completed with the result that it is probably the most searing war film or any other kind of film you are likely to see. The acting throughout is brilliant from Sheen and Duvall, and fascinatingly quirky from Brando and Hopper. The cinematography is breathtaking and the use of music inspired. I cannot count the number of times I have seen it and it still thrills and enlightens me. A must for any DVD collection. P.S. Don't see the REDUX version."
Yabier,"Aug 11, 2005",10/10,"What can I say about this film is that it's simply one of the best ever. Francis Ford Coppola shows us the deepest emptiness of the human soul that the ruins of war mean. If you have read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", the book in which the movie's concept is based, you will understand the parallelism between the original and the Marlon Brando's Kurtz, the character who symbolizes the greatest and the lowest of the human being.I want to write a meaningful comment, that's because I'm going to talk about the metaphysical part of this movie. There is a lot of comments talking about the movie itself, so read them if you are looking for that.Apocalypse Now is a war movie that encloses a deeper story; the journey of a man who is caught between war and peace, death and life, and doesn't find any meaning for both of them. When his superiors task him an extra-official mission, he is involved in the chase of a ghost, a man who is apparently mad but whose actions in the current war seem to be brilliant. Captain Benjamin L. Willard finds himself chasing a man who admires in order to kill him, although he doesn't know what he will do when he faces Kurtz. In his path Willard have to confront the horrors of war, which degenerate forth to complete madness, nonsense and death like the most terrible nightmare.The rest is history. I think that the Redux version adds darkness and daze to the original Apocalypse Now, deepening more in its real meaning; not only an anti-war movie but the baring of the human soul."
BareNakedJimmy,"Jan 28, 2004",N/A,"I love movies, from Chaplin, Garbo, Bogart, bad 50s Sci-Fi, Plan B, Giant, Hud, sixties counter-culture, Airplane, Ahnold, Dr Evil, everything from outstanding to truly bad, I love movies.  That said, I'll continue...I first saw the original AN in 1980, at 19 years of age, on my first large screen color tv (remember the video disk?!)AN was the first film I had ever seen wherin I couldn't even leave my seat to pee - I was positively riveted!  Now, 23 years later, I have seen Redux (four times this week!) and I must say that AN (and Redux) are STILL the finest ever!  The cinematography, the character's experiences, the sets, the action, the horror and insanity, the multiple levels of thought-provoking sounds and images, everything.This masterpiece works on SO many levels that I wonder how many times I'll have to watch it to really get it all.  My last thought... seeing Lance tripping on acid, with the firefight and wild lighting effects  makes me wonder how AN would be while tripping... Happy viewing everyone!"
Arnold-10,"Mar 22, 2000",7/10,"This film is one of the more disappointing ""great"" films I've yet to see. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a _good_ movie.  The cinematography is excellent, I thought the Helicopter attack scene was magnificent, and the performances by Sheen, Duvall, and to an extent, Brando's as well, and I felt the pacing was great, if not just a bit slow, but was an excellent parallel to the nature of the war in Vietnam.  For the first 3/4ths of the film, I thought this was a great movie...And then I reached the ending.  This ending was so drawn out and mind-numbingly slow that I couldn't wait for the film to wrap up.  I heard that the reason behind this was that originally Brando's part was relatively short, but he wanted to get more screen time, so he stretched it out as far as humanly possible.  It certainly seems to be the case.  And as such, it is a detriment to what otherwise is a fantastic film."
Howlord,"May 6, 2002",10/10,"As a Cinema Studies major, I'm forced to constantly rely on video tapes and DVDs to study movies I have to write about in more detail.  There are HUGE conveniences to these media: the ability to move forward and backwards within the film with ease, the low cost, the lack of a need to get myself a large screen and a projectionist, etc.  I've always been a big lover of watching movies on the big screen for the enhanced size of the image, thus making it easier to catch small nuances in shot composition, and because of the ever increasing awe of modern sound systems.  I don't think films like ""Black Hawk Down"" would work without massive, multidirectional audio.  Well, Apocalypse Now Redux proved something further to me...  film projection makes everything just look better.When I caught the Redux at an Oberlin Film Series screening, I was absolutely FLOORED by the depth and variety of color and light at work in this film.  I'll admit to not particularly liking some of the added scenes. The dialogue in the plantation sequence was VERY heavy-handed and not in the poetic manner of much of the dialogue in other parts of the film.  But the images... I was drawn into the film on the pure power of seeing film as a medium in its most powerful form.  From the opening explosions to the haunting sound of the Doors, to the scene of Martin Sheen rising from the mud, the film was as textured and palpable as a Van Gogh painting.  I've never once had any kind of illegal substance, let alone hallucinogens in my life, but I felt out of body watching this movie.  I was awestruck at the sheer power of a film's imagery.  Watching this film, I fell in love with movies again.  Thank you, Mr. Coppola.10/10"
brijfuchs,"Oct 22, 2022",7/10,"Apocalypse Now is a war drama about a U. S. Army solider serving in Vietnam that is given a mission of assassinating a Special Forces Colonel who has gone insane. The film was released in 1979 and is rated R. The movie is directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The film is written in the collaboration of Francis Ford Coppola, John Milus, and Michael Horr, who narrated the film. Apocalypse Now is based loosely on a book called Heart of Darkness by Joesph Conrad. Martin Sheen plays Captain Benjamin L. Willard who is assigned a task to assassinate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, starring Marlon Brando, for his immoral rampage of killing.There were both positives and negatives about the production of the movie. After I watched the film, I did not know what to really think of it. I decided to watch the documentary of the production called Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse to get more information on the movie. I really liked the storyline of the film. Martin Sheen's opening scene performance was very emotional about his character's trauma of the Vietnam war. It showed true vulnerability and his internal conflict. I also really liked how true the movie was about how American soldiers treated others. They were very Gung Ho on war and did not seem to be cautious of shooting others. It was mostly shoot first, ask questions later even if they are just civilians. A lot of war movies depict Americans as heroes of the war and in this movie, it shows the reality of how horrible American soldiers could be.Another position was how the movie could be interpreted as how internal conflict could create a monster. In the beginning Willard struggles with his trauma from the war. Colonel Kurtz's character is struggling with his own demons of trauma and him hurting others. It shows how trauma can affect people differently. Both made different decisions in the end.The production of the movie was quite amazing to see in the documentary. Everything from the explosions to fires and dead bodies, played by actors, were all real. Even some of the props were made. Unfortunately, the weather ruined a lot of sets and equipment.The negatives of the movie were the writing for the ending. I felt the ending did not have much closure of the movie and left it up to the viewer to decide on the philosophy of the film. Another negative was that a few of the crew's health was at risk for making this movie. Sheen had a bad heart attack during work and Coppola had a seizure. It was also mentioned from some of the actors that there was a lot of drugs and alcohol involved to cope with the stress. The planning for the movie was disorganized due to Coppola wanting to make everything perfect and everything his way. Sometimes he would change a scene on the fly, or he would write a scene on set.Overall, I really recommend both this film and watching the documentary to gain more insight into how the movie was produced. To me, watching the documentary and seeing the struggles to achieve the amazing quality of the movie was quite amazing to see. It was even cool to see that they used a lot of real objects and not props. There were no miniatures or projections in the movie. All of it was real. Even the guns were real."
nskanyal,"Aug 12, 2009",10/10,"Were they not the real soldiers? Was it not the real war? Was that not the real horror? Have the people not really gone insane? Was the movie really made on this planet and by some mortal human beings? Was it a video documentary or was it a movie made 5 years after the real war? Yes, to all of the above, but I have never ever seen any movie so close to reality or actually real. It was not a war movie, it was not a drama, it was simply a deeply touching horror drama. I am still wondering what should I make out of this movie, should I feel anything, should I be sorry about anybody – if yes, about who?? American soldiers, Vietnamese, those tribals, each one of these or nobody? Coppola doesn't leave anything obvious and everything is open to your own interpretation – he is at his arrogant best. Man, it takes inhuman guts to make such a movie or even think of doing it. He was fortunate to supported by such a able and gutsy team of editors, script writer, screenplay writers, cinematographer and so many other people. I am really surprised and disappointed that this movie was not awarded academy for Film Editing – it's as ridiculous as it can be. My head still spins from imagining all these people living in those swamps and malaria invested waters for almost 2 years.Talking about the cast, I would rather say that movie and its makers go way beyond the cast. Any other actors may have done equal justice (if not less) to the movie. This may sound highly uncharitable, especially to Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall (I don't mention Brando – he was rather a waste, Coppola may have utilized that money somewhere else – am I speaking out of my shoes?? ). Sheen was awesome awesome and hats off to all his effort, and it was rather wise (or fortunate) not to have Al Pacino in his place, but the movie is not about Captain Willard, Col. Kilgore and Col. Kurtz, it about everything around each of them – it goes way beyond all these people.In the end, ""The End"" will stay as my personal favorite for the most apt movie soundtrack of all times.10/10"
john-hitchcock,"Mar 21, 2011",10/10,"Apocalypse Now is a very unusual portrayal of the Vietnam War. It's not the most realistic interpretation of the conflict, and it is very surreal.One problem that I frequently find with war films is that often, especially when showing intense battles, the plot can be difficult to follow. Another major issue is that, especially when there is a large cast, it can be hard to distinguish the main cast.Neither of these problems are present in Apocalypse now. Despite it's surreal nature, the film's plot is actually reasonably straight forward and summed up in the trailer: Willard is ordered to find Colonel Kurtz and terminate his command, then takes a patrol boat with four other men up the Nung River o Kurtz's compound.The majority of the main plot is confined to the patrol boat, dealing with various problems that the main cast encounters over the course of the journey.The cast is actually pretty easy to tell apart. There are five main characters aboard the boat, and all of them have distinctive features which allow them to be recognized instantly.The acting is also brilliant. Martin Sheen is great as Captain Willard, a soldier whose mind has been completely messed up by his experiences in the war. The rest of the main cast (including a really young Lawrence Fishbourne) does great as well, making them very easy to relate to.Most of the other actors have very brief roles, and you won't see much of them, but they are still very memorable. The most famous is Robert Duvall's appearance as Lt. Colonel Bill Kilgore, an air cavalry officer who takes a bit too much pleasure out of the war, playing 'Ride of the Valkyries' while attacking a village and then having his men surf in the middle of the battle.Also notable is Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz, the insane officer whom Willard is sent to kill. His first scene is probably his best, in which both Kurtz and Willard are only partially visible in the dim light.Other supporting actors include Harrison Ford's brief appearance as Colonel Lucas, the officer who assigns Willard his mission; and Dennis Hopper as an annoying photojournalist who admires Kurtz. Both manage to put on great performances.Overall, Apocalypse Now is a very unusual and brilliant portrayal of the Vietnam War. It is very effective in illustrating the insanity that took place, and if you interested in war films, you will definitely have to check it out."
Howlin Wolf,"Nov 8, 2005",10/10,"Masterful. How do you tell who's sane and who isn't when the troops and the officials are all in the war for the wrong reasons? It's a giant cover-up, like the whole affair tried to be and should have been, for the good of the ordinary person's conscience. It's not a movie, it's an experience. They weren't just goofing off in front of the camera, they lived this; and the arduous shoot became a reference point for future troubled productions. The sacrifices were worth it, though; because the end results are nothing short of stunning...I never understood all the hype around Marlon Brando before I saw this. In ""The Godfather"" he didn't seem to be stretching himself; but he blew me away here. He's not alone; as an acclaimed cast and director joined together to make not just the finest Vietnam movie ever made; but a work that is easily one of the best films of all time, in its own right."
dfm1967,"Oct 8, 2005",10/10,"My rating is for the ORIGINAL 1979 theatrical movie. I would only give 8 stars for ""redux"". I live,eat, and breath this film. It embodies so much thought. My wife is tired of hearing the DVD played on our DVD/VCR entertainment center. I even like the end credits and the lack of clutter in relation to them. Platoon (""Spitoon""), Full Metal jacket (apologies to R. Lee), and even Saving Private Ryan ( ""It's a Wonderful Life"" set to WW2) cannot compete with this 1979 masterpiece of cinematography. The soundtrack alone is brilliant thanks to Carmine Coppolla and MOOG. So haunting and mysterious. Whenever I pass a tree line driving and see the tall trees in front of the red sunset I remember that film when they were on the river and that eerie music.""...you're an errand boy, sent by the clerks to colelct the bill."""
Boba_Fett1138,"Aug 13, 2005",9/10,"This movie is extremely odd. Looking at this movie makes it obvious that most of the cast and crew were on drugs during filming. The end movie result, is an unique one of a kind movie experience and quite possible the best Vietnam war movie ever made. It's not a movie for everyone though, guess true movie buffs are the only ones who can truly wholeheartedly appreciate this movie and the 'beauty' of all the ugliness in the movie.The movie makes a perfect statement as an anti-war movie. It shows the horror of war and what it does to men. I have to admit that my favorite parts of the movie were the ones with action in it. The chopper attack is truly splendid and a real classic moment of movie history. Still this is not really a movie about shooting and fighting. Its more a movie about the emotional struggles of men during war. The struggles of the main character Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) are told in a most excellent, slow, compelling way. He becomes more and more obsessed and interested in the man he is supposed to 'terminate with extreme prejudice', during his journey over the river to Cambodia, where Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), the man he is supposed to kill, is located. Once the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the journey and the emotional struggles seem to be more difficult and dangerous than the killing of Kurtz.What makes the movie work are the good and realistically brought characters and the actors that portray them. All of the characters are stereotypes in a way, which works extremely well for the movie and its story. Brando is totally flipped in his role as 'crazy' mumbling Colonel Kurtz and even though his role isn't THAT big (ironic sentence, considering the fact that Brando was 40kg overweight, for his role), he still makes a lasting impression. Also totally crazy is Dennis Hopper in his role as American photojournalist that lives under Kurtz. Robert Duvall also gives a most excellent performance as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore. Rest of the cast consists out of big names as Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, G.D. Spradlin and a 14-year old Laurence Fishburne, in one of his first movie roles.The movie has a fantastic and kind if surreal atmosphere, which makes this movie one of the most moody movies ever made, also thanks to the Oscar winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro.Perhaps the whole story surrounding the making of this movie (Sheen's heart-attack, the difficult overweight Brando, the drug abuse, the 16 months of filming in the jungle, the three year editing process.) is more legendary than the movie itself, it still is a classic, one of a kind movie, that might very well be the best Vietnam-war movie (yet).9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
lee_eisenberg,"Nov 15, 2005",10/10,"From the opening scene - with ""The End"" playing while helicopters are attacking a village - to Col. Kilgore's (Robert Duvall) admiration of napalm, to the Playboy bunnies, to the final scene, ""Apocalypse Now"" always hits you like a brick in the face. As Capt. Benjamin L. Willard, searching for renegade Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), Martin Sheen has what was probably the best role of his career.Above all, the movie is staunchly anti-war, even more so than ""The Deer Hunter""; ""Apocalypse Now"" condemns the fact that we were in Vietnam to begin with. The Playboy bunny scene not only shows that the GIs were shown the most despicable stuff for entertainment, but it shows that if you expect to create such emotions, don't expect to be able to control them (in that scene, you can see Vietnamese people outside the compound, and you can only imagine how disgusted they must be at American ""entertainment"").Col. Kilgore is of course the ultimate rah-rah military type. Among other things, this ""patriot"" ignores a wounded man, preferring instead to go surfing. He doesn't even flinch when there's an explosion. As he cynically notes: ""Charlie don't surf."" All in all, ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. With top notch performances by the stars and great support from Frederic Forrest, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Sam Bottoms and Harrison Ford, this is one movie that everyone should see."
Emerenciano,"Nov 28, 2002",N/A,"War has been the theme of many of the greatest movies of all times, such as Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"", Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", Stone's ""Platoon"" and Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"". These films  are living examples of Hollywood passion for military conflict, mainly World War II and Vietnam War. It's interesting how we can never ignore this movies, full of battles, shots and explosions.I'm sure it's not easy for the directors to rule such big projects where a numerous cast is involved and millions of dollars are spent. We can't deny these characteristics attract us, once we realise we have seen all the cited movies lots of times.""Apocalypse Now"" is something we just cannot miss at all. Coppola's direction is wonderful and the cast counts on Marlon Brandon, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Laurence Fishbourne, Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford. The plot itself is different from anything we have seen in the genre of films: Col. Walter E. Kurtz (Brando) is a dissident officer who lives somewhere in Asia leading his own army and obeying his own laws. This makes Capt. Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) goes out in a mission to get Kurtz. This itself could be enough to make ""Apocalypse Now"" great, but then we see the wonderful performances Brando, Duvall and Sheen have. Not to be missed.My rate 9/10"
mattrochman,"Feb 6, 2008",4/10,"When it comes to films about the Vietnam war, I think that too many people are over-praising. Perhaps many from the generation that lived through that war feel a strong connection to any film about it. Perhaps the explicit horrors of war vindicates their stance at the time so therefore, it's more worthy of praise. Perhaps this is even a generational thing? In any case, the acting was nothing magical. Sheen looked more constipated than anything else throughout the film and his obsession with Kurtz is poorly scripted. The war sequences are not too bad, but hardly the best cinematic portrayal of war.Moreover, the film tends to bathe in its own views, themes and self-importance. After a while, it become tedious (even before REDUX) and interest levels plateau.Then there is the grand finale where we finally meet Kurtz and all is supposedly revealed. But while the quality of the scripting and performances lifts during this period, the actual plotting goes awry. While many will say that the conclusion places caps off an exploration of the dark side of the human psyche, I felt that it was more of a disjointed series of monologues that the viewer never really follows, nor connects totally with. The fact that Kurtz turned out to be a demigod leading a tribe stretched both credibility and sensibility.Cinematography was fairly good and there are enough engaging moments which compels me to give it a higher rating. But drastically overrated and the ending borders on absurd. Full Metal Jacket was the best of the lot in my view and many others get my vote before Apocalypse Now. However, I do give Platoon a lower rating than this as that was woeful."
RatedVforVinny,"Dec 16, 2019",10/10,"It is the only movie in film history to be both pretentious and utterly essential viewing. The helicopter raid, the movie's standout scene on an ill-fated Vietnamese village, is simply mind-blowing and one of the finest action sequences ever committed to the silver screen. Francis Ford Coppola was wise to stick with such quality actors, he'd previously used in both 'The Godfather' and 'The Conversation', chiefly Robert Duvall as the crazed, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (of the Air Cavalry), Marlon Brando (as the hunted and out of shape -Kurtz) and Gene Hackman (in a lessor role). 'Apocalypse Now' is not just about the horror of war (though it naturally depicts this in large doses) but also deals with the mayhem and absolute chaos that was Vietnam. This anti-war classic has never really dated like other, later 'Nam' movies such as 'Platoon' and to be honest it's impossible to imagine a film of such magnitude, cost and physical endurance ever being produced in today's climate (in fact it would be nigh on impossible). The psychedelic soundtrack (including music) by 'The Doors, together with some brilliant method acting by Martin Sheen, who replaced Harvey Keitel (as the man with a mission), and some rather intense improvisation by madcap Denis Hopper (as a rogue photojournalist), make it seem like one bad but beautiful acid trip. The way longer 'Redux' release, with previously deleted scenes, slows the pace but is still an interesting watch and a huge must for the fans; so basically you will need to own and savour both versions."
SoHo1,"Mar 2, 2005",10/10,"Well, I guess everyone who has once seen this move could not have denied its status of a masterpiece. I couldn't as well. Initially, the viewer is served with the captivating, overwhelming song ""The End"" by The Doors, which I am listening to right now. The song very much describes the imminence of the events about to ensue. The greatest amount of the movie's grandiosity lies in multiple separate, self-contained scenes. One of those is the air strike undertaken by Americans while the Wagner's ""Flight of the Valkyries"" is on and there is a splendid juxtaposition of horror over the Vietnamese and the exhilaration among the Americans. Another wholly self-descriptive scene is that of Marlon Brando confessing with his tremendously pervasive and piercing posture. Robert Duvall's peerless courage and uncommon decisiveness is another completely different, yet scathing, character. The movie is philosophic with events meandering here and there but never getting away from the target. 10/10"
UniqueParticle,"Nov 29, 2019",10/10,"Martin Sheen's performance is one of the greatest things to ever be done! The sound throughout is ambient glossy perfection, I love how the acting is incredible in every scene. Apocalypse Now is a truly magical adventure thrill ride filled with beautiful atmospheric vibe. There's so much exciting elements even for a non war fan this is masterful for anyone."
bobsgrock,"Nov 22, 2009",10/10,"There are quite a few good movies out in circulation today, many of which have been released in the past five years. None, however, can claim the title of most ambitious film of all time. For that title must go to Apocalypse Now, the classic yet surreal tale of US forces in Vietnam experiencing more than their share of problems and violence amongst the jungles and wilderness.What does one say about a film like this? It certainly isn't easy to criticize, mostly because you don't really watch it so much as experience it. Every scene builds tension and emotion as you watch these young American boys, innocent when arriving, be turned into robotic killers with an almost complete lack of remorse or emotion. Coppola is able to keep our attention and at the same time somehow get us to sympathize but also be stunned at the severity of the action taking place. Each scene is so layered, so complex with what it is trying to evoke that it makes the viewing experience a mind-blowing journey very much like Willard's journey to Kurtz.The success of this film is in no small thanks to the acting, with the classic lineup delivering on the nose the exact tone of monotonous and deplored sense of bewilderment. Of course, it is Marlon Brando who is the show-stopper as Kurtz, the crazed colonel running his own version of the war in the heart of the jungle. As we follow Willard (Martin Sheen) to find Kurtz, we realize perhaps he is not as crazy as first portrayed. After witnessing Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall in perhaps his best work ever) and the insane chaos that is the Do Nung Bridge, could it be possible that Kurtz isn't as bad as they say? This, of course, is part of the journey and something the audience itself needs to figure out.All the same, Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest of all films because it goes farther than any of its kind. The helicopter scene when Kilgore's cavalry attack a Vietnamese village is perhaps the most daring and ambitious sequence ever filmed. No film maker or even studio would dare do such a thing, probably instead using CGI to create the effects. But Coppola was a genius and just crazy enough to be able to try such a stunt. Indeed, the whole movie is a crazy stunt and one that you won't soon forget."
oneflewovertheapocalypse,"Mar 26, 2004",N/A,"`Apocalypse Now wasn't about Vietnam, it was Vietnam' they are the famous words of Francis Ford Coppola and I could not agree more with every word he said.   Apocalypse Now for me wasn't just a film, it was an experience which I hold dear to my heart and always will.   It may have taken a long while for this to be made, but imagine what it would have been like if all the problems that occurred didn't happen, it wouldn't be the same film.  It was like it was meant to be a horrendous shoot to make it what it is and that is the great living film ever to be done.   If you take notice into every film Coppola has done since Apocalypse Now you see them as not bad or just good films, but he has accomplished something that is so harrowing and epic as this.  Coppola put so much into the movie based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness it was like he had no more vision left to put into his other projects.  Maybe Apocalypse Now was the film to blame for the not so good Godfather 3.  I enjoyed The Godfather 3 just as much the first two but  you could see something lacking from the third instalment that he didn't bring up like he did with the other two.The story revolves around Captain Willard played by Martin Sheen who is an assassin travelling up a river with a small platoon to terminate a colonel who has gone insane.   That is the movie.  You live with these men for the first two hours of the film on this boat and the situations that happen throughout and then it comes to a halt when they arrive at Kurtz's camp where you finally get to see what you have imagined would look like.  I expected to just see a camp full of soldiers but you instead see a platoon of tribesmen and warriors who have no grip on reality and what is the difference between right and wrong.  The journey up the river starts off exciting with many things happening whether it would be the invasion on the beach with the crazy but commanding Kilgore or the playboy bunnies concert at the barracks.  The more it goes on the slower the plot is and the more relaxing it becomes.  The story begins to tire and so do you but not in a bad way.  It happens in a way where you just feel you know that these soldiers have travelled so far and tragedy has struck them one to many times and there is no reality in their minds anymore.Friends ask me what do I prefer, Redux or the original?  I say both as the original version of Apocalypse Now was just unspeakable of how good a film could be and when I saw Redux it was just a bonus and answered questions that I didn't have the answers to.   It is an emotional roller coaster ride of a movie and does depress you in a way.  You either come out of the film thinking `wow' or `What the hell was that'?   It scares me to think what George Lucas's version would have been like if he took the helm.  It would have been more commercialised  probably in my opinion and also under budget. I think if Orson Welles went ahead with Heart Of Darkness then it would have been great and Coppola could have still made Apocalypse without much comparison to Welles's version as it would not have been set in the same backdrop of the Vietnam war.  But there is a part of me that is thankful for Welles not to direct Heart Of Darkness because it makes Apocalypse Now stand out more to the rest and that's what makes it so groundbreaking.   I remember seeing Redux in the cinema on release and the whole multiplex was packed and when Brando mutters the words `The Horror, The Horror, The Horror' and there are cross dissolves of Willard's painted face and the helicopters from the beginning flying In the background, the lights came on and everyone left in utter silence, and that's what makes Apocalypse Now so good even to this day, it silences everybody and doesn't make you think because there is no message here to read, just an experience of pure madness.   Even though Brando is only seen for at least a quarter of the of the picture, he is the man that steals the film under everybody's except Coppola's feet.  His ad libing of every scene is what an actor is really about.  He is without doubt the last great actor and no one apart from De Niro has been able to touch Brando for what he has achieved in his acting career.  He is not your average type an actor, he's your Jim Morrison of the movies who just doesn't seem all there but speaks words of beauty and terror through his words.   The music of The Doors is as haunting as any original movie score could ever be and comes in at the right time and Carmine Coppola just shines as more as his music did in The Godfather to bring the horror and heart of darkness to an end.Apocalypse Now is not one of the greatest films ever made, it is the greatest film ever made and no film will probably ever surpass it, not in my lifetime anyway and if something does come along then it will have to be noting short of a miracle and let's face it you don't see many of them in Hollywood."

fidomail2002,"Jan 5, 2005",10/10,"I agree with Ann Medina from the Canadian History channel when she says 'it's not a story, it's an experience'. In my opinion, using the Vietnam war is just a convenient medium to actualize concepts about living everyday life, since our lifestyles can be rife with conflict as well.Others have argued the opposite; that the movie is too extreme, too evil; that it's trying to imply that we must keep depravity close at hand to keep things real and define our lives. I, however, see the movie as a balancing act between religion and inhibitions with individuality, courage, and convictions. Otherwise known as the eternal struggle of man. Concepts of evil are to some degree, culturally based; to kill a cow in India is considered a crime, while in the western world, we eat hamburgers quite regularly. We have already accepted several things in our lives that others would consider sick and depraved. Just ask PETA. Just ask Ret'd UN Commander Romeo Dallaire. But I digress at this point.William Golding's book titled 'The Lord of The Flies' stipulates that evil is simply a nervous and irrational reflex to our fear of the Unknown, in whatever guise that may truly be. For instance, I'm afraid to be thin, because I might be afraid that my excuse for not being sexually appealing will disappear with the extra ugly flab. It could be that I'm just not sexy. *G*Walter Kurtz, as played by Marlon Brando, got a glimpse of that knee-jerk hysterical evil after witnessing the slaughter of innocents; arms that were injected with a polio vaccine had been hacked off. His mistake was in growing to admire the finality of such an action when in fact, it was a chronic lack of understanding of modern medico logy compounded by a preternatural paranoia of a better developed force. But, Walter Kurtz, in turn, had misunderstood the origins of such evil and reacted blindly to it by losing his mind. He merely proves again that reactions from too little knowledge are dangerous and that again, evil has been begotten by past evils. And Benjamin Willard (aka Martin Sheen) perpetuates the downward spiral of human society by executing his own order of justice. But he was afforded the luxury however grotesque, of not having to think overmuch about his task, he merely had to make sure it got done. So who is right or ultimately wrong?Evil exists on various levels. A concept of evil is governed by early childhood experiences, educational, and parental support systems. Evil defined at the most fundamental level is when an entity causes or compels a deeply changed state upon another entity. One type of evil is when genocide is deemed acceptable because people have been deeply compelled to believe that some other types of people are not entirely sentient. Obviously, this is a circular type of evil that perpetuates over many generations. If you have been led to believe that an entity does not enjoy your supposedly higher level of sentience, you will not know that you have committed evil against the entity.A fundamental definition such as this may not be realistically applied since we usually define evil subjectively. For example, an entity is not necessarily committing evil when an entity causes another entity to exist or be born. So should the definition be altered or are we already subjectively moving the definition to our own preference? Is evil an entity causing or compelling a permanently changed state upon another entity rather than an extreme temporary change? We are then saying that drastic changes upon an entity are not evil when they are only finite. The birth of a entity is not evil because the life of the entity is never permanent, the child is never immortal.Murder, rape, and physical or emotional abuse are still evil under this revised definition but for two of those instances it has to be acknowledged, known, or believed that entities can possess souls that live forever beyond physical death. But it also has to be true that the birth of an entity does not mean that the soul is beginning its own existence too. If a soul were not to be evil, the body could only be the temporary host for a soul that had already existed for all of infinity; an entity that had no beginning or no end of being alive. And, in another thought, if heaven was created--which is supposed to last forever--did God Himself commit evil...or did heaven also always existed with an undefined beginning or end?We could do a third improvisation and exclude 'entities' from the definition and instead cite 'organisms' to subjectively skirt Godly issues. We now say that evil is when organisms cause or compel a permanent change upon another organism. What about books like 'Mein Kampf' which sometimes causes a person to permanently alter his or her way of thinking to become anti-government and anti-semitic? Or do we claim that it was the the fault of the reader since the alteration does not occur for everybody? What if written words such as these in this ditsy review of a movie permanently alters one's opinion of evil? D'oh.The definition of what constitutes an organism could be too subjective, inconstant, or contextual. It might be proved one day that man-made electricity is evil. The bumping of electrons from molecule to molecule might be permanently disrupting thousands of unseen galaxies containing countless sentient beings too small for human technology to readily perceive for empirical proof of their existence. But don't let that permanently compel you to turn off your computer, just run away screaming; that's a temporary state."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Sep 2, 2004",9/10,"The only two problems with this movie are, as the one line summary states, the length and the ending. It's so long that unless you're very determined or very patient, you're not gonna sit through it to the end(particularly not if you're watching the ""redux"" version which I was(un?)lucky enough to see on TV). And the ending seems to suggest that Coppola had either run out of steam or simply didn't know how he should end it. As a war film, it's not particularly realistic, I guess, but more of a piece about the descent into madness that you experience under such dehumanizing circumstances. I found it interesting to see as such a film, but arguably not much else... I also found it interesting to recognize the actors, whom I, for the most part, hadn't seen in a film from, at least before the 80's. If any of this doesn't make sense, don't blame me... blame the fact that I'm writing this as I'm almost falling asleep after the movie. Now, let it be known, that I didn't pay attention to the entire thing; I am neither a man of great patience nor determination(well, not enough, anyway) so I fell asleep once or twice through this film, and actually found myself awaking a few minutes after it had ended, and had to rewind it to catch the ending. Maybe that affected my judgment, maybe not(it probably did). However, what I saw, I mostly liked. The acting is very good. The characters are well-written and nuanced. The action is well-done. The cinematography is very good. All in all, a very good film, if you have the patience and you're sufficiently interested in seeing this very well done piece of film, despite it's very long runtime(maybe you would want to start with the original version, not the ""redux"" one I saw). I recommend it to just about anyone who really is interested in films and the media of movies. If you can sit through it, you probably should. Any Coppola fan should definitely experience this. 9/10"

jmholmes-73727,"Jul 11, 2019",10/10,"When this movie was released in 1979, the term ""post traumatic stress disorder"" was rarely used, certainly not nearly as often as it is today, to describe the emotional anxieties endured by battle-weary soldiers who had returned from the jungles of Vietnam. It seems today that APOCALYPSE,NOW!, large chunks of it anyway, illustrate the effects of this disorder on the characters,situations and most especially the atmosphere and tone of the work. Perhaps this is the reason it resonated so strongly with some viewers at the time, despite its unsatisfying concluding moments that failed to deliver the big action moment many hoped would end the film. Instead, Coppola leaves us in a heart of darkness, stuck as it were, in a state of mind from which escape seems impossible. Not only does the movie not give us an exhilarating battle scene to match the helicopter attack seen earlier, it doesn't even give its characters a rescue or deliverance, and certainly not a homecoming. Where another fil-maker might have inserted a psychologist to comment on the awful anxieties the men might be going through, Coppola shows in nearly every scene
the insanity of their surroundings and the twisted world of war in which they live. He succeeds in using his film to immerse the audience as much as possible in the hell this war created in the minds of the veterans forced to endure it.
There have been four great films about that war: The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Coming Home, and this one - but it is this one, Coppola's, that seems most personal."

Prince-P,"Mar 12, 2023",6/10,"In the early 1970s, George Lucas wrote a draft of ""Apocalypse Now"" together with John Milius. However, the idea remained on United Artist's shelves, and when it was brought up five years later, Lucas was busy making ""Star Wars"". So, he asked his good friend Francis Ford Coppola if he was willing to take over. And Coppola was more than happy to do so. If he was given free rein with the script, that is.Coppola's new screenplay was based on the 1899 novella ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad. The director changed the setting from late 19th-century Congo to the Vietnam War of the '70s. He also decided to finance the project with the profit from his ""Godfather"" movies. Then Coppola travelled to the Philippines to start filming.What began as a 14-week shoot ended up being extremely difficult logistically. Everything was taking much longer and costing much more than anticipated. Marlon Brando showed up on the set terribly overweight and completely unprepared, while Martin Sheen (in the lead role) suffered a near-fatal heart attack on location.Then there was the weather. A violent typhoon destroyed the sets, causing the movie to shut down for three months. And the problems continued. Back home, it took Coppola over two years to edit the 250 hours of exposed film. When he was finally done there were approximately 247 hours of footage on the cutting room floor.Although the movie was a hit in the United States, it lost money due to its huge negative costs. And it didn't help that the studio squandered money for prints and ads. Three years later, the film still hadn't turned a profit, and Coppola owed United Artists $7 million. So, in the end, the director was forced to hand over the TV rights to the company to pay the balance. But at least ""Apocalypse Now"" won the coveted Palme d'Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival."
davidmvining,"Nov 21, 2019",10/10,"The SeventiesIn terms of the 1970s of American cinema, in my opinion, the most imposing individual was Francis Ford Coppola. Beyond his own creative output, which was obviously significant, he helped foster some of the most prominent filmmakers of the generation with relationships from mentor to collaborator with people like George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Paul Schrader. He was at the center of the new movement of American cinema that we're still seeing the effects of today (most are still making movies, although generally just not at the same level of quality as when they first started).But back in the seventies, Coppola was king. From '72 to '79, he made four movies. All four were nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. He won for two of them (The Conversation's loss was to his own The Godfather Part II). The second loss was to Apocalypse Now, which lost to Kramer vs. Kramer Now, I do really like Kramer vs. Kramer, but it's nothing compared to the mad odyssey into the depths of the jungle that is Apocalypse Now.A DifficultyWith the other movies on my list, I had little difficulty explaining to myself why I loved them individually. The disparate parts of each film assembled so easily together into something often beautiful that I found the experience of writing about them easy. Apocalypse Now is very different. I really see it as a work of genuine madness. Coppola went into the jungle and lost his mind on the way out, the perfect mirror of the main character's journey, and I really do feel like the movie captures that amazingly well.But then that leads to the question: How does madness lead to great art? How do you read an art born of madness?I think the only way to really approach it in an abstract sense. Its effect on the viewer as he watches it. There are arguments that all art should be approached that way, but I do personally feel that formal structural and character based approaches are important to both creating and taking in art, but Apocalypse Now largely forbears any formal approach. Long story short, this post is going to be messy. Let's roll!Apocalypse NowRewatching the movie for this post, I was struck by something that I've seemingly never really processed before. The movie is gorgeous to look at. The colors are vibrant with the wide range of greens of the jungle and the great palate of colors that fill in the gaps. The framing of every shot is beautiful, especially around the flight of the helicopters during the ""Ride of the Valkyrie"" scene. Even during smaller moments, like when Kilgore walks out of frame, it's perfectly shot.Kilgore is crouching down, talking to Willard, ending on a melancholy note, and then proceeds to stand up and just walk to the right. We never see him again. He just disappears into the war. It's such a perfect end for him, and it's done through simple and effective framing.ThemesAs with my other favorite films, Apocalypse Now isn't terribly explicit about what the movie is actually about. The closest it gets, I think, is this line from General Corman near the beginning of the film:Well, you see, Willard, in this war, things get confused out there. Power, ideals, the old morality, and practical military necessity. But out there with these natives, it must be a temptation to be God. Because there's a conflict in every human heart, between the rational and irration, between good and evil. And good does not always triumph. Sometimes, the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.That quote outlines the idea at the heart of the film. The conflict between the rational and irrational and good and evil. What we end up seeing during Willard trek up the river into Cambodia is the increasing madness.Is that madness specific to the Vietnam War? The surface of the movie? Is that all there is?I don't think so. I think that the surface is part of the equation, but also the least interesting part. As with all great art, Coppola uses the subject of his film to talk to more immediate and relatable concerns. Not much of the audience lived through Vietnam in country, but most of the audience has seen madness. They've understood obsession. They've understood being lost. They've also understood making a choice to turn back from madness.The Journey's EndMany people consider the journey to Kurtz to be great, but once Willard actually gets there, for the movie to peter out. I disagree, the ending is my favorite part of the whole thing.I believe that part of the issue people have is with Marlon Brando. It's not that he plays the part badly, but that he's pretty obviously fat. He promised to show up lean and mean to the set, but he just loved eating too much to actually do what he promised. Coppola panicked. Kurtz wasn't going to be the highly mobile killing machine as he was in the script. Instead, Coppola had to find another solution, choosing to shoot Brando mostly in shadow and turning what was supposed to be a thin man of action in a bulking heavy threat. I actually think that the combination of shadows that the man's size, along with his insane ramblings makes him a rather terrifying figure.I consider the threat of madness infecting others to be a more imposing threat than a single man swinging through the jungle as some great killer, and by stripping Kurtz of the physicality of the character's original ideal and leaving him with only the madness makes the madness all that much stronger in my mind.And besides, the actual death scene is fantastic, using the sacrificial bull to imply that Kurtz himself is a sacrifice, but to what? Is Willard killing Kurtz out of orders? He says no in the voiceover. I think that it's a rejection of the madness in its entirety. What solidifies that in my mind is how Willard could obviously take Kurtz's place, but he simply grabs Lance, the last member of the boat crew, and walks away.In ConclusionThe movie is both a hard watch and an easy one. It's hard because of the inhumanity on display and the questions that it raises. It's easy to watch because of the magnificent cinematography on display and the great performances by everyone involved.In regards to the two versions of the film, I've only ever seen the original cut. I actually own the Redux version (the DVD I bought years ago came with both on the same pair of discs), but I've simply refused to watch it. I'll probably do it one day. I've heard both good things (people saying that it finally completes the package of the movie and makes it great) and bad things (those saying that, in particular, the French plantation isn't worth the price of admission and doesn't add to the movie in any significant way).In the end, though, this work of madness by a madman who lost himself in the jungle is one of the most significant and greatest films made. A great companion piece, by the way, is Hearts of Darkness, the movie that Coppola's wife made about the making of the movie."
Mr-Fusion,"May 14, 2015",6/10,"It took me a bit to nail down the reason for my less-than-fawning reaction to ""Apocalypse Now"" - after all, this movie's so damn revered - but, surprisingly, it's Martin Sheen's voyage up-river (which is really the bulk of the movie). I'm surprised as anyone, seeing as I generally dig his stuff. But his journey into Cambodia just tends to meander through the film. Sure, there are firefights mixed in, but none of this is ever as exciting or mysterious as the film's two most winning features: Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando. And they're only present for such a short time. Duvall is just such a larger than life sociopath; it doesn't hurt that he's at the forefront of the movie's wildest set piece, but he owns the screen. I'm fairly certain the man's ruined ""Ride of the Valkyries"" for me (hijacked, not soured). And Brando looms so large over the entire movie that, you're left wondering what kind of answers are coming when Sheen finally tracks him down. And it's a hallucinatory payoff, to be sure.6/10"
s-49457-63906,"Jun 20, 2022",5/10,I did not enjoy Apocalypse Now. I think what makes a movie that I enjoy is a connection to the characters in some way whether it be a relation to them or an emotional connection throughout the story and for some reason I didn't get that in this film. That is the reason that this movie doesn't resonate with me.
NeanderthalDNA,"Feb 15, 2017",10/10,"During the Vietnam War, the young American Captain Willard is given the assignment to hunt down and kill one of his own: Colonel Kurtz, who has apparently gone insane, murdered hundreds of innocent people and constructed a strange kingdom for himself deep in the jungle. Willard and his crew embark on a surreal river journey to find Kurtz, meeting along the way a Lieutenant-Colonel who surfs during live combat, Playboy bunnies dropped in by helicopter to entertain rowdy troops, and the inhabitants of a French plantation trapped in colonial times.Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is not a Vietnam War film. Do not confuse it with one. It is set to the back drop of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced, or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels. Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors ""The End"" as Martin Sheen's Captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes. Willard's mission is to ""terminate... with extreme prejudice"" Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and, as told by his general, is ""out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops."" Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard, this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat, yet, the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior. Teaming up with a small crew, they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way, Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. During Sheen's raspy voice over, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led. The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away. Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythic figure, he is drawn to the man's power and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decay will parallel that of Kurtz's. Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unmatchable. His genius: undeniable. But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer, as a hack. He is most certainly not. Brando was difficult to work with, hard to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity. If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppola's actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man's fanatical struggle to produce a movie. It is reported that during the film's 200 plus day principle photography schedule, Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheen's haunted soldier Willard. I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented, films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film-making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today's standards for film: a lack of innovation. It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola's masterpiece, a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend. That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can unhinge. But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress, unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual, the savage and the animalistic. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis."

barnabyrudge,"Aug 1, 2005",10/10,"Apocalypse Now is a stunning film on many levels, and a film that reverberates long after the viewer has come away from it. Visually remarkable, thematically frightening, filled with haunting and dream-like sequences that show the horror and insanity of war in intense detail, it is a film that can be watched and re-watched endlessly without ever failing to throw up new surprises. It was greeted with huge controversy when released in 1979, and almost thirty years on remains as powerful an experience. One thing that has altered over the years is the critical reaction to Marlon Brando's performance as the renegade Colonel Kurtz. Initially, Brando's performance was heavily criticised for being impenetrable and inscrutable (it didn't help that he arrived on set overweight and unprepared), but over the years the cleverness of his interpretation of Kurtz has become more apparent. Kurtz is a man alternately psychotic and eccentric, and always dangerous, and in retrospect Brando's bizarre approach to the role captures the character's insanity quite ingeniously. Those who complain they cannot understand what Kurtz is talking about in the film's final scenes are missing the point - he is lost in his own phantasmagoria and we are not meant to understand his demented ramblings.The story, an updated and relocated adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, deals with an emotionally-scarred Special Services soldier, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), who is instructed to travel upriver into Cambodia on a highly dangerous mission. It seems that a once brilliant colonel, named Kurtz (Marlon Brando), has retreated into the deepest jungle and formed a private army of Montagnard warriors. Quite mad, yet totally influential, Kurtz sends his loyal followers on horrific genocide missions and lords over them like some self-appointed God. Willard's job is to find and eliminate the colonel, an unsound and embarrassing thorn in the side of the American war effort. On his perilous journey to Kurtz's lair, Willard undergoes various surreal and horrifying adventures, the most remarkable of which is a helicopter attack on an enemy village led by the deranged Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who likes the play The Ride Of The Valkyries on loudspeakers during his airborne raids because ""his boys love it..... and it scares the hell out of the gooks!""The film was a real ordeal to make. The shoot in the Phillipines spiralled over budget and took an unprecedented length of time to complete. A typhoon destroyed much of the equipment and the sets; Sheen suffered a near-fatal heart attack despite only being in his 30s. But the decision by Coppola to make the film under such authentic conditions, with no studio filming or special effects trickery, ultimately pays off. This is war like never before seen on film. Nihilistic, horrifying, destructive, pointless, perversely exciting and shockingly brutal. The much-criticised ending, with its heavy symbolism and (pretentious?) ambiguity, has frequently been viewed as the film's main flaw. But in all honesty, was there any other way to end a film of this nature? Would a nice, neat ending in which the loose ends are tidily tied together really fit in a film which goes so far out of its way to blur conventions, morals and reality? Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece - a challenging, unflinching, thought-provoking journey into the heart of darkness which asks many disturbing questions but refuses to yield any easy answers."
RNMorton,"Feb 27, 2005",10/10,"It smells like......victory. I wasn't there in Vietnam, just a tad too young. I guess it would be possible to do a movie about that war that displays its insanity better, but I certainly haven't seen it. Martin Sheen and crew of small PBR gunboat are sent deep (and I mean DEEP) into the unclaimed jungle to terminate renegade U.S. Army officer Brando. With each mile they travel civilization moves further and further away. Surrealistic film style captures perfectly what must have been the hell of Vietnam in-country (or any other kind of) service. Duvall is memorable as arrogant air cav officer obsessed with surfing even in the midst of bloody shore assault. Sheen (who I think suffered a heart attack during the filming) is Oscar-caliber as an ordinary guy just trying to do his damn job in the midst of bedlam, and Hall does well in role of stoic gunboat chief. As much as anything this movie turned the post-war attitude of many, like myself, who thought at the time that we should have been there. When you go this far out on a limb there are going to be some hits and some misses. Brando and the movie's final episodes are pretty much of a miss (Hopper makes it bearable), but the rest of the movie is so damn good it almost doesn't matter; the trip rather than the destination is the big story. I initially had problems with the Redux version as it adds to an already mammoth running time, but I've gotten to like very much the French colonial sequence and also Duvall's surfboard search. There are few moments in cinema that top Sheen's monologue inner voice talking about his mission and Kurtz on his way into the jungle. Another of those movies I feel like I lived, in this case its unpleasantness (that I also live with) keeps me from stopping by too often."
Danny_G13,"Aug 17, 2004",9/10,"Knowing little about Apocalypse Now bar it being set during the Vietnam conflict, I viewed the Redux version with a completely open mind.Having journeyed through a 3 hour 15 minute epic I can only say this really is as breathtaking and brilliant a movie as I'd been led to believe.Martin Sheen is Captain Willard, a soldier stationed in Saigon after various missions in Vietnam. Holed up alone, he is picked to undertake an assassination mission of the reclusive Colonel Kutz, played by the ever-marvellous Marlon Brando. Getting to Kutz will not be easy, such is the isolation he's ended up in deep in Cambodia. The mission is based on the fact the American army believes Kutz to have become insane, and commanding armies on the wrong side of the war. 'His methods are unsound'. Willard must infiltrate Kutz' army and murder the man himself.However, to say it will be an epic journey is an understatement of some magnitude and summing it all up is practically impossible.The many strengths of this movie result in a level of depth which is quite flabbergasting. The acting is absolutely outstanding and incredibly convincing. We undoubtably care about the characters such is the warmth and affection with which they are portrayed. Even the lesser-featured characters are vastly significant in their own right, such as Robert Duvall's gung-ho Kilgore - he loves the smell of napalm in the morning. And then there's the spaced out but endearing photographer, played by the energetic Dennis Hopper. Similar character to who he was in Easy Rider, but more exaggerated here.Then there is the quite superb direction/cinematography. Each scene has an amazing amount of life within it, with camera work which has to be seen to be believed. Some of the shots are just astounding, either encompassing impressive scale battle, or more humble close ups. I don't quite know how Ford Coppola did it, but this was a masterstroke and a lesson in filmmaking.A review of Apocalypse Now would be empty without mention of the enigmatic Brando. Every scene he is in he steals just as he did in the Godfather. The man was the human embodiment of the brilliance of cinema, and while he's not on-screen for a massive amount, he still becomes by far and away the most important and intriguing character in the entire tale.To summise, Apocalypse Now is everything a movie needs to be; gripping, dramatic, intruiging, exciting and personable.One of the all time greats? Without doubt."

hunter1269,"Nov 13, 2003",N/A,"The most obvious influence for this movie isn't a movie, it's a book. Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"". Kurtz is the same character in the movie and in the book, and Willard represents Marlow from the book. Even the character played by Dennis Hopper comes from ""Heart of Darkness"". The book is about the colonization and exploitation of Africa by the Europeans in the late 1800s. The setting is on the Congo river, and they travel up the river closer towards ""Darkness"" or Kurtz. This is the same paralell as the river in Vietnam depicted in Apocalypse Now. I thought the movie was great, and much easier to stay involved with than the Stream of Consciousness writing style that is present in Conrad's Heart of Darkness."
dpenzel,"May 17, 2005",6/10,"The one question that ""Apocalypse Now"" should leave in the minds of everyone who sees it is ""Why was this movie ever made?"". For starters, it is a direct lift from Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"", which is a short story that makes its points briefly and without fuss. It proposes to examine the disaster that was the Vietnam war, but takes forever to make its points, and then makes them with a bludgeon. It is a collection of setpieces and lacks a natural feel. It also features the worst performance Marlon Brando ever turned in. From the moment he appears on the screen he affects the movie the way a rotting whale carcass washed ashore affects a beach party. I missed the opening credits the first time I saw it and was shocked at the end to see that Harrison Ford had been in it. And for a final over-made point, listen to the code word Martin Sheen uses to call in the airstrike. That is not to say that there aren't some good things in it. The Philippine scenery was used well. Frederick Forrest was as good as he can be, and that little scene with the tiger is a gem. Robet Duvall was excellent, and the helicopter assault is one of the best flying sequences ever filmed, a real triumph of editing. My own recommendation is that even if it is pretentious and overblown, it is still worth seeing - a superb failure."
helms-are,"Feb 2, 2008",1/10,"What a waste of my time! I DID like Apocalypse Now quite a lot, but I'm so absolutely disgusted by the ""REDUX"" that I'll never watch either again. It's one thing to act, it's quite another to show someone hacking at a water buffalo with a machete FOR REAL!!!!! Perhaps before the movie started, a comment that stated it contained the butchering of real animals would have been appropriate! An unacceptable rating from the humane society isn't enough, not by a long shot. For all those who would say it was a ritual that these people actually perform, I say this... I wasn't watching a documentary of fact, nor was I watching a movie that gave the slightest indication that it contained such nightmarish images! NASTY!"
PLundblad,"Sep 2, 2001",10/10,"River revisitedApocalypse Now Redux sets a new standard among the 'Directors Cut'-versions of old classics that has continued to surface during the last decade. True, most of these versions has been better than the originals  most notably the versions of Blade Runner and The Abyss  but they have been more or less the same movie with a few changes. But when 53 minutes  roughly one third of the running time  of unknown events been added to a familiar story, we are set with a new story. Therefore it's more accurate to regard this as a new movie. And there's no doubt about it, this one is even better then the original. To be more precise, it's 53 minutes better The inserts are many, but here's a basic rundown of the major events thats new: First of all, the famous scene on the beach where the mad Colonel wipes out an entire village in order to surf there, has been extended with a clever twist: Willard and his crew steals the colonels surf-board as they sneak off with their boat. The colonel is very upset by this, and pursues them with helicopters. The tape recorder in the chopper doesn't play Wagner any more, though. Instead we hear the colonel on a taped message in which he begs them to return his surfboard to him. That's a scene that has been extended. But there are some scenes that we have never seen before at all. One is a follow-up to the scene where the Playboy Playmates drive the soldiers to a frenzy. They find them again further up in the jungle where they have been stranded, and trade diesel to sexual favours in return from them. These scenes are both observant and strong, and seem very logic as a follow up to the earlier scene. But the best new sequence is when Willard and the crew on the boat arrives to a ragged French rubber-plant in the jungle. A few bits of this has been seen before, in the documentary of the making of Apocalypse Now.This sequence is actually one of the fundaments of the story in the movie. It's quite long, and incorporates several key lines, that are at the core of the story. 'We fight because we fight for our home, for whats been ours for seventy years', says the owner of the plantation. 'You americans, you fight for the worlds biggest nothing', he continues to Willard. There's also a short love affair between Willard and a woman at the plantation. 'Don't you understand theres two of you?' she says to Willard. 'One that loves. And one that hates.' This is one of the key elements to the movie, and adds to our understanding of how and why Willards personality changes as they travel up the river. The ending is much longer. More scenes when Willard confronts Kurtz are added. It doesn't clarify much, though. Sane reasoning and logic has still ceased to exit at the macabre and horrible place at the end of the river. And one of the reasons that I absolutely love this movie is that its narrative and structure follows the dramatic path its characters experience when they travel there.Per Lundblad"
axiom-3,"Nov 2, 2004",10/10,"As Captain Willard lays on his bed and watches the fan blades spin round, it triggers off memories of the helicopters and a past mission that he was once part of. It is this extremely effective and entrancing opening sequence that quickly establishes Apocalypse Now as a movie for the mind.The viewer is taken on a strange journey up the river to meet an enigmatic figure known as Kurtz through the eyes of Willard (as narrator). On the journey we gain an insight in to the many dark facets of war and the effect that it has on one's humanity. Whether it be the insanity, the humour, the surrealness etc. It all comes across very effectively, with the characters in this film refreshingly real and the dialouge pertinent and on occasion genuinely funny.Apocalypse Now does not make the mistake (as many other war films tend to do) of manipulating you into thinking a particular way, rather it is open-ended enough for you to draw your own conclusions. We are made to feel part of the crew and witness as they do and to have our own perceptions on the events as they occur. I tend to see a movie not that one watches, but experiences.The technical aspects of the film are amazing. The cinematography is breath-taking with each scene exquisitely detailed both visually and sonically. The use of natural light in many scenes is superb (such as the mango sequence) while the music highlights the mood perfectly (The Doors was a perfect choice for the opening). The action sequences were superbly edited, especially the helicopter attack sequence coupled with Wagner blaring in the background which adds to the thrill of that scene.Not a completely realistic film, but I don't believe that that was the vision or the intent. If you crave realism, go rent Platoon as a companion piece to this. When I first saw this film (which wasn't that long ago) I knew it would be one the greatest films I'd ever see just from the first 5 or so minutes. It's a far-reaching film that delivers on all counts."
Brandon_Robert_Kersjes,"Sep 28, 2022",9/10,"If you've ever watched a film or show that blew you away, then missed the feeling of seeing it for the first time, this film, has the unprecedented ability to inflict that sensation upon viewers, viewing after viewing. Each time one sees this film from beginning to end, a new experience is revealed and another understanding of the film is discovered. This, in my opinion is the greatest trait a film can hold. It keeps one guessing while always giving just enough information to avoid becoming a psuedo intellectual film-school discussion piece. This film is both a blockbuster and an art house film. Amazing film."

The film delves deep into the darkness of the human soul, exploring the moral and ethical dilemmas that soldiers face when they are pushed to their limits. It is a film that challenges the viewer to confront uncomfortable truths about the nature of war and the human condition.Overall, ""Apocalypse Now"" is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate audiences over four decades after its release.

m_madhu,"Oct 4, 2001",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola'a Apocalypse Now is one of the best war movies ive ever seen. the movie is extremely long (in fact i saw the original version, the redux version is longer!!) - but there is not one moment when it gets boring. the movie is an excellent voyage voyage into the minds of people in war.martin sheen as captain willard is simply brilliant. Marlon Brando is no great shakes - hes hardly there in the movie. this is a martin sheen movie all the way and he carries it off tremendously aided by the brilliant cinematography and directorial style of the inimitable coppola, who knows how to shock the viewer with his terrific exploration of the shades of grey. one thing that amazes me about coppola's movies - be it godfather, apocalypse now or even dracula - is the way that it portrays neither good nor evil. the chief characters have a bit of both in them.Apocalypse now is a  masterpiece in showing the mental trauma of war. there are many scenes in the movie that will be etched in your memory forever. the chracters are tremendously believable and original. each scene is honest.The other standout features in the movie are its chilling dialogs and the terrific soundtrack to the movie - coppola uses popular classic rock songs from the sixties to terrific effect, the songs highlight the scenes and add a tremendous aural backdrop to the visual scenes. the songs usually take over during the pauses for the audience to think. the dialogs of course are the ones that make you think anyway, especially the narration.its hard to discuss the movie without taking away its impact, suffice it to say that this is a movie that will stay with you for a long time. one of the greatest movies of alltime.a chilling 10!"
EdgarST,"Jul 2, 2006",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindness, and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture, the increase of violence and death in the streets...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare, be different, and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures. Coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life, the reason of death, or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work, made against all odds, chronicled in the 1991 documentary ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse""; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen. This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture, but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously, ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Coming Home"", or in latter ones as ""Platoon"" and ""Casualties of War"", before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre, as horror in ""Jacob's Ladder"", or comedies as ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war."
paulclaassen,"Mar 12, 2024",7/10,"There are different versions of 'Apocalypse Now'. If you - like me - prefer a faster paced film without all the extra scenes, then I suggest the Theatrical version, which is 147 minutes long. (The Final Cut runs 182 minutes, while the Redux version runs 202 minutes!)The horrors of war does strange things to a man. Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) believes he is a god, and taking matters into his own hands by killing innocent people and destroying villages. The soldiers under his command follow his orders however ridiculous.The Army believes Kurtz to be insane, and orders Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) to follow Kurtz, infiltrate his team, and terminate his command. Together with a small team, Willard head up the river in search of Kurtz. As Willard reads Kurtz's dossier, we get a good background on Kurtz, and realized he made some questionable decisions in his career.There's plenty of action along the way. 'Apocalypse Now' is an impressively well made movie with stunning battle sequences, excellent cinematography, and amazing visuals. The Theatrical version is definitely the best cinematic experience, since the action in the Redux version is slowed down significantly by additional scenes involving the characters that doesn't contribute in any way to the film. You therefore won't miss anything by cutting out around 49 minutes.With Kurtz being accused of being insane, the film also becomes a descent into madness as it hurtles towards the end. The moment Willard encounters Kurtz, the film takes a dramatic turn, plummeting into weirdness...and I mean this literally (in the film).In general, I was highly impressed with 'Apocalypse Now'."
amilisic44-1,"Aug 14, 2006",1/10,"What an awful movie. The worst thing of all is the amount of written material and other forms of mystification produced about it. The whole film is based on the terrible misreading of Joseph Conrads brilliant ""Heart of Darknes"". Coppola turned something which is genuinely a brilliant piece of written fiction into a 3 or more hours of visual disaster. A complex narrative turned into an ordinary kitsch. If there is nothing to understand, it doesn't mean it's masterpiece; it's just stupid. This film is just going nowhere from the beginning to the end. The final scenes, involving Hopper and Brando are the lamest thing I've ever seen. I mean, it's more lame than Troll2: totally bizarre and unmotivated. Read ""Heart of Darkness"" and you'll see what I'm talking about. From technical aspect film is really marvelous, but the whole concept is so pathetic that nothing can save it. Disaster. 1/10"
rudolfsbojars,"Oct 10, 2017",10/10,"Whenever a conversation regarding your favorite movies come up, without hesitation Apocalypse Now always comes forth as the primary contender. Although it took me multiple viewings until I fully started to appreciate the movie for the masterpiece that it was. That for me seems to be the only downside of most truly great films- just a few hours are given for the immersion into the lives of several nuanced characters. While the (mostly) time consuming act of reading a great novel grants the opportunity to grasp the atmosphere of the plot without having to reread.While obviously the movie revolves around the Vietnam war, the historical conflict itself seems to merely be used as a background. In fact, as quite a few other reviewers have pointed out, it has barely any real connection with the actual day to day life of the American soldier during the war. Instead it is a surreal and intense character study of psychologically distinct individuals on a boat going down the same route of consecutive stages of war-induced madness. Only a select few can endure the trip deep in to the heart of darkness without on the way losing oneself to violent bravado, lust and degradation, madness or cold, detached indifference for the rest of the world. This theme becomes more apparent as the characters delve further down the river, deeper into the jungle, slowly abandoning the Vietnam theater while the film adapts a more surreal, almost metaphysical focus.It certainly is one of those movies that divides an audience and to its discredit far too often is compared with other films of the same (or similar) genre. Though it is truly unique, and the fact that (at least to my knowledge) for all these years since its creation no other director has dared to emulate something which doesn't seem to have a tangible formula, speaks for its longevity."
ville_koistinen,"Mar 13, 2005",10/10,"I watched this movie the first time last summer alone in my apartment and the digital clock showed that time was 02:30AM. Over three hours later, while the sun was climbing above the horizon, I had watched the best movie ever. I just sat in my chair and I was just shocked, amazed and stunned from the strength that Apocalypse Now: Redux had hit me. It took me twenty minutes to come back to Planet Earth.The acting was superb, Martin Sheen did a wonderful job as a man who is fed up with war but can't withdraw from it. Martin Sheen's monologues were very intense and every line had an effect on me. I was very anxious at seeing Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz the first time I watched this, so it almost ruined the whole movie. The second time I watched this I was even more struck by a lightning than the first time.The best thing about this movie was the mood. Coppola's directing made that and also Sheen's voice. But I can't praise this movie enough, so enough of my jabbering, watch this movie and have the greatest movie-experience of your lifetime.10/10"
strange-6,"Jan 12, 2002",10/10,"I don´t know which version of the film I´ve seen, I have a VHS version that has the playmates scene, and does not has B52s bombing Kurtz´headquarters...anyway, all what this movie is about is that war is total madness. A crazy colonel that attacks a Vietcong town only to go surfing? I can buy that, and the playmates also! This film has its surreal moments, but it is just a way of showing how unreal reality (and war) can be. War can twist off anyone´s mind. A total masterpiece."
dndcullens,"Jan 23, 2004",9/10,"For years I have been annoying friends and family with the following question: Which famous movie quote is delivered by an unknown actor as the his only line in the movie and he never worked again? The best answer I could get was ""I quit!"" but the correct answer is ""Terminate with extreme Prejuice"" but until now I could never name the actor and was unsure about the last bit. Now thanks to IMDb I am able to see that it was in fact Jerry Ziesmer and see that it was in fact not his only movie. Thank you IMDb but now I am just left with one annoying question: ""Who is Stroder Martin?"" As for the movie it is one of those you either love or hate. I love it. At the time it was made Coppola was on top form and could get away with the excesses he did (like the character Kurtz who ""is operating out there without any control) but the movie stands as a testiment to one of America's best ever film makers. It is a pity he has not been able to discover his best form since then (although I did enjoy Bram Stokers Dracula) but if you listen to his DVD commentary on one of his lesser known projects ""The Godfather"" you can hear that he doesn't have the heart for movie making anymore which is a shame. But he has left us with the two Godfather movies (the less said about the third the better) and this masterpiece which rates a 9 out of 10."
rzajac,"Sep 12, 2003",N/A,"Believe it or not, I have only just seen the redux.What's interesting is what the redux adds:  For one thing, it better highlights the idea that if Kurtz didn't have a method, he did have (or had had) a goal:  ""Winning"" in Vietnam.  And this dovetails with another image from the original, nicely paired with a new image in the redux.  Image one, from the Playmate USO show:  While the Americans had myriad choices, the Vietnam had a choice between victory or death.  Image two, from the French plantation, reminding us that the French had actually built something there in Vietnam.  What did the Americans have?  The Dominoe Theory.  In other words, we didn't have s**t, and the redux drives this home a little better.I love this movie because it's still a bit of a Rorschach.  It's a mystery wrapped in an enigma, or some f**kin' thing.  To wit:  Are we ever given a satisfactory picture of the meaning behind Kurtz?  The redux seems a little better at conveying the feel of approaching an event horizon, where morality and reality becomes more chaotic and splintered, and it would not be meet and right to expect to be able to walk away ""resolved.""  The movie resolves by resolutely evading a clear resolution.  But there are mirror shards whipping by our heads at 400mph, bearing fleeting perspectives.  Maybe Kurtz *is* ""America in Vietnam.""  Maybe we won't understand the meaning of the Vietnam War until we understand that the best picture we'll ever get of that is Kurtz.  Which is to say that we simply engineered, to the tune of $400B (which, I heard, only *just* got paid off), a horror show to fulfill our Daily Minimum Requirement for The Horror.All that said, there were still a few bits that maybe should have been left out.  The scene with the Bunnies meeting and greeting the crew was unnecessary.  Specifically, Willard engineers the deal--2 tins of diesel for a couple hours with the bunnies--and this is distinctly out of character for the spartan Willard.  The scenes at the French Plantation were a mix 'n' match; Clean's burial; good.  Explanation of prior French integration into Viet society; good.  Opium and sex; again, glaringly out of character for Willard.  Any time Willard cracks a smile or otherwise distracts from his own proto-Kurtz philosophy has to remain suspect.This was a great movie and remains a great movie.  See it."
burtonloyd,"Sep 25, 2022",7/10,"The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's 'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in, stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity.This film has its famous moment, some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen. It doesn't require any intellectual understanding, although the film is intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity: to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date. During the current situations of the world, where they are trying to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation. It asks for realism."
starry-2,"Oct 18, 2019",10/10,"This is an amazing and well priced definitive collection of one of the best films of the 1970s and perhaps of all time, the psychedelic and intense Vietnam war era film Apocalypse Now. Like the director (Francis Ford Coppola, who also directed the Godfather series and The Conversation- another best of the 70s film) said in a press conference...this film IS Vietnam. This edition consists of the recently assembled ''final cut""...which is somewhere in length between what was the Redux version and the original 1978 cut. I find it a little more fascinating and gets a little more in depth about the journey and mission martin sheen's character gets involved with. It's the best of Redux really. But what's great about this set is that it comes with all three versions on 3 separate discs so no one is left unsatisfied. It also comes with regular 1080p blu ray versions along with the fantastic unique behind the scenes documentary from 1991 called Hearts Of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. I would rate the 4k visual presentation at 4 out of 5...the elements used in the transfer to digital are a little faded and I suspect multiple sources of film elements were used to make the final cut. However the cinematography of the film is so strong and well lit that it really overshadows any generational loss or fine details issues. The use of neutral density filters in the shooting of the film is prominent and the hdr color and wide contrast reproduction is vivid and blends beautifully. What is much more amazing is the work that went into the surround sound remix for this release. The low end pulses rather dramatically and deeply and the high end fidelity is penetrating. The use of The Doors' ""The End"" song in the infamous dazzling opening shots/scenes are so mesmerizing and spacious that it gets right deep into your brain via your ears and vibrations through your spinal column. This film is reputed as one of the best sound designed films and it's true. It's one of the only films in existence whereby you can listen to the film with the visuals/tv off and still be able to get the story of the film in great detail. It's a testament to pure artistry and psychology delivery via editing of sound and picture. This goes with Thanks to the ultra genius craftsman of film overall, Walter Murch. It's hard to say which cut is better, which is great that all 3 are here in this collection. I rate this film (no matter which cut/length) a 12 out of 10. The 4k restoration is a 4 out of 5 as stated previously and the sound reproduction, Do get this if you are a fan, or just curious. It's a rare perfect movie thats immersive- delving deep into morality, 'tripping out' and of course, madness. Get some Coppola estates red wine and a nice joint and kick back to this fine fine piece of cinema. Its a keystone and testament to how a story should be told."
stratsz28,"Sep 4, 2004",7/10,"APOCALYPSE NOW is a stunning movie, but it's not exactly a war movie.The cinematography was spectacular. The acting was mighty fine, with Sheen playing is part artfully and masterfully. The story was absorbing.My only major gripes with this movie are: 1.) it is a little confusing and takes a lot of mulling over to even approach some sort of explanation to the ending ( -- of course, the lack of logical thinking at the end is the point) and 2.) the movie is too surreal and unbelievable, and it exploits the Vietnam War as its backdrop.I liked PLATOON a lot more than this movie. While both movies examine the loss of innocence and lack of logic in the Vietnam war, PLATOON is more realistic, more touching, and more truthful. Watch PLATOON for a no-nonsense examination of the horrors of war, and watch APOCALYPSE NOW for its cinematic value.8/10"
operationgetbanned,"Nov 17, 2024",5/10,"Don't get me wrong, this is a beautifully shot, extremely well made movie. The problem is that's mostly all it has going for it because the story and characters just did not grip me. It is mostly style (amazing visuals, tons of stills that make great wallpapers) with not enough substance in terms of plot (the themes are great though). I enjoy slow burn movies when there is actually some build-up, but this movie spends most of its runtime with the characters going up the river to meet that AWOL captain but by the time the anticlimactic climax happens, I was just looking at the clock. I do admit Kurtz's rants near the end have some pretty great quotable lines, but I thought the ending felt a little rushed. More time should have been spent exploring Kurtz's insane psyche and less time watching rainforests pass by the boat while hearing Willard talk about mindless things.The narration just drones on and it becomes tiring. Is that supposed to be the point? Am I supposed to feel the immense boredom and alienation Willard felt crawling up the river? I think there's a fine line between emotionally exhausting movies on purpose (wanting to convey dread/suspense/disgust) and just exhausting movies. Call my attention span short but I didn't think the psychological and philosophical aspects of it were enough to overpower most of the movie being forgettable.That isn't to say this movie was boring start to finish, or that it didn't have memorable/iconic scenes. It had an intriguing idea for the plot and I could not wait for them to finally encounter Kurtz. But I was kept waiting. The entire sequence with Col. Kilgole was probably the highlight of the movie for me. The Ride of the Valkyries scene was so over the top but great, the surfing scene was pretty legendary. Kilgore is completely out of place in a war movie in the best way possible, he's another insane character in an insane world. One of my favorite scenes though was when they reach that abandoned camp. That scene was pretty haunting and one of the most memorable, it was the only time I felt the movie earned the adjective of ""surreal"" it often receives. The ""I told you not to stop"" boat scene was also masterfully done.I was very excited for this movie because I wanted to finally watch a war movie that wasn't just grisly action and maybe had some thought-provoking, suspenseful aspect to it. This did provoke some thought, but unfortunately some of my thoughts were ""how long does this have left?"" I can't believe there's an even longer version (I watched Theatrical), I don't think I would have finished Redux.This is a very iconic film I tried to enjoy and wish I could have, but it was just not for me."

quixoboy,"Dec 5, 2003",N/A,"...That's probably because my first-ever viewing of ""Apocalypse Now"" was in its ""Redux"" version - featuring around 40 minutes of additional footage that, in the 3-hour-plus product, apparently formed the crux of what was ORIGINALLY envisioned.Oh, well. I buy it. Contrary to what most others thought, I didn't have a problem with the film's somewhat bloated running length - though I shouldn't really be able to judge, as I have never, ever seen the film before. Fans of the original tend to side with it, and dismiss THIS 2001 re-release as a cheap marketing gimmick (which most re-releases usually are). Nevertheless, I wasn't too bothered by its epic pace; this masterful Vietnam war picture had an impact that resonated with me all the more strongly BECAUSE of its longevity. The next week I ended up viewing the tighter, original 1979 version - and, while still obviously good, I found I somewhat preferred the newer version, for its fascinating additions that lent new depth and meaning to its images.This is a terrific, and shockingly realistic drama, showcasing unbelievable performances from an all-star cast backed by a legendary director. Obviously enough has been said about the infamous ordeal that countless cast and crew members went through to make it on location. The result was well worth it, and provides an insightful, thoroughly enjoyable window into the hellish, surreal world of the Vietnam war."
swmoncur,"Feb 6, 2022",7/10,"No doubt, a stunning film when it comes to the visual effects--all of which were created without the use of CGI. There was an abundance of real explosions, planes, helicopters, napalm, etc. That all added to the visual beauty of the movie. This aspect alone deserves a very high rating.Where I think the movie fell short was with regards to the plot and pace. The storyline is interesting enough, but the execution was lacking IMO and the pacing didn't help. Development of the plot was very slow. Surely this was on purpose (meant to mirror the film's setting / subject matter), but I felt that it detracted from the enjoyability. Acting performances were good across the board, but nobody stood out in particular.Wish I had loved this one as much as the general populations seems to, but I just felt there were too many elements that were just OK to justify a GREAT rating (8+)."
telltime,"Mar 6, 2019",5/10,"I am not a big fan of this movie. I understand that its disjointedness and melancholy feel is supposed to be representative of the war, but I found it absurd in many ways. I remember my response when my wife asked me what I was watching and, when I told her, she asked if it was as good as they say. I told her that the cinematography was phenomenal, but the story line was not believable and most of the characters were not accurate representations of 90% of the people who served in Vietnam.In my opinion, Vietnam is the war in which film makers still want to use to push a pacifist or leftist agenda. There were hundreds of thousands of Vietnam veterans who served their country proudly and loyally who have yet to have their story told. And this film's artistic blend of the worst of the worst did not sit well with me."
kevin_robbins,"Oct 30, 2022",10/10,"Apocalypse Now (1979) is a movie that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Netflix. The storyline follows an officer assigned to special missions in Vietnam whose in R&R. He is awaken one morning and asked to track down a rogue Colonel who has created his own kingdom in Africa and is seen as a god. He will need to navigate the war, make some friends, infiltrate the Colonel's cult and find a way to bring him down.This movie is directed by legend Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather) and stars Martin Sheen (The Believers), Marlon Brando (The Godfather), Robert Duvall (The Apostle), Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix), Frederic Forrest (Falling Down), Harrison Ford (Star Wars), Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider) and Scott Glenn (The Silence of the Lambs).The cinematography in this movie is absolutely out of this world as is the soundtrack. The scenes of the helicopters and the areal shots of the jungle are tremendous as is the explosions and action scenes. The film seems realistic and as authentic as any in the war genre. The acting by the entire cast is tremendous and Sheen delivers my all time favorite performance of his. The narration is awesome throughout the movie and helps set the mood of every sequence. The details of events that went on during the war were fun subplots. The arrival at the final compound was fascinating and had a dark cloud over it the entire time. Brando really brings the movie home and creates a tremendous conclusion.Overall, this has to be a top 3 all time great war genre picture. I would score this an easy 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
Schwag09,"Sep 22, 2017",10/10,"Apocalypse Now is a deployment to war-ridden Vietnam on acid. It's an exploration of human darkness with the faint scent of napalm in the air. A glimpse into sweltering madness only to turn around and question whether you've entered the rabbit hole yourself. When you're done watching it you'll wonder whether Francis Ford Coppola's best work was in fact behind him. Another of the greats that detailed a bloody excursion in the South Pacific; think Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter, and Platoon. However, despite being an ever-popular topic of film, Apocalypse Now presents a unique perspective on the war as it adapts a previously unrelated story.Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on an ill-defined mission into Cambodia to hunt down Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). A mission wrought with inefficiency and bureaucracy eventually begins to wear on Willard. Kurtz is wanted for murder, but "" charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets in the Indy 500."" During Willard's painstaking trip up river he slowly discovers more about the mysterious Kurtz and the nature of this horrific war. How can you destroy and man who's already destroyed himself? To what lengths will we go to maintain sanity in an insane place? Kurtz flows with the river and sways with the jungle like an omniscient, omnipresent ghost. The familiar puttering of the boat engine is our only form of solace as the vines begin to wrap around us and the water appears to pull us upriver.The War is put on display as a series of decisions made by four-star generals sitting in air-conditioned offices somewhere. An attempt at traditional war during exceptional circumstances. Desperate times don't call for moderate measures. Kurtz is the wild card and Willard is sent to clean up after him before he becomes a wild card himself. If the Vietnam War was an asylum, the inmates would surely be running it.Overall, Coppola provides a thought-provoking adaptation of Heart of Darkness. The contemporary nature of the film makes it more approachable than the original story. Despite becoming somewhat of a case-study of movie production problems during filming, Apocalypse Now is undoubtedly one of the best films to come out of the 20th century. It is often the most trying times that provide the most artistic inspiration, and this film is certainly a testament to that."
rick-908,"Jul 10, 2006",10/10,"I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. ""Charlie Don't Surf"". Robert Duvall's famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition. It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks."
nived84,"Aug 16, 2006",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is an absolute masterpiece. It doesn't really matter which version of the film you watch; the original '79 version, or the restored and extended ""Redux"" cut. Francis Ford Coppola has said that he personally prefers the longer cut of the film which was finally restored in 2001 and added an additional fifty minutes of footage cut from the original release because of it's already long running time of two and a half hours. When I first saw Apocalypse Now I watched the original version and I was instantly taken by it. It was dark, twisted, and surreal and unlike any other war film I had seen before. A few years later I watched the 2001 ""Redux"" version and was a bit disappointed with it initially. The extra fifty minutes didn't really seem to add much more substance to the overall picture and in return just ended up slowing down the film so much that it just dragged on. Since that time I have only watched the original cut of the film on DVD and still love it. It's one of my all-time favorite war films and probably the best Vietnam war film I've ever seen, and if it's not the best, because certainly Oliver Stone's Platoon is another Vietnam war film that I hold in very high regard, but if Apocalypse Now isn't the best film on Vietnam it's certainly the most original, darkest and fascinating.The film uses Joseph Conrad's novel ""Heart of Darkness"" as the basis for the plot, but setting it in the middle of the Vietnam War. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) leads a top secret classified mission to travel by boat up a long and dangerous river into Cambodia to assassinate a rouge Green Beret officer named Colonel Kurtz, played with a powerfully absorbing intensity by Marlon Brando. Kurtz seems to have gone completely and totally insane, and a local jungle tribe seems to have adopted him and worship him as some kind of God. Along the perilous journey the team encounters many strange and unusual people and places, including a gung-ho Lieutenant Colonel of the Air Calvary named Bill Kilgore, played great by a wild and fun Robert Duvall (in an Oscar nominated performance), that leads an all-out assault on a small village of Vietnamese, which is undoubtedly the most infamous sequence in the film. But that's just the beginning of this bizarre odyssey; as the small group of soldiers makes their way up the river they also meet some Playboy Playmates, and come across a nighttime battle over a destroyed bridge that is nothing but absolute anarchy and chaos, with no one seemingly in control of the combat. And just wait until Captain Willard finally gets to meet Colonel Kurtz, face to face; it's well worth the wait. Oh, and the scene where the cow gets sacrificed, that wasn't faked; that was all done for real.Apocalypse Now is a wild and nightmarish vision of hell on Earth. Francis Ford Coppola's vision of the Vietnam War is so strange and surreal it might as well take place on an entirely different planet all together. The performances are all superb, not a single weak link among them. Among my favorites though has to be Dennis Hopper as an American photojournalist with a motor-mouth and always seems to be on the brink of madness. The Oscar-winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is phenomenal, and crisp with bolder darks and beautifully bright colors that look even better on the new DVD transfer. It looks so good it's actually hard to believe that the film is nearly thirty years old. And the action sequences are just another aspect of the film that seems to hold up amazingly well over the years. The helicopter attack sequence is breathtaking and still impressive, even by today's standards. The music of Apocalypse Now is another pretty interesting topic. It's mostly an orchestral score done with synthesizers and a few rock tunes from The Rolling Stones (""I can't get no satisfaction"") and The Doors (""The End"") and Robert Wagner's classical march ""The Ride of the Valkyries"", which is a piece of music that has become infamous with the film.I recently re-watched the ""Redux"" cut of Apocalypse Now and must say that I did enjoy it more a second time around. Some scenes, while still feeling long and maybe a bit excessive, don't really feel as uninteresting or unimportant anymore. The additional sequence with the Playmates does still seem to be pretty pointless to me, but the scene with the French plantation now seems to have more of a purpose; of reminding Willard of man's potential for both good and evil. This scene used to seem slow and pointless, now it seems to make a little more sense when you think more about the ending and how important choices of good and evil play out. The extra fifty minutes of restored footage in the ""Redux"" cut seems to add a lot more character development and a little more comradeship to the soldiers, but also it makes the journey up the river longer and more ""tiring"", but in a good way. Personally I like both versions of the film, but choosing which one to watch really depends on what kind of film you're in the mood for. The original cut is more straightforward and to the point. Apocalypse Now Redux is a little more taxing to sit through (running at three hours and twenty two minutes), but has more substance, nudity and truly carries the weight of a dangerous and surreal journey into the heart of darkness. But which ever version you chose to watch, either way it's a masterpiece."
iquine,"Nov 7, 2019",10/10,"(Flash Review)It would be overly-simplistic to call this film intense. It is visually and physiologically intense in the hands of a director who took bold chances and with top actors in the prime. While many describe this film as a surreal look at war, many others call it realistic as war can be that insane. Nevertheless, the Army assigns Captain Willard (Sheen) to make his way up the Nung River to locate and assassinate a highly intelligent and decorated officer Col. Kurtz. (Brando). The film is about the journey up stream and the bizarre, brutal, surreal and unexpected encounters that cross their path. Many unforgettable scenes yank emotion from the viewer accompanied by an effective and at times novel music score. The acting and screenplay are tremendous and this is a definitive epic not to be viewed on a whim."
tostinati,"Oct 15, 2001",N/A,"Contains spoilers. The problems I see with the film now: First, Dennis Hopper. At some point Hopper transcended (?) Actor and became a sort of floating Saturday Night Live celebrity guest host for life. --No matter where he is or what he is doing, that is what he is. His characters are never credible, and even more than in the case of Brando, whose celebrity is a monumental thing to sublimate as you watch him, you never for an instant forget you are watching an Actor. Worse than his simple inability to fit into a scenario where verisimilitude is important, though, is the fact that he threatens to undermine the seriousness and horror of this film, by reminding one of the incessantly gibbering, fluttering Disney feature length cartoon comic relief (think of the china ware in Beauty and the Beast). If, along with the reinsertion of formerly edited footage, they could have reduced Hopper's hammy drive-in movie level role (think of Waterworld), they should have. His appearance so close to the end of the film, problematic as that ending already is, is especially damaging.Second, one is loath to say a clearer or more decisive ending would have been welcome or done the film a world of good. Yet after three hours of the most grueling verisimilitude, three hours in which you accept every surreal, absurd, horrific sight laid before you as Gospel truth, an ending that may act as a reality disconnect is a problem indeed. At the time of the 20th anniversary revival of Apocalypse Now, a friend of mine said ""It is a great film, but there is no way I can accept that the ending would have happened the way it does in the film in real life."" Not having seen the film at that point, I marked this off as a philistine gripe. It sounded like the complaint of someone disappointed that the ending wasn't a standard action film call-in-the-air-strike fireworks show.Now, just after having seen it, my friend's comment comes back to nag me. I am forced to concede it is entirely possible that the films agonizingly scrupulous mounting of tone and purpose, one of the most stunning in all film, is damaged by an ending that may make the viewer balk, or at least question its verisimilitude. The end falters by removing us from the most horrifically concrete reality ever put on film --being stuck way up river in the middle of Vietnam during the war; could there be anything worse in the human imagination?-- and offering in place of the reality an arty, impressionistic, cop-out ending that puts a handy Subjectivist toggle switch on Reality/ Perception. Because of this, there is a painted-into-a-corner feeling to the ending, a feeling that an invitation to the audience to fill in the blank has been offered by an artist afraid or unable to complete his statement. The rigorously-wrought horror is dissipated.Understand, I don't enjoy complaining about this major film achievement. There was no other director in the world at the time-- or maybe even now-- who could have made this film. But the ending is just such an incredible letdown. And there is no way a weak ending can erase the gripping power and brilliance of the three hours before it. But if anything, it leaves this film a special dispensation case. As it stands, Apocalypse Now belongs in the company of Erich Von Stroheim's Queen Kelli or Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons-- films that stand as classics despite weak or unsatisfactory resolutions resulting from third-party intervention. Maybe health problems, the strain of crippling financial worries, over-taxed energy levels and the weight on the filmmakers' conscience of Viet Nam itself intervened here, preventing Coppola and company from achieving a wrap up wholly commensurate with the astounding body of this film. Or maybe they simply couldn't bear to put a period at the end of the sentence.Whatever the case, what remains is a complicated, genius film, far beyond the scope of a simple star rating system. (But be warned of animal slaughter scenes, by the way, that Coppola could only have gotten away with filming offshore. If this sort of thing disturbs you, maybe you should pass on the film altogether, because acts of apparently genuine animal slaughter unfortunately have been made integral to the layered ending.)"
o_cedar,"Jan 10, 2005",7/10,"I have just seen this movie for the first time, and it was the ReduX version. I really enjoyed it at the beginning, but then it dragged on for too long and that finally numbed me to the point of not liking the second part of the movie... Thus it is difficult for me to rate this movie because reading what was added to the first version, I must say that without these 50 supplementary minutes, it must really be a stunning experience... I would have given it a 6 for the ReduX version (interesting but far too long with the boring scenes that were added: Bunnies girls, plantation...) and the original version would probably have gotten an 8 or a 9... I rate it 7 then..."
hendrix-lives,"Aug 25, 2005",8/10,"Two words: Cutting edge. The film remained quite different from its surroundings at the time. It was the first war film in a long time to receive good acting while many war films were about glory and pure action. It depicted war as a depressing era of death and insanity. While other Nam movies like The Killing Fields (although a great movie) just killed off soldiers, Apocalypse Now made you feel like you lost a member of your family when a soldier died. I felt that the film was to long but with all the information in the film, it couldn't have been shorter. For todays standards people of a younger generation will not appreciate the brilliancy of this film sheerly because from a war film they would expect more violence than dialogue. The Redux version does not compare to the original version and many people will seem impatient as they watch. I suggest eighteen or over not because of the violence, but because it will not appeal to someone younger than that age."
