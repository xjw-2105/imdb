chuck-hickl,"Feb 4, 2019",9/10,"To watch this again after so many years and after so much has changed in movie making, what a joy. The intro scene itself is a work of cinematic genius. Too bad most these days don't have the patience or appreciation for the plot making and cinematography these days. If you appreciate excellent camera work, scene making and soundtrack working together, I can't imagine you would be disappointed in this movie."
mattywoh,"Nov 13, 2019",9/10,"I won't go into the story, but it's true, I never tire of this movie---At first i thought Charles Bronson wouldn't be able to keep up with acting heavyweights Henry Fonda and Jason Robards, but Bronson's physical abilities, combined with his minimalist close-ups practically steal the show---His goodness came through in the close-ups toward the movie's end, I thought it was Charles Bronson's greatest screen work."
thinker1691,"Jun 27, 2007",9/10,"In the annals of western film lore, there are good and bad films. This is one of the finest. Because ""Once Upon A Time in The West"" is such a remarkable film, it is hard to define what makes it so memorable. The story centers on a beautiful former prostitute called Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) who arrives to assume the role of wife to a stubborn, crazy, red-headed Irishman with a dream. Waiting, instead is tragedy and 'Mr. Morton' who is a powerful, but ailing land grabbing baron (Gabriele Ferzetti) who desires to crush everything and everyone who stands in his way to reach the Pacific ocean with his railroad. To help him is an equally ruthless gunfighter named Frank (Henry Fonda; the success of this movie owes much to Fonda who plays a very convincing heavy) who has been removing obstacles for years and now targets the McBain family for death and that includes Jill. Unfortunately for Frank, he has accrued many enemies over the years with one particular, mysterious and deadly Harmonica playing stranger seeking revenge. Frank arranges for three of his best and fastest gun hands to meet and eliminate the stranger at the train-station. Joining the instrument playing stranger is an unpredictable, half-breed, renegade, who is a notorious gunfighter called 'Cheyenne.' ( Jason Robards ) The entire film is a triumph to the superb direction of Sergio Leone, who christens each major character with their own theme song. Each theme was created by Ennio Morricone and when the character makes an entrance, the theme prepares the audience for mood change, drama, action, and lifelong memories. Special guest appearances, by Woody Strode, Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn and Lionel Stander add to the classic nature of this excellent story. ****"
bgkerfant-09664,"Sep 25, 2019",10/10,It's hard to believe this movie is from 1968. Very modern way of filming for the time. Sergio Leone gave time to each scene... something that new directors seem afraid to do... Great story about the last days of an era. Amazing music and the originality of linking a specific melody to each main character. And all these close-up to character's eyes... Just a wonderful movie.
TheDragonTrader,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,"In full silence, three mysterious men in long trench coats wait in a remote train station. Their faces have anticipation written all over them, even while the most interesting things they can find to do are toying with a fly, drinking water from a hat and cracking their fingers. A dog runs past. The windmill squeaks. The ticket vendor is locked away. The heath bounces off the wooden platform. The men sweat.Are you bored yet? Then this movie is probably not for you.But are you dying to know what the three men are waiting for? Does a light anxiety creep onto you whilst reading that description? Can't you wait for the tension to resolve? Then this movie is all you ever wanted.The almost lawless world where outlaws and bandits roam the country with ease that is the setting of the story, is shown by Tonino Delli Colli (director of photography) in all its splendorous grandeur and it's uncountable little details. The set pieces, the costumes and the real life locations in Arizona and Utah make everything believable. And together with the characters and figurants, everything creates a vibrant and utterly believable Western civilisation.Charles Bronson plays the man with the harmonica: a lone wolf looking for something that he chooses not to reveal to anyone until he gets it. A character with no name roaming the endless fields under the sun, announcing his presence at all times with the same melody he plays on his harmonica that echo's in an unsettling way. Bronson does this brilliantly, with a face that overflows with held back emotions and a determination that is downright scary.In a tavern the man meets Manuel 'Cheyenne' Gutiérrez (Jason Robards), a bandit that recently escaped being hung by the neck, re-joining his band of outlaws. With already greying hair, he takes on the situation that arises in the area, trying his part to be the hero that saves the day. Robards portrays a character that, by only one look at him, we can see how the years have shaped him. His performance is outstanding; we want to grab a drink with Cheyenne, but we also get the feeling that being on your guard around him wouldn't be an overrated luxury.The 'damsel in distress' (although she isn't in the original meaning of the word) Jill McBain (played by Claudia Cardinale) turns into a toy of Fate itself. Without any warning she gets involved in something quite over her head, but she handles it masterfully; she refuses to return to New Orleans with her tail between her legs and stays to face the difficulties put before her. Cardinale playing Jill is both an erotic marvel and a woman you wouldn't want to cross.They are all opposed by Frank (Henry Fonda): the local gang leader with a heart of stone and a business proposal at the ready at all times. With his ruthless blue eyes and his gun at the ready he keeps the town quiet. Fonda gives you the creeps with just one gaze at the camera and every sentence leaves the bitter taste of malfeasance.And finally, Gabriele Ferzetti finishes the line of main characters with his deliciously sickening portrayal of the crippled railroad baron Morton. A character that you'd like to slap in the face, but one you feel pity for as well. Outstandingly brought!The soundtrack is composed by the never beaten maestro of film scoring himself: Ennio Morricone. His genius lies in the creation of themes and melodies that will haunt your dreams forever for better or worse. The melancholic main theme that is brought with a heavenly choir draws tears from your eyes after hearing only a couple of chords. The theme of the man with the harmonica is as unsettling as it is epic and Cheyennes' theme creates the lighter counter points in the movie. Morricone uses these motifs ingeniously, hinting at plot points, character motifs and feelings and giving you a sense of the world the movie takes place in. If I could give twelve out of ten stars for the score, I'd do it.Sergio Leone was a masterful director, no need to prove that. He manages to turn even a scene of seven minutes, where three men are merely waiting for a train, into an epic storyline. Two hours and three quarters the tension builds and then resolves... partially, always building towards the end. And that finale! That finale! That finale chilled me to the bone! Throughout the film, question after question is raised, and when one question is answered, another one pops up. So when all pieces of the puzzle fall into place to the score of Ennio Morricone, how can one not be moved by it?For Leone, there was no better way to reach the top of the Western genre.And for us, there never will be a film that is more Western than 'Once Upon a Time in the West'."
daxsir,"Jan 21, 2016",10/10,This is my fav film. It is more like watching a piece of art. The look is fantastic. The director does a perfect job. The acting is wonderful. The story is not the strongest ever but it should be watched to experience it. If your a film lover you can't fail but admire this film.Charles Bronson is the perfect broody loner. Henry Fonda surprises everyone by giving a strong performance as a bad guy. The close up of his eyes is stunning. The camera work and close ups have never been done better. The music is as good as anything you will find in a movie. Throw in the scenes when you first see Henry Fonda. The scene at the railway station which the water dripping on the hat. The sound of the spinning water tower. To me the closet movie to ART i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of films.
gogoschka-1,"Dec 24, 2013",10/10,"This one only gets better with each viewing. Leone's masterful storytelling and Morricone's crazy, beautiful, epic soundtrack; desperate, haunted faces which look like the barren landscapes the story is set in and a plot that unfolds with impeccable pacing to culminate in THE ultimate western finale.As in Leone's previous films, music isn't just used to add to the atmosphere but is essential to the story, or perhaps even more: Morricone's main musical theme plays the actual role of a (or rather: the) protagonist in the film.Anyone who thought that the so called ""Spaghetti westerns"" were nothing but cheap, violent B-movies had to reconsider after seeing this film. It doesn't get any better than this: this is movie history; iconic, classic, unforgettable, epic. For this film, I just run out of superlatives.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
daniken,"Jun 23, 2002",10/10,"I can't quite find the words to even come close to describing the pure brilliance of this movie. When this movie was made, the western genre was dominated by the big hollywood studios. The western was taken by these studios and transformed into an opportunity to portray classic superheroes like John Wayne and Burt Lancaster in their fight against all sorts of smalltime crooks and outlaws in smalltime stories and smalltime towns. It was a genuine effort to portray 'Americanism', the American Way, along with a romanticised view of the west as 'Frontier country' where good always triumphed over bad and where the life was hard but honest. It was the American Way.And then came this film. The title, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' must have seemed to mean nothing more than 'just another western' to the unexpecting viewers at the time. Oh boy were they wrong. With this movie, Sergio Leone singlehandedly redefined the western genre and no American western would ever match the brilliant spirit in which it was made. While the story is basically the same as in any other western, it is the WAY in which it is presented that so clearly distances this western from others. Whereas other westerns are simply stories that are designed to entertain, this movie is an emotional masterpiece that will move your heart. Sergio Leone takes the ordinary western and replaces words with looks, and conversations with feelings and emotions. With his brutal but honest portrayal of the sheer hardness of life and death in those times he thoroughly destroys the old romantic idea of the west as a 'generally-hunky-dory-kind-of-scene with the occasional bad guy and indian' and replaces it with an eerie, dark, hot and dry place where life is cheap and only the strongest will survive.I cannot adequately convey in words the way in which Sergio Leone deepens and defines the characters by pure means of visual persuasion. It starts with the three gunman in the beginning of the movie, waiting for some reason at a train station for someone or something that obviously is going to be on the next train. No explanation, no conversation; not a word is said. Even the stationmaster is ushered into captivity without a single audible threat. Then comes the waiting... Any other director would have skipped directly to the moment of arrival, but Sergio Leone takes minutes of boredom and translates it into a visual feast, deepening the characters that are portrayed and making them more human, more real to the viewer, while at the same time encompassing us with a deep dark sense of foreboding. This way in which the story is not just augmented but in times completely replaced by the sheer visual drama, is perfected by the absolute fantastic music, directed by Ennio Morricone. Who needs words and explanations when the combined forces of cinematic mastery and heart-tearing music are not just able to carry the story, but pick it up and push it up to such heights of excellence that it has no equal in it's genre?Another great feat that adds to the power of this movie is the minimalistic way of portrayal of the characters as real, emotional people. Not a single word is said that isn't required for the understanding of the story, yet the characters feel more true than those in movies where whole conversations are added merely to explain their motives. Instead of words, the camera focuses on the characters...so that you can simply read the emotion off their faces. Often no explanation is given other than than a mere facial expression. No superheroes or supercriminals, just real, desire-laden, traumatised, obsessed people that act upon motives inherently understood by the viewer.All in all this is without a single doubt in my mind the greatest western of all times, and even though Sergio Leone has made many more mindblowing, heart-shattering westerns like this one, like 'A Fistful of Dynamite', 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly', and 'For a Few Dollars More', none could equal 'Once Upon A Time In The West' in sheer magnitude of perfection. Western has never been the same since....I only wish I'd have been there in 1969 when the movie was new and see it, for the first time with fresh innocent eyes and an unexpecting mind..just like 2001: A Space Odyssey (also of 1969, a year of legends).A tip for those who have never seen this movie: Bribe, beg, borrow, or steal yourself into possession of a Videobeam and Hifi-audio equipment if you can't find a cinema that is showing this movie. Turn the audio up WAY HIGH (never mind the neighbors) and prepare never to be the same again.........I (obviously) gave this movie a 10 because no matter how hard I try I can't find anything less than perfect about it."
jsmith-74661,"Jun 29, 2019",10/10,"The slower pace is what makes this movie unique. The attention given to detail in terms of facial expressions, scenery, symbolism, and an operatic type musical score is what sets this move apart from other westerns. After seeing John Wick 3, I can honestly say that I long for less action and more substance. There is something to be said about the old ways. If you haven't seen this movie, give it a shot. It will be worth the 2 hours and 45 minutes."
Sadako-Toyboy,"Jul 26, 1999",N/A,"Thank god that I'm a Bronson fan. This was my first Leone movie, and dumb kid that I was, I actually watched it thinking I was in for a  typical Bronson ""vehicle""! Looking back I'm thankful, because if it wasn't for his involvement, I would never have discovered the beauty and majesty that is Once Upon a Time in the West.I absolutely love this movie. It's probably my all time favourite, certainly one of the few that I can watch OVER and OVER again without losing interest. I love the way Leone creates intrigue and mystery around what is a relatively thin plot. He can make even the smallest twist of fate seem like an epic turn of events, with that amazing sense of revelation that he generates out of old hackneyed situations (something Argento has since picked up). Leone proves in this film that he could seemingly take anyone, even peripheral characters, and give them screen charisma without using dialogue as a crutch.OUATITW features the most tense two man stand-offs ever, with some serious deja-vu in the direction of his ""Dollars"" trilogy. In fact, it does feel like those three movies were warm ups,  practice sessions in the build up to OUATITW. Here though, he perfected everything; despite the long running time, it's all focused, and without a single irrelevant scene. For me, the two hours plus just fly by, I wish it would never end. Leone was without question at his artistic peak when he made this, that's not to say that he went downhill from then on, but I honestly don't think he ever did another film where everything came together so perfectly.The cast is flawless. Fonda eclipsed every good guy he ever did in one fell swoop, truly chilling. Robards is a great comic character, the lovable rogue with an edge. And Cardinale is more than just (incredible) window dressing; she switches between passionate, angry, delicate and sentimental at all the right moments.Which leaves the hero; I'm a huge Eastwood fan, but I honestly don't believe he could have done the role justice. His ""man with no name"" was a cool, sly character with hidden complexities. Eastwood always does these layered personalities, with some kind of mental baggage. Bronson, on the other hand, mostly does himself; simple, uncomplicated figures with only one state of mind, that's why he's put in so many revenge flicks. Plus, he looks like he's been seriously wronged at some point in his life, Eastwood doesn't have that quality. Bronson is the genuine hard-as-nails article. You can readily imagine that, had he been born decades earlier and been put in the same situation, he would resolve the problem in much the same way as his character in the movie (sometimes I affectionately refer to this movie as Deathwish part 0- could Harmonica be the great granddaddy of Paul Kersey?).Of course the other great contribution is the music. I still think that the main theme is one of the most breathtaking pieces of music I have ever heard. It affects me deeply whenever I hear it, regardless of the mood I'm in. Maybe I should listen to more opera or something, I don't know, but that's the way I feel. And the individual character themes are just so well integrated into the film, it's unbelievable. Leone replaces words with music, and it conveys so much more in return. Bronson just plays that melancholy tune on the harmonica instead of answering people back, it consistently cracks me up.High Noon, Naked Spur, Shane, The Searchers, etc. are all classics of the genre, but I really  don't think it's possible to compare those ""traditional"" westerns with OUATITW. For me, it exists on a plane of it's own, it's the kind of film experience that you let wash over you, a waking dream. I recommend this movie to anyone, if you're on the right wavelength you'll be greatly rewarded."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jun 28, 2006",7/10,"This was a unique western, one in which sometimes the action moves excruciatingly slow, which can either be fascinating or boring. Unfortunately for me, after spending big bucks for the DVD when it first came out, I found it more boring than fascinating. In my previous viewings, I always found it fascinating. Maybe I just had a bad day.The movie is filled with gaps of silence while closeups of the main characters' faces are shown. That's director Sergio Leone's trademark, and I believe he does it more in this film than in any of his others. When you get closeups of chiseled faces like Henry Fonda's or Charles Bronson's, it quite interesting but most of the movie feels like slow motion. At 165 minutes, this movie takes a lot of patience. By the way, the closeups of Claudia Cardinale's face were with a soft lens, so the wrinkles didn't show. That's so typical of older films with the vain female stars. Cardinale looks cheap, anyway, with all that 1960s-type eye makeup.At any rate, the action scenes are a decent and not bloody and the characters are quite real, meaning believable. I liked Fonda in here best even though I am not particularly a fan of his but his against-type villain role of ""Frank"" was excellent. I read where he said this was his favorite role. I'm glad to hear that. The best character in the film, though, was ""Cheyenne,"" played by Jason Robards.The opening credits - spaced out over 11 minutes (which was rare in ""classic movie"" days) - are considered by many as the most famous ever, in any genre. The music in this film is different, too. It's not as memorable as the score from ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly,"" however, done by the same composer, but it has its moments. Early in the film we see some shots of Monument Valley which are the prettiest I've ever seen. I wish there had been more of that.Overall, this is a western in which patience is rewarded, I suppose. It certainly looks beautiful on DVD and the sound has been enhanced as well. Note: when this came out on disc, the rating of the film changed from PG to PG-13."
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Sep 30, 2017",10/10,"I won't claim to have the ability to say anything new about this movie. It's been around for nearly fifty years, and is widely regarded as not just one the best Spaghetti Westerns of all time, but one of the best Westerns full stop. And it's not hard to see why: an incredible soundtrack, strong performances from the entire main cast, some surprisingly good humour and funny one-liners, a few tense sequences, a well-told story that doesn't rely on excessive dialogue or exposition, and consistently amazing cinematography and direction throughout. At least half the frames in this movie would probably make good paintings- no exaggeration.It's probably the marriage of the great visuals and soundtrack that make Once Upon a Time in the West work as well as it does. There's a good number of dramatic camera movements and interesting reveals that are tied up perfectly with the music- almost like some kind of singing-free musical at some points.Sergio Leone was one of the greatest directors of all time. It's a real shame that he apparently never got the kind of recognition he gets nowadays while he was still alive. Out of all his films, there's a strong argument to be made for this one being the closest to perfect. Honestly, there's not a lot that could be changed to make it better. My biggest direct gripe is the way the title pops up at the very end of the film, and rotates in a full circle before it disappears. It looks really cheesy, and comes close to killing the mood the otherwise extremely strong ending creates. While we're on complaints, another minor one would be that I want to say the film feels a little too long- maybe about 10 to 15 minutes. But at the same time, I wouldn't really know what to cut. Every scene is so well-constructed and orchestrated, and there's always something interesting to look at or listen to or think about, so I'm not really sure what should be cut. It's a pretty weak complaint, I know. Like I said, this thing's close to perfect.The Good The Bad and The Ugly might be a tiny bit more entertaining, and Once Upon a Time in America might have a slightly better soundtrack and stronger emotional moments (for me, personally), but it's still really hard to find much to complain about here. Absolutely recommended to any Western fan, and it gets a little better every time I watch it (four for me now, and counting)."
RubenMovies,"Oct 4, 2022",7/10,"In two lines: it's a classic italian produced Western movie that is all about build up and great decors.Story Summary: the story is a bit convoluted, but it centres around a widow and three cowboy mystery figures. Think, good, bad, ugly, but with a few more side characters.Analysis: the movie will probably remain a classic, because the execution is quite well done. The story however is quite average, but packed up in an interesting watch due to good acting accompanied with a great musical score and great decors.Dialogue: 8/10 intriguing and well done
Acting: dramatic, many close face shots (seems India soap operas have taken inspiration here). The actors are a bit simple and bot fully fleshed out. So while there performances are good, none is ultimately relatable. It's just a fictional film/story to watch.Visuals (Decor): 10/10 insanely well done
Costume & Make up: 9/10 also here no comments. Why not a 10, coz there is nothing that really stands put. It just all works really well together.Music: 8/10 In this directors productions music always plays a big parts and flows in and out of the story. The music is ambient and specifically gets a main role around tge harmonica sections. Sometimes the timing and choice of music ard not perfect like when Jill arrives at her new house...Story: 5/10 very average (no spoilers though)Anything else (originals story, liberties etc: the story is a poduct of its time. Jill is getting a bigger role and was cast as a vamp. Nothing wrong with that, but she is overall reduced to a woman who literally solves things with lying and sleeping with man. Not really a great representation, especially coz it doesn't come across as a survival mechanism, even though ithid is mentioned in the movie. Classic movie that hasn't aged as well. Also of the weirdest scenes was why Harmonica had to undress upon meeting her at home. It was very unpleasant especially coz there was no implied reason to do it and it didn't lead to any development in the story.Overall assessment: the movie is ok and has some memorable scenes, but it is lacking dept to truly shine for new viewers today that don't have the same nostalgia.End Word: very good film for Western lovers and people who appreciate good (old) cinema, however non movie buffs can skip this movie."
HotPot,"May 8, 2005",3/10,"Really not my kind of film. I thought my tastes were quite broad, but apparently not broad enough to encompass this one. The best writers and directors can make a point quickly and effectively without seeming to hurry. Sergio Leone, it seems, can't do that - at least, not in this movie. He takes his time over every scene, whether it has a point to make or not.It takes ages to get started (whatever happened to grabbing the attention of the audience to make them want to find out more?!) and ages for anything to actually happen once it has started. The word ""lean"" cannot be applied here; I suppose the best phrase I can offer is ""elegantly lumbering"".I saw the director's edition rather than the theatrical release, and as far as I could tell, the long scenes didn't achieve anything that ones half or even a tenth of the duration could have achieved (boredom aside).Yes, there were some ""pretty"" camera angles. Yes, there were one or two clever lines of dialogue. But the impression I came away with was, I'm sorry to say, that the director put his self-indulgence firmly above the audience's entertainment. The music was noticeably repetitive; the sound-effects intrusive beyond the point of distraction; and the dialogue invariably too quiet.I suppose I must be missing something given the absurdly high (IMHO) position of this film in the top 250. I really can't imagine what that might be!"
secondtake,"Nov 5, 2010",8/10,"Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)On the heels of ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" is this equally sprawling and archetypal Western, this time with less obvious dubbing, and Henry Fonda as a kind of tie in to Hollywood's hero paradigm. It's indescribably beautiful, one of the most gorgeous Westerns ever photographed, indeed a model for good visual directing and cinematography in any genre. That alone makes the almost three hours a pure pleasure.But it's not a fast movie in any other way. It can't be. It depends on lingering over delicious details, small ones, shot up close in startling detail and ever deadpan looks and steely eyes. Nothing is believable and it's not meant to be. It's not even a fable, quite, but more a celebration of being inside an incredible film, as strange as that sounds. Not that the scenes are not believable--even the very last shots of the makeshift town and the railroad being built is about as realistic as it gets. Great stuff.Plot? You might, at times, wonder where the plot went. There are lots of bad guys, and you're not totally sure there's a protagonist, unless the one woman in the movie is the center of our concerns, even if she is clearly a bystander to it all. When it gets clear, in the last twenty minutes, it's again archetypal (and has echoes of the over the tops showdown in ""Good Bad and Ugly""). A small bit of slow motion (not needed normally in a movie where everything is slow already) makes clear this is the key moment in the film, the thing that made the rest of it, with all its confusing and violent layers, sensible.For my money, I'd love all this incredible visceral stuff, the sounds and sights, filled in with some kind of deeply felt conflict, not a purely dramatic one. I watch and am shocked, or swept away, or impressed, or dazzled, but I'm actually never moved, not from the heart. And there are plenty of aspects here that should really move us--including feeling for the woman's plight, rather than simply recognizing that it is, after all, quite a plight.Still, another landmark Sergio Leone movie."
fnj-07126,"Jul 7, 2017",10/10,"I've seen a lot of superb movies, and this one is right up there so high that it is impossible to name one that is better. The cast and crew reads like a list of masters of film, every one at the very top of his game. From the top stars, Henry Fonda and Jason Robards, through a whole host of superb supporting character actors, Charles Bronson, Gabriele Ferzeti, Woody Strode, Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn, and Lionel Stander, they comprise a film maker's dream. Even the unknowns with the bit parts are unforgettable.Now you add a towering director, Sergio Leone, an absolutely sublime operatic musical score by the matchless Ennio Morricone, superb cinematography, great costumes and makeup, fine voice and sound work, and you end up with a seismic event.It holds up like the masterpiece it is, no matter how many times you have seen it before, no matter how many years it has been since it was made. It is the closest thing there is ever going to be to a perfect film."
LinkinParkEnjoyer,"Oct 30, 2019",9/10,The score is amazing and Henry Forda is magnficent. I can see why this is James Gunn's favorite movie. One of the best westerns packed with action and tension.
raphaklopper,"Oct 23, 2013",10/10,"After the great success of the masterpiece ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" which perfectly finished the ""Dollars"" trilogy. Sergio Leone get bored with nothing to do, and decided to start another trilogy, the ""America"" trilogy with ""Once upon a time in the West"". That today is considered the best Western ever made in the history of cinema.""Once upon a time in the West"" begins when the farmer Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his sons are murdered in cold blood by the hands of the ruthless bounty-killer Frank (Henry Fonda) who puts the blame on the criminal Cheyenne (Jason Robards). Frank was hired by the legged-rail baron Morton (Gabrielle Ferzetti) to just scare away McBain and his family of their land, because she would be much valued with the advancement of the railroad. But on the same day Jill (Claudia Cardinale) arrives in town, coming from New Orleans, and when she finds out of the crime she reveals that she married Brett McBain weeks before in New Orleans and therefore the land still had a owner. On the same day, Jill meets a mysterious man who is known for Harmonica (Charles Bronson) because he always carries with himself a harmonica, and offers itself as a protector of Jill. And when the criminal Cheyenne knows that he is being unfairly prosecuted, he decides to join forces with Harmonica to help Jill keep the lands of her deceased husband. But a web of mystery and deceit circulates between the contradictory relationship of the characters.When the film premiered at the time it was poorly received by critics and was a box office failure, only today that the critics and the public praised the film as not only the best Sergio Leone's movie, but also the best Western ever made. Well, not quite (in my opinion), but I understand why people praise him as such. The main complain of the critics to the film at the time, it was that the film was extreme slow. But this slowness is caused by some reasons.The first one is that the film was completely different from all the Western films ever made, even from the ""Dollars"" trilogy because Leone gives the film a dramatic tone. What Leone tries to show in the story is the end of the Old West, the title shows that perfectly. The original translation from Italian to English was ""Once upon a time THE West"", that is, the end of the Old West. And that originally came in the time of the advance of the railways, and the grand corruption and death that she brought to the population. Leone shows that giving the film an excellent script (written by him and Sergio Donati), which gives the film a superb narrative with beautiful dialogs between the characters, but like any Leone's film, it never loses his great sense of humor.The other reason is, as always. the magnificent direction of Leone, which once again shows advanced for its time. With its perfect close-ups on characters and enormous scenarios, making everything beautiful and epic. But there it comes the problem that prevents the film to even beat ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". Leone was known for his quiet moments brilliantly filmed, and ""Once upon a time"" is full of them (but maybe too much). Without considering the first 10 minutes of the film (which is brilliant, putting us in the heat of the scene), but others seem to boring taking the power of narrative and our investment on them.Another problem with the film is the relevance of the characters. Not that they are not superb and memorable (which they are): Jill is nothing more nor less than the representation of the women in the world of men in the Old West and its extreme strength and intelligence, along with an excellent performance from Cardinale; Cheyenne can be compared with Tuco from ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", both characters are cruel bandits, but in several times they are shown to be simple human beings with their problems and their kind and innocent side; Frank is another cruel-badass villain that Leone built in his films, Frank is a bounty-killer who in previous films its showed that they are honored to their ""job"", do whoever they were told and paid for and nothing more. But Frank in the film betrays its own principles, and gets into the corrupt world of the railways; Harmonica is almost the same character that Clint Eastwood was in previous Leone films. Mysterious, don't talk much, and never shows his true motives (only at the most epic and badass moment of the film). All characters are fantastic, but thanks to the silent moments of Leone, their relevance and relationship fails in several moments in the history.I don't agree that this is the best Western film ever made, but I understand why people consider it so. From a fabulous story that shows excellently the end of the era of legends with a flawless script, magnificent direction and unforgettable characters. All this makes ""Once upon a time"" not only one of the best Western films ever made, but a beautiful masterpiece of cinema and the beginning of another amazing trilogy!10/10"
BailedOutHotDog,"Jan 20, 2025",10/10,"As I'm sitting here writing this review I still cannot believe how stunning this movie was. The score- the cinematography- the casting, everything fit perfectly with this movie! To tell the truth there was not one scene where I was in the slightest bored in this 2 and a half hour long masterpiece of a spaghetti western. So, where to begin?First some background;
A few years back after finishing ""The Good The Bad and The Ugly"" I told myself, practically convinced myself, that there was no better western movie. I had been aware for some time of this movie's existence however I always seemed to avoid it since nothing about it really caught my attention. Fast forward to last night and there's a reason that I'm writing this the day after. I had to think about this movie for a long time before deciding what to write about it and I think I'm finally ready.The score:
I don't think you can even mention this film without first referring to its amazing score. I had heard that the score was good but I was not prepared at all when I actually heard it. Its an audiovisual journey and the music accompanies every shot that it's in so well. The score is impeccable and I'm seriously considering buying it for the next long road trip that I take. I think Sergio Leone is the only director that can make genuine music out of a windmill creaking and water dripping. Huge kudos to the team that worked on the sound and score.The cinematography:
I expected this as it's another Sergio Leone film but I still cannot believe that more directors haven't/had copied this style. It gets me very time I watch one of his films. Every scene is so drawn out in a good way that it lets you soak everything up. The slow methodical way that the camera pans up to the face's of the actor's lets you see the true emotion that this film puts on so well and maintains it for the rest of the films duration. Some of those scenes had me getting tears in my eyes which rarely happens anymore with the garbage that Hollywood turns out.And finally, the casting:
The cast in this film is very fitting. Never would I have thought that Henry Fonda would play such a despicable character but here I am again getting proved wrong. Henry Fonda as the villain was such a good choice and I don't think anyone could have played his character better.Charles Bronson was another good pick, he fit the role very well. Unlike other Sergio Leone westerns I don't think Clint Eastwood would have been a good fit for this film. He definitely could have played the character fine but there was something about Charles Bronson that made the film better. The way he plays such a mysterious character and keeps the audience's attention until the end of the film really is something special.And Claudia Cardinale plays the typical sexualized woman piece. Not much to say for her character. She kind of annoyed me but I guess she was alright.Overall a good cast, albeit small, but good.Summary:
I don't think that any director will ever achieve what Sergio Leone achieved in his brief span making films. There was something about his films that I as a movie buff envy so much. There is something so likable about pretty much every movie he's ever made but for me this is his definitive western.This movie really brought out the true gunslinger in me and now I will probably have to invest in buying the score and the collectors addition Blu-Ray, but what the hell? It's a movie completely worth your time.I recommend it
10 stars

johnnyboyz,"Jul 27, 2008",7/10,"Leone's now iconic film stands out for two very distinct things for me, personally. That is, number one: the brilliant, brilliant soundtrack that adds feeling; raw emotion and atmosphere as well as number two: editing and shot composition which differs between long, wide angled long shots to the gritty close up of the face for certain reactions and objects for certain atmosphere. Many things have been said about how brilliant the film is and in terms of the genre, this genre film is usually considered one of if not the pinnacle itself of the Western. But whereas the typical American western might include John Wayne or some other such hard bodied American taking on a role of 'honest as they come guy' who gets caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time, Once Upon a Time in the West is a slower and less-obvious film that somewhat ignores these conventions. Therefore it is a shame that I liked it rather than loved it once it had ended.The European influence grabs a hold of you right from the off in Once Upon a Time in the West. Afterwards I read a brief summary on the film stating it may well have the best opening to any film ever and that could well be the case. Leone's style here is to ignore the process of 'action, causes action, causes re-action, action, causes action...etc.' and show the guys who are a part of Frank's (Fonda) gang wait for a train to arrive rather than have the train arrive; have the gang arrive and then play out actions  Leone pays attention to sound (windmill and the fly) and has tantalising long shots of the train track in the distance that announces to us that the train is not going to arrive anytime soon. Cut back to ground level and the guys are killing time before the train arrives  we don't know why they're there and given it's a Western, they could be minutes away from death so the character's casualness and the build up through composition work really well.Once Upon a Time in the West carries a certain elegance despite its dirty, gritty and slimy nature. Characters look rough, wear dirty clothes and spit more than they need to and the dusty desert locations in Spain and The States work so well that to see the film is to almost feel hot and bothered. From the opening, the film develops with the arrival of Harmonica (Bronson), a man with no name indeed bar the one he's given by a fellow character for spending so much time playing said instrument. As a character, Harmonica epitomises the strange, the mysterious - a man that does not, you feel, belong in the film but a man who has his reasons and a back-story but the European influence is there again in the sense Leone chooses not to show it until well into the film. As a character, Harmonica brings diegetic music to the film in the form of his harmonica, an object he will never forget the manner of which he came across it. When it is played, it echoes and sounds louder than usual giving the man a presence that is almost uncanny  the music teeters on the brink of being within the film and not being within the film and certainly maintains a brooding and unnatural atmosphere.But Leone does not limit his style to composition choice, locations and harmonica sounds. He broadens his arsenal so much so that at times, the objects are doing the speaking for the characters. Another character is introduced, she is Jill McBain (Cardinale) and she arrives, like Harmonica, into this town by train. The genius here is that a simple introduction of a character by train has been stretched out through having a prior tragic event happen in a preceding scene that will affect McBain  how will she react? Then there is the brilliant cutting between her pocket watch and the station clock, creating a 'jump' in time between waiting there. Such a technique is rarely seen today and further acts as an example of Leone's ignoring of the 'action, causes action, etc.' method.But even that is not the first time it happens since later on, a card game will happen in a train caboose which doubles up as the only urban inspired 'space' in the film amongst all the dusty and dirty rural settings. The game is accompanied by odd sounding train noises which could be read into as the noises going on inside the player's minds as the pot grows and the tension rises. Once Upon a Time in the West is a film that can bring pleasure to its viewer but it's really brining its director the most pleasure. At 165-odd minutes, Leone is clearly in love with his unfolding of a film rather than his telling of a story and his style does overtake a lot of what I would've liked to have seen, that is to say more of an interesting narrative and less of the style once it had been established he could do it. But it will remain a film studied and looked at for years to come. Like I said with the original Japanese Godzilla film, you get the impression if they'd known it was going to be looked at and studied so much in the future, they might've made sure it would have held up a little more."
gtalumnus,"Jan 1, 2006",6/10,"In a word, melodramatic. Two much exaggerated drama with every scene. Maybe if it had Clint Eastwood instead of journeyman Charles Bronson I could tolerate the glacier-like pace of the movie.I watch movies for entertainment. Perhaps this has some sort of literary value, but its just too slow for me.The Good the Bad and the Ugly is one of my favorite westerns, but just can't get through Once Upon a Time in the West, as there is always something better I can do with my time, such as watch on old John Wayne movie that I've seen 100 times.I think the director gets way too caught up in impressing the viewers with with slick camera work (which there is, by the way), but drags out each scene to the point its difficult to remember sometimes whats actually going on in the plot.I am clearly in the minority here, and I attribute that to the fact that I am perhaps a more shallow movie viewer than most who post here. You guys see things that I don't see. I hated English literature in college, and I typically hate movies that win awards for their literary value. This may be Shakespeare, but I hated Shakespeare.I don't hate this movie, but its not in my top 100."
paul2001sw-1,"Jan 8, 2009",5/10,"Most westerns are actually about the death of the old, wild, west; and 'Once Upon a Time in the West', with its story centred on the coming of the railroad, is no exception. One thing that Sergio Leone has done in this movie is to make a truly cinematic film: it's hard to imagine how the script read, as so much of the meaning is conveyed in the facial expressions of the actors or by Enrico Morricone's score - there's a balletic quality to Leone's work. Unfortunately, I found the music intrusive, the exaggerated grimacing of the characters merely comic, and the plot contrived, difficult to follow and arbitrarily bloody; I don't believe that even in the wildest west, six people would be killed outside a bar and everyone inside would just carry on drinking as if nothing had happened. Personally, I prefer Robert Altman's treatment of a similar storyline in 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller', a film that uses rather fewer of the conventions of the western, but which seems closer to life as a result."
slaforce,"Jan 24, 2006",10/10,"I thought I knew westerns, I'd seen John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Glen Ford, Audie Murphy, Richard Widmark, Alan Ladd, all of them save the day many times. I was wrong, I was 14 yrs old when I went to the local movie house to see this movie in 1969. My grandmother took me, she had always been a huge fan of Henry Fonda's, and even though she didn't care for western's, she dragged me to this one. I'll never forget how engrossed I was from beginning to end. And this one movie was the basis for all my future wish's to have been born a cowboy. Everything about this movie impressed me one way or the other.Simply put, this movie is the most visually stimulating and engrossing movie I have ever watched.I have seen plenty of great movies in my in my fifty years of life, but this one, is in my opinion more than a movie, it's a piece of history unfolding in front of your eyes with no censorship or BS added for flavor. True, the movie has been chopped up some for TV and other forms of presentation, but when I was in that theater in 1969, the movie was, to use a semi modern term ""AWESOME"".No one, not even if you dislike westerns, should pass on this one."
mrmystery99,"Apr 29, 2018",9/10,"This one only gets better with each viewing. Leone's masterful storytelling and Morricone's crazy, beautiful, epic soundtrack; desperate, haunted faces that look like the barren landscapes the story is set in and a plot that unfolds with impeccable pacing to culminate in THE ultimate western finale. As in Leone's previous films, music isn't just used to add to the atmosphere but is essential to the story, or perhaps even more: Morricone's main musical theme plays the actual role of a (or rather: the) protagonist in the film. Anyone who thought that the so called ""Spaghetti Westerns"" were nothing but cheap, violent B-movies had to reconsider after seeing this film. It doesn't get any better than this: this is movie history; iconic, classic, unforgettable, epic - for this film, I just run out of words."
widescreenguy,"Jan 15, 2007",8/10,"thank goodness for IMDb !!! I remember over the years that echoing mournful theme song but since I missed this movie on first release I didn't make the connection, and it never played on television because of rights issues and the unusual length for the time.finally I bought it on DVD and there it was, that theme song that gave me flashbacks big time.then I finally knew what the interview with Jane Fonda was about where she described her recollections seeing her father Henry in the unusual role as archvillian, and another one with jack Elam about how it took all day to do the scene with the handgun and the fly.this is a remarkable western, despite some stretches of credibility.the railroad indeed was the thing that finally opened the west; it was the only way to move millions of tons of goods and tens of thousands of people over the long distances, wagon trains were too dangerous and got off the beaten path too easily and couldn't carry enough provisions. the railroad allowed in a symbiotic relationship, towns to be founded and flourish with mining, cattle herding and farming around them.and thus the premise of the movie, McBain is going to build a town right in front of the advancing railroad.the corruption, violence and greed depicted were certainly problems of the day considering the fortunes to be made. no different than today when a big factory is built and the land selected gains 20 times its normal value and those 'in the know' engage in speculation. or oil or mineral resources are discovered on land held by simpletons who mysteriously are murdered in a 'botched' robbery or some such nonsense. it does happen.the movie is so long I haven't seen it once yet without falling asleep which is not to be taken as a criticism, just that wailful haunting theme song gets to me ..... and it is close to 3 hours long.at least the good guy, in this case, the good girl wins in the end.gawd Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and still making films."
Fella_shibby,"Jun 15, 2017",9/10,"As a fan of Westerns, I saw this film many times in the early 90s. Saw this recently again on a DVD aft many years. The plot- Claudia Cardinale arrives at her ranch, to find that her husband has been murdered by hired gun Henry Fonda. Mysterious gunman Charles Bronson wants an appointment with Fonda. Bronson teams up with outlaw Jason Robards to help protect Cardinale n her ranch from Fondas evil intentions. There are long scenes where you get close shots of a person's face. Sergio Leone loves the stare-down, and you can see it in virtually all of his films. In this movie he allows the camera to linger longer than ever before. You get those quiet scoreless scenes where the natural sounds of the environment are greatly exaggerated. Leone's opponents take a long time to feel each other out before they act. One may find the long stretches of silence and inaction tedious n boring. Honestly, even i found some scenes boring, especially the opening scene. Henry Fonda is terrific. No one expected him to play such a ruthless and brutal killer. Bronson was decent but Jason Robards was much better with his tip on guys patting females bottom n the tip on don't get shot by a person who doesn't know to shoot. One of the best part bah the film was Ennio Morricone's score, especially the recurring harmonica music during the final closing fight. This is Morricone's best moment in a long, treasured career. I was surprised to know that the story was written by Dario Argento."
Abdulxoxo,"Sep 14, 2024",9/10,"Once Upon a Time in the West stands as a towering achievement in the Western genre, showcasing a masterful blend of stunning cinematography, compelling performances, and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. Directed by Sergio Leone, the film is visually breathtaking, with every frame meticulously crafted to capture the grandeur and grit of the Old West. The sweeping landscapes and intense close-ups are nothing short of cinematic artistry, making it a feast for the eyes.The performances in the film are top-notch, with Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, and Claudia Cardinale delivering memorable portrayals that bring depth to their characters. Bronson's stoic demeanor and Fonda's chilling turn as the villain create a dynamic tension that drives the narrative forward. The characters are richly developed, adding layers to the film's intricate plot.The narrative itself is complex and richly woven, dealing with themes of vengeance, justice, and the inexorable passage of time. The film's storytelling is deliberate and evocative, though it can be challenging to follow at times due to its length and the intricacy of its plot. While this complexity adds depth, it can also make the film a demanding watch, requiring patience and attention to fully appreciate its nuances.The soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is another standout feature, perfectly complementing the film's atmosphere with its memorable and evocative score. The music enhances the emotional impact of the scenes, from the tense confrontations to the quieter, reflective moments.Despite its many strengths, Once Upon a Time in the West is not without its drawbacks. The film's length may test some viewers' endurance, and the slow pace, coupled with its intricate plot, can make it a bit hard to follow. These aspects might detract from the experience for those looking for a more straightforward or fast-paced film.In summary, Once Upon a Time in the West is a masterful Western that deserves its place in cinematic history. Its visual and auditory splendor, along with its powerful performances and thematic depth, make it a rewarding watch for those who appreciate its grand scope and intricate storytelling."
heisenberg12,"Jan 30, 2019",6/10,"This is a really good movie, as I expected since it is rated so high, but it is so long that it can't help but become boring at times. For that reason only, it is flawed. It drags at times, and it took me several days to finish it. Other than that it is a really good old western that was well executed and crafted.8/10"
kosmasp,"Nov 11, 2024",10/10,"No pun intended - yes this is a Sergio Leone movie ... yes he also did the good, the bad and the ugly! So you figured out how I came up with my summary line (at least partly I assume). Charles Bronson is the man with no name - he does have or rather play his own tune though! And another classic theme (one of a few we can here in the movie) was born! Leone and his movie (composers) were able to create magic. Morricone once again in this case.But let's start ... from the start! The train station scene - something almost unthinkable nowadays - the viewers are being ""tortured"", will have to watch about 10 minutes where ""nothing"" happens ... well people waiting for a train to arrive. Almost no dialog - and yet this is amazing to say the least. It might have been even more amazing if the original actors who were planned for this would be in it - Lee van Cleef and Clint Eastwood and another one were to appear - at least if it were up to Leone. Two wanted to do it, but not Clint! That is according to the commentary people on the disc I own (western movie experts in their own right).But even so, it does not take anything away from this monumental beginning. How the framing works (you just know it is Leone when you see it), the music and lack thereof ... and in this case the title cards ... an art form for sure. The Harmonica and the tune played ... for the first time of many. And we will come to love it. Actually in Germany the movie is called (translated): Play me the song of death ... based on that tune that comes from Bronson lips. Well if he actually ""played"" it.He has a goal and some things may not make the most sense (why sending men there, relationships between characters, who is talking to who, some scenes seem to be out of order or make little sense when it comes to people who already met or should know each other and much more) ... but this is nitpicking ... enjoy the grand scope of things (no pun intended).And the homage to John Ford and other Western movies. Yet way ""dirtier"" - as in more realistic depiction (likely) of what the West was looking like. A bar, that is also multiple other stores too ... teeth that are crooked, dust and dirt all over the place ... and the progression of the train rails ... and their industrialization .. add to that figures that are leaned on people that actually existed.And then also the casting genius - Leone wanted to have Henry Fonda in this ... as quite the bad guy. When he gets introduced (what awesome camera movement and reveal) ... you won't believe your/his eyes! So blue! So pretty - unlike his character.I am sure you can real a lot things about the movie and about how it was made, what it means, what it covers (trains, homages, philosophical and society stuff) ... and while it has a strong female main character (Claudia Cardinale), some may have issues with how she is seen or how she is ""used"" by some of the men ... but overall she is not giving in - she may not always get what she wants (and deserves), but she will evolve to something even greater during the movie.Long shots, the movie takes its time to breathe ... and it clearly is one of the best western movies ever made - and best movies ever genre defying. One gets chills hearing that harmonica ... fitting for being my review number 11599 ... I think you can tell I have a thing for numbers! It was great revisiting this ... and one can rewatch this time and time again ..."
tomgoodman1,"Nov 1, 2002",2/10,"Sergio Leone understood mannerism better than any director who ever lived and employed it to extraordinary effect in his spaghetti westerns.  In addition, his superb use of sound, detail and the closeup were rarely equaled in the history of the cinema. That said, his Once Upon a Time in The West is by and large a dismal, overblown failure of equally titanic proportions.  The acting is self-conscious not mannered, the details other than the opening sequence at the train station (brilliant in absolutely every regard, he should have quit when Charles Bronson says, ""You've brought two too many."")are largely uninspired and the music is nothing short of grating.  Both of Leone's Once Upon a Time films (in America and in the West) were creative and box office failures as he bit off far more than he could chew."
playifk,"Jul 1, 2019",10/10,"Haven't seen a single bad film of his and this was not a let down in any way. Worth watching simply because of the, once again, outstanding soundtrack made by Ennio Morricone wich kind of moves the storyline instead of the dialogue at many times. For the movie itself i would describe it in simple terms as a bit of drama mixed into a classic western with both comical and dead serious elements combined. Just a spot on cast and a spot on story. Hats off!"
SandeepLoyalka,"Aug 14, 2008",8/10,"I first saw this film as a 20 year old in the late 80's on VHS & ended up thoroughly disappointed. Every scene seemed to stretch to near-infinity and the action was too sporadic for what I normally expected from a western. Now, however, things are different! I saw it again a few days ago after reading so many positive reviews & I must admit to pretty much being bowled over! 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is not your traditional shoot-em-up western. Its an acquired taste and I wouldn't be too far off the mark if I say that it resembles a dish with near-perfect proportions of ingredients, slow cooked over an intense fire. Director Leone doffs his hat to several classic westerns and ends up with a film thats greater than the sum of its parts. The lovely Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) arrives in the old west to join her new husband & family only to find them all brutally shot dead. Clues apparently point to the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards) though the dastardly deed has in fact been perpetrated by the magnificently evil Frank (Henry Fonda). Also in this lethal mix is a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger (Charles Bronson) with his own covert agenda. From the classic opening scene to the explosive climax, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' sucks the viewer into its vortex of emotions as layers upon layers are gradually peeled away revealing each characters true motivations. Featuring a stellar cast who have probably never been better, and a haunting, evocative score by maestro Ennio Morricone, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is mandatory viewing for all film aficionado's. My only (small) complaint is the occasional self-indulgence displayed by Leone when he tends to give style precedence over narrative."
poppydaddiopbr,"Jun 3, 2017",10/10,"Brilliant, breath-taking, mind-blowing, minimalist dialog, creative camera angles, closeups that speak volumes without a word, gritty, suspenseful, dangerous, brutal, sadistic, sad and cathartic period masterpiece by cinematic geniuses with an outstanding score, great cast, plot, screenplay and scenes. Leone's Masterpiece made with 100% Directorial Control of every aspect. Outstanding and thought provoking. Primordial emotions: fear, revenge, hate and finally, their resolution."
jj-72,"Jan 15, 1999",N/A,"There are few movies that can combine great directing, acting ,music, cinematography, and writing into one movie, but this one does. There are no weak points. Every scene is a piece of art. I know of no other film that affects the senses as this one. Henry Fonda said this was his favorite film and role. It's easy to see why. He created 1 of the great ""bad guy"" roles in history. In a side note, Leone wanted to put brown contacts in Fonda's eyes,(""who ever saw a villain with blue eyes"", Leone said), but Fonda wouldn't have it, and the effect is magic in the famous Leone close-ups. Bronson, Cardinale, and Robards are equally powerful, all have great lines and the camera loves them. Speaking of cameras, the visuals are stunning. There is nothing fancy about this movie. Raw power is what you see and feel. Simply the best western if not film ever made."
michaelheiser-25099,"Nov 5, 2021",7/10,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is the poignant chronicle of a time that has passed, a time between tradition and progress, it's the demise of the Old West and the majestic flag it raised. The pioneer family is symbolically eliminated by the corporatist world. It's all about making profit and only a ruthless and heartless person like Frank could have accepted to kill a family for greed, what no other outlaw from John Ford's movies would have done, except a Native. The child was killed as a continuation of the McBain threat and Jill's sentence wouldn't have been suspended if she didn't have some assets of her own. Claudia Cardinale is the emotional core of the film, with this mix of false strong-mindedness and wisdom to know how to use charm as a survival instinct in a dark and savage world with no place for 'little people'. The light of hope that kills off this cynical mood is incarnated by the providential help of Harmonica and Cheyenne.Cheyenne plays a significant role as the counterpart of Fonda's Frank, an outlaw with principles and heart, the good Old West, his theme sounds like a playful saloon' piano tune and in a way, he seems to exist only to provide a connection with the past, for Jill so we can know more about her, he's her link to the past. And it's tragically ironic that he is shot by the crippled Morton, not even in a spot that would have made his misery short. His agony, magnificently expressed by Jason Robards, symbolizes the agony of the Old West myth, and elevates ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" as the masterpiece of Western revisionism."
bobsgrock,"Oct 29, 2008",9/10,"With a style very much unlike that of his previous three Westerns, Once Upon a Time in the West takes a long time to tell this epic and powerful tale of three men all connected by their past and all destined to connect in the future. The acting is universally excellent with Fonda playing a very uncharacteristic part, but since he is such a great actor he has no problem filling the shoes of the merciless gunslinger, Frank. Jason Robards is great as the outlaw with a good heart, Cheyenne; and Charles Bronson is very Eastwood-like as a man known only as Harmonica with a mysterious past and a quick draw. The central character, though, is that of the beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Jill, a widow seeking revenge.Sergio Leone used a slower, more romantic style for this Western, but he still was able to produce some great images and a story that will forever be remembered. He doesn't deal too much with character development, rather showing us their actions and letting that speak for themselves. And, of course we cannot forget the score by Ennio Moriconne. Though not as memorable as The Good, Bad and the Ugly, it adds a great deal to the film. Certainly one of the best Westerns ever made, this is film making at a very high degree."
finercreative,"Sep 1, 2024",7/10,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is one of Sergio's longest and highest rated on IMDb, but personally, though I liked it, I didn't like it as much as most people do.It's a good example of style over substance. Sergio gives us so many close up shots, long pauses, etc. That it seems as if he's forgotten to expand upon the film's other aspects. Even so, I will say that this style will sometimes do good for the film (a good example being its climax), but still. It, in my opinion, seems overlong at almost 3 hours.At least it's got a good soundtrack, and lots of attention to detail for the old west setting, but the plot is also convoluted at times, and even the acting seemed wooden on rare occasions. Nevertheless, if you're a fan of Leone's style of filmmaking, I'm sure you will love this. Maybe this is just one of those movies that I'll rewatch later down the line and end up loving, who knows.Also, everything stated is simply my opinion. If your opinion differs from mine, than that's completely fine. 7/10."
chrisart7,"Feb 17, 2015",3/10,"I recently purchased a double DVD package of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and re-watched this film after having revisited the ""Dollars"" trilogy...and what a comedown. First the positives: a lovely score from Ennio Morricone (especially the ""Jill""/Claudia Cardinale theme), gorgeous photography, sets, locations, lighting, and some decent (but not terribly great) acting - Gabriele Ferzetti probably comes off best in his role. You know you're in trouble when the very last bit in the documentary extras is a quotation of Sergio Leone worriedly admitting to co-scripter Bernardo Bertolucci that he had set the pace far too slow when filming the opening sequences, and that the ensuing film would probably be five hours long as a result. It was almost three, and it barely moves along at all. The plot is paper thin and could have easily been filmed in 90 minutes. Perhaps then the much-needed forward momentum and suspense would be in place. As it is, the film has far too protracted silences which do not advance it at all.Henry Fonda's villain Frank is rather drab and one dimensional, especially in comparison to Gian Maria Volonté's romanticized villains Ramon and Indio in the first two ""Dollars"" films. Fonda is also not even remotely formidable as a physical opponent for Charles Bronson. I'm not certain why Jason Robards' Cheyenne character is even in the film---perhaps as comic relief, but he does not ever really seem to belong in the Old West, despite his grizzled appearance. He and Bronson have none of the chemistry and camaraderie that Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef had in ""For a Few Dollars More."" Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and beautifully photographed, but even her character is rather one dimensional.Back to the music: for this film Ennio Morricone recorded the score in advance (unlike the ""Dollars"" films), and some of the soaring themes arrive early in the film and are far too stridently emotional for characters and situations which have not yet won the viewers' hearts. He should have subdued some of his orchestration of the same themes earlier in the film, then revisited them in full intensity after some of the drama had likewise escalated. As such it is a bad marriage of sound and celluloid at the outset.In the end it is director Sergio Leone's fault for not shooting this film so that the story would unfold at a much faster pace. It seems he didn't learn his lesson, though, as his next film ""A Fistful of Dynamite"" (1972) suffered from the very same problems. I donated the ""West"" DVD set to my local library just before writing this review; perhaps someone else will enjoy it."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jan 9, 2011",10/10,"Although I have not seen all his films, I have yet to see a Sergio Leone film I hate. The movies I have seen of his are visually gorgeous with superb scores and interesting stories and characters. Once Upon a Time in the West is no exception. It is long and slow, but I think the film was deliberately paced like that.Once Upon a Time in the West does take a lot of risks, including improvising the action around the score's moods. This was a risk that paid off. The story is rich and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking and beautifully written. Leone also proved what a fine director he was by directing so wonderfully on this film.The characters are great and quite complex, and are further advantaged by being wonderfully portrayed. There is the brutish gunfighter, the beautiful widow, the mysterious harmonica player and the sympathetic outlaw. Henry Fonda particularly does brilliantly in the role of Frank. The visuals once again are exquisite and quite grandiose in its scope and beauty, while Ennio Morricone's wonderfully operatic-like score fully justifies why he is considered one of the all-time great film composers.All in all, a big and bold western and one unlike any other. It also took risks, ones which could have gone horribly wrong but due to the evident work and care of all involved, they paid off. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
murtaza_mma,"Mar 4, 2010",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTW) is a piquant cocktail of style and substance in equal parts, potent enough to catapult the viewer into a whirlpool of incessant excitement transcending him beyond the usual realms of an adrenaline rush. Vintage Leone, OUTW is inarguably the best Western ever made and undoubtedly features amongst the very best works of cinema, period. Leone incredibly surpasses the brilliance of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (TGTBTU) with OUTW by blending his favorite theme of Greed with that of Revenge. The only thing that TGTBTU lacked was the presence of a strong female character and Leone more than makes up for it in OUTW. Its eccentric yet consummate plot revolves around a female protagonist, thereby revolutionizing the very tenets associated with the genre where machismo and chivalry had solely held sway, hitherto.OUTW is a juxtaposition of the lives of five individuals, viz. Harmonica - a mysterious stranger, Cheyenne – a notorious desperado, Frank – a ruthless assassin, Jill – a beautiful widow with an obscure past, and Morton – a railroad baron, whose motives inevitably make them cross each other's paths albeit through an act of fate.Henry Fonda is a revelation as the cold-blooded assassin, a portrayal that is remarkably contrasting to his usual 'good guy' on-screen image. He goes about his business with a sublime touch of feral grandeur that makes him equally chilling and fascinating as 'Frank'.Charles Bronson plays his part with utmost conviction and incredibly manages to conjure up an element of mystery in his portrayal that not only brings 'Harmonica' to life, but also gives it a very distinct identity despite Harmonica's conspicuous similarities with Eastwood's 'Man with no name'.The role of 'Cheyenne' is played with equal brilliance by Jason Robards. He has taken care of the various subtleties and nuances to such an extent that he perfectly fits into the shoes of notorious, yet likable, 'Cheyenne'.Claudia Cardinale is ravishing as the beautiful, yet vulnerable, 'Jill McBain'. She has fully justified the trust shown by Leone in casting her and by Bertolucci in penning down a strong feminine part in a Western. She truly entrances the viewers with her mystifying pulchritude and enigmatic charm. She meticulously highlights the flaws in Jill's character while also managing to depict the elements of tenacity and grit which represent the true spirit of femininity.Gabriele Ferzetti is quite effective in his cameo as the crippled railroad baron, 'Morton'. He suffers from the tuberculosis of bones and each passing day brings him closer to his end, thereby further intensifying his desperate urge to fulfill his far-fetched ambition of taking the railroad to the Atlantic. He truly represents a man worthy of achieving the impossible, unfortunately cut short by his haplessness. Despite the inhuman and unjust means adopted by him to fulfill his naked ambition, one finds it excruciatingly hard to derive pleasure from his perpetual plight and eventual doom.Contrary to the popular belief, the slow pace of the movie and laconism in dialogue pose no impediment to the viewing and in fact this deliberate pacing enormously adds to the detail and beauty of the movie, and also helps in brewing the desired level of tension before it is finally punctuated suddenly with quick bursts of action.Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is vividly descriptive and has elements which have become his and Leone's trademarks like the extreme close-ups, the quick panning of the terrain, the rotating camera shots etc.The haunting score written yet again by the master composer, Ennio Morricone enhances the grandeur of the movie tenfold. If Leone's direction and Colli's cinematography are the backbone of the movie, then undoubtedly Morricone's plaintive score is its heart and soul. The surreal score has shades of melancholy, intrigue, and romance that become more obvious with each passing moment. The music features leitmotifs (a melodic phrase that accompanies the reappearance of a character) that relate to each of the main characters (each with their own unique theme music). The soundtrack to the opening scene is a creative orchestration of ordinary sounds like that of the dripping water, the clicking of a telegraph, a buzzing fly, and the screech of a windmill after Morricone experienced a musical performance created by the medley of these sounds. This created an exaggerated version of what had come to be known as 'Spaghetti sound'.OUTW is a magnum opus unparalleled in direction, screenplay, cinematography and music. With its slower pace and relatively somber theme (compared to Leon's previous works), Leone managed to transform his image of a satirical showman into that of an accomplished auteur capable of producing much profound works. OUTW also served as the harbinger for Leone's surrealistic masterpiece, 'Once Upon a Time in America'.P.S: OUTW is an absorbing masterpiece; an absolute gem of a movie and a must watch for those who understand the true meaning of 'A Timeless Masterpiece', and are willing to indulge themselves completely through the whole length of the movie. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
maue-19674,"Jul 7, 2020",10/10,"There are some films that simply leave you stunned the first time you watch them - that is EXACTLY how I felt when I first viewed Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. I had seen his 'Dollars Trilogy' with Eastwood - and loved his 'style' languid story-telling, massive close-ups and (of course) Morricone's timeless music. So when I approached this Film I was expecting something similar but - in many ways - THIS is Leone's greatest work. Everything about the Film evokes a melancholy nostalgia for a lost 'West'. Ennio Morricone's peerless score underpins this and drives your emotions through the film - indeed the Music was written FIRST - Leone played it on the sets so that the Actors could hear the atmosphere he was looking for. The fantastic set-pieces - the massacre of the McBain Family to reveal Henry Fonda's soulless gun 'Frank', the arrival of Harmonica at the train stop to face three adversaries, Jill's arrival at Sweetwater - all had me utterly spellbound.
The performances are simply perfect - Bronson was never better, with superb support from Fonda and Robards as Cheyenne but it is Claudia Cardinale's Jill that is the heart and centre of this story. We see this through her eyes and recognise that this 'West' - with the coming of the railroad - will not last long.
Leone and his fellow writers - Donati, Argento and Bertolucci - could have simply delivered a basic Western screenplay but, to his undying credit, Leone wanted to tell a story of not only the Myth of the West but it's passing. In doing so, he crafted a Film so unique and cinematic that it repays repeated viewings and just improves every time a see it.
I remember my first viewing of this masterpiece - as the credits rolled up to Morricone's beautiful music I simply stared at the screen stunned and said to myself ""did I just see that?"" And I longed to watch it again.....this is one for the ages and one of my absolute favourite films."
TheUnholyPeanut,"Apr 23, 2021",10/10,"Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" stands as a towering achievement in the Western genre, a testament to the director's mastery of cinematic storytelling and visual artistry. Building upon his legacy with the Dollars Trilogy, Leone crafts a sprawling epic that transcends the conventions of traditional Westerns, immersing viewers in a world of mystery, intrigue, and larger-than-life characters. At the heart of the film lies its stellar ensemble cast, led by the incomparable Henry Fonda in a revelatory performance as the enigmatic villain Frank. Departing from his usual roles as a heroic figure, Fonda delivers a chilling portrayal of pure evil, using his piercing blue eyes and subtle facial expressions to imbue Frank with an aura of menace that lingers long after the credits roll. Opposite him, Charles Bronson mesmerizes as the mysterious gunslinger Harmonica, channeling his screen presence and masculinity to create a character shrouded in mystery and quiet intensity. Supporting performances from the likes of Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale further elevate the film, adding depth and complexity to its rich tapestry of characters. Leone's direction is nothing short of masterful, as he weaves together a narrative that unfolds with the precision of a finely-tuned watch. From the enigmatic opening moments to the gripping climax, the film grips viewers with its tantalizing mysteries and intricate plot twists, leaving them on the edge of their seats until the final reveal. Leone's use of close-ups and widescreen shots heightens the emotional impact of each scene, allowing viewers to fully immerse themselves in the world he has created. Ennio Morricone's score serves as the perfect accompaniment to Leone's visual storytelling, with its haunting melodies and evocative themes adding another layer of depth to the film's narrative. Each note resonates with a sense of foreboding and melancholy, underscoring the emotional journey of the characters as they navigate the harsh landscape of the American frontier. Cinematographically, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a feast for the eyes, with Leone's meticulous attention to detail evident in every frame. From the sweeping vistas of the desert to the bustling streets of Sweetwater, each scene is beautifully crafted, showcasing the director's unparalleled talent for capturing the essence of the American West. The construction of the railroad becomes a mesmerizing ballet of movement and industry, while Jill's journey to Sweetwater is rendered with a sense of breathtaking beauty that echoes the grandeur of John Ford's ""The Searchers.""In conclusion, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" stands as a timeless masterpiece, its blend of captivating performances, stunning visuals, and evocative storytelling marking it as one of the greatest films ever made. Sergio Leone's vision and artistry shine through in every frame, leaving an indelible mark on the Western genre and cementing his legacy as one of cinema's true auteurs."
axelhansson-84896,"Aug 6, 2019",10/10,"After completing the ""Dollars"" trilogy, Sergio Leone was initially reluctant to direct another western. But when Paramount tabled an offer he couldn't refuse, he went on to make this poetic, utterly compelling tale that still stands out as one of the most elaborate movies the genre has derived. Themes of greed, vengeance and haunted pasts all intertwine to form a grand and poignant homage to the whole western genre.
While the ""Dollars"" trilogy and most prominently ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" remain the quintessential western movies, OUATITW takes the genre one step further, into a less exploited territory. Whereas Leone's previous work has more of an adventurous feeling to it, OUATITW is pervaded by a more dooming atmosphere. Unlike most other Westerns it doesn't have the typical hero, but relies more on a sentimental basis, personified by the tormented Harmonica. Overall this movie is less extravagant than the ""Dollars"" films, and more subtle and subdued, which in the end results in a more mature and realistic approach to the genre. Equipping the characters with different backgrounds also benefits the story's depth and intricacy.
The cast I superb, led by a chilling Henry Fonda. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale also provide memorable performances, as well as Charles Bronson as the vindictive, harmonica-playing stranger whose incentive is a mystery to everyone but himself. Everything about the movie, how the shots are executed, how the sets are devised, how light affects the scenes: everything is done with the outmost meticulosity.
One of the film's most salient features is it's astonishing direction. Leone employs the same camera techniques as in his earlier films, only even more extensively. The shots are even longer, the close-ups even more extreme. Simultaneously he refrains from any attempt of moving forward too promptly. On the contrary, he uses the slow build-up to create tension that surges the viewer into the happenings. This is particularly notable in the opening scene of the movie. We see three men coming into view at a railway station, and apart from the squeaking cry from a windmill it is completely silent. For minutes nothing of importance happens, and without any music and without any dialogue the tension increases as it becomes evident that the men are waiting for something. Without any words being uttered we know something is about to happen. After minutes of shots between the three men and the station, the viewer is completely absorbed into the movie. This type of storytelling is a rare, if not nonexistent instance in movies of today.
The final essential piece of the movie is the music. Composer Ennio Morricone, the man behind the famous ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" soundtrack, produces yet again a haunting, perfectly adequate score. Probably it was his ability to compose iconic western music that mad Leone use him over and over again. Morricone utilizes different soundtracks depending on which character currently occupies the center of the stage. Bronson's eerie, desolate cry of a harmonica greatly reflects his lonely and reserved personality, while Robards' more upbeat, clever tune perfectly suits the coarse and cunning gunslinger.
After watching this you can do nothing but conclude that this is one big, immaculate masterpiece. If you haven't watched it, watch it. It is definitely worth the time."
jeroennouwens,"Dec 15, 2020",10/10,"As there are already 719 reviews of this title, I will keep my two cents brief. I personally wanted to leave a little mark here, because Once Upon a Time in the West is one of my favorite films. I have watched and immensely enjoyed it glued to the (small) screen numerous times, from a young boy onward to me now being close to 40. I did watch it again earlier this year (2020). The year isn't all that great going, so I had to brighten it up by watching this classic one evening again and it immediately was an evening to remember. I don't know off the top of my head how lengthy this film is (definitely longer than 90 minutes), but not one minute feels wasted or overly long. From the classic opening scene to all the scenes that follow, it's an epic ride. I love the themes in the film and I also love the music.I often listen to Morricone's soundtrack and on occasion watch the finale again. Everything about this masterpiece is amazing. I also think it's Bronson's best role and perhaps Leone's best film.Go watch it, if you haven't already. It's timeless. I will watch the Finale once again. I want this played at my funeral."
DavidRobinson10,"May 14, 2004",N/A,"I have recently commented on Leone's GBU and was intending on reviewing AFOD and FAFDM as well as this one - OUATITW, but after reading a number of the comments about these from all the avid fans on this great site, I will simply give you a short account of how these films have affected my life. I am 55years young and saw all these films on their first release in Sydney.(late '60's) They were cut, but it didn't stop me seeing the brilliance in them. I would imagine that a lot of the members of this site are much younger than myself and have only watched these films on DVD or TV quite recently. (Stood the test of time, eh!!) (WideScreen is a must for these.) Leone's films exhibit an idealism in art that surpassed his Hollywood models (eg: Ford). Although, at the time of creation, I doubt he would have thought he was. He simply had a vision.From film to film he improved on this. Like most artists, I don't think he was too concerned with the financial gains that might or might not be realized.(This was probably his downfall). That these little films can impress all you younger fans so much says a lot about good taste and the sad lack of it in American films of recent times.Great directors, like Leone, don't come along every day and it saddens me greatly to know he died before he was recognised for the genius he surely was. Morricone must be 75 now, soon we will loose him too. I am a successful composer in Australia and can tell you, without bias, that Morricone is in the top five best ever film composers just from these four films alone, if not one of the best composers in general (yes, this includes Stravinsky, Bartok, Debussy and Schoenberg.) of the 20th century. Eastwood is also reaching the end of his life and although I'm not a huge fan of his recent work, he is one of the last living greats. Without the inspirations put forth by these men, I might not still be writing and recording my music these days. Plenty of times I could have stopped when things got tough but all I had to do was revisit these gems of modern art to realise that greatness does still exhist , all you have to have is the love and desire and guts to make your visions a reality. Leone, Morricone and Eastwood: I salute you."
jokool-2,"Jan 7, 2023",7/10,"There have been four feature films that have put me to sleep in all my years. ""The Lawnmower Man"" and ""What About Bob"" had me snoozing in the theater when they came out; and I could never make it through several home viewings of ""Citizen Cane"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West.""Once again I was out cold last weekend at about an hour and a half into the slow buildup of ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" At that point I thought the movie makers couldn't get out of the way of their own ""brilliance"" in order to make a great film.When I resumed watching the movie the next day, the film suddenly became masterpiece theater. The second half of the movie was equal to any other great movie I've ever seen. Unfortunately, I have to grade both halves of the movie as a whole. Therefore 5 plus 10 divided by two = 7.5. I feel more comfortable rounding down to 7 here. Overall it's a classic for sure."
Hayden-86055,"May 30, 2020",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in the West is another great film by Sergio Leone, but this time it's not just all guns blazing he focuses more on the finer elements of film making.Every shot is masterful and informative, the way Sergio Leone can turn a 6 minute scene of 3 men doing menial movements to amuse themselves is masterful. The film is admittedly very very slow paced, but somehow that works in its favour and I enjoyed the journey even more.All of the main characters are very detailed, interesting and you actually care what happens to them. Henry Fonda was a genius choice to play the villain, and when the film came out many people were so used to seeing him play the hero seeing him here murdering a family was shocking!The music is fantastic and almost as good as the Dollars trilogy!10/10: Absolutely worth a watch, especially if you enjoyed the Dollars trilogy"
NihadRogue,"Sep 22, 2025",7/10,"Once Upon a Time in the West is a visually stunning and epic spaghetti Western that tells the story of a widow, Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale), caught in a deadly power struggle over a valuable piece of land. The film features three central characters-Harmonica (Charles Bronson), Frank (Henry Fonda), and Cheyenne (Jason Robards)-whose paths intertwine in a tale of revenge, greed, and justice.The movie isn't flawless. Its pacing is deliberately slow, with long stretches of tension-building that may feel tedious to viewers expecting constant action. Some plot points take time to unfold, and minor characters receive limited development, emphasizing style and atmosphere over fast-moving narrative.Despite these slow moments, the film excels in artistry and storytelling. Sergio Leone's direction creates a cinematic experience with meticulously composed shots and masterful framing. Ennio Morricone's unforgettable score heightens every moment, from suspenseful standoffs to reflective character scenes. Charles Bronson's silent, stoic performance as Harmonica contrasts perfectly with Henry Fonda's chilling villain, Frank, and Robards' charismatic Cheyenne, creating a captivating dynamic. The attention to detail in the landscapes, costumes, and set design immerses viewers fully in the Old West.Overall, Once Upon a Time in the West is a masterpiece of the Western genre. Its deliberate pacing, stunning visuals, iconic score, and complex characters make it a cinematic experience that rewards patience. While it may feel slow at times, the film's artistry, tension, and emotional depth make it unforgettable for fans of Westerns and classic cinema.I wish the viewers a good time."
nowra100,"Sep 3, 2006",2/10,"I couldn't stand this ridiculous movie. It is one of the most pretentious movies I've ever seen, indicating that Sergio Leone had officially lost his mind and indulged in his own mania. What's so good about it? The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is far superior, as are the 'dollar' movies that preceded it. I guess it is cool that Henry Fonda is an evil piece of work, but other than that this movie really has nothing going for it, except Claudia Cardinale and her legendary beauty. The pacing was way too slow, the scenes were unnecessarily long and dragged often, and the acting left much to be desired. It's as if Leone tried to fuse an art film with his macho western style, and the result was a confused piece of action-art nonsense with no substance to justify the 'art' and too many stagnant and lifeless performances for it to be considered 'action'."
estebangonzalez10,"Mar 27, 2015",10/10,"""Do you know anything about a guy going around playing the harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking, he plays. And when he better play, he talks.""What a pleasure it was for me to finally get to watch this masterpiece which I kept on putting off because of its nearly three hour runtime. I was blown away by Sergio Leone's direction in The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, and that was the only film of his that I'd seen up to this point, but now I honestly can't say which of the two films I prefer. This is perhaps a better film because it is set on a grander and epic scale, but perhaps not as entertaining as the other. Both films have terrific performances with memorable characters and a masterful score composed by Ennio Morricone that accompanies Tonino Delli Colli's beautiful cinematography. Leone's exaggerated close ups show us the dirt and the sweat coming out of these grim people's faces and it's juxtaposed perfectly with these extremely long shots of the vastness of the Western valley. I can't imagine liking this film more than I already do, but it is clear that these films were made to experience them in the big screen and it's a pity I couldn't do so. There are also many memorable quotes in this film and I absolutely loved the screenplay. For the first 90 minutes or so I wasn't sure what direction the movie was heading and that is what I liked about this film since it had me guessing at some of the characters motivations and where the plot was trying to go. The characters have a lot depth and not even the villain is portrayed in a stereotypical way. Along with Unforgiven these are the three best Westerns I've seen so you can bet I will watch more of Leone's spaghetti westerns in the future.The film couldn't open in a more spectacular fashion as the camera follows three gunmen waiting for someone at a station. Once the train arrives, the men don't find who they are waiting for and as they are walking away they hear someone playing a harmonica. It is the mysterious man they've been expecting (Charles Bronson) who asks them where Frank is. They've been sent to kill him, but Harmonica is too quick for their guns and finishes them off claiming they ""have brought two horses too many."" Then we are introduced to a recently married family man who is living on his deserted property with his three children and expecting his new wife to arrive that very day, but a group of bandits led by blue eyed Frank (Henry Fonda) kills them all one by one for reasons that aren't explained yet. The bride, Jill (Claudia Cardinale), arrives to find them all murdered and the officers find evidence that lead them to believe that the outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) is responsible. The lives of these three men all intersect with Jill's and as the story develops the plot and mystery unfolds.Sergio Leone had me engaged with the film from the very opening sequence and he sets the slow paced tone rather quickly. He takes his time to let the action unfold but thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the gripping score I was never bored for a minute. I was continually trying to guess what was going on and what the motivation of each character truly was. I was surprised that Leone decided to have Ford's character shoot a young kid in a very early scene in the movie, and I can only imagine what a shocker that must have been for audiences during that time who were used to seeing Ford play the hero. Bronson is mysterious but it is rather obvious from the beginning what his intentions are. He still delivers a gripping performance as this mysterious character and when his backstory is finally revealed it all pays off. It was Robards' character who had me guessing at times what his real intentions were. At first I believed he was going to be one of the main villains, but he delivers most of the funny scenes and was perhaps one of the best characters in the film. The breathtaking Claudia Cardinale may have not been given a strong female role, but she wasn't simply a damsel in distress and she seemed to know what she was doing. Once Upon a Time in the West is not a straightforward revenge story and it blends several tones throughout the film having you sympathize with each character at different points of the story. Leone maintained the thrilling atmosphere for its entire runtime and the final showdown is rewarding. This is an epic masterpiece and a new addition to my favorite movies of all time list that I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to experience.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
Andy_MJD,"Feb 4, 2020",10/10,"My favorite western of all time, and in general top 3 movies at all. I've watched it three times in the last year, which is about triple what I usually do.

The music is haunting and incredibly powerful."
sn319,"Dec 10, 2014",8/10,"One of the best western's ever made, with fantastic directing, acting, and beautiful scenery, Once Upon a Time in the West is a true classic. The story has four characters coming together on a plot of land where a now dead owner was going to build a town around a rail station. From there, the violence ramps up toward a slow, wonderful conclusion.It has pretty much all the classic staples of a western. Despite not being as action-packed as most movies these days, the long portions of quiet and beautiful scenery give us a sense of the west and leave us wanting more. It's rare that a director can make such a quiet, dream-like film that leaves the viewer wanting to be part of that world.Beautiful, serene, and overall excellent, Once Upon a Time in the West is a grand film."
brucejr,"Jan 31, 2001",10/10,"The ""fourth"" and best of Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is a sprawling, operatic masterpiece of cinematography. The languid pacing only accentuates the meticulously presented scenes and the Ennio Morricone score is powerful, poignant and haunting. Each major character has his own musical theme. Henry Fonda's character has a menacing and jarring score which chills and thrills me every time I hear it (I bought the soundtrack too!). Fonda as Frank is the ""coldest villain in screen history"" as I have read in other reviews and was cast against type in this film. When the camera pans up into his passionless blue eyes early in the movie, one sees what a brilliant piece of casting it was to have him as the villain. This movie is a metaphor on the death of The Old West and the final word on how a (spaghetti) Western should be. Not to be missed!"
slightlymad22,"Feb 3, 2021",9/10,"Once Upon A Time In The West (1968)I love this Sergio Leone classic. Unfortunately, they will never make a movie like this again. As sadly people are put off by 3 hour run times unless it is an action packed Avengers movie.This isn't action packed, it's very slow-paced as Leone really allows it to breathe, there are long scenes with no dialogue, the opening scene of example. Made today, I think an hour with be trimmed as audiences don't have the attention span. Even trailers have 15 second mini trailers before the actual trailer starts, because of this.It has Henry Fonda playing against type as a bad guy, with intensely blue eyes, he is an evil, cold blooded, nasty man!! God, he is chillingly brilliant. Easily one of the best movie villains of all time. And yes, I don't say that lightly, he really is up there with Hans Gruber and Darth Vader, for me.Charles Bronson (originally Leone wanted Clint Eastwood, but he wasn't interested, then he offered it to James Coburn, but he wanted too much money) is amazing as Harmonica, a character whose motivations, you are never quite sure about.. But my God!! When you see a flashback.... It's absolutely brutal. Bronson is so cool here, it's a brilliant performance.One of Ennino Morricone's finest and epic scores stands out too.Claudia Cardinale needs mentioning as Jill McBain, she is brilliant.Epic film making, and just a work of art.Sergio Leone liked to tell the story of a cinema in Paris, where the film ran uninterrupted for two years. When he visited this theater, he was surrounded by fans who wanted his autograph, as well as the projectionist, who was less than enthusiastic. Leone claimed the projectionist told him ""I kill you! The same movie over and over again for two years! And it's so SLOW!"""
gabrielegomiero,"Sep 10, 2024",9/10,"This film is simply a masterpiece. Sergio Leone chooses to change the themes of his typical ""western film"", adding a woman as the protagonist (a prostitute looking for a new life) and placing three very differently characterized characters alongside her. The first and nicest character is the infallible and light-hearted (even a little romantic) bandit called ""Cheyenne"". Cheyenne is played by a formidable Jason Robards, who with his graying beard and his melancholic, incisive eyes is perfect. Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda, on the other hand, are two very skilled gunslingers, one good (Bronson, who always plays the harmonica) and the other bad (Fonda) who have an unfinished business to settle. The beautiful landscapes of ""Monument Valley"" provide the backdrop for epic battles and the construction of a railroad that introduces the ""wild west"" to the modern world. The romantic, melancholic and dreamy atmospheres of these Sergio Leone films make it unique and unforgettable. Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is also unforgettable as he creates a musical theme for each character with great sagacity."
shishirgemawat,"Dec 22, 2018",N/A,"Finally got around to watching this absolute epic that is one of the best Westerns I have seen to date. I appreciated the layered plot when compared to most of the classic westerns I have seen, which usually consist of overly simplistic narratives. The cinematography was so pleasingly detailed at times, starting with the opening scene, and so widely encompassing at other times, expertly capturing the beauty of the West. No surprise either that Morricone's score was incredible and probably more integral to my enjoyment of this film than any other aspect."

It's worth seeing and re-seeing for any one of its outstanding features: just for its cinematography; just for Ennio Morricone's music; just for the intricate and captivating screenplay and story by Morricone, Sergio Donati, Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci; just for the measured and intense performances by its great stars and great character actors supporting them; just for the amazing location shots and detailed production values of a high-budget film; just for the loving, painstaking references to the great Western films that preceded it; and just for the social commentary of a past world, a world we probably wrongly mythologized and distorted forever in our memories."
AaronCapenBanner,"Sep 6, 2013",6/10,"Sergio Leone's follow up to his superlative ""Man With No Name"" trilogy is highly acclaimed in some circles, a bit too much so to be honest, but is still a well acted story of a woman(beautiful Claudia Cardinale) who comes to the west as a mail-order-bride, only to find that her would-be family was wiped out by a cold-hearted gunfighter(Henry Fonda, cast effectively against type). She nonetheless vows to carry on, and is later helped by a man known as Harmonica(Charles Bronson) who has also vowed to kill the same man that killed her family.Sprawling story details the westward expansion by train that transformed America irrevocably, ending many ways of life. I did like this film, it is stylish and ambitious, with a good score, but it does become tedious at times, not to mention uncomfortable(Fonda's scenes with Cardinale, for instance...) I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"", but film is still memorable, just not a ""classic""."
Ismaninb,"Jan 7, 2007",4/10,"In my opinion Sergio Leone is one of the best directors ever. But Once upon a time in the West is his failure. Whenever I watch a Leone movie, I am prepared for a slow pace - and am surprised that it is actually steady. OutW really is too slow. There is no typical Leone tension build up. The final shoot out is a meager copy of the two previous ones with Lee van Cleef involved. Henry Fonda is not a convincing villain like Van Cleef and Volonte (Fonda - and Leone - took revenge though with My name is Nobody). Charles Bronson is not underacting like Clint Eastwood - Bronson is simply not acting. Wallach is missing - I cannot even remember what kind of character Cheyenne is. There is no character development. There are no tricks, black humour, double and triple crosses. In fact there is hardly a story. I am happy to learn, that I am not the only one to prefer the Dollar movies. I also prefer all the movies Leone directed after this on, as far as I have seen them (the most). In fact I have been thinking of rating OutW with a 1. But that is not fair. The opening scene with the three hit men waiting for the train is absolutely brilliant, with Leone's typical eye for the detail."
chrisshort-26816,"Sep 14, 2024",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in the West is a cinematic masterpiece that redefined the Western genre. Sergio Leone's epic tale unfolds with a slow-burning intensity, immersing viewers in a world of dusty landscapes, moral ambiguity, and unforgettable characters. Henry Fonda delivers a chilling performance as a ruthless villain, while Charles Bronson's enigmatic harmonica player is a force of nature. Claudia Cardinale adds a touch of vulnerability and beauty to the narrative. Ennio Morricone's iconic score elevates the film to new heights. With its stunning visuals, unforgettable characters, and haunting themes, Once Upon a Time in the West is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences."
ktangney-56206,"Jun 17, 2025",10/10,"The great filmmaker Sergio Leone has achieved excellence yet again! But this time, he has crafted the best Western ever made, and quite possibly, the finest movie ever made!Once again, he wisely begins the film with little to no dialog - preferring to let the barren landscape do the talking.Charles Bronson, playing ""Harmonica,"" adeptly grasps the baton from Clint Eastwood to play ""The Man With No Name."" And Leone's instincts were spot-on - Bronson is the better choice over Eastwood for this particular film; Bronson is a little more brawny, a little swarthier, and he conveys slightly more mystery.Aided by the desolate landscapes, Leone portrays a story of widespread, existential loneliness. Sure, the movie boasts a cast of hundreds upon hundreds, but the viewer intuits the fact that each character is utterly alone in the world. This is a movie of bleak individuality. Everyone is carrying a pistol or rifle, & there's no police department within a thousand miles. Nowhere is the existential loneliness better embodied than in the demise of the character Morton, played by Gabriele Ferzetti.One has to be impressed by the combined star power in ""Once Upon A Time In The West."" I mean, come on, Jason Robards, Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson, &, of course the great Henry Fonda, who plays ""Frank.""Frank is probably the greatest villain in film history, and, mind you, Henry Fonda was playing against type. Frank's frigid blue eyes are filled with a brooding, ever-present hatred, ill-will, and one suspects, a perverse sense of amusement regarding his own Evil. When he's about to murder someone, is that a smirk we see cross his lips?Although the viewer never discovers what happened to Frank as a child - what caused him to become gnarled, twisted, & Evil, one thing is for certain: Frank is one of the most indomitable villains ever to appear on a movie screen. But what about Harmonica? He hasn't disappeared - he's still in the mix!Some words must be written about the greatness of filmmaker Sergio Leone. Leone made the masterpieces ""A Fistful Of Dollars,"" ""For A Few Dollars More,"" ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" ""Once Upon A Time In The West,"" and ""Once Upon A Time In America""! This means Leone fashioned 5 films, each of which could be pronounced ""The Greatest Film Ever Made""!No other great filmmaker can approach this 5-film total! Not Andrei Tarkovsky; not Bernardo Bertolucci; not Federico Fellini; not Alfred Hitchcock; not Werner Herzog; not Ingmar Bergman; not Orson Welles; not Franco Zeffirelli; not Pier Pasolini; and not Martin Scorsese! And don't forget, Alejandro Jodorowsky is continually hanging on by his fingernails at the very periphery of the filmmakers ""insiders club.""I believe this means Sergio Leone is the greatest filmmaker of all-time!So, by all means, watch the greatest Western ever made - ""Once Upon A Time In The West""!10 out of 10 stars!"
Tweetienator,"Jan 26, 2022",9/10,"Sergio Leone was a poet - he gave us that many iconic scenes and pictures (in fantastic collab with the tunes of maestro Ennio Morricone). Once Upon a Time in the West is no exception, a rather simple revenge story but how it is drawn before our eyes. And last but not least, Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda are superb. Without doubt, this is one of those few movies who define a whole genre, and not many will deliver that kind of excellence, no matter how much time will pass."
alexhernandezlawyer,"Aug 27, 2022",10/10,"This is one movie I can watch over and over and never get tired. The nostalgia, the settings, the cinematography all combine to create one of the best Spaghetti Westerns ever made. Ennio Morricone's touch on the background music, the subtle crescendos and musical notes just are not matched with most movies today. At the times where Clint Eastwood was making Spaghetti Westerns popular, Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson create the epic good guy versus bad guy story. Jason Robards adds a whimsical touch to this movie overall. The beautiful starlet Claudia Carnale is a great touch to an Italian film by an Italian beauty. This is one movie you should watch."
luukramaker,"Oct 28, 2013",10/10,"Once upon a time there was a European who perfected the typical and old American western genre. It was the Italian Sergio Leone who succeeded to reach this seemingly impossible perfectionism. With Once Upon a Time in the West he brought both his own career and the complete genre to the highest level. Of course that's just my opinion and there are a lot of people who would disagree with that statement, but for me this extraordinarily great movie seems currently unbeatable. Now, the last 45 years much has been said and written about this movie, but that doesn't prevent me to add my humble opinion to the increasing number of shared opinions about it. The fact that I truly love this movie was just something I didn't want to stay unmentioned.Yesterday, one of the songs of Ennio Morricone's wonderful soundtrack got stuck in my head. The characteristic sound of Cheyenne had kept me busy the whole day and because it had already been a year since I saw the movie for the last time I decided to see it once again.Almost every time there's been talked about this movie in the past there's been talked about the distinctive, sluggish, but powerful beginning. We're lucky that the three men were not half an hour early for the train, because it shouldn't have last much longer before boredom would've struck. However, right now, with only ten minutes to wait before the train comes in, the beginning is brilliant. You then approximately know what's about to come 'cause in the rest of the movie Leone also takes ample time to show what he wants to show and with the pace in which the movie continues there isn't much important you can be missing.Every character which can be found in the movie is a unique and original one, without any form of overacting or a highly overdone presence of one of them. Whether it's about the remarkable Harmonica, which attracts the most attention with the striking tune he plays, or about Cheyenne, which can be recognized by his own theme as well, all of them ensure that it's enjoyable from the beginning till the end because of their abstruse, unknown history. Furthermore, Leone succeeds to let his characters behave very human, just like he did in his previous movies. They all have both their good and their bad sides and none of those sides is hidden, let alone that one of the characters is idealized.Yet the movie feels a little unrealistic in the sense that it seems to take place in a different universe. Especially the slowness in which everything happens makes you feel like you're looking into another world. In particular, the time that is taken to say something feels unreal, while on the other hand it gives a magical feeling as well. It's Ennio Morricone who perfects the ensuing mysterious atmosphere.But a movie would be nothing without actors. Actors which are all delivering a great performance in this movie. Jason Robards perhaps got the best role. He seems to be made for the role of Cheyenne and it's wonderful to see how he slowly changes during the movie. I think Charles Bronson plays the best role in his career and just like Henry Fonda he's acting great in the interesting, mysterious conflict in which they're involved. In my view, Claudia Cardinale can do no wrong and she therefore brings along the necessary femininity in a perfect way. Finally, Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Gabriele Ferzetti deserve a special mention which they owe to their great performances, although not all of their roles had very much influence on the movie's story.After the very good beginning and the great continuation the ending is at least as admirable as the foregoing. A shootout wasn't a big innovation and there already was a foretaste of the use of flashbacks in Leone's earlier For a Few Dollars More, but the way he combines these two elements and the quality of the combination makes sure that the end is more brilliant than that of the average movie. After the first few blurry, mysterious flashbacks the flashback at the end ensures clarification. Then everything falls into place and some of the characters seem to face a happy life ever after."
pushkinpuss,"Oct 21, 2004",N/A,"I've seen and enjoyed this movie twice.Each time I watched it I took it for granted that Cardinale has sex with Fonda because she's trying to save her own life. She's using the skills she learned as a prostitute to seduce him into sparing her. But I've heard this scene referred to (even on the DVD commentary) as a love scene? And when I recently referred to it as the scene when Fonda rapes Cardinale, my companion looked baffled. Rape may be the wrong word (tho' if Fonda knows she isn't having sex with him by choice, what else is it?) but how anyone could call this sick situation a love scene is beyond me. What do other people think? Have I totally misread it?"
Shilo_R_A,"Aug 23, 2022",7/10,"""It's easy to find you. Bastard. I don't have to kill you now. You leave a slime behind you like a snail.Two beautiful shiny rails.""Before the actual review I'm gonna say this: I can probably count the number of westerns I've seen on three fingers tops, including this one (if you consider it a western). I let you know that since I know that understanding this film fully might require some further dive into westerns in general, but I'm gonna review it in light of my current experience of it. Maybe one day I'll come back to it and maybe not. We shall see.Anyway, Once Upon a Time in the West follows this small wild-west town as a farmer named Brett McBain is murdered, alongside his children. His murder leads to certain reveals, certain conflicts regarding his land and a mysterious man with an harmonica who seems to take special interest in the shady man who might be behind the murder.Let's start with the most noticeable thing about this film, which works both in its advantage and against it. This film is slow. It works well because in many points the slow pacing allows the film the work as a slow-burn, building up slowly to epic moments or creating a specific vibe that immerses you as a viewer. On the other hand, there's something like half an hour in the beginning of the second act that just feels way too slow. It's exhausting. So yeah, I like it overall, but it also makes this film more exhausting than it should be imo, at times.Talking about immersive stuff, I'm gonna address the score. The score is really, really solid. Beyond just being epic and well-produced in general, I think that the way the film uses the score in a digestive way most of the times is really cool and unique. When the music you hear is present in the scene itself, it creates this immersive atmosphere that I like a lot. The cinematography makes you feel like you're there as well, and has a certain beautiful grittiness to it, which is no surprise considering the fact that this film is directed by Sergio Leone.The characters, well, I feel like I've grown to appreciate them more on my second viewing. I mean, sure, the dialogue was iconic and memorable in my eyes on the first viewing too, and there were many creative and fun moments (the thing with the boot, that whole scene on the train) but on my first viewing it felt like the characters were just okay and carried *by* it instead of carrying *it*. On the second viewing, however, I realized that the characters have nuance that is definitely felt. Jill, Morton and Frank all felt more fleshed-out on a second viewing, though no character here is ""great"" per se. Solid, though. Decent. I especially like that one sexual interaction we see in the film - I won't elaborate so there won't be any spoilers, but it says much about the characters involved and the score is definitely haunting in that scene.There's a certain theme here about progress and the rush for it, but it doesn't fully click with me. I think I understand it overall and appreciate it, but it doesn't feel whole to me at the moment. Like, I sort-of get it but it doesn't fully work for me.To sum it up: Once Upon a Time in the West is a very well-made film on a technical level. It has great score and solid cinematography. It's also a fun, creative and very iconic film at many points (very quotable, too). The characters are solid as well. My main issue is the slow pacing, which works well for most of the film but feels really exhausting in others, especially during the first leg of the second act. I'm feeling a 7.2/10 on this one. Solid, but definitely overrated in my eyes."
tiberijegrozni,"Nov 9, 2004",10/10,"This is one true masterpiece, I can't remember any other movie (and I have seen a lot of movies) that is so powerful like this one. This movie has everything great ambient, scenes larger then life, hypnotic Morricone music and what is most important great acting. In this move Sergio Leone proved that he is one of the most unique directors in movie history. If you saw this movie you know that almost every scene is great piece of art in almost every scene you are amazed by visual style of Leone. In all other great movies (like: Godfather, Casablanca, Citizen Cane, Notorious,Big Sleep, The Third Man, etc.), you won't find these many great scenes like in this one. This is an ultimate Western and i want to say: Thank you Sergio Leone for your great vision and this masterpiece, after this one there is no need for any other western, in compare to this one John Fords westerns are movies for kids and women."
RatedVforVinny,"Dec 17, 2019",9/10,"A true vision of the 'Wild West' frontier, from the Italian maestro Sergio Leone. All of his films apart from 'Duck, You Sucker!', are either perfect, or near perfect productions. I have a slight preference for the 'Dollars Trilogy' but this epic is simply magnificent. You just won't see a poor review to this one, as it's already a certified classic. Is highly ironic that 'A Fistful of Dollars' was so poorly received on its initial release but just four years later, the world had already bowed to the genius of both the director and especially Ennio Morricone (who scored the film, even before the first shot was filmed). A further masterstroke, was casting Henry Fonda, as the bad man and with a whole host of stars as the back up. Timeless in every aspect, coupled with some of the very finest gun-play."
msmith-87318,"Jul 23, 2015",9/10,"This is the fourth film taken from Sergio Leone's Dollars series. Once Upon a Time in the West is a fantastic masterpiece. The slow pace of the film only serves to increase the amazement at the beautiful presented scenery. The music score provided Ennio Morricone is just amazing, its so powerful its almost chilling in nature. The character played by Henry Fonda thrills me every time I watch this film and the music that is associated to the character again chilling. The character that Henry Fonda plays is Frank and he is ice cold. Henry's eyes are such a vivid blue as the camera pans around on him. Just mesmerising.The film is set towards the end of the ""Old West"" era with modern America creeping in.Under no circumstances should you ever miss this film its a must watch!"

But, as of now, I've only seen ""Once Upon a Time in the West"".The film is a classic epic spaghetti western, with great atmosphere, great performances, and, of course, an excellent soundtrack by Ennio Morricone!

jack_malvern,"Feb 17, 2006",7/10,"A squeaking wind pump, a dripping water tower and the baking sun. The beginning of Once Upon a Time in the West, in which three hired guns wait wordlessly at a train station for their target to arrive, is one of the best openings in cinema history. It is every bit as tense as Sergio Leone's finale in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, which he filmed two years earlier.But good as this Western revenge saga is, it is not as accessible and a good deal slower than the other films in Sergio Leone's series of Westerns (namely A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). What many reviewers describe as its ""operatic"" and ""epic"" nature can also be read as ""occasionally mawkish"" and ""overlong"".That said, this story earns its status as a classic for combining the gun-toting fun of westerns with the grand theme of the end of the Wild West, brought about by the arrival of the railroad. The railroad is the villain here as Henry Fonda plays an unscrupulous blue-eyed bad guy paid to force landowners to sell up cheap so the rails can pass through.Charles Bronson is a darker take on Leone's man-with-no-name character, but it is debatable whether that makes him more interesting then Clint Eastwood's version.The main characters each have a theme tune, opera-style, which is an interesting motif, but quite an irritating one when you have heard the harmonica tune for the 30th time.A fine movie, but claims that it changed the western any more than Leone's previous films or that it is better than The Good, the Bad and the Ugly should be taken with a pinch of salt."
BA_Harrison,"May 23, 2015",5/10,"A nasty railroad magnate hires some bad, bad men—led by evil gunslinger Frank (Henry Fonda)—to ensure that nothing gets in the way of business. Mysterious stranger Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards) do their best to stop the baddies in their tracks. Beautiful widow Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) gives the men something else to think about other than shooting each other.There are those who consider Once Upon A Time In The West to be director Sergio Leone's magnum opus: with a magnificent cast, and contributions from some of Italian cinema's greatest names (the script is by Leone, Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci, the cinematography is by Tonino Delli Colli, and the score is, of course, by Ennio Morricone), the film certainly has an excellent pedigree.However, while it does boast solid performances and is often very impressive to look at (the widescreen cinematography is terrific), the film suffers from a severe case of over-indulgence, Leone taking his trademark themes and visual touches to the nth degree, the exaggerated style ultimately getting in the way of the storytelling. The director's signature moves are so excessive and drawn out that Once Upon A Time In The West proves hard to get through without dozing off at least once.Watch if you want to waste several minutes of your life as Jack Elam tries to blow a fly off his face, or to hear Charles Bronson repeatedly playing the same few notes on his harmonica, but give it a miss if you're looking for something even remotely as cool as any of Leone's Eastwood movies."
SnoopyStyle,"Jul 25, 2015",9/10,"The man with a Harmonica (Charles Bronson) arrives at a desolate train station. He's met by three gunmen sent by Frank (Henry Fonda) and he promptly kills them. Jill (Claudia Cardinale) is a new young bride from New Orleans. She arrives to live with her husband Brett McBain and his family in an isolated desert homestead he calls Sweatwater. She finds the whole McBain family massacred. Cheyenne (Jason Robards) is the prime suspect but he joins her along with Harmonica to seek revenge on the real killers, Frank and his men who are working for the railroad.This is a western dripping with the Sergio Leone style. The story is simple. It's a lot of attitude. The movie starts with the great Harmonica arrival scene. Woody Strode and Jack Elam are so great that I wish they survived to stay in the movie. A minor problem is that the opening scene is so great that the rest of the movie struggles at times to return to that level."
guy gatebois,"Jun 20, 2001",10/10,"""Once upon a time in the west"" symbolizes the quintessence of theatrical ceremonial. Sergio Leone seized the traditional western and, helped by his scriptwriter Dario Argento, the future reference of giallo and baroque slaughter on large screens, enriched it with emphatic approach and humorous disenchantment. In fact, he builds a myth with modest elements - an organ mouth, a blue-eyed glance, long coats - and introduces lyricism and immoderation, to sublimate the manners of this specific spectacle. The daring of realization - inverted or encircling shot - and artistic choice (Henry Fonda becomes a tough guy) express an authentic will to break the common rules, in order to confer sensible density on his characters and an aesthetic energy on his scenery. Paradoxically, this glittering vision of Redemption, which was hesitating between homage and parody, belongs now to the classics. Looking for ruins poetry and contemporary genesis, the director has created an absolute. A story beginning by ""Once upon a time"" contains always some scraps of eternity..."

hitchcockthelegend,"Nov 7, 2010",9/10,"Once Upon A Time In The West is directed by Sergio Leone and stars Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale, Jason Robards & Henry Fonda. Leone co-wrote the screenplay with Sergio Donati, while the story was provided by Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci. Ennio Morricone scores the music and cinematography is from Tonino Delli Colli.After finishing The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in 1966, Sergio Leone felt he had done all he wanted to do with the Western genre. Thankfully that wasn't to be the case as he was lured back into Oaterville to make the unique and quite superb C'era una volta il West in 1968. Greeted with negative reviews on its release in America, it was a financial flop. But in Europe the film was richly received and took the box offices by storm. Time has showed the film to have risen above cult status to be widely acknowledged as one of the finest Western film's of all time.Everything about the film is bigger and bolder than previous Leone works. Opening with an almost silent ten minute sequence that has become legendary, the film follows four characters as they dovetail towards the reckoning. Harmonica (Bronson), Frank (Fonda), Jill McBain (Cardinale) & Cheyenne (Robards), all linked by death, and with each one represented in the narrative by a piece of music. Leone clinically weaves the four stories into one operatic whole. Not all of it makes perfect sense, which stops it being the masterpiece many consider it being. But its observations of Western mysticism, capitalism and progression of time; and with scores to of course be settled too, it makes for a fine story nestling in amongst the beautiful treats for the eyes and ears.While Leone clearly homages the genre and pays tribute to the old America (you will lose count spotting the Western film steals), his film is ultimately very much a pastiche piece. But he gets away with that lack of freshness (the story at the core mirrors Johnny Guitar for example) due to the unique structure. It's meticulously paced as the characters are fleshed out to the max, sometimes even without dialogue. Smart directing as Leone makes the story more richer and weightier in substance. Morricone's score is magnificent and so is Colli's photography, with the latter's shooting of Monument Valley good enough to have featured in John Ford oeuvre. While the casting is inspiring, notably Fonda as a villain (the impact shocked many back in the day).I can't call it a masterpiece because it does lift from many other sources, but it's darn close to being a perfect movie. One thing is for sure, that in it's uncut form the film is a work of art. Where repeat viewings keep rewarding and never dilute the enjoyment. 9/10"
tedg,"Dec 4, 2007",N/A,"Its odd how one comes to a film. I saw this one nearly 40 years ago in an edition that was chopped up. The sound and score was reprocessed and muted. It was terrible. I lumped it in with the Clint Eastwood trilogy. Those movies were fun in the manner of an then new extreme style. But the concept was thin and knowing that one was an exact copy of a Kurosawa samurai movie sort of took the American link out of them. (That specific film was remade again starring Bruce Willis and was superior.)Now after all this time, I come back to it and find it whole, a new thing. Its wonderful. Its as wonderful as advertised. There are all sorts of joys. One is the many references to ordinary, series westerns. Another is the meditative pace; a sort of an anti-action movie rooted in place and place-derived intents. These two things alone would place it as high as IMDb readers have chosen.But there are two other things that matter more to me. The first is obvious: the sound design. Few filmmakers seem to want to leverage sound much. Malick is one, but the idea there is to make an independent layer over the images. Here, the sound saturates the images. In my experience, it is unique in its effectiveness. And that's one of the other shocks: I don't think I would have been able to appreciate it as much as a young man. I've been watching films more lucidly for only a few years now and though all the other components here are ordinary but perhaps extended, this strikes me as wholly new.The other thing probably requires one to have gone through a couple stupid American wars. The second one makes all the difference, because the first was still based on the notion of doing good even if the means were bankrupt. Now, a world can look at westerns and not automatically make the John Ford connection: that Monument Valley and open spaces mean freedom. Frontier gunplay and violence automatically invoked populist justice.It took this movie to break things. And it took this long for them to break. Westerns are a notation for America, a story about an accidental nation. A collection of simple notes for us to grasp. This movie is about westerns in precisely the same way. I study these constructions and nearly always say that the underlying or original goal is to increase the viewer's engagement. But this case is different: the layers provide a distance. It allows us to see the notation about the notation about what will always be a notation: national identity.Of the sections, the opening is the best. At some point when the web grows to allow clips to be annotated online and ranked separate from the movie, that sequence will rate very high.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

imaxxing,"Feb 11, 2024",8/10,"Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" serves remarkably elegiac and ahead-of-its-time filmmaking for 1968 with a Morricone score to boot. Leone captures the harshness and drudgery of the scabrous, hardy and calloused gunslingers and desperados of the Wild, soon to be tamed, West during the 1880s; with a signature use of low shots with drawn-out and melodramatically extreme close-ups; but with a slight dearth of dialogue. His work here encapsulates the spirit and theme of several different grand westerns rolled into one, as if a hazy fairytale backed by that now famous crooning harmonica. Ingenious elements like this are an apotheosis of the genre and an operatically parodying pastiche of that fabled and legendary stretch of American history.It's no question that these depicted men are surely accustomed to action over words; but the apparent selective mutism leaves a little too much to the viewer's imagination and too little to their charming, stirring, and regaling; as wincing and piercing blue eyes locked in staredowns are often the preferred language, buttressed more by a slew of slow pacing, spitting, smoking, wry smiles, and the flexing of crow's feet. This laconic language of the cutthroat survivalist's Wild West is Leone's preferred, and carries over from the Clint Eastwood 'Dollars' films, with it being a project initially offered to Eastwood - but turned down, with the part of No-Name 'Harmonica' going to the steely Charles Bronson instead.The film has an intermission so should be seen as two parts. Its 3-hour runtime, if seen in one sitting, is lengthy, but perhaps needed for Leone's ambitiously complex story involving killers, land rights, railroads, long-delayed revenge, mistaken identity, love triangles, double-crosses and shoot-outs. The allegory of the laying of the railroad signals the transition from a wild frontier to an organised civilisation. With Henry Fonda's character Frank acknowledging his partnership with a crippled railroad tycoon is also an abandonment of his outlaw lifestyle and an admission that his times are over.Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) as the leading lady is caught in the narrative's crossfire but captures the hearts of all sides, epitomising the woman-as-survivor part women undertook. She's an almost mythical feminine force, grounding the loose cannons around her. Perhaps it's evidence that Leone was giving thought to the roles and sufferings of women in the grandiose, death-and-glory landscape of the American west.In 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". The film is regarded as one of the greatest Westerns of all time and one of the greatest films of all time.7.7/10."
djbeardpaperclip,"Feb 1, 2025",7/10,A classic gunslinger movie. The real star is the sound track music by Ennio Morricone which is haunting. The other major star is the landscape: the spectacular Monument valley. The three male leads all produce strong performances with Henry Fonda as the baddie. Charles Bronson as his nemesis (in the role declined by Clint Eastwood); and Jason Robards as the outlaw being set up. Claudia Cardinale does a fair impression of Racquel Welsh. The expansion of the railway generates the opportunity for lucrative property development and in the Wild West that is more than enough motivation for bloodshed.
g-a-1,"Oct 2, 2003",1/10,"every scene filled with extended pauses and unnecessary camera angles, if you want boring to death between the paucity of action (ridiculous and totally without suspense) then this is surely the film for you! You say who knows the reason for the protagonists conflict? I say who cares! I had lost interest ......along with the will to live.....long before the end of this grindingly dull movie. Is this the result of a group of profits motivated film executives thinking ""wow we have a major director here, lets allow him to do ANYTHING he wants, after all it MUST be good!""? Next time hire a cheaper director but pay for some decent dialogue!"
ReadingFilm,"Feb 24, 2024",10/10,"I have had a strange experience with this movie. I saw it in a midnight screening in 2008, and I found it painfully boring. Tons of people walked out the screening. By the end, I was frustrated and felt I wasted my time. Any time I reflected on the movie I got annoyed and felt it is massively overrated. I never re-watched the movie again.But about 2 years ago, I woke up one day and out of nowhere, I realized that it is one of the greatest movies ever made. I finally rewatched it now, and I agree with myself. So what I think happens is that we watch a movie, our mind rewatches it, the movie matures as we mature.Some movies we thought would mean more to us, don't mean much with time. Some films that we ignored, suddenly become important. Some films can latch onto your spirit when you don't expect it."
view_and_review,"Mar 23, 2019",8/10,"The familiar face of Clint Eastwood was replaced with that of Charles Bronson in this western and not a beat was missed. Bronson played the steely-eyed, rugged gunslinger with a penchant for playing the harmonica. Harmonica play has a whole new meaning to me now. For me, the harmonica chords in this movie are right there with the whistling soundtrack of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" The story unfolded in a rather unorthodox fashion with the various characters but it was all tied up in the end."
ranjanmishrap,"Nov 26, 2024",10/10,"Loved watching the movie full of suspense. This film is more than just a Western; it's an epic that explores themes of revenge, justice, and the inevitable passage of time. It's a cinematic journey that captivates from start to finish. ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a timeless classic that elevates storytelling to an art form-truly a must-see for any lover of film.Ennio Morricone's score is nothing short of legendary-each note strikes a perfect balance between grandeur and subtlety, amplifying the emotional depth of every scene.

daisukereds,"Nov 29, 2025",7/10,"When a villainous gunslinger starts thinking bigger, they take advantage of others, for a reason.. but their past deeds always catch up to them.Following a philosophy of ""show, don't tell"", this film delivers a simple and straightforward script. But it still manages to deliver interesting background elements, charming and well-written characters, a satisfying conclusion, and developments that feel fresh even today. I personally didn't find the score particularly memorable, though. But I did like everything else.. quite a pleasant watch."
drystyx,"Mar 7, 2007",1/10,"Sergio Leone will one day, maybe fifty years from now, replace Mister Wood on every critic's list as the worst movie director of all time. He'll at least make the top ten. At least Wood could make a story interesting, at least one character you might care about, and didn't have the gigantic Leone budget. Leone fails on every level. The story is very disjointed. It's mostly just comically unrealistic gunplay, with some guys being able to kill minor characters from great distances, but unable to kill major stars that should be easier. That's nothing new, but the circumstances are quite laughable. The story is just killing after killing, to take land away, and it follows sadist Henry Fonda, and his opponents, Charles Bronson and Jason Robards. Jack Elam appears in what amounts to a cameo. The characters aren't much to like. Bronson makes little jokes like an underdog hero of a Japanese movie, but the plot is so bad, and the characters so unlikable, you don't really care. To be fair, they aren't as unlikable as other spaghetti Westerns, but they don't have any appeal, either. You struggle to watch the film. You won't be able to do in one sitting. You'll have to watch a piece at a time, because you will fall to sleep. What makes the movie a bomb is the use of such outstanding cool music that neither matches or contrasts the situation. It falls flat, and it is a waste of good music."
picobenguet,"Feb 13, 2022",10/10,"I've watched hundreds of westerns, and this tops them all. Truly amazing, a combination of the best spaghetti and American western in one movie. A great epic, beautiful cinematography, excellent story.I just love all 3 main leading actors, and even Claudia Cardinale fits into the story nicely. Henry Fonda's facial expression is priceless, the face of a killer. The close-ups done by Sergio Leone is all good, beautiful in capturing various expressions, or even just the stoic expression of Charles Bronson.The new generation shouldn't miss this picture, it has aged well, and I just watched it again in its restored version yesterday.Other great westerns - Unforgiven, Day Of The Outlaw, Lawman, Winchester '73, and so many others :)"
aleksanderk-95350,"Jun 21, 2021",8/10,Amazing film with wonderful acting. The film is very slow paced with long scenes. It does not get boring though and stays entertaining. Which is a very challenging thing to do. The acting mainly keeps it exciting and interesting. An amazing performance from Henry Fonda. Who does an excellent job at being a sinister evil gunslinger. Charles Bronson is great as well creating a mysterious persona.
otetdec,"Sep 14, 2024",9/10,"And then came this film. The title, 'Once Upon A Time In The West' must have seemed to mean nothing more than 'just another western' to the unexpecting viewers at the time. Oh boy were they wrong. With this movie, Sergio Leone singlehandedly redefined the western genre and no American western would ever match the brilliant spirit in which it was made. While the story is basically the same as in any other western, it is the WAY in which it is presented that so clearly distances this western from others. Whereas other westerns are simply stories that are designed to entertain, this movie is an emotional masterpiece that will move your heart. Sergio Leone takes the ordinary western and replaces words with looks, and conversations with feelings and emotions. With his brutal but honest portrayal of the sheer hardness of life and death in those times he thoroughly destroys the old romantic idea of the west as a 'generally-hunky-dory-kind-of-scene with the occasional bad guy and indian' and replaces it with an eerie, dark, hot and dry place where life is cheap and only the strongest will survive.I cannot adequately convey in words the way in which Sergio Leone deepens and defines the characters by pure means of visual persuasion. It starts with the three gunman in the beginning of the movie, waiting for some reason at a train station for someone or something that obviously is going to be on the next train. No explanation, no conversation; not a word is said. Even the stationmaster is ushered into captivity without a single audible threat. Then comes the waiting... Any other director would have skipped directly to the moment of arrival, but Sergio Leone takes minutes of boredom and translates it into a visual feast, deepening the characters that are portrayed and making them more human, more real to the viewer, while at the same time encompassing us with a deep dark sense of foreboding. This way in which the story is not just augmented but in times completely replaced by the sheer visual drama, is perfected by the absolute fantastic music, directed by Ennio Morricone. Who needs words and explanations when the combined forces of cinematic mastery and heart-tearing music are not just able to carry the story, but pick it up and push it up to such heights of excellence that it has no equal in it's genre?Another great feat that adds to the power of this movie is the minimalistic way of portrayal of the characters as real, emotional people. Not a single word is said that isn't required for the understanding of the story, yet the characters feel more true than those in movies where whole conversations are added merely to explain their motives. Instead of words, the camera focuses on the characters...so that you can simply read the emotion off their faces. Often no explanation is given other than than a mere facial expression. No superheroes or supercriminals, just real, desire-laden, traumatised, obsessed people that act upon motives inherently understood by the viewer.All in all this is without a single doubt in my mind the greatest western of all times, and even though Sergio Leone has made many more mindblowing, heart-shattering westerns like this one, like 'A Fistful of Dynamite', 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly', and 'For a Few Dollars More', none could equal 'Once Upon A Time In The West' in sheer magnitude of perfection. Western has never been the same since....I only wish I'd have been there in 1969 when the movie was new and see it, for the first time with fresh innocent eyes and an unexpecting mind..just like 2001: A Space Odyssey (also of 1969, a year of legends).A tip for those who have never seen this movie: Bribe, beg, borrow, or steal yourself into possession of a Videobeam and Hifi-audio equipment if you can't find a cinema that is showing this movie. Turn the audio up WAY HIGH (never mind the neighbors) and prepare never to be the same again.........I (obviously) gave this movie a 10 because no matter how hard I try I can't find anything less than perfect about it.864 out of 1,053 found this helpfuljsmith-7466129 June 2019

Some people just don't get this movie
The slower pace is what makes this movie unique. The attention given to detail in terms of facial expressions, scenery, symbolism, and an operatic type musical score is what sets this move apart from other westerns. After seeing John Wick 3, I can honestly say that I long for less action and more substance. There is something to be said about the old ways. If you haven't seen this movie, give it a shot. It will be worth the 2 hours and 45 minutes.62 out of 71 found this helpfulSadako-Toyboy26 July 1999
pure cinematic paradise
Thank god that I'm a Bronson fan. This was my first Leone movie, and dumb kid that I was, I actually watched it thinking I was in for a typical Bronson ""vehicle""! Looking back I'm thankful, because if it wasn't for his involvement, I would never have discovered the beauty and majesty that is Once Upon a Time in the West.I absolutely love this movie. It's probably my all time favourite, certainly one of the few that I can watch OVER and OVER again without losing interest. I love the way Leone creates intrigue and mystery around what is a relatively thin plot. He can make even the smallest twist of fate seem like an epic turn of events, with that amazing sense of revelation that he generates out of old hackneyed situations (something Argento has since picked up). Leone proves in this film that he could seemingly take anyone, even peripheral characters, and give them screen charisma without using dialogue as a crutch.OUATITW features the most tense two man stand-offs ever, with some serious deja-vu in the direction of his ""Dollars"" trilogy. In fact, it does feel like those three movies were warm ups, practice sessions in the build up to OUATITW. Here though, he perfected everything; despite the long running time, it's all focused, and without a single irrelevant scene. For me, the two hours plus just fly by, I wish it would never end. Leone was without question at his artistic peak when he made this, that's not to say that he went downhill from then on, but I honestly don't think he ever did another film where everything came together so perfectly.The cast is flawless. Fonda eclipsed every good guy he ever did in one fell swoop, truly chilling. Robards is a great comic character, the lovable rogue with an edge. And Cardinale is more than just (incredible) window dressing; she switches between passionate, angry, delicate and sentimental at all the right moments.Which leaves the hero; I'm a huge Eastwood fan, but I honestly don't believe he could have done the role justice. His ""man with no name"" was a cool, sly character with hidden complexities. Eastwood always does these layered personalities, with some kind of mental baggage. Bronson, on the other hand, mostly does himself; simple, uncomplicated figures with only one state of mind, that's why he's put in so many revenge flicks. Plus, he looks like he's been seriously wronged at some point in his life, Eastwood doesn't have that quality. Bronson is the genuine hard-as-nails article. You can readily imagine that, had he been born decades earlier and been put in the same situation, he would resolve the problem in much the same way as his character in the movie (sometimes I affectionately refer to this movie as Deathwish part 0- could Harmonica be the great granddaddy of Paul Kersey?).Of course the other great contribution is the music. I still think that the main theme is one of the most breathtaking pieces of music I have ever heard. It affects me deeply whenever I hear it, regardless of the mood I'm in. Maybe I should listen to more opera or something, I don't know, but that's the way I feel. And the individual character themes are just so well integrated into the film, it's unbelievable. Leone replaces words with music, and it conveys so much more in return. Bronson just plays that melancholy tune on the harmonica instead of answering people back, it consistently cracks me up.High Noon, Naked Spur, Shane, The Searchers, etc. Are all classics of the genre, but I really don't think it's possible to compare those ""traditional"" westerns with OUATITW. For me, it exists on a plane of it's own, it's the kind of film experience that you let wash over you, a waking dream. I recommend this movie to anyone, if you're on the right wavelength you'll be greatly rewarded.357 out of 456 found this helpfulccthemovieman-128 June 2006

Excruciating Slow Or Fascinating: Your Choice
This was a unique western, one in which sometimes the action moves excruciatingly slow, which can either be fascinating or boring. Unfortunately for me, after spending big bucks for the DVD when it first came out, I found it more boring than fascinating. In my previous viewings, I always found it fascinating. Maybe I just had a bad day.The movie is filled with gaps of silence while closeups of the main characters' faces are shown. That's director Sergio Leone's trademark, and I believe he does it more in this film than in any of his others. When you get closeups of chiseled faces like Henry Fonda's or Charles Bronson's, it quite interesting but most of the movie feels like slow motion. At 165 minutes, this movie takes a lot of patience. By the way, the closeups of Claudia Cardinale's face were with a soft lens, so the wrinkles didn't show. That's so typical of older films with the vain female stars. Cardinale looks cheap, anyway, with all that 1960s-type eye makeup.At any rate, the action scenes are a decent and not bloody and the characters are quite real, meaning believable. I liked Fonda in here best even though I am not particularly a fan of his but his against-type villain role of ""Frank"" was excellent. I read where he said this was his favorite role. I'm glad to hear that. The best character in the film, though, was ""Cheyenne,"" played by Jason Robards."
muchopotalcantara,"Sep 14, 2024",10/10,"The film is set in the American West during the late 19th century and centers on a conflict involving land, revenge, and the encroachment of the railroad.Introduction: The story begins with a dramatic sequence where three gunslingers, led by the ruthless Frank (played by Henry Fonda), ambush and kill a family at a remote homestead. Their aim is to eliminate witnesses and secure the land for the construction of a railroad.The Mysterious Harmonica Player: A mysterious drifter known only as Harmonica (played by Charles Bronson) arrives in the town, seeking revenge against Frank for a past grievance. Harmonica's motives and backstory are slowly revealed throughout the film.The Outlaw and the Widow: Jill McBain (played by Claudia Cardinale), the widow of the murdered family, becomes a central figure. She inherits the family's land, which is valuable because it is situated along the railroad's route. Jill's struggle to hold on to the land and protect her family's legacy becomes a key plot point.The Clash of Interests: As the story unfolds, various characters' motives and pasts intersect. Frank, the railroads, and the enigmatic Harmonica all have competing interests in the land. The narrative weaves through themes of vengeance, betrayal, and the struggle between the old ways and the new industrial age.Climax and Resolution: The film builds to a dramatic climax with a confrontation between Harmonica and Frank. The final showdown reveals the full extent of Harmonica's quest for revenge and the dark history that binds him to Frank. The film concludes with a resolution to the central conflicts and a reflection on the changes brought about by the railroad and the passage of time."
KIDOLOHKEN,"Jun 10, 2024",10/10,"Although it felt like there were too many close-ups, they were very effective and fascinating.Whenever a master director uses an unusual technique, there is always a reason behind it.If he suddenly showed a close-up of the eyes, you would be shocked. It would be an obstacle to appreciation. That is why foreshadowing is necessary. As you watch, wondering why there are so many close-ups, you eventually see a close-up of the eyes. What did you see there? Yes, you saw multiple colors. He is mixed race. Immediately afterwards, the fateful scene begins. What an effective close-up! Henry Fonda was cast as the villain because his eyes are pure blue. And the theme of this work would later be carried over to Tarantino's Django."
rafaelgarcia-20962,"Sep 24, 2025",10/10,"Today Italy is in mourning, after the passing of Claudia Cardinale. As an art and film historian I wanted to watch the actress in action and saw the film as part of an homage to her by the RAI television company. Her contribution to this genre and to the film community in general, is as indelible as her performance in this amazing film. A star studded cast of seasoned actors at their peak. The only appearance I question was that of Henry Fonda in a grimy old western but his performance quickly puts your doubts at bay. Truly enjoyed this film. RIP Claudia Cardinale."
candatischer,"Apr 22, 2022",10/10,"Recently I have seen many justifications as to the benefit of slow productions. As an example, the Anatomy of a Scandal miniseries is a miniseries that in my opinion is at least twice as long is it should have been to effectively tell the story. It nevertheless is praised for its drawn out story telling.Sergio Leone, in this movie, shows that length is good if you know how to tell a story and even thought it is almost three hours long I never once thought of using the fast forward button. It is also a movie that I have watched several times without thinking to my self I have seen this before. Mr. Leone was a great director and I just noticed he is listed as the writer. He is also a great writer."
albrechtcm,"Apr 26, 2014",4/10,"This film was beautifully filmed with impressive scenery and well-designed sets against a beautiful musical score. The story line is pretty standard, but okay. Water rights, railroad coming in, new town, etc. However this film can't quite decide whether it wants to be a horse opera or a soap opera. At over three hours it's something like watching a full season of Days of our Lives meets The Young and the Restless in the Old West. A good half of that three plus hours is spent on close ups of the different characters staring at each other, or into mirrors, or just staring with gritty expressions on their weathered faces.Henry Fonda gets to show us how bad a bad guy he can be, but that's just not the Henry Fonda we knew and loved and it didn't really work for me. But he was really bad. I'll give him that. Overall I found this film very tedious and I had to watch it in short increments or I'd never have got through it at all."
briancham1994,"Jan 3, 2021",9/10,"Previously I had watched Sergio Leone's famous The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and I was not that impressed by his use of slow tension-building scenes in that film, but Once Upon a Time in the West has fully won me over. The slow scenes here are used to great effect to construct an impression of a desolate, anarchist wasteland with plenty of masculine bandits who really rule the land. Every little moment has its purpose - the playing of a harmonica, the buzzing of a fly, the wind in the desert and more. This all supports a gradually unfolding story that is as mysterious as its characters, culminating in the victory of big business, railways and the building of civilisation that end the classic impression of the ""wild west"" the characters thrive in."
sauravjoshi85,"Apr 26, 2021",9/10,"Once Upon a Time in the West is a western movie directed by Late Sergio Leone and stars Claudia Cardinale, Late Henry Fonda, Late Charles Bronson, Late Jason Robards and Late Gabriele Ferzetti.There are two types of western movies that exists, one is any Western movie and one is The Great Sergio Leone type western movie and you can easily see the genius work whenever you the movie made by the legend. Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the masterpiece crafted by the great director.The plot of the movie might not be something very strong or to vouch for but the unique storytelling style Sergio Leone makes the movie more interesting and intriguing.Climax of the movie is great and some might feel that the movie is slow but this is the signature style of Leone Be it The Good, The Bad and The Ugly or A Fistful of dollars, you'll see the similar pace. Music has always been a strong part of all the Leone movies and the same is been repeated in this movie with some extraordinary music.Acting was another strongest aspect of the movie with Fonda, Bronson, Cardinale and Robards doing their job with utmost perfection. The Climax of the movie gives the movie a perfect ending. If you are a lover of western movies and loves the work of Sergio Leone then this is the movie for you."
Steffi_P,"Mar 19, 2007",10/10,"It's funny how so many of the greatest westerns, particularly those by directors who are best known for the westerns, are ones which deal with the death of the old west. There's John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch; Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven to name but three. However, for me the best of all these is Leone's masterpiece Once Upon a Time in the West. It is also my favourite of all Leone's pictures.Leone had always been a director who packed his films with atmosphere, style and rhythm, but here he organises every single element to create one overwhelming mood. Everything in the film is geared towards reminding us of death, of a time coming to an end. The pace is slow and measured  Leone really takes his time in telling the story. The buildings are rickety and creaking, many of the minor characters and extras are old and look worn out, and the wind howls across the open spaces.Symbolism is everywhere in this film. Jill and the railway both represent the death of the west. The coming of the railway of course literally heralded the end of an era, but Leone also had a rather strange theory that this time was also the beginning of a matriarchy in America  so women also represent change. Jill and the railway are often synonymous. Jill arrives on the train. The train is black and so is Jill's dress. In contrast, most of the characters are dressed in browns and yellows, matching the landscape of the open plains. The railway magnate is called Morton  ""mort"" as in death. Another very subtle touch is that most of the movement is towards or away from the camera. Jill and the train are the only things regularly seen moving from side to side across the frame, as if they are the only ones really going anywhere.The flipside to this atmosphere of death is that it is tinged with the hope of rebirth and progress. This is represented by the recurrent water motif, as water symbolises life. The train needs water to run, and the Sweetwater ranch will provide a watering stop. Jill likes to bath frequently, and later she brings water to the railway workers. Jill is a survivor, and she and Sweetwater represent hope for the future.While Harmonica, Frank and Jill have been analysed to death elsewhere, the character of Cheyenne I feel is often overlooked. Although he rarely drives the plot along and could have been edited out of the story without changing much, he is really central to the tone of the film. He more than any other single character represents the old west. He is tough and rugged on the exterior, but gradually his façade is stripped away to reveal a tired, middle-aged man who just wants to settle down. He is the most real, the most human character, and the one given the most depth. Jason Robard's performance has also come in for a lot of flak, but I think he's perfect for the role  he does that forlorn look very well.Ennio Morricone's music here continues to evolve alongside Leone's style. The score of Once Upon a Time in the West is not as rousing or listenable as the music from the Dollars Trilogy, but it perfectly mirrors that sad and weary tone. The Leone-Morricone trademark of giving each character their own musical theme is even more firmly stated here. It's particularly clever how the theme for the final confrontation mixes Harmonica's and Frank's themes. Leone and Morricone also worked together to make use of natural sound to create atmosphere, something which up to this point had only really been explored by Alfred Hitchcock (most memorably in The Birds, but I'm also thinking of the use of sound in his 1930's pictures). In the opening scene, the creaking of the windmill, the chattering of the telegraph machine and a number of other noises take the place of a musical backing.If there is anything wrong at all with Once Upon a Time in the West, it's that it takes either repeated viewings are extreme concentration to take in every minor plot point and understand every character motivation. The dialogue is sparse, and often more for effect than to give information. There are many short cuts in the narrative and very little is made obvious, so most of the time you have to join the dots yourself to work out exactly what is going on in each scene. There are two pieces I find people get confused about most often, so I'll give my explanations here. Firstly, why Harmonica tears Jill's clothes before going out to the well. This is to make it look as if the two of them have just had a quick session in the barn, thus Frank's men don't expect Harmonica to be armed and ready to fight and so let their guard down. Secondly, a lot of people (including Alex Cox in the DVD commentary) think there is a continuity error when Frank abducts Jill at Sweetwater and is then seen talking to Morton at his hideout in the cliffs. However the scene where Jill and Frank are in bed together is also at the cliffs  the walls are made of stone. The implication here is that Frank took Jill from Sweetwater back to his hideout, even though there is no linking scene to show it happening.So, it can be a little confusing, but I'd rather have taut narrative than lots of unnecessary material bogging the story down. Besides, with a film that is this entertaining and this beautiful, there's no burden whatsoever in having to watch it over and over"
Marwan-Bob,"Feb 23, 2020",9/10,"Epic, Romantic, Dark, Melancholic, this is Pure cinematic paradise, and Probably The best Western Film Ever Made."
TheNabOwnzz,"May 4, 2018",10/10,"While it is still most commonly stated that 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is Leone's ultimate masterpiece, this label is quite unfortunate for another Leone masterpiece, 'Once Upon a Time in the West', which is also one of the greatest films ever made.First and foremost Once Upon a Time in the West is a masterpiece of storytelling. A lot of early scenes will leave you with questions that will only be answered later on after everything becomes clear. The story is a complex and multi layered mystery that is handled with impeccable editing and a slow pace which is always evolving. In the end all of your questions as viewers will be answered in one of the greatest reveals ever in cinema history when nearing its end. It also features an incredible use of sound, having birds chirping when everything seems safe and creating silence and awareness of the characters in question when there is danger brewing. Leone was a master of creating tension, and this way everytime the birds would stop chirping you are at the edge of your seat. There are a lot of close ups as usual in a Leone film, and emotions are put into the incredible facial acting ( especially by Henry Fonda ) and the once again terrific Ennio Morricone score.With Charles Bronson as the mysterious harmonica player who seems to be able to kill with his eyes, Henry Fonda as the intimidating blue eyed villain & Jason Robards as the charismatic bandit Cheyenne we have an incredible cast of actors who are used to the best of their abilities. Ofcourse Fonda was barely cast as a villain before this film, frequently appearing as the hero in a lot of Hollywood movies before this one, which makes his appearance all the more shocking and intimidating when the camera glances from his shoes towards his piercing blue eyes. However, i have a slight critique on Claudia Cardinale ( Jill ), whose dialogue seems to come across as forced, yet her facial acting is absolute world class. One of my favorite scenes has to be the one where she jumps off the train only to find there is no one there to pick her up. Her confused and melancholy look is absolute divine, and combined with Leone's elevating shot which shows the town right when Morricone's music hits its climax, it creates one of the greatest cinematic scenes ever made.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful as usual in a Leone film, especially during the shoots of all the workers working on the railroad, in the background, middle and foreground, all flowing across the screen effortlessly due to Leone's artistic directional talents. Jill's ride to the McBain farm is also one worth of notice, with a lot of beautiful widescreen distance shots of the western environment in a very similar style to John Ford, which was one of the influences of Leone.From its incredible opening sequence devoid of almost any dialogue whatsoever to the very end, it is a movie that grabs you and never lets go due to its incredible slow paced storytelling. It is just a brilliant piece of writing that manages to make every scene look useful and more mysterious, building up to an ending that has to be one of the greatest sequences ever put on the screen."
antoniocenteno-87266,"Mar 21, 2020",10/10,"It´s incredible to think that an Italian director played the game better than any american at directing Westerns, every Leone movie from the dollars trilogy changued the game of cinema about the wild west and by far influenced so much when it comes to how people watched that genre. Now imagine that, but is played as an hybrid between his spaghetti cinema and traditional western movies. That´s what makes this movie so amazing and great. Been honest i praise more the Good the bad and the Ugly as the ultimate western (and personal all time favorite) but Once upon a time in the west is just a different beast and was Leone´s more realistic movie at the time.This movie is a long drag but is a good one, the plot kicks in really slowly, you don´t know what the movie is about untill around 45 minutes after it started and finally is moving at around half the movie, when you see it objectivly the plot isn´t that big, other filmmakers will do a one hour and 45 minutes of film, but not Leone, there´s several long long shots with amazing cinematography and landscapes new to his movies.Leone´s close ups work here in a different way too, he was the kind of director that let face acting make the difference, but his previous movies where full of angry faces, fury and violence, here is a different story in the acting, we see concern, grief, greed and remorse, wich made Bronson, Fonda, Robards and Cardinale give a wide charachterization for their, well, charachters.The music in this movie is fantastic, Ennio Morriocne even called it the best he did in colaboration with Leone, it really puts you in the mood and is so haunting, gives the scenes so much power that is unreal.Once upon a time in the West is definetly a must see for people that love Westerns and movies, easly one of the greatest ever made and a true experience to the eyes."
bob the moo,"Sep 21, 2003",N/A,"As the railroad spreads western, bringing with it progress and development, the west is a changing place.  The rule of gunmen is ending with the new men of power being land owners and developers.  A young woman arrives in one such small town to find her new husband and family murdered by gunman Frank under the lead of a railroad developer.  Meanwhile a mysterious man arrives in the town looking for Frank for some reasons.  Both he and convict Manuel Gutierrez join forces to try and hold onto what remains of `their' west and deal with Frank.From the opening ten minutes you should be able to judge whether or not this film will frustrate you or not. The opening scene is one of the best of cinema but, on paper, very little actually happens.  This is what you need to carry into the film  as it is so very long there is plenty of silence and pauses.  If you feel that these are unnecessary then the running time of this film will feel even longer to you.  On the other hand if you, as I do, feel that the silences in this film are just as important and telling as the dialogue or action, then this film should move quite quickly.The plot is a mix of revenge western while also looking at the death of the West associated with the American movies  the strong gunman, the frontier town etc, they exist here but are being pushed out with every frame of the film.  What Leone manages to do which confounds me is he fills the film with so much silence but yet little of it brings boredom, instead the film has it's steady pace and never lets it dip into flagging but just keeps enough happening to keep things moving.  I must admit that some of the deeper meaning was lost on me but still felt that the central threads of the three or four main characters were more than enough to hold my interest on their own.  Of course, bits did work better than other bits but that is to be expected  I know I got more from the cat and mouse between Harmonica and Frank than I did from the relationship between Gutierrez and Jill.  However these minor problems are lost in the sheer scale of the film itself.The acting is great and some of it could be considered the actors at their best.  Certainly I can't think of another role where Charles Bronson was required to do so well.  Here he has to have a stone face but still give over character  he manages it and pulls off an iconic type of cool that I'd usually associate with big stars.  Fonda plays very naturally as a bad guy. When I first saw this film I was quite young and hadn't seen a lot of his more famous roles, now that I have it is very strange to see him as a bad guy, but the counter casting of him does work anyway.  Cardinale is a strong role but I must confess that her character was lost to me a little  this was one of the threads I was weakest on and I'll watch the film again with more focus.  Support cast are all pretty good and have a few famous western faces in there.One of the strongest parts of the film is the score.  From the first time you hear that scarring harmonica you know to associate it with bitterness, likewise other parts of the score are very strong and used well.  Part of it did remind me of Steptoe & Son but it still worked in it's context!  The plot all goes sort of where you expect it to but we are left with the wider picture of the West of Frank coming to an end and the West of Morton moving unstoppably to replace it  the film never suggests that one is better than the other, in fact it highlights that there may be no difference at all. Meanwhile the frontier men are pushed on into a shrinking horizon.Overall this is an epic, which means it is sweeping in scope, resulting in the occasional stretch showing.  The running time is sparsely filled with dialogue which may frustrate some, however Leone has made the silence as loud as the dialogue and the actors provide him with performances that deliver so much without words at times that the time is easily eaten up. Not the most accessible western he made (simply because others are more entertaining) but still an epic and well worth three hours of anyone's time."

yoyoyoast,"May 6, 2024",9/10,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a masterpiece. It is that simple. From the moment the iconic opening sequence begins, Sergio Leone's magnum opus grips you tightly and refuses to let go until the final frame. This sprawling epic is a symphony of visuals, sound, and storytelling prowess.First and foremost, the film's visual aesthetic is nothing short of breathtaking. Leone's use of wide shots to capture the vastness of the American West, coupled with his keen eye for detail, creates a world that feels both immersive and authentic. Every frame is meticulously composed, turning each scene into a work of art in its own right.The performances are equally impressive. Charles Bronson delivers a career-defining performance as the enigmatic and stoic Harmonica, while Henry Fonda's portrayal of the villainous Frank is chillingly effective. Claudia Cardinale brings depth and complexity to her role as Jill, the woman at the center of it all. And of course, no discussion of the performances in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" would be complete without mentioning the iconic presence of Jason Robards as Cheyenne, whose charisma leaps off the screen.But perhaps the film's greatest strength lies in its storytelling. Leone masterfully weaves together multiple narrative threads, effortlessly blending elements of romance, revenge, and redemption into a cohesive and compelling whole. The pacing is deliberate yet never sluggish, keeping the audience engaged from start to finish.And then there's Ennio Morricone's legendary score, which elevates the film to even greater heights. From the haunting strains of ""Jill's Theme"" to the rousing melodies of ""Man with a Harmonica,"" Morricone's music is an integral part of the experience, setting the mood and enhancing the emotional impact of each scene.In short, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a cinematic triumph in every sense of the word. It's a film that rewards repeat viewings, as there are layers of nuance and detail to discover with each watch. Whether you're a fan of Westerns or simply appreciate masterful filmmaking, this is a movie that belongs in your collection. A masterpiece."

adamjohns-42575,"Mar 19, 2022",2/10,"Once Upon A Time In The West (1968) -Considering that the story was really quite lame and that some of the acting was really quite appalling, I actually wrote down a lot of notes about this film as I watched. Chief among them was that if I'd had to listen to that damned Harmonica all the time I would have shoved it right up Charles Bronson's ar$e! Every time the tune played, I thought that it was the start of 'Dub Be Good To Me' by Beats International (Maybe they sampled it) (Apparently they did).Other than that Ennio Morricone's soundtrack was quite enjoyable, except for the points where it was almost the theme tune to 'Steptoe And Son' (1962-74).So what went wrong with the rest of the film?Well, the first ten minutes were the longest I have ever sat through, the most exciting bit being a fly on some guys face (That fly deserved an Oscar) and the pace didn't quicken much after that either. It was almost painful to get through in places and drippy and dull in others.I did find it interesting to see Henry Fonda in a bad guy role. Up until now, I have only seen him on the right side of the law and it was a bit creepy to see how good he was at being bad.However, the acting overall was only really saved by Jason Robards, who did a great job and is probably very underrated. It was a shame that he wasn't supported by a decent script and fellow cast.Bronson was alright I suppose, when he finally stopped using the mouth organ and talked properly and funnily enough Claudia Cardinale was ok, even though she was allegedly dubbed, but the additional actors and extras were very poor, as was the artsy overly long direction.The script they had can't have been hard or taken too long for any of them to learn, there was so little said and so many dramatic pauses that it's a miracle the story moved anywhere at all, especially at its slow, slow, slow pace.For me the narrative didn't even ultimately lead anywhere and it was hard to tell who was supposed to be the good guys and the bad. Even harder to tell than in 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' (1966), because each of them was all three!I didn't know who was on whose side in this film and not because it was cleverly written, but because it just wasn't easy to see. Too many dirty old cowboys all looking the same and acting the same.Apparently Charles and Jason were supposed to be Mexicans, but that wasn't obvious either. I just thought that the whole film was a waste of bits that could have been good, but that became a tale that lost its way. I'd actually have been more interested in seeing a new town out west as it fully developed. That bit was really interesting. You start with one house and see how it grows, as each faction moves in, but sadly that was only a tiny part.I will say that they were very lucky to be surrounded by such beautiful scenery, I don't mean backdrops and sets, but the actual locations, which although dry and barren in places, looked stunning on film.Once again I disagree with at least three top 100/1001 lists. I'm probably wrong, but this one didn't seem to reach its potential for me.247.77/1000."
Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Jul 25, 2020",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in the West is a true Western: it's got all the ingredients of stories concerning gunslingers and outlaws, and it goes all the way with showing the scope of what life was like on the American frontier; just as the railroads began to span the countryside.It's got sharpshooters in the concentrated forms of Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda, and they're two men fighting for different causes: Bronson's Harmonica is a mysterious trauma-ridden cowboy while Fonda's Frank is like a remorseless gangster trying to control his interests wanting to exploit the frontier's proliferating steam-engines.The thing that's great about Once Upon a Time in the West is that even though the story's got ridiculously big scope, it knows that in the middle of the vast American deserts of the Old West, the people roaming it are still very much interconnected in ways that can't be changed regardless of how much terrain one can traverse by train or horseback. It's an epic with a tight-knit character-driven story dissecting the simplicity, vastness and ruthlessness of the American frontier.This one's a movie for the ages, and it came out in 1968; probably one of the best years in cinema history, thanks to this, Yellow Submarine, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Planet of the Apes and The Great Silence."
dworldeater,"Aug 5, 2020",10/10,"Once Upon A Time In The West is Sergio Leone's epic western masterpiece. A huge production shot in both Europe and in The United States. This was Sergio's Hollywood debut and takes the spaghetti western to new heights. Once Upon A Time In The West is a fantastic piece of cinema that was masterwork of sight and sound. Amazingly shot working hand in hand with Ennio Morriconne's incredible trademark score with meticulous attention to detail, especially with costumes and sets. The ensemble cast of Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinals, Jason Robards and Henry Fonda as the diabolical Frank is awesome as well. The storytelling is solid and done in Sergio's innovative style. The plot deals with corruption, murder and revenge and gives the sense of the desolation and grit of the American west. This is much darker in tone and a completely different take on the great John Ford westerns that influenced Leone . Overall for cinophilles, Once Upon A Time In The West is a must watch. There has not been a film that was anything quite like it before and hasn't been seen since. There are lots and lots of spaghetti westerns, but nothing that was done on such a large scale or done as flawlessly. Sergio Leone was a unique and brilliant filmmaker that is more than worthy of the reputation he had and this is my favorite of his films and in my opinion, his very best."
Endless_01,"Apr 15, 2017",10/10,"Sergio Leone, the master behind this fascinating film is undoubtedly one of the best directors in history. The trilogy of the dollar is unique in every way, but we must not forget its other fascinating films, like this one.What can I say? It is simply incredible every point of this film, with an incredible start and tense, a development that opens our eyes, classic phrases that are remembered as celebrities, an epic ending, incredible performances, beautiful cinematography, unique sound editing, A plot of entertainment, everything, everything, I love everything about this movie.It's just so gratifying to know that directors such as Leone lived to give us the most beautiful films in history, movies so incredible in every sense that they leave us remembered the most grandiose scenes, we'll never have epic films in life, well , Probably never like these. It has absolutely everything necessary to earn great ratings and prizes, it is unfair that it does not have the recognition it deserves, since it is fascinating for the soul of any lover of the movies.Without more to say, 10 out of 10.By the way, the soundtrack of Ennio is one of the most beautiful soundtracks of the cinema.You must see this movie, it's fantastic."
Red-Barracuda,"Dec 30, 2010",10/10,"Once Upon A Time In The West is no ordinary western. Despite the non-descriptive title, this is a film that redefined the genre. With his dollars trilogy, director Sergio Leone proved that he was the master of the spaghetti western; with Once Upon A Time he transferred the conventions of that genre – the operatic sense of drama, the nihilism, extreme close-ups, epic widescreen photography, Ennio Morricone music and moral ambiguity – into Monument Valley, the setting of the traditional American western. The result is pretty unforgettable. Leone tells a simple story via images. Looks, as opposed to dialogue, are used to convey meaning wherever possible. When characters do speak, their lines are significant. Every bit of dialogue is considered, no one talks unnecessarily. This combined with the phenomenal cinematography and unforgettable music results in a sort of operatic minimalism. The western has never been depicted so artistically.There is a real feeling of time and space. The opening credit sequence where the three gunmen wait at the train station typifies this. Instead of launching straight into the initial confrontation, Leone waits. Insignificant details become epic. The fly and the dripping water for instance, are given real significance, and are integral to the pace of the scene. Nothing of narrative significance happens, not a word is said but the pacing and magnification of the smallest details add human depth to what would otherwise be cardboard characters.There are four stand-out performances from Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale and Jason Robards. Bronson plays Harmonica the mysterious stranger, Fonda brilliantly cast against type is the cold-eyed killer, Cardinale is the stunningly beautiful woman in the centre of the narrative and Robards is the grizzled outlaw. Together, they are terrific. And Leone moves them around the widescreen frame quite beautifully. Morricone's score once again is quite outstanding. The haunting harmonica theme is a particular standout; only Morricone could make a harmonica sound so sweeping, evocative and mystical.Once Upon A Time In The West is truly epic film-making of the very best kind. It's a western of intense emotions and brilliant acting; of peerless photography and ground-breaking music. It illustrates perfectly how to use cinematic space and how to pace events within it. It refashioned the western and brought the highest cinematic artistry to Monument Valley. It goes without saying that it is a masterpiece."

openeyes,"Dec 18, 2003",10/10,"A railroad magnate named Morton, Gabriele Ferzetti, hires a cruel gunman named Frank, Henry Fonda, to ""remove obstacles from the track.""  One of the obstacles is Brett McBain, who owns some water rich land the railroad must pass through.  Frank massacres McBain and his family, framing a local bandit named Cheyenne, Jason Robards, in the process.  Unbeknownst to Frank, McBain married Jill, Claudia Cardinale, on a recent trip to New Orleans.  Jill arrives to find her new family dead and herself in possession of the land Frank will certainly kill again to obtain.  Jill's survival depends on Cheyenne, who wants to find out who framed him, and a mysterious stranger called Harmonica, Charles Bronson, who has his own business to conduct with Frank.""Once Upon A Time In The West"" is perhaps the most beautiful western ever filmed.  Employing his signature style, director Sergio Leone uses the wide screen format with the skill of  a master painter, alternating breath-taking vistas with stunning close-ups against the magnificent score by Ennio Morricone.  Leone lets the story unfold slowly.  Characters surrender their motivations only grudgingly, all the while slowly building to a powerful conclusion.  The pace of the film, which I credit as one of its strengths, may also be its main drawback today.  Many members of the post-MTV generation accustomed to quick editing may not have the patience to let themselves be swept up by this film.  That is a pity.""Once Upon A Time In The West"" stands as Leone's homage to the great, and not so great, western films that came before him.  ""Johnny Guitar"" certainly springs to mind and the opening sequence makes an undeniable nod toward ""High Noon.""   However, unlike Quentin Tarantino's recent homage to his roots, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1,"" this film not only stands on its own two feet, it expands the genre.These characters are more than a group of archetypes wandering about under the western sun.  Jill isn't your traditional victimized widow.  A New Orleans prostitute taking a chance on a new life on the frontier, she's an independent woman who knows men.  If sleeping with Frank is the only way to save her life, she will, knowing that after a hot bath she'll be the same as she was before.  Frank, in a brilliant performance against type by Henry Fonda, is also a man in transition.  He envies the power flowing from Morton's money.  He would like to become more like Morton, but his propensity toward baser evil deprives him of the discipline he needs to become a businessman. Cheyenne seeks revenge for being framed and pretends to interested in the wealth the McBain land will bring, but he is mainly motivated by growing feelings for Jill.  He's the most sentimental character in the film.  He's a bandit with a heart of gold, which is more than can be said for Harmonica.  Harmonica, the man with no name, develops a liking for both Jill and Cheyenne, but one gets the feeling he would sacrifice either or both of them if there was no other way to get Frank.  He is not the classic, selfless western hero of old.When I originally saw this film, I was disappointed by Bronson.  I didn't think he made the most of a role obviously tailor-made for Clint Eastwood. I was mistaken.  Bronson brought nuance to the role I doubt Eastwood would have at that stage of his career.  In his three films with Leone, Eastwood's ""Man with No Name"" character tended toward smug amorality motivated only by self-interest.  Harmonica has a little more depth and introspection than Eastwood's characters.  He plays him with a certain sadness in his eyes; a doomed self-awareness.  Harmonica realizes when he kills Frank the remainder of his life will be devoid of meaning or purpose.  He doesn't speak much, but he tellingly attempts to wax philosophically with Frank about the nature of men of like themselves and the changing West.  In a sense, he knows Frank is the only person who could understand him, since he had to become a gunman like Frank in order to achieve his well- deserved revenge.  The characters Eastwood played for Leone were less troubled about their place in the universe than Bronson's Harmonica.  This might be Bronson's best performance.""Once Upon A Time In The West"" deserves an esteemed place among the canon of great westerns."
FAZ-4,"Jan 24, 1999",N/A,"Sergio Leone's rhythm of drama is incredible. Who else could get away with an opening sequence like that. Long held close ups with what must be the best sound design of its period. Brilliantly engaging and terrific performances from Fonda, Cardinale, Robards and Bronson. Ennio Morricone's music captivates you with its use of strong drama and instantly memorable melody. The way the music stops occasionally over Robards character Cheyenne is sheer mastery. A film ahead of its time in its bold stance of atmospheric rhythmic drama showing us that today's 20 cuts a minute ""Bond"" style films are becoming extemely weary."
deloudelouvain,"Sep 19, 2020",7/10,"Sergio Leone is the king of the spaghetti westerns, that's a fact. Almost everyone knows his movies, or has seen at least one, that is if you're of a certain age. His movies get really high ratings on IMDb, even though I don't think they're all that good. For instance For A Fistfull Of Dollars (1964) has a weak story, yet it still scores really high. The same for Once Upon A Time In The West, great acting and cinematography (certainly for that time), but the story isn't that great. That said I still enjoy this movie, just for the great soundtrack of Ennio Morricone, the sublime tension building between the different characters (nothing beats those face offs in Leone's westerns), or the superb close-ups of the villains. Like all his other movies it's a very long movie, and maybe sometimes the shots are just a bit too long and not to everybody's taste but to me it adds to the tension building. I don't think this one is his best though, I preferred For A Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (1966), but that's only my opinion. The acting was good, with a young Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda and the always stunning looking Claudia Cardinale. If there's one typical thing in Sergio Leone's movies is the amount of bad guys that all add to great visual close-ups. His casting is just really good, his way of shooting those images even better. But what strikes me the most with his early movies is just the quality of the images, for that time it was just great cinema and for that alone all his movies are worth watching."
YellowManReanimated,"Aug 17, 2021",10/10,"A western of operatic dimensions, this would be, in my view, Leone's most complete iteration of the genre. There are four characters which epitomise the film: Harmonica, the virtually nameless hero who is on a mission for revenge; Frank: the steely-eyed villain, motivated by vice and venality; Jill McBain, the beautiful, determined heroine who will do what it takes to survive, and Cheyenne, the big, rough exteriored yet warm-hearted wild card whose allegiances could swing either way. The film's plot draws these characters together as their fates and fortunes are constantly intertwined. Through these characters we are treated to a story of greed, brutality, brute politics and, ultimately, revenge.The western, by its very nature, has generally involved interpreting the past, it's a genre which draws on history, often a mythised version of it. This film revels in its mythic quality, it feels like a twisted fairy-tale (Once upon a time...), a fable in which the heroes will eventually triumph and good will conquer evil. There is a tacit acknowledgement that this film is bathed in artifice, it moves with a dream-like quality, the setting and the events serving to propel the characters toward their ultimate fates. Leone's camera work creates a visual feast from extreme close-ups to soaring bird's eye-view takes which romanticise and eulogise the beauty of the natural landscape. Morricone's soundtrack elevates the film at every turn and provides it with its operatic quality. It's a haunting spectacle of a film which creates its own world within a world making it utterly distinct."
moonspinner55,"Jan 21, 2006",6/10,"Italian-US co-production from Italian director Sergio Leone, who takes the spaghetti western to an elegiac (and, at times, elegant) plateau, although the picture is hurt by overlength and is carefully (some may slowly) paced. Claudia Cardinale stars as a beautiful widow trying to hold onto her hot piece of real estate in the booming Old West, trailed by a cold-hearted hit-man. As photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, the picture looks splendid, though this screenplay from Leone and Sergio Donati (working from an original treatment by Leone, Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci) is thin, and Leone ultimately relies on the sweep and the scope to propel his story, which covers familiar territory. Henry Fonda is surprisingly icy as the villain; Cardinale is indeed gorgeous but is mainly used for decoration, despite being at the center of the action (it seems to happen around her). Ennio Morricone composed the stirring music. **1/2 from ****"
genecass-135-703914,"May 22, 2014",1/10,"To be fair, I only watched the first hour of this thing. Seriously, they could have edited that down to 10 minutes. I don't need to look at a tumbleweed for 2 minutes or a ""bad guy's"" face for that long either without dialog to add anything. I felt like yelling at the TV something like ""GET ON WITH IT""! I find that a good rule of thumb for movie watching is the ""20 minute Rule"". If after 20 minutes the movie doesn't do anything for you there's a very good chance it won't after 2 hours. Sort of like going on a blind date, you sorta know after the first 5 minutes if it's a bust or not, then the best thing to do is to be polite until you can gracefully exit. Good luck to anyone else watching it, maybe it gets better after the first hour but I didn't want to risk wasting any more of my life watching paint dry."
TheOneManBoxOffice,"Jun 9, 2019",10/10,"After director Sergio Leone's famous ""Dollars"" trilogy (consisting of 1964's A Fistful of Dollars, 1965's For a Few Dollars More, and 1966's The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly) wrapped up, he figured that he was officially done with making spaghetti western pictures. However, as you can tell, this did not turn out to be the case, and thank god for that.Once Upon a Time in the West, released in 1968, is a spaghetti western that should not be confused with being a part of the ""Dollars"" films, in that there's no Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, or Eli Wallach in sight, and instead of United Artists, the film was released under Paramount Pictures. Still, it would be as influential and intense as Leone's prior films, and as someone who loves westerns in general, I would rank it as one of the best.The film centers around a woman named Jill (Claudia Cardinalle), who was once married to a farmhand named McBane, only to become a widow upon arrival to Sweetwater Ranch, as she finds her newlywed husband and all three of his children dead, shot by a murdurous assassin simply named Frank (Henry Fonda, in his first controversial role as the bad guy). Her life and land, which contains the only source of water for miles, are in jeopardy as the railroad gets closer to completion. A desperado named Cheyenne (Jason Robards), though notorious in the territory and accompanied by a gang, is mistakenly labeled a prime suspect. He offers his services to protect her and her land to find the real killer, which she eventually accepts upon realization that he didn't do it. Additionally, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunslinger (Charles Bronson) joins in to help Jill, as he too is hellbent on hunting Frank down for an unknown reason.This film has all of the spaghetti western traits you'd expect from Leone. Much of it is beautifully shot in Techniscope (like GBU), lots of long shots and tense moments, an epic score by Ennio Morricone, the works. It would also serve as the start of another film trilogy revolving around three time periods in history that toughened a nation. Right as the movie begins, you know you're in for something interesting, as it centers around three bandits waiting at a train station (an homage to Fred Zinneman's 1952 film High Noon), and we stay on them as the opening credits roll for about 10 minutes with no music. Just the sound of natural ambiance, trickling water, and a rhytmic squeaking windmill. Now that's good tension build-up.Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West marked not only the beginning of a new era of western pictures, but also the end of the old era, showing the true grittiness and cold-blooded nature of the wild west. On its own, West is not only one of the best westerns I've sat through, but is also one of my personal favorite films of all time. It's a long movie, so check this one out if you haven't seen it whenever you can find time for it."
mjneu59,"Dec 22, 2010",9/10,"If Sam Peckinpah's Wild Bunch killed off the Western film, Sergio Leone's widescreen epic delivered a final eulogy in grand operatic fashion. This is the Wild West as only a European could see it: bigger than life, bolder than life, and much more savage than life. The plot, as suggested by the title, is a fairy tale amalgam of every Western movie myth (i.e. cliché) since Edwin S. Porter's 'Great Train Robbery', with beautiful widow Claudia Cardinale defending her homestead against an aggressive railroad tycoon. Included in the subsequent carnage is the usual cast of Spaghetti Westerners: the enigmatic, nameless anti-hero (Chuck Bronson, replacing Clint Eastwood); the scruffy desperado sidekick (Jason Robards Jr., providing welcome comic relief); and an entire secondary cast of swarthy Italian gunmen, most of whom are killed off before the closing credits. Leone toned down the often surreal amorality of his Man-With-No-Name trilogy, but in a stroke of brilliance cast Henry Fonda against his image as the sadistic mercenary hired by the railroad to ""clear obstacles"" (including a young boy, blown apart at point blank range) from the path of the train."
TCManiacs,"Dec 31, 2010",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in The West is my all time favorite film as well as my favorite movie score. Bernardo Bertolucci, the co-writer of Once Upon a Time in The West, later directs The Last Emperor, which is my second all time favorite film as well as my second favorite movie score. Beware this is not your usual western. It is epic poetry. It is opera. It is a perfectly crafted art film that expresses Sergio Leone's true love for the great American Westerns. Leone doesn't necessarily romanticize the American West, he romanticizes American Western films. He makes references to High Noon, 3:10 to Yuma, The Comancheros, Shane, The Searchers, My Darling Clementine and many other great American Westerns very much the way Quentin Tarrantino has made films that pay homage to the gangster film genre. BTW Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds pays tribute to this film with an opening sequence entitled Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France.Although most of the film was shot in Spain & Italy like most spaghetti westerns, Leone traveled to John Ford's Monument Valley to capture the authentic Western United States panorama. Like Nicholas Ray's Johnny Guitar, it has a poetic quality that uses strong symbolism; but instead of symbolic words and lyrical phrases in the dialog, Leone relies on the alliteration of sights and sounds to formulate poetic stanzas out of every scene. The length of the film is a result of Leone's choice to direct in a sometimes painstakingly slow pace that builds up incredible tension before key action scenes. He allows us time to imbibe the majestic landscapes, and appreciate the details of the authentic sets and costume design documenting this pivotal period in American history. Instead of cluttering the beauty of his carefully photographed frames with dialog, close shots of these actor's iconic faces express all that needs to be said.Ennio Morricone, also my favorite movie composer, scored five distinct musical themes that embody each of the main characters: widowed new bride Jill (Claudia Cardinale), mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards), hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) and railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti). Instead of a musical prelude, the movie opens with a symphony of natural sounds using a screeching windmill, a buzzing fly, dropping water and a ticking telegraph. Meticulous sound editors maintain continuity throughout this mostly visual narrative, composing a perfect harmony between each of the main character's musical motifs along side the multitude of natural sounds mostly inspired by the two major symbols, the railroad and the water. An impressive lengthy tracking shot introduces the ""anti-heroine"" Jill as well as the beginnings of a bustling railroad town. Don't miss the first few minutes of this movie. Without music nor dialog, Leone creates one of the most suspenseful thrilling first few minutes of a movie whilst still rolling the opening credits. For all 168 minutes I was captivated by each and every frame! Once Upon a Time in the West is the finest example of Sergio Leone's creativity and perfectionism as a director, but most of all it is his greatest testament of love for the American Western."
atzimo,"Feb 21, 2004",10/10,"'C'era una volta il West' is not an easy film to watch. Its pace is hypnotic and the story unfolds in a way that blurs the viewer rather than provide exposition.Saying that its not easy to watch, doesn't necessarily mean that the movie is not a great one. In fact OUATITW is probably the greatest art western ever made. I still believe that 'Unforgiven' is the greatest western story of all time, but this one is a joy to watch, for all its artistic endeavors.The casting is genius. Especially Henry Fonda. It takes a genius to see that Henry Fonda could play the ultimate bad guy. Bronson's movie career was defined by this movie and Claudia Cardinale is absolutely stunning.If you are a DVD enthusiast, the restoration of the movie will bring tears to your eyes. It's superb, better than 'Laurence of Arabia'. You can even see the pores in the actors' faces. Highly recommended.10/10"
Artimidor,"Dec 24, 2011",10/10,"""Here's looking at you"" might be Humphrey Bogart's trademark slogan, but eyes in a Leone Spaghetti Western reveal much more emotions and even plot than Bogey ever could convey with his. Sergio Leone made extreme close-ups the dominant shots to explain character - and a look into Frank's eyes (played by Henry Fonda), who was deliberately cast against his usual character in ""Once Upon a Time in the Wild West"", makes it perfectly clear why. There's no need for lengthy dialog if a capable director can do so much more with style alone. And of all around brilliant visuals in Leone's Westerns there is no shortage, no doubt about that. If the widescreen scenery is as grand, deep and epic a director can even deliberately allow the weight of silence to descend on the viewer and let the image speak for itself.Once sound effects are added to compositions like these they become more than nice enhancements or mere fillers, they turn into characters themselves of a total work of art. An art that reaches even higher levels if you take Ennio Morricone's melancholic score into account which rounds off this rare masterpiece. Morricone delves deep into the souls of characters, makes whole landscapes tangible, even develops plot of the powerful story. Add to that a flawless cast (aside from Fonda Jason Robards, Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson and others star) and every lover of the moving picture is likely to be seriously moved. Or blown away if you haven't seen anything like this before. There are so many memorable shots in ""Once Upon a Time in the Wild West"" that one can stop counting them early on and take the whole thing as the ultimate template on how a great film should look like. Films like these are cinematic paradise, made for the history books, and every moment of it should be savored. Definitely one of the greatest."
Sittinghasruinedmybody,"Jun 26, 2025",N/A,"A long film but it felt justified, there wasn't a moment where I wanted to pause it.Fonda, Bronson, Cardinale, Gutiérrez, everyone has a brilliant performance. This movie is top tier, from music to pacing, to suspense and atmosphere.The opening scene alone is great, how much you can achieve with little to no dialogue, only waiting and music.And all the dialogue between for example Gutiérrez and Cardinale feel meaningful and interesting, every word has a reason, no fillers even with the near 3h runtime.Watch it, it's a solid story with strong performances. It's the movie from spaghetti westerns you should watch."
captnemo,"Nov 13, 2003",6/10,"I saw this at a revival house for my first viewing. I'd have to say that this was much better than the typical Italian western, which is 2 hours of people staring at each other and odd sounding gunshots. The cinematography was beautiful, as were the sets and costumes. The acting was pretty good, especially Fonda and Robards. What is missing was either a screenplay that filled 2 1/2 hours of screen time or an editor to cut out about 45 minutes of superfluous material. This is no masterpiece, but it is a film worth watching. Leone will be remembered as someone who made overlong good movies, but no masterpieces. Maybe these films are loved in Europe, but here in America we like some story with the pretty images. Rating: 6 out of 10."
adam_pittavino,"Aug 2, 2013",10/10,"When a mysterious stranger with a harmonica protects a beautiful but naive widow from a ruthless train baron and his hired gun, they all soon discover that much more than prized land is at stake. While the storyline itself isn't complex, it's characters are compelling, rich and intriguing as Sergio Leone delivers what most western's do without, suspense. Jill Mcbain(Claudia Cardinale)a prostitute travelling from New Orleans to start a fresh life on the frontier with her awaiting husband, arrives only to find him slain, as locals gather to offer their condolences. Leoni's greatest weapon in this movie is his foresight to cast against type. Henry Fonda, not known for villainous streak, plays Frank, the muscle used by the railroad to enforce it's dominance across the desolate wastelands of America's West. As good as Fonda is, it's Charles Bronson's movie. He may prefer the sound of a harmonica over his own voice, but what he lacks in dialect, he more than makes up for with a quick draw. This is more than a movie, it's an experience in my mind, a piece of history, as the west is portrayed as a haunting brutal land that discriminates against absolutely no-one. 10 outta 10 guaranteed!!!"
EVON1TY,"Jul 11, 2019",7/10,The actors and their performances are really good. Cinematography and Set Decoration is also very good. But the storyline is not really good. It's based on pretty unnecessesary events. Not effective and important storyline at all.
michaelb109,"Nov 29, 2011",10/10,"...they made amazing films like this one. This is my favorite western, one of the best ever made. The pacing and filming are pure brilliance and really build the tension as you work toward the inevitable final standoff.The way each character is introduced makes them feel real and full of personality without the need for explanatory dialogue and I love how the music suits the movie, I can still hear Harmonica's haunting tune in my head. Bronson is excellent as the silent and mysterious good guy and Fonda adds a whole new meaning to the word evil.The story is tight and all the threads weave together in the end to form an outstanding western of epic proportions that I can't fully describe in words."
Wulfstan10,"Apr 21, 2005",10/10,"This is clearly among the greatest movies ever made and the very top westerns ever made, its main competitor (in my opinion) being another Sergio Leone masterpiece: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It's hard to say which I think is greater and I tend to place them pretty much equal as the greatest Westerns ever. This is partly due to the fact that they are in many ways, especially plot, depth,and even basic approach to the genre, quite different.Whereas The Good... has a simple story dealing only with three gunmen looking for gold, Once Upon... has a much more complex plot with a number of deeper themes. It delves into the relationships of people, the end of the Old West and the place of gunfighters, the spread of development and the future, revenge, etc. Unlike some, I don't consider this plot ""superior"" to The Good; it's just different, richer, and more complex, and certainly has more potential. However, the plot of The Good is compelling and clean in its simplicity. I also thoroughly appreciate how The Good doesn't make any excuses or try to be sentimental, yet in its grittiness there is amazing depth. Therefore, I really think that the two are just very different and while Once Upon is certainly more complex and grand, it is not necessarily better.More fundamentally, these differences seem to result from the fact that Once Upon really seems to be an homage to the ""classic"" American westerns such as those of John Ford, taking their basic themes, elements, and approaches. Everything, though, is handled very differently, so that characters are much richer, more ambiguous and subtle, the plot and scenes more tense, the events more violent, gritty, and hard-hitting, and the ""classic"" elements are in general given a new freshness, so that the emotional impact is incredible. Whereas Leone's earlier westerns really reinvented the genre and broke from the ""classic"" mold, this film went back to the ""classic"" predecessors and blended the key elements of those films with Leone's new style and approach, making a film that really brings the ""classic"" western to its apogee. An homage to those earlier films, it expands them and morphs them into something greater so that this is undoubtedly the greatest western based on those ""classic"" traditions.Of course, a film's plot is only part of the mix, and a film must be put together well: directing, cinematography, editing, costumes and other details. In this regard, Once Upon... is, like The Good, sheer perfection.I have heard people describe Leone's work as ""operatic,"" which is not a description that I came up with on my own, but it sure does describe the films, especially this one.This film is a true masterpiece and a shining example of Leone's brilliance. It is beautiful throughout and the plot is fascinating and developed superbly(as one should expect from Leone). Although I think that a couple scenes are a little longer than they should be, overall the slow pace of the film is one of its beauties, as always with Leone. It builds the tension and emotion incredibly well and allows the viewer to be absorbed in the film. The characters are wonderful. Bronson is at his absolute best here as the taciturn, calm, man of action while Henry Fonda superbly plays what I think to be his greatest role. His face and eyes are perfect for it. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are great,too.The constant theme of the railroad and its development in the scenes as the film progresses are also incredible. Its use is not entirely original, but railroads have immense artistic, dramatic, and symbolic potential and the theme is handled flawlessly. As a result, the railroad theme fully realizes its potential in all three aspects. The images of the railroad progressing are themselves thematically powerful and visually stunning.There are so many wonderful Leone elements throughout this film, giving it extreme dramatic power, grittiness, and atmosphere. A key one is the use of music, such as the haunting harmonica music, acting as a soundtrack and theme song for Harmonica while at the same time heralding the arrival of his character as he plays it, and adding a mournful, haunting feel to the scenes, perfectly fitting Bronson's character. It's wonderful to hear the music as if it's just a soundtrack just before noticing the characters react to it, showing that they hear it, too. Another is the images, with the beautiful long shots of the scenery with close ups of characters' faces or items like guns, sometimes together in the same shot, and sometimes with the items in obscure positions in the picture, so that their very closeness and appearance emphasises them and obscures them at the same time.The beginning scene at the station deserves its own special praise. This scene is absolutely incredible and is Leone at his artistic best. Everything about it is utter perfection, with the slow build-up of tension as the viewer for some time wonders what exactly is going on but can feel the tension; the quick, sharp spot of violence (another Leone trademark); the use of the sounds of the windmill, etc.; the things with which the three gunmen occupy their time whilst waiting; the images, especially the view with the close-up of the windmill and long shot of the countryside and tracks as Woody Strode casts a shadow whilst traversing the makeshift platform; every detail of the station and the characters; the references to other westerns; the arrival of the man for whom they are waiting; the image of them turning to face him. That's a long list, but this scene alone is worth the price of the film. It could stand on its own as a short film.In sum, this what everything that a ""classic"" western should have been."
alihayyas,"Jul 17, 2020",10/10,"The movie is a gem. It continues the same direction taken by The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, only with more human characters and serious themes.The movie tells convoluted stories mixed and packed with a rather straight main story/theme ( where the main protagonist's goal is straightforward) but that won't really be fully revealed until the last few minutes of the movie but it's utterly predictable anyway even if not stated early.The characters are complex in a way that there isn't a morally good character and all of the characters commit immoral stuff/decisions that will make you intrigued as to how to judge them.A substantial first hour throws in the main plot and start mixing it with the secondary acts. Beside the lengthy introduction there is a very well paced flow of events that follows.Awesome soundtracks too."
AntoineLvq,"Dec 31, 2019",10/10,"The best movie in my opinion, the music is exceptional throughout the film, the actors are perfect in their roles, and the scenes are filmed in a masterful way, everything is perfect, it's a masterpiece.
I don't understand how there can be so many films in front on, some are very good but others are mediocre and do not deserve to be classified as high."
beatsavior420,"Jul 18, 2020",10/10,"The greatest western ever made. Only fifteen minutes in and I'm already overcome with tears of nostalgia. The soaring, yet playful spirit of Morricone's score, Delli Colli's gorgeous visual language, and Leone's incredibly robust vision and direction. Once Upon a Time in the West is a perfect film, a violent, emotional masterpiece, brandishing the shattered romanticism of the American Dream. This is the quintessential western, brimming with complex, hearty characters, each venturing to carve out a life in the brutal frontier of the American West. A must watch for fans of epic cinema, spaghetti westerns, gunslingers & outlaws, the ever beautiful Claudia Cardinale, and vintage Charles Bronson. 10/10"
darth_sidious,"Sep 2, 2000",N/A,"Leone is and always will be an incredible director. The film needs to be viewed a few times to understand the narrative and symbolisms that the widescreen vista conjures up.The film is delibrately slow paced, the characters are building and changing before our very own eyes. Leone's masterful camera placement and shot selection is astounding, you are left in complete awe.Henry Fonda is amazing, the evil in his eyes will pierce straight through you. Charles Brosnan proved what an actor he could've become.The west is just a backdrop, it's the execution by Leone that makes everything work. The opening sequence is one of the best things I've ever seen on film, the sheer frustration it brings for both the characters and the viewer is immense.The Morricone score is his best, it works perfectly with the characters and the vistas.The sound effects are fantastic, you feel the sound hitting you very harshlyOne of the best films to be shot in the west!Remember, see it in widescreen."
Wuchakk,"Nov 11, 2015",7/10,"Released in 1968, Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is an epic story of a mysterious stranger known as Harmonica (Charles Bronson) who joins forces with a desperado named Cheyanne (Jason Robards) to protect a newly widowed ex-prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) from a ruthless assassin, Frank (Henry Fonda), who works for a railroad tycoon (Gabriele Ferzetti).As my title blurb amusingly suggests, this movie is really slow. It's basically an hour and 25 minute movie stuffed with filler to make it twice as long. For example, a man merely getting off his horse and approaching someone to talk is made out to be an epic blow-your-mind event. Absurd. I'm not saying it's not a good movie; it is and it has numerous attributes, like the great cinematography, outstanding cast and hypnotic score. So it's definitely worth watching, but you have to be prepped for an epic, slow movie that's more of a piece of art than a piece of entertainment.Fans of the film defend its slowness on the grounds that it's an allegory of death. They suggest that the movie's always revealing and expanding itself until the last act, where it becomes clear how everything's connected. At this point the film becomes a catharsis as the plot points converge, ending with a duel. Then the picture loudly reveals its theme: The death of the west, the death of gunslingers and the death of the myth. My response: The death of the West and the gunslinger via the encroachment of civilization (here represented by the advent of the railroad) is a constant theme in Westerns, before and since this film. While it's a great theme for any Western, it was nothing novel in 1968. Speaking of 1968, that was the year ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" came out, which is sort of the Sci-Fi counterpart to this film. Let me put it this way, if you loathe ""2001"" you'll probably hate this one too.Some say that ""Once Upon A Time In the West"" is very different from Leone's previous film, the iconic ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" from 1966, but I see a lot of similarities: The epic (overlong) length; the three main characters consisting of good (Bronson), bad (Fonda) and ugly (Robards); a fitting score by Ennio Morricone; and Leone's unmistakably mesmerizing style.Despite my honest criticisms, this is a notable Western and a one-of-a-kind film, highlighted by Bronson's laconic hero, Fonda's villainy, Claudia's curvy beauty and Robards' likable good-desperado. I can see why some hail it as an artistic masterpiece, but I can also see why others think it's repetitive and boring. My appraisal falls in between these two extremes, albeit closer to the former.The version I saw runs 165 minutes and was shot in Arizona; Moab, Utah; Sonora, Mexico; and Andalucía, Spain.GRADE: B"
Mr-Fusion,"Jun 18, 2016",8/10,"Instant gratification was never on Leone's mind when he made ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". This is a slow-burn in the strictest sense, and even character development doesn't happen until very late in the game. Up until that point, none of the characters struck me as very memorable - and even after that, not so much. They just sort of blend in. Although Henry Fonda was a genius choice; you don't get stone-cold killer from hearing that voice. It's beyond subversive.That said, this is a masterpiece in shot composition (widescreen, especially). The gunfight staging, the staggering scenery, gorgeous Claudia Cardinale; it's all in the visuals, at least for me. To watch this movie is to feel like you've just gorged on grand cinema; it's really more like an experience than anything else. I can understand the praise from a filmmaking perspective.8/10"
SnorriGodhi,"Jul 5, 2009",3/10,"Great visuals; great soundtrack; Sergio Leone directing; Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, and most important (for those of us whose tastes run in that direction) Claudia Cardinale. What could go wrong with this movie? judging from the IMDb rating, nothing. But since I liked very much the Dollars trilogy and Once Upon a Time in America, I am writing this review to warn others that they might, possibly, be as disappointed as I was.So, once again, what can go wrong with this movie? for starters, one can figure out, very early on, that it is going to end with a gunfight between the two main characters, and therefore that they are not in any danger at any point in the movie. That is true of many other westerns, but I cannot think of any other western where the entire plot consists of a series of diversions with the sole purpose of delaying the final gunfight -- for nearly three hours. Good westerns, and good action movies in general, build up the tension, which is not the case here: the final gunfight might as well have happened in the first scene, if both of the main characters had shown up at the train station. Apart from that, there were other excellent opportunities which the main characters let go to waste. They should have seized their chances and saved us a lot of time, part of which could have been used in finding images of Ms. Cardinale on the web.On the positive side, the final gunfight is worth fast-forwarding to.As is often the case, my rating is lower than it would have been without high expectations."
sol-,"May 10, 2017",9/10,"Captivating right from the eerie, near silent opening with only the faintest sounds of birds and windmills, this critically acclaimed Sergio Leone western circles around a widow, the man who killed her husband and two strangers who have their own reasons for helping the widow beyond simple benevolence. To reveal any more of the plot would not do the film justice because part of its charm is how gradual the exposition is; only as it slowly progresses do we begin to get clues as to what is motivating all the characters. This might sound a little frustrating, and at times it is, but there is a lot to like about how we are simply thrown into the middle of the story (as clueless as the widow is), forced to observe these characters and see what makes them tick before coming to understand their actions. This is an inventive film beyond its storytelling approach though with much quotable dialogue (""you brought two too many""), imaginative shooting scenes (a boot!) and several impressive graphic/audio matches, most notably a speeding bullet cut against an approaching train. The conclusion of the movie is perhaps too sentimental for its own good and the very deliberate pacing of the project is not going to please everyone, but it is amazing how great a film Leone and his team manage to spin here with such an unconventional plot unraveling approach."
southernmissfan,"Apr 10, 2005",10/10,"In 1964, a small time director named Sergio Leone, unknown in America, directed A Fistful of Dollars and would subsequently change the way the world looked at 'westerns' forever. Up until this time, westerns consisted of the perfect hero, who was invincible and always did the right thing; a knight who traded in his shining armor for cowboy boots. It was the duty of this morally outstanding superman to take on the despicable villain, complete with a black hat, save the girl, and ride off into the sunset. Then came Leone, who gave us stories and characters that were not black and white, good and evil, but rather a grey reality. Leone's protagonist, the so-called 'man with no name' (as played by Clint Eastwood), did not always do the right thing. He was not the noble sheriff or marshal, but instead a mysterious stranger looking for a buck. In fact, in the third film The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, there is only a thin line separating the 'good' from the 'bad' and 'ugly'. Leone's revolutionary westerns did not stop there. His cinematography would become his calling card- beautiful panoramic shots of big country combined with extreme close-ups, what has been described as using the faces of the characters as second landscapes. Throughout his career, Sergio Leone would work with one of the greatest composers of the 20th century, Ennio Morricone. Morricone's use of harmonicas, chimes, and amplified guitars (just to name a few) along with natural sounds, such as the creaks of a windmill, would become a trademark of not just Leone, but the entire Italian 'spaghetti' western sub-genre. It is in 1968 that Leone would direct a new project, leaving the ""man with no name' series behind. This new project, Once Upon a Time in the West, would combine the traditional western with the groundbreaking work in his previous three films to create an epic masterpiece, true cinematic art.Story Once Upon a Time in the West tells the story of five characters, all intertwined by property just made valuable by the railroad. A mysterious drifter called Harmonica (Bronson) comes to the town of Flagstone, but this time not for the allure of money. Harmonica is after revenge, and a central element of the film is Harmonica's past. In one of the boldest, most brilliant casting moves ever, Henry Fonda plays Frank, an emotionless killer working for the crippled railroad baron Morton (Ferzetti). Frank and Morton plan to take the newly valuable McBain property, and blame it on the notorious criminal Cheyenne (Robards). But the true star is Claudia Cardinale, playing Jill McBain, the beautiful prostitute who marries Brett McBain, owner of the property. The casting works perfectly. Bronson gives a distinct feel to the 'drifter' character. Ferzetti has this aristocratic look to him, perfect for the power player Morton. Robards is both rugged and comedic, the type of guy who can crack a joke one minute and wipeout a gang of lawmen the next. Cardinale is beyond gorgeous. And then we have Henry Fonda, who destroyed his beloved, wholesome image and portrayed one of the top villains in movie history.Cinematography In OUATITW, we see the evolution of Leone. The cinematography is perfect. This truly is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, ranking right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Wide shots of the beautiful, open country side lends to the epic, opera-like feel. To portray emotion, Leone used close-ups of the actors' faces rather than dialogue. His style takes the old saying 'a picture is worth a 1000 words' and uses it in the most brilliant way. Often times we need only to see the expression on the character's face to understand the situation, not forced dialogue. Once Upon is a masterpiece of pacing. The film progresses slowly, but in a dramatic, epic way. The opening scene is an example of his genius. We are introduced to three gunfighters waiting at the train station, with only noises in the background, such as the creaking of a windmill. The three men are silently waiting for the looming confrontation with whatever or whoever is on the next train. The camera zooms in on the men's faces, and WAM, the train comes in with a deafening screech. One could never guess that a 12-minute opening, with almost no dialogue, could be so powerful and tension building.Sound You cannot discuss a Leone film without discussing the sound. Ennio Morricone composed all of the film's music before a single scene was shot. The actors act to the music, scenes are shot to the music. Unlike the Eastwood trilogy where there would many pieces and themes, there are only a few themes for the central characters and they are used repeatedly. Bronson's harmonica theme is haunting; Fonda's theme featuring amplified guitar is the definition of amazing; Robard's humorous banjo theme is a refreshing break between the intensity; and Cardinale's romantic theme is just as beautiful as she is. Morricone's music definitely surpasses the previous trilogy in its ability to set the mood, and become like an additional character, an additional setting. The use of natural sound is superb, from the flight of birds to the trotting of horses.Overall The camera work is perfect, the music and sound is incredible, the acting is excellent, and the pacing is genius. As you can so obviously tell, this is one those classics that you will never forget in your lifetime. The opening scene, Frank's introduction, the image of a blurry Frank walking behind a desert background, the showdown, all are imbedded into my brain. There are movies, meant to make money and entertain, and then there are films, art. Once Upon A Time in the West is art in its purest form."
souther02,"Sep 5, 2010",9/10,"A lot of very interesting things. But in the beginning, the movie starts as a normal Western with the bad guys looking like the bad guys and everyone else moves into the picture as possibly the same.A beautiful prostitute has come clear across America to marry a man name of McBain. Who we soon find out is her husband after all, and has married Jill in New Orleans. While out hunting grouse with his son, McBain is shot and killed by Frank(James?). The bloodthirsty outlaws decide to decimate the place, and soon the whole McBain family is dead. Jill, however, is about to arrive in the town not far from McBain's outpost, and is not killed. She finally arrives. But not before going to the watering hole where she is not shocked by the accommodations, but merely amused. Amused, that is, until Cheyenne shows up. Cheyenne meets the man simply known as Harmonica, a Mexican half-breed who plays an integral part in the story. Harmonica(Charles Bronson), has already blown away four of Frank's gang at the railway station. The half-breed is disappointed. He does not see Frank there, but does a job on Frank's employees. After the funeral, Jill looks everywhere in McBain's house for money, and finds none. She does not realize what the wealth is. Cheyenne shows up at McBain's place(which now belongs to her). He shows the New Orleans entertainer how to make coffee. Frank the outlaw had a singular interest in Brett McBain's land. He rides the train owned my Mr. Morton, making himself a partner. Being a paraplegic with TB, Mr. Morton has little to say in the matter. By now, Frank knows of Harmonica's presence yet even after meeting Harmonica Frank has not put 2 and 2 together yet. Harmonica even gives the names of Frank's victims. Jill McBain throws herself at Frank for really no good reason, except possibly to save her own life from the treacherous outlaw. At the time that most of her belongings go on auction, Cheyenne shows up with Harmonica and Cheyenne is the bounty, so to speak, for Jill McBain's possessions and priceless property. Definitely a film to catch your attention. The train breathing as Morton plays his hand in a bewildering game of poker is reminiscent of the breathing of Dave Bowman as he struggles to regain control of the Discovery from HAL 9000."
Karl-38,"Jan 23, 1999",N/A,"I just saw the film again after so many years since its release, and watched in amazement how this masterpiece still holds up against any other film. The way suspense is built, twists are implemented and camera work is executed.... thank you Sergio (and Ennio for his fantastic musical score)"
Hey_Sweden,"Feb 17, 2014",10/10,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a truly epic scale Western, one of the best ever made; no other film from this genre can quite touch this one in this viewer's humble opinion. Virtuoso director Leone gives it an impressive sense of grandeur while also always remembering to concentrate on human emotions, as it takes its characters and audience on this dramatic (but never melodramatic) journey. It's subtly performed by all, with absolutely gorgeous widescreen photography. Leone dares to take his time telling this tale (scripted by himself and Sergio Donati, based on a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Leone), which might drive less than patient people up the wall, but the film offers plenty of rewards for those that stick with it. You really come to either care for or loathe these characters, waiting to find out how things will be resolved and what will become of everyone. Enhancing all of it is one of Ennio Morricone's loveliest ever scores; it's likely to bring a lump to your throat several times.Four reliable performers play individuals whose lives come together: Claudia Cardinale is Jill McBain, a former whore who's married well and is on her way to join her husband and his family. Charles Bronson is the unnamed man with the harmonica, who's a man on a mission. Not until near the end does his motivation finally become clear. Jason Robards is Cheyenne, a notorious half-breed outlaw who gets falsely accused of the slaughter of Jill's family-to-be, which was actually perpetrated by the vile, ambitious Frank. In a genius bit of casting, Henry Fonda, who had played so many upright and morally strong men before, plays this role, and does it with commendable restraint, refraining from ever becoming a moustache-twirling Oilcan Harry. Forming part of the plot is the attempt to build a town that will take advantage of a railroad being built.Leone gets wonderful performances out of his entire cast. Some of them are just making ""special appearances"", which might make one wish that they had more to do, but they're welcome no matter what: Woody Strode, Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn, Frank Wolff, Lionel Stander. Gabriele Ferzetti has the delicious role of physically disabled but devious railroad baron Mr. Morton, but it's Mr. Fonda who proves to be the most fun to watch.Leone prepares you for what's to come with his effectively protracted, stylized opening credits sequence. It plays out slowly, but the tension is unbelievable. From then on he covers a lot of ground. The film has a long running time at two hours and 46 minutes, but never feels as long as that. There are some delightfully clever moments and plenty of time for the characters to make a lasting impression.One doesn't come away from ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" unaffected. It's very much essential viewing.10 out of 10."
acelecasting,"Mar 23, 2015",10/10,"One of the best picture ever. Good line, good story, good actor, good directing and Ennio Morricone !!! So if you want to see a real good western, you just to see this movie (also the good, the bad and the ugly ;-) ) The first sequence is an anthology ! The shootouts are epic. Before sudden, ear-shattering gunshots ring out, Leone orchestrates masterful moments of long and intense waiting. In the famous 10-minute opening credit sequence, we're left for a long, long time just listening to drips from a leak, a squeaky windmill, a door slamming open and shut, and a fly buzzing. We listen and keep listening, anticipating; anticipating violence or silence or both. And Charles Bronson appear!!!! I loved the end too, with Jason Robards on his horse (i don't spoiled, i can't tell more). And Henry Fonda make the bad guy, a very good idea (in this time Henry Fonda only play the good guy). This is a mythic Western; an ode to the end of its era. Thanks Mr Leone for your genius."
verovalera1976,"Dec 30, 2016",10/10,"When I first saw this movie, not even at the start, only the McBain sequence, I thought that it would be really violent so I turned off the TV. I then watched it on its entire length a while ago and let me tell you that finally found the story very good. A bit long but I didn't care.The story of a man, called Harmonica because he always wears that instrument around the neck, who arrives in the town of Flagstone looking for a man named Frank. During this time, not far from there, a family is savagely assassinated as they were preparing for the arrival of Jill, the future wife of the patriarch. When she arrives at the station, nobody comes to take her to the McBain house. While en route, she meets Cheyenne, an outlaw.Frank, who works for Morton, a crippled railroad tycoon, tries to eliminate everything that is on the path of the future train. But Harmonica will have to confront him in a duel to refresh Frank's memory.Great performance for great actors like Bronson, Cardinale and especially Fonda, who plays for the first time of his long and successful career as the villain Frank."
mrslimm,"Apr 6, 2003",10/10,"'I wouldn't say when you've seen one Western you've seen the lot; but when you've seen the lot you get the feeling you've seen one.' Katharine Whitehorn Sunday Best (1976)The traditional accusation is that Once upon a Time in the West offers nothing new to the genre but merely replays highlights from his previous classic Western movies. This is, however, a simple evaluation demonstrating a simple prejudice against the director or the genre. It is not a true evaluation of the film itself which is a stunning melodrama filmed in breathtaking manner, garnished with stars (including Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, Charles Bronson, Keenan Wynn and Western movie favourite Jack Elam) and, to top it all off perfectly, one of the greatest film scores ever written from Ennio Morricone.While it is astonishing in hindsight to note that this masterpiece from one of cinema's most talented directors was not even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar (the dreary and inexplicably popular musical [Oliver!] won), it borders on criminal that Morricone's incredible score was not nominated either (it was won by [The Lion in Winter]). As seems typical of masterpieces, they simply are not appreciated in their own time but masterpiece this is.Given that Leone also directed all three of the 'Dollars' trilogy ([A Fistful of Dollars], [For a Few Dollars More] and [The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]), it is truly remarkable that this movie proved to be even better. There are very few films that can claim to be the greatest Western of all time and this is one of the strongest contenders. I would probably shortlist [For a Few Dollars More], [The Good, the Bad and the Ugly], [High Noon], [The Magnificent Seven] and [The Shootist] in the search for the best Western of all time. Leone also directed the first two of that list and the star of this movie, Charles Bronson, also appeared in [The Magnificent Seven]. However, Once Upon a Time in the West is, in my opinion, even better than all those films."
buchan1965,"Feb 14, 2004",10/10,"This is not a film for people with short attention spans, so those of you who have grown up on MTV, don't bother with this one. You won't like it.Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the greatest westerns because instead of showing us unrealistic hero-type characters (um, Clint Eastwood, anyone?) it gives us regular people living their lives in realistic situations.This film proves Roger Ebert's saying ""no good film is too long"" -- yes, it unfolds at a snails pace, but, like Leone's wonderful shot of Monument Valley, you have to pull back and look at the big picture. If you're expecting a Jerry Bruckheimer ""film"", this movie will drive you nuts. But if you like good long movies, you can't do better than this. After 165 minutes, I could go back to the beginning and watch it all over again. How many movies can you say that about?"
claudio_carvalho,"Nov 30, 2003",10/10,"Three bad guys stay in a station waiting for the train. Along more than ten minutes, there is a disturbing lack of action, with minor details being presented: a fly, a drop of water. Then, Harmonica (Charles Bronson, maybe in his best performance on the screen) arrives and there is a short but spectacular dialog between the characters. The next scene, the viewer sees a family being massacred by Frank (Henry Fonda, with a stunning performance). Then we have a long shot and panoramic scene in a station, with the arrival of Jill (Claudia Cardinale, with such a remarkable  beauty and performance). And last but not the least, there is a scene in a road bar, where we are introduced to the character of Cheyenne (Jason Robard, in a spectacular performance). The introduction of this four main characters is slow, but very well presented. And this will be the tonic of this film: slow, but very well constructed scenes and characters. The story was written by Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci, therefore it does not need any further explanation. All supported by the magnificent, wonderful, stunning, marvelous, fantastic soundtrack of Ennio Morricone. Another masterpiece of Sergio Leone. The DVD just released in Brazil in special edition, with two discs and lots of extras, deserves a special observation. Congratulations to Paramount: Sergio Leone, writers, screenplayers, actors, actresses, crew and the fans really deserve such a respectful edition! My vote is ten."
CinemaClown,"Jul 13, 2010",N/A,"Setting a new benchmark for westerns, Sergio Leone's sprawling epic is a 3-hour long, violent & dreamlike meditation upon the mythology of the American Old West. A sprawling epic like no other, Once Upon a Time in the West is spaghetti western at its most artistic that also marks the birth of a new style, new approach & striking maturity in Leone's vision & creativity and is, arguably, the most haunting & accomplished film of his remarkable career. In short, his magnum opus."
ptb-8,"Feb 22, 2014",7/10,"Quite astonishing for about 45 reasons, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is a film that also took me 45 years to bother to see. Whilst I admired the over-all production especially the art direction and the photography, I found the convoluted and quite bewildering story presentation tedious and ultimately irritating. There are many absolutely gloriously spectacular scenes both in Utah and with the train; the created sets/houses/town etc are genuinely visually fascinating and stunning to enjoy and make you reach further into the movie. I liked the main casting, even enjoying Fonda doing Eastwood. You can see how Bronson became a superstar after this. Some soaring magnificent orchestrations and endlessly beautiful scenes... but oh, that slow pace really did get to me. An irritating magnificent western masterpiece. Probably what Cimino was aiming for with HEAVENS GATE but overspent. This superb production came in for about $6m and looks every well spent dollar of it. Bravo! Beautiful.... Boring."
bkoganbing,"Apr 19, 2008",6/10,"I have never been crazy about foreign made westerns because in my humble opinion it's an original American art form. We don't do Shakespeare or Moliere or Cervantes in American cinema, why do Europeans insist on a pale imitation of a uniquely American contribution to cinema? Not they've done bad westerns all the time, Once Upon A Time In The West is not a bad film. I've just never accorded it the landmark status that some give it.Still Sergio Leone certainly packed this film with enough American names so that it does read like a cast John Ford could have put together.In Ford's last western with Henry Fonda, Fonda played the ramrod martinet Colonel Thursday who led his troops into a massacre because of his pursuit of glory. That was as close to a villain Fonda ever played on the screen before. Leone made Fonda ratchet his game up several notches in villainy, he's truly evil here.Fonda's a man in the pay of the railroad who wants to get a homestead family off a particularly important piece of land. Fonda also goes and frames another outlaw gang headed by Jason Robards, Jr. for the evil deed. But what no one figures on is that the homesteader had gone and married a second wife played by Claudia Cardinale. She's got the land now.She's also got a mysterious guy with a harmonica played by Charles Bronson helping her while he's pursuing his own agenda. Who he is and what the agenda he's following is something you would watch Once Upon A Time In The West to find out.I've never been terribly crazy about the music Leone employs here. Some folks swear by it, but for me I'll take John Ford's use of American melodies any day and twice on Sunday. And although Jason Robards, Jr. has a beautiful death scene, it was copied in part from what Sam Peckinpah did with Joel McCrea in Ride the High Country.Still with a cast that also includes people like Keenan Wynn, Jack Elam, and Woody Strode there are enough Americans who know their way around the Hollywood west to give it a familiar ring. Once Upon A Time In The West is a decent enough western, but hardly rates landmark status."
RM851222,"Jun 30, 2025",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1968) is a great movie. Deliberately slowly paced, it tells an old fashioned western story, but those this in an epic way. Brilliantly directed by the legendary Sergio Leone, this is a film in every meaning of this word. It looks epic, it feels epic and it epic in every frame. Cinematography here is stunning. How in the world movie like this haven't won multiple Oscar for its stunning production values is beyond me. Music by a legendary Ennio Morricone is absolutely unforgettable here. Acting by all involved was very good. And while the story takes its time to be told, its truly an involving one.Overall, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a classic not without a reason. Stunningly filmed, with jaw dropping landscapes, unforgettable music this revenge tale was tailor made as an epic film. This surely must be seen more then once to be truly appreciated. One of the best spaghetti westerns ever made, and truly a stunning cinema in every way."

crunchwraptaco,"Feb 27, 2025",10/10,"While the film runs nearly three hours, Leone masterfully takes his time, building an atmosphere of tension, revenge, and the fading Wild West. Unlike traditional shoot-'em-up Westerns, this film spaces out its action scenes, making each one feel earned and impactful.When the gunfights do erupt, they are nothing short of spectacular. Every showdown is staged with breathtaking cinematography, haunting Ennio Morricone music, and a level of suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The final duel, in particular, is one of the most gripping and visually stunning face-offs ever put to film.Charles Bronson delivers a career-defining performance as the mysterious Harmonica, bringing quiet intensity to every scene he's in. Henry Fonda, playing against type as the ruthless Frank, is chillingly effective. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale round out a stellar cast, each bringing depth and emotion to their roles.Leone's direction is at its finest here, blending operatic storytelling with striking visuals. The wide landscapes, extreme close-ups, and slow-burning tension create an experience unlike any other Western. Once Upon a Time in the West isn't just about gunfights-it's about the end of an era, the clash of civilization and brutality, and the myths that define the West.If you have the patience for its deliberate pace, you'll be rewarded with one of the greatest Westerns ever made-where every gunfight counts, and every moment lingers long after the credits roll."
nelsonc1991,"Feb 7, 2015",8/10,"Let me just say that I really loved this movie. The actors cast for each role are absolutely stellar and really pull you into the wild west. The cinematography is also outstanding. Closeups of faces coupled with dramatic lighting and atmosphere make every scene a treat. The action sequences are intense and the story is very well written.That being said I do not believe it ranks more than an eight. As a disclaimer, I am not a western aficionado so this might be par for the course. I found many sequences of the film boring. The opening scene is 10 minutes long and nothing is really happening, just a creaky old windmill. I understand that sequences like this build atmosphere, but this movie could have been 15-30 minutes shorter. Also some entire sequences were not shown which would have reduced a lot of confusion later in the storyline.A few really small things stood out to me also. Like Cheyenne cuts his face shaving and then minutes later there is no cut. Sometimes the audio is out of sync ( I was watching the 2011 remastered version ) when people are talking.Overall the positives really outweighed the negatives. When you watch a film from the 60's you sort of expect these kind of things. The superior acting, directing, and storyline make this an outstanding film."

TxMike,"Dec 23, 2019",N/A,"I managed to find this classic on Amazon Prime streaming, this version runs 2 hours and 46 minutes. I treated it as a mini series, I watched it in three viewings.After watching it I read a number of reviews, it is clear that fans think it is one of the greatest movies ever made, maybe even the greatest. Detractors say it is too long, moves too slowly, doesn't have much of a story.My sentiments are somewhere between the extremes. The surprise comes at the very end, when Fonda's character finds out who Bronson's character is and why he has been following him so diligently. It is a simple revenge motive.Most of the buildup to that in fact moves very slowly, often it even seems that characters are deliberately moving in slow motion. There is much attention paid to makeup because the movie is filled with full facial close-up shots, all done extremely well. The movie depicts settlement of the Old West in the 1800s and the coming in of the railroad which will make land more valuable and the dishonest willing to kill to get what they want.I am glad I watched it, quite an achievement especially for the 1960s. However the western genre is not my favorite and I don't plan to re-watch this one. Is it the best western ever made? It is if you believe it is, that is all that really matters isn't it?"
ifsixwasnine-sw,"Jan 4, 2022",7/10,Imagine how much better it would be if it was 30 minutes shorter. If I had seen this in a theater I would have fallen asleep or walked out. I agree it is a masterpiece. Just not one of my favorites.
rajdoctor,"Aug 12, 2007",7/10,"Rank No. 20 in IMDb list! There has been certain charm in viewing western movies. The landscape the people, their dress, horses, caps, style, guns etc. Who can forget The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? And who can forget its director Sergio Leone? Though I read that this masterpiece of his flopped in the US box office, it still remains one of the most well directed, well shot, and best western movie ever.The story is about a ruthless assassin Frank (Henry Fonda), who kills a whole family to build a rail road. His mission is finally stopped and the widow Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) is rescued by a stranger Harmonica (Charles Bronson) with the help of another notorious dacoit Cheyenne (Jason Robards).The plot is simple, but the narration is brilliant. The characterization, the silence, the style, the choreography of sound, and back-ground score is marvelous. There is a built up of suspense through-out the movie. Always seen Henry Ford as a hero, packed against a team of dacoit and stranger  brings certain tension of purposefulness of the motives of the characters. In the end, Henry Ford emerges as a villain and Charles Bronson as a savior.The camera angle, the sets and costumes are fantastic. The dialogues are minimal. The love scene between Henry Fonda and Claudia is a bit too much and serves the only purpose of formulaic insertion in the narrative.The small details, the slowness of pace, the lazy movement of people, the sun, the heat the dust all add up the canvas being painted BIG. Not a movie to see on small screen. It is strictly for big screen viewing with stereo-phonic sound effect.Hats off to Sergio Leone for bringing so much style to the genre of western movies! (Stars 7.5 out of 10)"
david-39167,"Mar 26, 2020",1/10,"When it takes 10 minutes to get through a scene where only one thing happens and only one of the six people in it remain in the movie, you know you are in for a long night. An hour in and still only about five minutes worth of plot has happened and you are still no closer to understanding what the movie is about or why anything has happened. The worst part is that no human in history has behaved like any character in this movie. People don't stand and stare for minutes before talking to each other and then say one or two words that don't mean anything but somehow say everything. Obviously a lot of people like this movie but for me, I have no interest in having to start the movie up again over three or four night due to falling asleep watching a fly crawl around a person's face or a woman stare at herself in the mirror for a minute for no good reason. Sometimes the ends don't justify the slow, boring, absurd means."
lost-in-limbo,"Aug 6, 2006",9/10,"A beautiful lady, Jill arrives in the town Flagstone, Arizona to where she would meet up with her husband, after the two just recently got secretly married. But upon arrival she discovers he and the children had been killed by a hired gun, Frank. Because the McBain family were in the way of railway bighead, Morton's track layout. But they didn't see Jill coming and so their plans face another hurdle. Plus add another couple when the mysterious gunman, Harmonica, and an extremely wanted outlaw, Cheyenne join in to see Jill get want she deserves.After really enjoying the Dollar trilogy, upon every repeat viewing and seeing the heavy influence of Leone's style breaking through. Well, I knew I just had to see his western epic. I finally got around to watching Leone's supposed masterpiece of the western genre, but here comes the sacrilege. It just didn't entirely grip me as a whole. There's no doubting the high quality of the picture and the skill behind the camera that explodes on the screen, but I found it to be a rather empty experience. More so in the ponderous, wind-out feeling, than anything else. What made it a whole lot easier to take on aboard with this opera style story of raw emotional was that of Ennio Morricone's tailor made score. His usual unique and trademark sounds draw upon very strongly in the heartfelt, but also stinging moments of pure sublime touches that simply drains the energy out of you. Leone used that asset beautifully and crafted more emotion then words could display. Each tune had its own character and organic feel by finding its way into each shot and Harmonica's theme was simply breathtaking. Of course the sound effects was the film's most important and striking component.Also stimulating, grand landscapes cover the surface with splendidly, dynamic photography capturing the sombre mood and colourful faces. Leone's cunning direction is so composed and spacious by giving the film grit and a coldness, but with a certain elegance that never can be matched. He stages some cracking scenes and the showdowns are simply unforgettable. My eyes were certainly, glittering after the powerfully precise opening 15 minutes and it would go on to be one expansive stage show with authentic settings worked into the presentation by innovative composition. But his direction and storytelling is inspired from the music cues that control the actions and emotions. The fragmented story has a more serious and level approach to it and a death stench lingering within its context of the dying west (the railroad making headway) that emerges from these characters' journeys into the new frontier. And also a certain cycle of western references creep into the feature. Like his other films it doesn't glorify its actions, but its hard not to be taken by the visionary that's on show, despite the slow moving pace, flawed story (seems rushed and convoluted towards the end with some continuity shifts) and the way it milks out its scenes. But there's certain perfection in this craftsmanship that can tell many stories with out too much effort and it finishes up with a Zen like awe.Now the magnificent performances were very capable and Charles Bronson really surprised me in his sensational role as Harmonica and the doll face Claudia Cardinale is perfect as Jill. Especially since her character is the heart of the film. Ironically, the epitome of total cold-hearted and barbaric ominous fitted Henry Fonda like a glove here, as Frank. Jason Robards is the life of the party with the wise words, as Cheyenne and Gabriele Ferzetti was jarringly, good as power hungry, but psychically ill Morton. Also you have Woody Strode and Jack Elam in cool minor roles.Simply a ravishing, haunting and baroque looking western epic that deserves to be watched. Nothing short of high art, but I don't see it as the masterpiece like some do. But saying that, watching the special features on the disc has made me appreciate it even more to up it from an 8 to 9."

This film has absolutely stunning visuals that could be a high class painting. The soundtrack fits so brilliantly with the movie and its near perfect pacing. The dedication by actors Harry Fonda frank and Charles Bronson as well as everyone else in the film is absolute brilliant.

Haleyun,"Mar 22, 2025",8/10,"This film is led a lot by emotionally tense moments, for example: a lead up to a massacre at a ranch is a mixture of emotions for a windy atmosphere where one is concerned by the flight of birds from the bush, while another is in wonder by the birds, and once a lone survivor watches in shock at the peaceful aftermath of carnage, five menacing figures reveal themselves one-by-one from the same bush as the birds, with a torrent of wind and dust making the sole noise. Other examples would obviously be the lack of dialogue from Bronson, creating a calm before the storm by simply playing his harmonica.Jill McBain's story is a harrowing, haunting sadness that does a good job of showing a woman at a loss for her once idyllic life. It's done well by the intoxicating Claudia Cardinale. Once a Bourbon Street prostitute from New Orleans, now a lady and a wife, she has the opportunity to go back to life that once was, or build her husband's dreams in a wild landscape facing the steel of the future.Irish Brent McBain knew the railroad was coming through his land, his future town. Aspirations for a Sweetwater Station are high since his land has the closest water around for steam engines.A sedentary man who yearns to be as wild as the ocean waves, crippled railroad tycoon Mr. Morton isn't above using fear and manipulation to get the land he needs for his lofty tracks, but he isn't about barbaric tactics that leave people dead. Mr. Chio Choo would rather make a deal than a coffin.Outlaw ""Cheyenne"" Gutiérrez is a wanted man, even when he isn't the man at fault, but he knows he isn't the man that a woman deserves. He'll just make believe it isn't nothing.Harmonica bears the burden on his shoulders of the ghost of tragedy, seeking vengeance with the haunting soundtrack of breathy harmonica. Hopefully he will come back for some sweetwater someday. Someday.Outlaw Frank wants it all: land, power, lust, sadistic savagery."
Lt Wolf Maker,"Sep 9, 2001",7/10,"Sergio Leone.  What more is there to say?  Don't be fooled by the context: Charles Bronson, Henry Ford, the end of the 1960's, a ""western""...no, no, my friend -- this movie is liquid style that transcends its own time period. Not even a ""western"" anymore, but a cool Leonefied experience.The best soundtrack ever (Ennio Morricone's famous thrusting ballad was composed first, and then Leone wrote it into the script).  Beautiful to listen to, fascinating to watch.  Claudia Cardinale (a delicious Italian beauty) plays the part of lead woman, which is the largest difference between this and the ""Trilogy"" Leone made prior.  Those had no women in them, except in small roles as the hostage and/or mother and/or rape victim and/or food fetcher.  Here Miss Cardinale is magnified under the Sergio Leone patented spotlight and transformed into the pouty grieving widow, in all her false eyelashed, holier-than-thou attitude and spicy comeback glory.And then people die.  Lust for revenge boils blood.  Threats are made. Threats are carried out.  Harmonicas play.  A beautiful, dusty, long, dangerously deliberate masterpiece plays out that curls your lips into an amused little smile by the time Jill serves the water to the men, and then the great opera finally ends.Leone was a great director.  Rumor has it he was in line to direct The Godfather.  All of his trademarks are in this one, including some surprisingly deeper poetic touches [the sound of the ocean as the cripple looks at the painting, which foreshadows his fate] and classic irony [the cripple on the train has enough money to afford everything, except his own health].  As usual, the sound effects are exquisite -- everyone's voice seems amplified, and the detail of smaller elements are emphasized, like the buzz of a fly in a gun barrel, or dripping water, or doors opening.Leone wanted Angel Eyes, Tuco and Blondie to make cameos as the 3 wanderers in the opening sequence, but Eastwood backed out so it never happened. Actually it turned out better this way.  Some have said that ""Once"" is too slow.  There is an obvious difference between ""Once"" and the ""Trilogy,"" which was much more commercial.  This looks more minimalistic, and is moodier than the Trilogy.  Perhaps this difference in starkness and stubborn pretension via Leone is why it never became a huge hit.Italian directors are masters of this genre.  If you're starved for more, try to find ""A Fistful of Dynamite (Duck, You Sucker)"" -- it's another great, yet often overlooked Leone film."

grantss,"Mar 18, 2014",6/10,"Decent spaghetti western by Sergio Leone. However, it suffers from the same problems as all of Leone's westerns: overly long, often- ridiculous dialogue and an abundance of hammy acting.Starts off well enough. Good build-up with much intrigue. However, if you think only the intro is going to be slow, to build up the suspense, and are hoping the remainder of the movie will movie will move at a quicker pace, you're in for a rude surprise. The whole movie moves at that pace.Has some good action sequences. Despite the unnecessary, and seemingly random, complexity of the plot, it comes together well at the end.As mentioned, dialogue and acting often leave much to be desired. Henry Fonda is great in his role. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are solid in their roles and even Charles Bronson is more-or-less okay (it is touch-and-go though!).However, as usual in Leone movies, it's the supporting cast who are largely atrocious. Some of the worst acting you'll ever see. Prize for worst performance here goes to the villain who gets thrown off the train and shot by Henry Fonda. I hope he went back to his day job."
Horror-yo,"Jan 26, 2017",3/10,"This is considered to be one of the top films of all-time, which I tell you is positively preposterous.This is a great casting, hard cowboy faces, the overwhelmingly beautiful Claudia Cardinale on the screen, an original soundtrack concept (that harmonica+electric guitar modern twist), a totally basic story about mere vengeance and...really, that's about it.The acting is as good as you'd expect from such a cast, but this film isn't even as good story-wise as lots of much more common previous westerns. I can think of some very ordinary westerns not many know that were better in terms of rhythm, story and morality.This is so over-the-top it is cartoonish. No character is identifiable and literally seems taken out of a comic book, where all those other previous Westerns gave you a feel of 'real', realistic characters with real incentives, motivations and relationships.This here is looooooooooooooooong, endless ""stylistic"" Euro-type cinema conjugated with large American budget production, top actors, and just such a thin center it feels practically agonizing that it's stretched over nearly three hours. You know what it feels like ? A soap opera. Yes. A Western-set soap opera. We move from scene to scene, at the slowest pace imaginable, and look at successive groups of people dialoguing about various topics each taking their turn. It's slow as heck, without substance, totally banal narrative-wise and ultimately, majorly overrated.3.5/10."

Sergio Leone gave time to each scene... something that new directors seem afraid to do... Great story about the last days of an era. Amazing music and the originality of linking a specific melody to each main character. And all these close-up to character's eyes... Just a wonderful movie. No spoilers here. Watch it and see nostalgia brought to the screen bu one of the greatest actors of the 60's. Transform you back to the greatest movie era of Hollywood wonders. A must see!
lisahmupindah,"Jan 3, 2025",10/10,"Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a masterpiece of epic storytelling, a sprawling Western saga that redefines the genre and cements Leone's status as one of cinema's greatest directors.The story follows a mysterious harmonica-playing stranger (Charles Bronson) who becomes embroiled in a bitter land dispute between a ruthless railroad tycoon (Gabriele Ferzetti) and a beautiful widow (Claudia Cardinale). As tensions escalate and the stakes grow higher, the stranger must confront his own demons and join forces with a notorious outlaw (Jason Robards) to take down the ruthless tycoon and bring justice to the American West.Leone's direction is masterful, using long takes, sweeping vistas, and innovative camera techniques to create a cinematic experience that's as visually stunning as it is emotionally resonant. His use of Ennio Morricone's iconic score is equally impressive, perfectly capturing the mood and tone of this epic Western saga.The cast delivers performances that are as memorable as they are nuanced, with Bronson bringing a quiet intensity to the lead role and Cardinale shining as the beautiful and determined widow. Ferzetti, meanwhile, is chilling as the ruthless railroad tycoon, and Robards brings a welcome dose of humor and humanity to the role of the notorious outlaw.The film's themes of revenge, redemption, and the clash between progress and tradition are timeless and universal, adding an extra layer of depth and complexity to the story. This is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, with a narrative that's as engaging as it is unpredictable.Overall, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a masterpiece of epic storytelling, a sprawling Western saga that redefines the genre and cements Leone's status as one of cinema's greatest directors. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and experience this cinematic masterpiece for yourself."
edavidathome,"Jan 13, 2024",9/10,"Beautifully shot from start to finish. Great music, and some very fine performances, Henry Fonda is excellent playing against type. Also Jason Robards is terrific. My one and only criticism which stops it getting the top marks of 10 out of 10 is the casting of Charles Bronson. Luckily, he doesn't spoil the film as such, I just feel it would have been so much better to have cast a better actor. Bronson adds nothing to the part. Anyway, that's enough negativity, it's a film I watch every few years as it's so very well made it has great action sequences as well as some touching ones such as Robards demise."
kalindkoirala-13911,"Dec 30, 2024",10/10,"Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is a cinematic triumph that redefines the Western with its epic scale, unforgettable characters, and masterful direction. The film's slow-burn storytelling is elevated by Ennio Morricone's iconic score, which perfectly complements the sweeping visuals and tense atmosphere.The performances are stellar, with Henry Fonda delivering a chilling turn as the villainous Frank and Charles Bronson embodying the enigmatic hero, Harmonica. Claudia Cardinale adds depth as a resilient and complex lead, grounding the story emotionally.Every frame is meticulously crafted, making this film a must-watch for fans of classic cinema and Westerns. It's a timeless tale of revenge, survival, and the changing American frontier."

Whaley_M,"May 6, 2020",9/10,This movie is art and arguably one of if not not the greatest western ever made. I would rank it #2 behind The Good The Bad and The Ugly only because of Eli Wallach and his acting as Tuco. This is definitely art on the screen.
Poseidon-3,"Jul 12, 2004",N/A,"The word leisurely is too fast-paced a word to describe this lengthy, exceptionally well-crafted film, so that will likely put off the fast-forward, channel-surfing crowd right away.  However, for lovers of art and cinema and the hybrid of the two that occasionally occurs, this is a feast.  Famed Italian director Sergio Leone crafted a mammoth, yet intimate western that ranks among the greatest examples of the genre.  Cardinale stars as a woman with a checkered past, coming west to live with her new Irish husband and his children from a previous marriage.  Right before she arrives, they are slaughtered by Fonda, a cold henchman whose been hired to clear (at almost any cost) the way for railroad tracks.  Bronson is a harmonica-playing drifter who steps in to help Cardinale, but has his own agenda.  Robards is a criminal, out to punish Fonda for masquerading as him during the killings.  Ferzetti is a wealthy crippled man who will stop at nothing to realize his dream of viewing the Pacific Ocean from the window of his private train car.  The unlikely quartet of buxom beauty Cardinale, legendary everyman Fonda, Mount Rushmore-esque Bronson and Method actor Robards blends surprisingly well and results in a fascinating melange of acting talent.  Cardinale (despite the 1960's trappings of huge hair and heavy eye makeup) gives a thoughtful, committed performance and her ample assets are loved heartily by the camera.  Fonda (in a completely uncharacteristic role) lets his cool blue eyes do a lot of the work for him but supplements greatly with his arresting gait, sharp timing and understated sarcasm.  Bronson is perfect for his tough, mysterious role.  he and Fonda make an intriguing pair of adversaries.  Robards brings wit, depth and interest to his part as well.  Ferzetti is strangely sympathetic as the driven man who has opened Pandora's Box and then can't contain it anymore. His relatively benign dream sets off a parade of violence beyond his imagination.  The whole film is given top notch treatment in the camerawork, production design, lighting, sound, editing and especially in the music. Revered composer Ennio Morricone wrote the music based on the script (!) and Leone actually directed the film, in spots, to coincide with it, rather than the reverse.  This has a noticeable and mind-boggling effect on the viewer. There are several magnificent set pieces in the film including (but not limited to):  the excruciatingly slow, yet intriguing, opening sequence, the murder of the Irish family, the gunfight in town as Fonda is targeted and the final showdown between Bronson and Fonda.  The film's few faults (obviously Italian actors as American characters, occasional dubbing issues, hair and makeup) scarcely matter in a film this grand.  There is creativity and introspection in virtually every frame.  Even the resolution of Bronson's mysterious character is more than one might expect (it isn't the usual, ""You killed my father!"" routine.)  The film is not going to appeal to the slam-bang, non-stop action crowd, but for those who love the grandeur and artistry of cinema (or even just a good ol' fashioned western revenge tale), this one is hard to top."
jordondave-28085,"Oct 18, 2023",7/10,"(1968) Once Upon a Time in the West
WESTERNOne of director Sergio Leone's most darkest film involving total retribution and a railroad line! The film Eastwood was supposed to star in but refused since he wanted to do other things and other projects. The film stars Leone's all time favorite actor by the name of Henry Fonda whose memorable as Frank as the most ruthless and the most sadistic villain in movie Western history! Charles Bronson plays Harmonica whose set out to kill him leaving viewers speculating what the connection is going to be! The problem, the Henry Fonda character whose totally an unlikable character screen presence especially in terms of it's running time overshadows the person viewers is supposed to root for which is Harmonica, the Charles Bronson character! Bronson's role is almost as absent as the rest of the cast by comparison with Henry Fonda's! And as usual excellent photography and musical score by Ennio Morricone but somewhat depressing and not fun to look at compared with Leone's other efforts."
davidmvining,"Nov 1, 2021",8/10,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly felt like the work of someone in over his head, unsure of how to spend the massive amount of money for the large production. Once Upon a Time in the West feels like the work of a mature filmmaker with a fuller understanding of how to use a large budget. The interesting thing to me in the credits is the story by credits for Sergio Leone that he shares with Dario Argento and, in particular, Bernardo Bertolucci. It's documented that Bertolucci was responsible for the idea of making the main character a woman, but the film has a certain structural feel that reminds me of some of Bertolucci's own work like 1900 and The Last Emperor. There's a cohesiveness to the central story with the larger canvas that was simply missing from the previous film.The story is of the dying of the Old West. It's a common motif and theme of Westerns since the beginning of the genre because even the earliest movies understood that the time of the West was over, that the personalities were either getting older or already dead. Leone takes the familiar and sad tale in his own deconstructionist and cynical direction, highlighting the violence and greed of the personalities that pushed the country westward and pulling in references to many familiar and unfamiliar Westerns along the way. The story overall covers similar ground to John Fords 3 Bad Men that told of Hell on Wheels, the effort to push the railroad construction as fast as possible (though, it's not like Ford's film was free of devious antagonists willing to kill to get what they wanted or anything). That's the epic scope part of the story, anchored by Jill (Claudia Cardinale), the New Orleans prostitute who married the farmer Brett McBain (Frank Wolff).He had gone to New Orleans, met the beautiful woman, married her in secret, and then paid for her passage out West to his dusty farm where nothing grew with promises of wealth and finery. However, Brett and his three children get shot down by Frank (Henry Fonda) before Jill even arrives at the remote little town of Flagstone, some miles from the town. Along the same time, the mysterious figure known only as Harmonica (Charles Bronson) arrives, kills three men dressed as the men of the local bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards), and begins his search for Frank. Cheyenne himself escapes from custody on his own (his men lagging a few minutes behind) and needs to untangle the mystery of the men, who were not his, dressed like his men and what they were doing on the remote, worthless McBain farm.Jill arrives to find her husband and stepchildren dead, knowing that they were killed for something, but she doesn't know what. Cheyenne shows up as well with questions, hoping to find something. He's menacing in look and gruff in demeanor, but he's less interested in what Jill could find than the mystery itself. Amongst the items of the late McBain Jill finds a toy train station.Frank, though, is not some random madman, he's working for the train company, represented as the dying cripple Mr. Morton (Gabriele Frezetti), traveling up and down the line in his resplendent train car, moving around the car by brass bars that extend from the ceiling since he can barely walk. He has dreams of making it to the Pacific, seeing the expanse of water before he dies, and in order to make that, the railroad must complete fast, giving our bad guy a tangible reason for his villainy which is nice.The story moves towards confrontation (of course) between all of them in different ways, especially when Jill learns the truth of her husband's plans. He had purchased the worthless land on purpose, knowing that the railroad had to go through that property, and in order to maintain his ownership he needed to build a station, the wood for which arrives after Jill.What's really interesting about the story here is how much more important to the movie it is than in Leone's previous films. Story always felt like a secondary concern, little more than a bare excuse to hang great moments on, but here everything feels of a piece, working towards a common narrative goal. The story actually feels like its coming to a point instead of just genre thrills, and that point is the dying of the Old West. Cheyenne, Harmonica, and Frank represent the wild version of the West. They are the gunslingers who dominated the myth of the Old West. Jill, an Eastern woman of fine tastes, represents the new West, the civilizing influence coming into the wild parts of the country on a path forged by the railway man Morton. As I said to start this review, there's a mature feeling to this film that's missing from Leone's previous work, and I strongly suspect the influence of Bertolucci.There is one story bit that falls a bit flat to me, though, and that's the reveal of Harmonica's connection to Frank. We're not even really given hints through the film beyond the idea that there is a connection, and then the connection is revealed as this deeply emotional moment for Harmonica. And yet, it just doesn't really work, probably because the slivers of slow-motion flashback were just too bare to establish the emotional connection with the audience.Of course, just story isn't Leone, even in a more refined form. His distinct style is still on display and it is both a strength and one of the film's smaller weaknesses. I think, at this point, Leone didn't know when to quit and some of these moments just go on for a bit too long (I'm thinking of when Morton has to bribe his way out from under some gunmen during a card game), but the rest of the time he's using his combination of slow action and active editing to create wonderful tension, like in the opening scene at the train station as Harmonica arrives or Jill's arrival at Flagstone (that Zemeckis would imitate in Back to the Future Part III).I don't think Once Upon a Time in the West quite rises to greatness, a key emotional beat doesn't work and Leone's style occasionally gets in the way of things, but it's a consistently entertaining and intelligent work by a filmmaker who suddenly discovered the art of telling a story rather than just having great individual moments strung together. Leone really grew here as a filmmaker."
awdboosted95,"Aug 26, 2024",7/10,"This is almost a completely different type of movie to me especially the 1st hour. And please, the opening credits - spaced out over 11 minutes, bored me to tears. Sure it oozed character, you get that, but that really only could only hold it for a few minutes or maybe 5, 11? Nah, it needed more substance like tension building and without that it staled and got boring. Structured differently with different music that opening definitely could have built great tension, just look at the ending of GB&U THAT is how you build tension!!!! A missed opportunity there really. So then the next 2 minutes were great, once the train arrived, THAT is classic and worthy of its reputation, but sadly, that was the ONLY good 2 minutes in the first 33!!!! UGGGG The next 33 minutes chugged along like this too, boring stuff, some good and great stuff, more filler etc. Thankfully after this pacing gets better and the story gets more interesting and intriguing.To me this is a good flick but somewhat overated, and I guess that set up too high of expectations for me also. The first 2 in the dollar trilogy are good but I don't find 'great' either really tbh, rate them about the same as this, all these are just really really slow burners that require a lot of patience, and appreciation for the subtleties. Good and the Bad though is the best there is IMO, unmatched Western masterpiece, the pacing is just so much better than this and the other 2 dollar flicks, and the music really really elevates it too, something that was sorely missing in this one IMO.Anyway having said all that this is a good flick and a must watch ofc and there are definitely redeeming qualities here worth viewing, just temper your expectations unlike I did. The story itself is good, but moreover the 3 main male characters and how well they were acted by Bronson, Fonda and Robards are really great, and Claudia was easy on the eyes as well which didn't hurt. So good flick yes, great? Falls really far short of that in my book. I will watch it again and probably enjoy it more in the future but it will never come close to GB&U greatness."
WaltuhRed,"Oct 22, 2021",9/10,"Im gonna make it short and simple. Once upon a time in the west is a beautifully made film (as usual when Leone is the director), it's a proper brilliant western with a great storyline, amazing soundtrack (as usual when Morricone is the componist), great cast, who are all natural in their roles. The only reason this isn't the greatest western ever is because of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Leone made both in 2 years.10/10."
afonsobritofalves,"Sep 13, 2018",9/10,"One of the best westerns ever, Once Upon a Time in the West got a realistic story, fantastic, fun and full of good special effects and very good actor; Without doubt one of the best films of Sergio Leone. Highly recommend."
lhomjose,"Dec 23, 2019",9/10,"What makes Sergio Leone movie stand out? Extraordinary taste to create lasting emotions in the human mind. Ennios music adds the quintessential spice to the movie with anybody watching the movie wanting to go back to listen to the theme again. Simple story compared to the very complex marvel movies nowadays, but the way it is narrated and paced creates a dent right where a movie lover wants it. Sergio just plays your dopamine, oxytocin, melatonin levels in your brain without you having a clue"
WhatsUpManPodcast,"May 2, 2024",9/10,"Set against the backdrop of the American frontier, the film weaves a complex and immersive narrative that follows several interconnected characters. The story revolves around a mysterious harmonica-playing gunslinger, played by Charles Bronson, a notorious outlaw named Cheyenne, portrayed by Jason Robards, a ruthless hired killer named Frank, played by Henry Fonda, and a strong-willed widow, played by Claudia Cardinale. Their paths converge in a tale of revenge, greed, and the clash between civilization and lawlessness.""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a visual and auditory feast. Leone's masterful use of widescreen cinematography captures the vastness and beauty of the American West, while the haunting musical score by Ennio Morricone adds depth and emotion to the film. The combination of Leone's precise framing, long takes, and the operatic quality of Morricone's music creates a truly immersive cinematic experience.The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing for moments of quiet contemplation and building tension to explosive crescendos. Leone's signature use of close-ups intensifies the emotional impact, capturing the subtle nuances of the characters' expressions and adding layers of depth to their motivations.The performances in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" are exceptional. Charles Bronson brings a stoic and enigmatic presence to his role as the harmonica-playing gunslinger, while Henry Fonda delivers a chilling and against-type performance as the cold-blooded antagonist. Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale also shine in their respective roles, adding complexity and humanity to their characters.Thematically, the film delves into the mythic nature of the American West, exploring themes of vengeance, redemption, and the loss of innocence. It deconstructs the traditional Western tropes and presents a more morally ambiguous and nuanced portrayal of its characters. Leone's examination of the clash between progress and the fading frontier creates a rich and thought-provoking narrative.""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a majestic Western epic that transcends the genre and stands as a cinematic masterpiece. With its breathtaking visuals, unforgettable characters, and profound storytelling, it is a testament to Sergio Leone's artistic vision and his ability to redefine traditional cinematic conventions. The film is an essential watch for any lover of cinema and a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences with its grandeur and emotional depth."
Witchfinder-General-666,"Mar 24, 2010",10/10,"There are Westerns that every Western fan should see. There are Westerns that every film fan should see. And then there are the chosen few that everybody MUST see. Sergio Leone's quintessential Italian Westerns doubtlessly belong to that latter category, and ""C'era Una Volta Il West"" aka. ""Once Upon a Time In the West"" (1968) in particular is a masterpiece that no one even remotely interested in the art of motion pictures could possibly consider missing. Along with Leone's earlier masterpiece ""Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo"" aka. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1966), this is arguably one of the two most brilliant and overwhelming Westerns ever made.There are countless reasons why this masterpiece must be seen by anyone interested in cinema, but I shall stick to the most obvious ones: Co-scripted by Bernardo Bertolucci and the later Horror-master Dario Argento (who is a personal god of mine), ""Once Upon a time in the West"" is absolutely overwhelming in all regards, be it story-wise, stylistically or visually. Maybe even more than Leone's other Westerns, all visually stunning and brutal masterpieces, ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" shows the old West from in its most brutal and most beautiful side. Leone's fourth Western in often compared to opera, and these comparisons are well founded. Visually overwhelming from start to finish, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" comes along with what is positively the most brilliant of Ennio Morricone's magnificent film scores; a score that overwhelms. Listening to Morricone's music alone is capable of building up suspense, even if it's listened to out of context. Maybe more than anything else, it is this score by the positively greatest film composer who ever lived, that carries the film and makes it the unforgettable experience it is.""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a film that uniquely takes time in order to build up tension. The opening sequence alone is a unique piece of art the likes of which are very seldom in cinema. I do not wish to go too deeply into detail about the story, as this fantastic experience should be experienced rather than read by anyone who hasn't seen it (if there still is somebody out there who hasn't). As much as it is a film about the Old West, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is also a film about the end of the Old West, the triumph of capitalism over the 'pioneer spirit'. The film begins with the brutal massacre of a family over a piece of land, which becomes the object of desire for a murderous villain (Henry Fonda), a bandit leader (Jason Robards) a vengeful gunman with a Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and a ravishing beauty (Claudia Cardinale).The film casts Hollywood's best, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson are all at top of their game, this positively being the greatest film either man has starred in. Robards is fantastic as the rough-and-ready desperado Cheyenne, Fonda is gloriously devilish as the villainous Frank, and Bronson, one of my personal favorite actors, is unforgettable as the vengeful Harmonica. All three characters rank among the most memorable ones in cinema, all three actors deliver outstanding performances. As fantastic as these three brilliant actors are, there is one person who steals the show:In over a century of cinema, there have been countless beautiful, sexy, ravishing actresses in seductive, charming, fascinating roles. It is a rare actress and role, however, whose beauty is so overwhelming that it makes the viewer fall in love with her at the very second of her appearance. This is the case with Claudia Cardinale in ""Once Upon a time in the West"". Doubtlessly one of the most ravishing women who ever blessed the screen, Cardinale plays Jill, who is angel, femme fatale and hooker with a heart of gold all in one, and who brings out the most lovable, most intriguing and most erotic side of either of these traditional female roles. Cardinale isn't simply beautiful in this film; she is a goddess, who will immediately turn every male viewer into a lovesick teenage boy. Without displaying explicit nudity, Clauida Cardinale's Jill is one of the most erotic roles ever in any film. It is impossible to watch this film and not fall in love with her.The supporting cast includes many fantastic actors such as Woody Strode, Lionel Stander, Jack Elam ad Frank Wolff. All cast members fit perfectly in their roles.The locations and cinematography are overwhelming, unlike Leone's Dollar Trilogy which had been shot in the Spanish Almeria desert (as many other Spaghetti Westerns), ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" was mainly shot in Arizona.As mentioned above, ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is a film that overwhelms in all aspects, be it Leone's unique talent to build up tension, the phenomenal photography and rough beauty of the landscapes, the incredibly compelling story, the brilliantly drawn characters or the incredible score by Ennio Morricone – there simply isn't the tiniest aspect about ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" that is not absolutely brilliant.The Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns have been personal all-time favorites of mine ever since childhood, and it is impossible to say which one is the best. To me, it's either ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" or this one, these two films being my choices for the greatest Westerns ever made. They are doubtlessly also two of the greatest films ever made, regardless of genre. I could go on for a long time doing nothing but praising this masterpiece, but it would all come down to the same point: ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is one of the greatest, most essential films ever made, and nobody who hasn't seen it is yet a true film fan. Is there a rating higher than 10 out of 10?"
gbill-74877,"Feb 24, 2018",7/10,"Coming in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, and giving us vast canvases of the old west, this film from director Sergio Leone is truly epic in scope. The cinematography is fantastic, and while marveling over the wide shots, you really feel as dry and dusty as the characters. The overall tone screams old west, and while it takes awhile to get there, the final 30 minutes or so is stirring, and memorable. The film is legendary in reputation and adored by many, so I'll tread as lightly as possible in my criticism. I just found it fell a little short in its casting, in its muddled middle portion, and its treatment of Claudia Cardinale's character.I'll start with Henry Fonda, who is a mixed bag for me. I liked the contrast of his blue eyes with his dark character, and he certainly does things which emphasize his cruelty - killing a child in cold blood, knocking down his crippled boss, and committing rape. It's a decent performance, but to me Fonda didn't quite fit in the part. Not enough grit to be believable, and at 63, too old.Charles Bronson is similarly 'just ok', and he's certainly no Clint Eastwood. It may be unfair to compare Leone to his other work, but I liked 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' much more, because of Eastwood, a more compelling plot, and that extraordinary musical refrain. The harmonica we get here kind of pales in comparison.While it's fantastic to see the beautiful Cardinale in the film, the rape scene made me cringe, and not because of the act itself, but because how Leone captures it. Cardinale is supposed to be pretending to go along with Fonda to survive, so some of what we see is to be expected, but to see no fear or disgust, and just waves of rapture instead, is sickening. Earlier Cardinale says that Cheyenne (Jason Robards) could bend her over the table and have his men have their way with her, and all she'd have to do is wash off with hot water afterwards. It could be the voice of the hardened prostitute talking, but the overall impression of rape this scene and the other give is that it's just a sex act, one a woman may actually enjoy, instead of an act of great violence with devastating consequences. So we have a male fantasy of rape to go alone with that of the fantasy of the fearless, cool gunslinger, the latter of which has plenty of Americans wanting to walk around carrying a gun, thinking they fit this image.My apologies if this is coming across unbalanced in the other direction, and too negative. There are plenty of great moments and great shots, both of the scenery and in close-ups. The relationship between Fonda and Bronson is effective, and as in Leone's other works, they share the mindset of the hardened killer, understanding one another as they circle each other's path throughout the movie. While we certainly have an idea of the backstory behind Bronson's character, the reveal towards the end is a powerful moment. If you like westerns, this is must-see. If you don't, I don't think I'd pick this one to try to convert you."
Dreammamachineprod,"Mar 18, 2013",4/10,"I rarely leave reviews and I certainly don't like leaving negative ones, but I can't believe that there is anyone who thinks that this is a great move, non-the-less a great one. And yet, this film (if you want to call it that) is on the top 250. You're kidding me right? If you think that a movie is great just because of cinematography and production design then maybe you will like this movie, because both of these are excellent. But if you want to actually be involved in the story, then this is a dreadful film.You don't know who characters are or what they want until you reach a running time when most films are over, and if you can get involved with them or the story, (because you can't have a story with out any characters) then how is this engaging?The pacing is bad. The cartoon characters, pregnant pauses and most goofy music are laughable. I actually normally love Ennio Morricone in some of his later work and is actually one of my favorite composers, so the decisions come down to Leone to use comical music as well as heartfelt music during a rape scene! (Which isn't meant to be ironic, or if it is, it doesn't work)Nothing in this movie makes the remotest bit of sense, and is really just an exercise in creating a reality that never existed. People have gotten colder not warmer than in history because they have been desensitized, and this concept that everyone in the west was in a free-for-all of unbridled violence is just rubbish.Ultimately, I think that some people watch movies and others get involved in the movie. And this movie clearly caters to the former, because there is nothing here to get involved in. Leone has done some decent work in his other fable ONCE UPON A TIME IN America which is a great film in terms of characters, but ultimately disappointing in terms of story. So to me, the problem here is that Leone is a better directer than writer and you can't fake writing."
EyeDunno,"Dec 17, 2003",10/10,"I may have commented on the movie, but I was compelled to write after watching the wonderfully- prepared feature DVD. The video quality is absolutely excellent, IMO, with hardly any foreign artifacts (specks). Every now and then there was some digitizing in some dark scenes, but overall, the picture quality was outstanding, considering the age of the film. I wasn't so impressed with the enhanced stereo (5.1 mix) that was used. Sounds from things like the train in the opening sequence didn't follow the subject consistently, but the mono track is also included and it was enhanced to make the audio range more spatial.I urge those OUTW fans to access the optional commentary track that gives viewers a sharp insight into the making of this classic. Things that are discussed include the fact that Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale) is actually the hub for the principal characters  who weave their paths towards the climax. Also, watch for the use of water, which is vitally important to the story. It comes up so often and in so very many ways. Strange, since the very first frame shows such a parched and desolate land. The discussions also yield more about how director Sergio Leone was deeply influenced by many other filmmakers in his film that pays homage in so many obvious and even subtle ways (like using the song ""Danny Boy"" -- regarded as a ""goof"" in imdb -- sung by Maureen McBain [Marilu Carteny], which pays homage to a film that has a similar scene). It's ironic how so many filmmakers now pay homage to  OUTW.And one other interesting note in the commentary was how the decision was made to use amplified ambient sounds in the opening scene instead of the music of Ennio Morricone. Those who have patience and are well- rested should thoroughly enjoy OUTW. Those who just want to see stuff blown up and have the patience of Indiana Jones with a gun may grow restless with this movie, which really takes its time to develop the story. Even Harmonica (Charles Bronson) urges Frank (Henry Fonda) not to rush things. Once Upon a Time in the West allows you to take a close look into the faces of all the characters in ways that no other filmmaker has ever succeeded in accomplishing so well. So get plenty of rest, cancel all your plans, pop the DVD in, crank up the volume.... and watch those false notes."
dallasryan,"Jul 21, 2012",10/10,"I won't say much about this film because I don't want to use any spoilers in this review. This is a movie that everyone should have the pleasure of experiencing for themselves with no review spoilers.All I will say is you will fall in love with the music score, this is Charles Bronson's best, one of Henry Fonda's best, and Claudia Cardinale, you could just watch her all day, she's so beautiful. Oh and I can't forget Jason Robards who was amazing, really great stuff from all Four of these actors.Not much dialogue in this film, the way a great western should be(although there are many great westerns with a good amount of dialogue in them). This is a very visual film, it's a film that has everything- it's a film that symbolizes the very foundation of why we love to watch movies.This film will draw you in in a way that you've never been drawn into a film before. Probably one of the most underrated films of all time, everyone should see this movie and experience it's magic for themselves. You cannot go wrong with this movie."

ma-cortes,"Mar 6, 2021",8/10,"A beautiful girl of dark past called Jill : Claudia Cardinale travels to meet his husband McBain: Frank Wolf . While this one cleans the dusty settlement in Sweetwater along with his children there shows up some strange people . Later on, a mysterious gunfighter : Charles Bronson with Harmonica joins forces with a known desperado outlaw who holds a high reward on his head nicknamed Cheyenne : Jason Robards. Both of them protect an attractive widow from a relentless killer named Frank : Henry Fonda hired by a railroad chief : Gabriele Fercetti. At the same time, all of them : Harmonica, Cheyenne, Frank fall for her. There was three man in her life. One knew her past. One wanted her Land. One wanted revenge.Awesome Spaghetti Western with emotion, overwhelming duels , thrills, crossfire and impressive scenarios. It is a first-class Western, outstanding an enjoyable studio character written by prestigious Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci, Sergio Donati, Sergio Leone himself and being played by a top-notch cast giving splendid interpretation. Charles Bronson at his best provides an enjoyable acting as a suspicious stranger who has his own personal agenda by seeking for vengeance, this was his greatest performance in a very long career. Gorgeous Claudia Cardinale as the naive but obstinate widow, being wished by three violent macho men, as one to take her, one to love her and one to kill her . Special mention for Henry Fonda, he is really astonishing as the merciless, notorious assassin, as he is an unscrupulous, ruthless gun-for-hire who will stop at nothing and at whatever cost to get his purports. They are well accompanied by a good support cast with plenty of familiar faces, beginning with three secondaries at the impressively slow prologue : Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Al Mulock who sadly committed suicide while shooting in Almeria. Along with other brief appearances of prolific secondaries : Conrado San Martin, Aldo Sambrell, Frank Braña, Antonio Molino Rojo, Lorenzo Robledo, Spartaco Conversi, Bruno Corazzari, these actors to be followed a long career as support in a great deal of Spaghetti/Paella Westerns mostly filmed in Almeria .It contains breathtaking scenarios, stunningly photographed by cameraman Tonino Delli Colli. Spectacular settings by production designer Carlo Simi, Leone's regular, being shot on location in a number of places as desert of Tabernas, Calahorra station, Andalucia, Spain and Red Mesa, Arizona and Monument Valley, Paramount Studios, US. And of course, the immortal and sensitive musical score by recently deceased Ennio Morricone. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Sergio Leone. After his Dollars Trilogy with The Man without name, Clint Eastwood, formed by : ""Fistful of Dollars"", ""For a fistful of dollars more and"" The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", Leone carried out this great production ""Once upon a time in the West"" financed by Paramount Pictures and Fulvio Molsella. And subsequently, went on filming ""Duck you Sucker"" with James Coburn and Rod Steiger. And, finally, ""Once upon a time in America"" with Robert De Niro and James Woods. Rating : 8. 5/10. Above average."
Doylenf,"Oct 3, 2007",6/10,"I have to give ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST a decidedly mixed review.Before I begin, let me point to the major flaws involved: the dialog is not as sharp as in the Clint Eastwood westerns Sergio directed; the score is not quite as electrifying as those memorable background scores featured in the Eastwood flicks; and there is never enough exposition in the dialog to fill the viewer in with any background information nor is there any insight into the character motivations of CHARLES BRONSON. You have to wait until the last ten minutes of the two hours and forty-six minutes running time to discover why Bronson has been trailing the villainous HENRY FONDA.Aside from these annoying defects, the convoluted storyline does manage to hold the attention from the opening shots before the credits, consisting mostly of close-ups of WOODY STRODE and JACK ELAM as they await the arrival of a transcontinental train. The story is only vaguely made comprehensible by the time CLAUDIA CARNIVALE arrives to greet her new husband and his children--only to find that they have all been slaughtered. From then on, the tension never lets up, although it is drawn out interminably with scenes that never seem to move but have impact because of the clever editing.It's certainly a western saga and obviously cost a pretty penny to produce. The atmosphere seems authentic as to the sets and costumes and there is a distinct lack of a Hollywood touch to the gunplay and violence.But is it a great western? I would have preferred a less enigmatic approach to the storyline--but the strength of the film lies in the solid performances from an excellent cast. I would have liked a little more from Claudia Carnivale than a fixed stare, which she seems to substitute for an intense overall performance. However, JASON ROBARDS, JR. does an impressive job as the outlaw ""Cheyenne"".The final shootout between Bronson and Fonda is masterfully shot and within the time it takes place we're also given a flashback that shows why Bronson was tracking down Fonda's character. But the film's pace is much too slow and not exactly enlivened by a lack of dialog.And finally, I was disappointed that Morricone's score lacked the excitement of those he did for other ""spaghetti westerns""."
cricketbat,"Dec 28, 2018",6/10,"Once Upon a Time in the West isn't Sergio Leone's best work, but it's still an iconic Western. It features complex characters and an engaging storyline -- not to mention a memorable soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. However, they could have cut out 45 minutes and it still would have felt a little long. This movie drags a bit. Don't watch it when you're sleepy."
michaeljsouth,"Feb 12, 2007",5/10,"OK, I saw this on the IMDb top 250 and made a mental note to watch it, and when I saw it for sale somewhere I grabbed it, thinking, ""Hey, top 250, this is a don't-bother-renting-just-buy situation!"". Three hours of epicosity later, I'm not impressed.The only reason you could give this a rating higher than a six or seven, in my opinion, would be based on its historical significance. Film students may be exulting in its groundbreakingness so much that they don't notice that it's three hours long. You, however, will.I'm not trying to contradict all the people that say this is the first time X or Y was done, I'm just saying that whatever fancy cool amazingly before-their-time techniques were employed, they weren't done in a way that made the film enjoyable. So, by all means, as part of a class, and with the historical context firmly in your grasp so you can stay awake looking for the right stuff, watch it. Otherwise, I expect you'll want your three hours back. All the fancy-schmancy stuff they talk about like extreme close-ups, etc, just make it drag and drag and drag."
speedtest,"Mar 21, 2018",10/10,"The 2h45 minute long movie is really beautiful, fantastic camerawork, great actors, great detail. The best thing is the dialogue, every sentence makes sense, there's no silly filler talk. The action is top. I've only watched it twice but this movie you can enjoy any time you re-watch it. You shouldn't be impatient though, as the story is revealed slowly in a dramatic way."
Faisal_Flamingo,"Nov 20, 2006",10/10,"Wow! .. is that masterpiece was REALLY made in the late 60s !! .. I feel it is still fresh like if it was made in the late 90s.The cast is amazing .. Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinal, Jason Robards,Charles Bronson and Gabriele Ferzetti .. they are all were great and everyone plays exactly the role which fits him/her 100% .. like if they were born to play these roles.Sergio Leone is one of the best directors .. he is an artist .. every movie of his is full of artistic shots .. I believe this movie was his best achievement .. it was really full of artistic little details that gave the powerful script a very unique nice picture.Sergio Leone & Sergio Donati wrote a very powerful script that is one of the best scripts .. and probably the best western script ever .. the characters are colorful & deep .. the lines were very good .. especially the lines of ""Cheyenne"".""Cheyenne"" is my favorite character .. he is one of the most wonderful characters you will ever see in a western movie .. i liked everything he says .. he speaks wonderful lines!.The musical score was very good by Ennio Morricone ..What a great movie it is! .. it is a joy to watch."
kenstallings-65346,"Dec 31, 2022",10/10,"Whether it is The Searchers or Once Upon a Time in the West, critics often debate which is the best western movie ever made. Leone might give credit to John Ford and John Ford probably would have given credit to himself!Regardless, there is one point that isn't really up to much debate. Ennio Morricone's haunting, soaring, and beautiful scores drive this movie to a very special place. His score for this movie is rightly considered his masterpiece.Visually and stylistically, the movie reaches a high water mark for minimalist approach, and the opening scenes are considered among the finest ever presented. Normal musical scoring is initially absent, noticeably so, but Leone uses objective sounds of wind and inanimate objects to project scoring into the scenes. And so when finally Morricone's signature title song starts, given the emotion of the opening scenes, it achieves a unique emotional reaction in the audience.It just works!The story is also a beautiful homage to the perseverance to build the American west, overcoming great odds to turn great dreams into reality, even if initially at least, those on the journey cannot see themselves succeeding.Since this film was released, many directors have tried to emulate the style, and while some have been successful, none have captured the feel to the degree that this very special motion picture achieved.The cast was excellent, with many first rate actors rendering roles defining their careers. Sometimes, a movie just becomes the sum of all its parts, and when that happens something magical is the outcome."
jclintcool,"Jul 19, 2001",N/A,"An old friend used to refer to westerns as ""horse opera"". If that label is appropriate, then this movie is the epitome of the genre. The characters are mythical, the old-west setting is grand, and the music is lyrical. The score by Morricone, in fact, has given each major character a memorable leit-motif. One of a handful of the finest westerns ever made...an easy ""10""...see it."
oldkystude-296-459326,"Dec 16, 2020",10/10,Looking at this again you can see the elements that Tarantino used in the Hateful Eight.A classic that is still an essential.
jpclifford,"Aug 10, 2016",6/10,"When viewing this movie you wonder if this is a story or a compilation of imaginary emotional moments. There is ""Sweetwater"" a place important for the railway to get water. But the railway supervisor (Morton) tries to intervene with it. Why?? He sends Frank to intimidate but he kills. Why has Morton connection with Frank??? No explanation. Frank tries to place the blame of his action on Cheyenne. Who is Cheyenne? It is a bandit but what has he to seek in that ""middle of nowhere place""??? It is hardly to believe that it offers any profit.So, I am afraid that I have to conclude that is it is a compilation, ""photo's in a frame"" expressing ""the void"".Enjoy!"
dcnilsen54,"Apr 8, 2011",4/10,A perfect example of what happens when there is little or no post-production editing..at least half this ponderous mess should have been left on the edit room floor..Leone's obsession with trivial nuance- such as the fly on Elam's face- also helped ruin what was actually a decent plot...Bronson playing the harmonica was also a stupid gimmick which was about as believable as Santa Clause..great cast..some very fine scoring...some wonderful scenery....some very good dialogue..all brought to it's knees by poor editing and stupid gimmicks...too bad...apparently there are many that feel this was some sort of masterpiece..but it would be an excellent teaching tool in a movie-making class about what happens when a film is not edited

walterkuciej,"Feb 22, 2018",10/10,"This has it all: operatic in its themes of revenge (Harmonica), and redemption (Cheyenne), epic cinematography (the last scene, shot from the train), and an emotionally driven score (Jill's Theme). My vote for the best western ever made, and one of the best films as well. See the full-length version.
I saw it in the Neptune Theatre in Seattle, maybe 1983. The Seattle Times review said it was ""heart stoppingly beautiful."" It is."
ChristianRussberg,"Apr 1, 2021",10/10,"I am unapologetic about my opinion that 'Seven Samurai' is the greatest movie I have ever watched. The ultimate movie that defines and encapsulates an entire genre - one that blows my mind with its absolute mastery of every aspect of the cinematic medium.I am equally unapologetic when I say this movie is worthy of comparison to it. Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone created an undisputable masterpiece. Although not perfect, this movie delivers so well on every front that it will impress even those who do not typically fancy the western genre.One of the greatest movie soundtracks.Some of the best pieces of cinematography.Some of the finest acting performances.Some of the best examples of pacing and building of tension.Ever."

Well done!"
slokes,"Jun 27, 2006",8/10,"People who view movies as foremost an art say ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" is the best western Sergio Leone ever made. I say ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" but that's because I prefer films as entertainment. Films like this one judge you as much as you judge them.A family living on a desert ranch called Sweetwater is gunned down by a gang led by Frank (Henry Fonda), one cold hombre. He brushes off his boss's complaint he was just supposed to scare them by saying: ""People scare better when they're dead."" Frank in turn is hunted by a stranger known only by the instrument he plays, Harmonica (Charles Bronson). Every time Frank asks Harmonica what his name is, Harmonica gives him the name of someone Frank murdered in his dark and bloody past. Matters come to a head when the new wife of the head of the murdered family, Jill (Claudia Cardinale), stakes her claim to Sweetwater and incurs Frank's wrath.What you have here is an exercise in pure cinema, with incredible compositions, soaring music, an existential subtext that holds up to later reflection, and references to just about every western ever made. What you don't have is very much of a story, at least an intelligible one. Characters get in and out of jams without much explanation, people die suddenly from unexplained causes, there's a final showdown that could have happened at just about any other point of the story with a lot less collateral damage, the hero tears the heroine's dress for no better reason that to make us wonder about him.I don't even like this film as much as I do ""For A Few Dollars More,"" maybe Leone's most satisfying film in its simpler way. But what you are getting here is magical, an expansion of the vocabulary of film. The astonishing opening scene, where three bad guys await Harmonica at a train depot, is alone a quantum leap from anything then in cinema: ambient noise, long shots of people staring at nothing, Jack Elam's battle with a fly.It's a different kind of spaghetti western, that's for sure. There may be less than 30 gunshots in the whole picture, and Leone is using a nearly whole new cast, with a female, Cardinale, as nominal lead. Bronson is a different kind of hero than Clint Eastwood was in Leone's earlier films: humorless, sinister, and laconic to the point of catatonia. The dialogue is still pretty quotable, but there's much less of it this time. An entire faceoff between Jason Robards' tough outlaw Cherokee and a dandy with an itchy trigger finger goes on for about five minutes and has but one word: ""Bravo.""It's really a western as epic, and an interesting response to anyone who might have thought Leone couldn't have done up anything grander than ""Good, Bad, & Ugly."" The use of themes and ideas from other Westerns, particularly those of John Ford, give this film a sense of taking stock of cinema's first genre. And Leone is getting it all in, even from the very beginning: That opening shot of Frank's pistol going off into the camera quotes directly from 1904's ""The Great Train Robbery,"" the granddaddy of westerns.I love watching this film unfold in its gradual way, and can't help feeling a sense of exultation over how everything gels, but it's impossible to ignore the flaws. The film drags. There's little humor. Robards' character is never integrated into the rest of the film. Leone's disinterest in plot becomes more apparent, and disabling, as the film goes on.What is Harmonica's purpose here? Is he an angel from God? The Grim Reaper? He seems to serve some mystical function, as Leone's emissary bringing down the curtain on Fonda's Frank, the ultimate bad guy, and the West that spawned him.""Once Upon A Time"" feels like a dead stop that way, both for Leone (who would make only two more films, neither much appreciated in their day, in the next 20 years) and for the western. They were still churning out good westerns in 1969, like ""True Grit"", ""The Wild Bunch,"" and ""Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid,"" and even bad ones like ""Mackenna's Gold."" Just a few years later, they were hardly making any, a drought that continues to this day.""Someday,"" Harmonica says when asked if he'd ever return to Sweetwater. It looks more and more like someday meant never."
Stamp-3,"Jun 24, 1999",N/A,"A truly magnificent film. I first saw the movie in 1969, and of course (not that we knew it then) it had been cut by some 30 minutes. The whole scene at the roadhouse was missing, so we didn't even know that Jill had met Harmonica and Cheyenne, a lot of important stuff concerning, Frank, his gang and Morton was not there, and of course the ending was...well let's just say it was different. But even then it was the most astonishing movie experience. Finally in 1979 I saw it wide screen, fully restored. Breathtaking! (It also made a lot more sense!)I agree with every comment on this page. If you get the opportunity to see it on the big screen.go!"
alfiefamily,"Nov 20, 2004",7/10,"But I would hardly say that this is one of the best pictures ever made.I liked this film very much, but I'm not a huge fan, as almost all of the other posters on this site seem to be.Leone does a wonderful job of focusing on the characters and using his camera to set a wonderful mood to the film. I think that all three of the male leads are excellent. And despite what some have said, I believe it is one of Fonda's best pieces of work. In my opinion it's the last excellent performance of his career. You can feel how tired and beaten Jason Robards is by looking at his hang-dog expression.I know that Leone had great affection for the American western, and he wanted to acknowledge as many great western films as he could by adding little hints during the movie. I thought this was a great idea and made the film even more interesting to watch.I think my favorite scene is the one in the beginning at the station. The lack of music, and just hearing the normal sounds really helped to build this scene into a classic.But I did not think much of the Claudia Cardinale role of Jill. While she is quite the central figure, we really don't learn too much about her. And I don't believe Cardinale was right for the roll.Overall, a very good film that I would like to see again, and maybe it is a classic western, but still a little unsatisfying.7 out of 10"
greene-1,"Apr 2, 2006",10/10,"This film is a masterpiece which excels in many areas. Its crowning glory is the way it handles elemental human themes like love, hate and the desire for justice. It also follows an intelligent script which doesn't patronise the audience, but leaves them to work out key points.The four main protagonists Fonda, Bronson, Robards and Cardinale each deliver outstanding performances and of course all the supporting actors are superb as well. But for me, the show stealer is Harmonica (Bronson) whose performance of a man driven by an other-worldly sense of injustice is absolutely mesmerising (the music score helps with this).In all, the performances, directing and music come together for a fantastic two plus hours, which, despite the unhurried pace of the film, keep you riveted to the screen."
casstevens-43612,"Jan 24, 2021",6/10,"I had pretty high hopes for this movie . I had already seen Leone's ""the good , the bad & the ugly "" , which was imo a great movie . However imo "" Once upon a time in the West "" doesnt come close to it . It starts off with an incredibly long scene with hardly any dialogue . Next , more of that , but with some very nice shots of the town and the landscapes with some western music played over it , which I like . But after a while , I really had a hard time focusing , since everything was simply too slow paced . I give it a 6 for the beautiful cinematography ."

oliverrosework,"Oct 22, 2014",9/10,"Spellbinding from the opening; a slow simmering build wrought by nothing more than Ennio Morricone's legendary score and some haunting shots from Leone, right the way to the close; a supremely satisfying conclusion, inevitable yet riveting none the less. Performances from a selection of actors all giving career defining performances, not least Charles Bronson, never better. It's also one of Jason Robards most three-dimensional portrayals, and of course there's Henry Fonda playing stridently against type in a chilling display of steel.An all time favourite, not least because I discovered it on TV one night with absolutely no prior knowledge. So do yourself a favour, pour a whisky and settle in for a slow building masterpiece."
LeonLouisRicci,"May 31, 2013",10/10,"In an age of quick cuts, shaky Camera and CGI, this Film will likely be a hard watch for the post ADD Generation. It is SLOW. The Cinematography lingers. The lines of Dialog are at the most minimum. It is LONG.So why is this considered one of the best Westerns ever. Because it is. An achievement that is a testament to the insatiable Love of Cinema, as Art, that the Europeans unabashedly utilize, like the Hug. They are not shy about physical displays of such Affection. That is the essence of this Film. Leone is a Lover and a Hugger. He is constantly hugging this Movie Loving every minute of it.He Loves the Genre, He Loves the Camera, He loves the Actors Faces, He loves the Landscape, he loves the Mythology, He just Loves and Loves. All that is apparent on the screen. Most likely that is why it is so lengthy. He Loved it all.What emerges is an Authentic Fantasy. There is on display a gorgeousity of grandeur that is quite a sight. Behold its panorama and its larger than Life Characters with their own quirky Personas and accompanying Musical Riffs. This is so playful and fun. It is all done for the Lovers of the World. Mostly, the Lovers of Movies."

TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"May 11, 2010",10/10,"Right from the very opening moments to the last, this is perfectly crafted. You immediately realize that you are in skillful hands. This builds up tension masterfully, including in the first minute(!). The use of sound(and silence, lest we forget) is incredible, with spot-on use of the exaggerated audio produced by real objects. Morricone brings to this an astonishing score, with distinct themes(with electric guitar as well as softer instruments) and sweeping pieces, all impeccably well-composed. The editing and cinematography, with effective reveals, beautiful sets and nature, heavy use of close-ups and a sincere focus on atmosphere and mood(whilst also delivering amazing gunfights) help make this downright operatic. No, this isn't in a hurry like more recent movies, and there is not an action sequence every ten minutes... however, if you find a single frame of this ""boring"" or anything of the sort, then I would think that your attention span is simply insufficient, and I urge you to attempt to improve it and give this another chance. Other than being contrarian, I can't imagine why one wouldn't find this timeless and relevant; it's about the future(not in the science fiction way), development, love, and personal dreams... the things life itself are made of, what we all cherish most. All of this, without any instances of sentimentality, preachiness or, at 160 minutes, any wasted time. It fits so much plot(note that viewers are expected to piece some of it together) into that time without coming off as rushed and avoiding overwhelming the audience. The pacing is beyond reproach, with a gradual speed that lets all of the events unfold. Every scene is done exactly right, and they fit together with impressive precision. The sense of humor is great. Costumes are beyond reproach. Everyone in this is a perfect casting choice, right down to the least seen extra; their faces add an immeasurable amount to this, especially in the cases of the goons and the three male leads(R.I.P., truly sorry to lose you). Robards is so ridiculously charming that I could remember him from Enemy of the State(yes, for as briefly as he appears in that), Fonda plays against expectations with an absolutely chilling result, and Bronson, I believe, started doing his thing, what he's so famous for, in this very picture. Do I even need to point out that this is among the (spaghetti) Westerns(it references the classics of the genre, by the way) that constructed our idea(then and current) of what macho is? Compare it. The short lines, ""cool-ness"", their behaviour(I will put no details here). Cardinale is *stunning*, and, as goes for the others(not merely the leads), an excellent actor. She is an early strong female character(that all of them are marvelously developed begs mentioning), too. Dialog is well-written. There is plenty of violence that gets brutal and contains blood here and there, occasional sensuality and a little moderate language in this, and it is disturbing at times. The Special Collector's Edition DVD comes with a rather interesting and informational commentary track(by directors, including the ""Johns"" Carpenter and Milius, an author of a book on Sergio and a film historian), four featurettes, two stills galleries and a trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the medium. 10/10"
rdf-sweetwater,"Jul 11, 2012",10/10,"Everyone has already told all about the movie contents. I concur with: ""Simply put, this movie is the most visually stimulating and engrossing movie I have ever watched."" I #1 found it to convey graphic reality in a way I have never experienced in any other film - and that came across on a crummy black and white TV that I first viewed it on when stumbling upon a late night showing in 1973. The next day in high school, I was reeling from what I had experienced - it cast a difference on plain 'ole mundane life - it is definitely an ART Flick - not mere entertainment. There are some elements that make it even more intensely valuable to us here still in 2012. It is somewhat of an overlooked legacy. The actors are nearly all dead. They truly lived and died and now very few of the current ""Sweetwater"" community knows of them what went on before we took over... The soundtrack is real- the sounds throughout the movie and the musical score is real - not sampler generated - the horns are horns, the chorus is people, the windmill is a windmill, the gunfire is amplified guns, Leone used a technique of amplifying real sound- bigger than life - for effect- works wonderfully- even the plate re-verb used on the guitar tracks is plate, a large cumbersome device, but not digital emulation...The length is perfect.. those who find it slow or long don't get it.. I would that it had been a 40-60 hour film, as it almost turned out to be before Leone got help shortening it - he captured reality with intense close ups and overextended meditation-like shots and sequences... Longer? Yes. Leone is gone now, the actors are gone now, the sets are long forgotten, the locales and even the story, is set in the unchangeable past - I would that we had all the hours of it that Leone struggled to shorten, like other extinctions, to only have available to see and hear and touch. A Bored of the Rings trilogy might have ruined it though, so OK. But sadly, there is no more. Perhaps it's like the possession of a single 200 year old bottle of wine.Of note - I am a musician; the players/singers of the score - are amazing - every contribution from the whistling to the exacting guitar passages, are perfectly executed - they set standard, that which comes after seeks to come up to the bar they set - the vocals and the musical passages are one time, one of a kind; anyone else can only hope to match - saying, you cannot surpass what they did- it was perfect as original, and any flaws are like the dust in the film and become that which others try to duplicate - they nailed it.As you live and the world you grew up in changes around you, until the people and places and events replace that which was, with only remnant artifacts, largely unrecognized or esteemed by the contemporary occupants, you will experience your own : ""Once Upon a Time in (insert your own place)"" as things move on and YOU become history. The movie extras show you what the actual scene locations look like NOW and you realize that it's that way where you live: you've been living in your own drama- all around change, but you are in it and the drama is as real.Buy it and WATCH THE FILM WITH COMMENTARY - the first commentator is wonderful - takes you into the mindset like a museum tour guide, and you'll discover that the reason you are shocked and touched and moved, and find this work of art so visceral and real,,,is because it was the masterpiece last western, by a lover himself of the genre, our USA mythical west, where as as it was stated in Judge Roy Bean, ""if it wasn't, It should have been..."""
searchanddestroy-1,"Feb 16, 2025",N/A,"My friends and relatives know that I hate spaghetti westerns, I mean western made in Italy. I prefer Spaghettis in my plate. Period. But there are several of them, such as THE BIG SILENCE, as pure gem because mainly of its tremendous and shocking ending, and a couple of others that enchanted me very much though. But the Sergio Leone's film that I reveiw now, is above all of them, and I would say as magic and powerful as many Hollywood ones. I prefer forgetting the westerns starring Clint Eastwood, and also made by Sergio Leone, produced before this western. This one, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is a pure moment of pleasure, excitement, a deep dive into emotion and splendor in terms of atmosphere, acting and production design. Charles Bronson had his career really launched with this one. Just watch it, even if, as me, you prefer spaghettis in your plate. Here, it is different."

Hdny42,"Oct 14, 2006",10/10,"Sergio Leone may have wanted to go ahead with the great Once Upon a Time in America after he'd finished his Dollars trilogy (which included the FANTASTIC The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), but the studios wouldn't let him go on without doing another western. The result is the magnum opus of Leone's career (though many others may debate if that title should go to Once Upon a Time in America, or TGTBATU), and it is not to be missed for any reason. The movie is worth seeing alone for the performance of Henry Fonda as the merciless villain Frank. Pile on top of that the great Jason Robards, a marvellous Claudia Cardinale, and a solid Charles Bronson, and this just can't be missed.Today so many people seem skeptical of older westerns, but that skepticism is unfounded and could keep them from so many gems, especially this one. I would recommend that this not be the FIRST Western, or first Sergio Leone film that one views. Leone's style and pacing take a film or two to get used to, but to know the style is to love it. It is very dramatic, and while the unexperienced may read that as ""Slow"" they would be making a GRAVE error to do such a thing.From the camera work, to the acting, to the BEAUTIFUL score from Ennio Morricone, this is a legendary film that will leave you with a new standard as the best. There really isn't much more I can say without outright begging people to see this movie, so do just that; SEE IT. You'll thank me afterwards."
Michael1958,"Sep 9, 2002",1/10,"Now I see many folks like this film, to be sure-there are some moments when this movie approaches something more than what it is-simply put-a violent saga of the Old West. Yes, Henry Fonda tackles a role far different from his normal stuff, but in reality-it was a big step down for an actor who showed far greater acting in roles like The Wrong Man, Mister Roberts and On Golden Pond. Jason Robards, one of my personal favorites has the best role of any in the story-at least his lines are interesting. Charles Bronson stands out-mainly because he has so few lines-the less said by Mr. Bronson in a movie-the better! He does makes for a stony, stoic character he portrays. Claudia Cardinale-forget her acting-she is there for beauty in what is really a very ugly film. Some of the music score is interesting, the outdoor shots are nice, but the screen play could have used a lot more work. If you are into the ultra violent western genre-go for this and watch it. This is just one person's opinion-but I have seen most of all the sound westerns-save for the ""B"" stuff-ever made. Once Upon A Time could have been done much better by a better director/producer."
basemnt-dwellr,"Apr 8, 2003",10/10,"This weekend I got the chance to watch this movie (again) on tv after not having seen it for so many years. And in my opinion it is still a fantastic movie. Although if you've got the chance, you should watch it on the big screen, not on tv.Best of all is the cinematography. How shall I explain it? The movie starts with three men waiting for a train at a train station in the middle of nowhere. Apart from the station master who wants to sell these men tickets, not a single word is spoken. You don't know anything about these men, you can only guess that the person they are waiting for must be on the next train. The scene is thirteen minutes (!) long, but it never gets boring. The whole film is made like that: many scenes are extremely long, and there is not much talking throughout the whole film, but it never gets boring. Despite its slow pacing the film manages to draw you in completely and despite its 165 minutes the film is not one minute too long.The characters are portrayed as real people, not 100% good, not 100% bad. The actors are really great. During the movie I was thinking: 'who else could play that role?' and I came up with no answers. Best of all was Jason Robards as Cheyenne and Henry Fonda as the villain (Frank). Charles Bronson as Harmonica is also excellent. But I also liked Claudia Cardinale's character (Jill). She plays a strong woman, quite untypical for a western and for the time in which this film was made (1968).This film focuses more on the dark side of the west, and the dark side of human nature as well. Contrary to ""The Good The Bad And The Ugly"" this film is not funny. As a matter of fact it is deadly earnest.Ennio Morricone's score is just great. It fits perfectly into the scenes and the main characters all have their own theme.All in all a brilliant film, a must see."
JB1865,"Aug 1, 2010",10/10,"Jill has recently married a man named Brett McBain and she is going to live with him and his family. Upon arriving at the McBain home she finds that they have all been slain by a vicious criminal named Frank, the muscle for a railroad tycoon. Frank framed a man named Cheyenne and his band of outlaws and everyone believes that they did it. Cheyenne must get his revenge on Frank, protect Jill, and work with a strange man with a harmonica who has his own score to settle.Once Upon a Time in the West is quite possibly the most expertly directed movie of all time. Every single scene is so stylistically shot that it is truly a wonder to behold. Sergio Leone uses a combination of long shots that show off the impressive western landscape with amazing facial close-ups that capture the emotions and expert acting of the wonderful cast. Leone directs with such finesse he could take a scene of someone brushing their teeth and turn it into cinematic gold. The first scene where Leone combines everyday sounds to create music is inspired as well as being an amazing example of slowly building tension to an exciting climax.Possibly just as important if not more is Ennio Morricone's beautiful score, which is the best he's every done. His music can breath such life into a character or scene that you don't even need dialog. Morricone's compositions pack such emotional weight that they can transform a scene. A happy scene could be sad, a sad scene could be frightening and all the emotions in between. If a pictures is worth a thousand words, Morricone's music is worth ten thousand words.The cast is excellent as well. Specifically Henry Fonda in his deeply haunting and extremely out of character turn as the ruthless Frank. A blue-eyed sweet talking villain is a rarity and a treasure. This detail is wielded to perfection by Leone as he will use a close-up on Fonda's face to accentuate his blue eyes. His clothes are dirty, his face is dirty and amidst all that grime shining beautifully are his two blue eyes. Like two oceans in the middle of the desert sand.The script is also amazing and it deals with so many cultural and personal battles; corruption, greed, the dying of the ""man,"" and the mechanizing of the West, and so many more. Some will complain about its length and pace, but like many great movies it gets better with multiple viewings. What can seem unnecessary and overlong oftentimes is just detailed and becomes more and more beautiful the more you see it. Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the greatest films ever made and it solidifies Morricone and Leone as some of the all time greats."
dvermeirre,"Feb 16, 2005",10/10,"I remember seeing this picture as a kid. At the time, I could have described it as some of the coolest movie gunfight scenes separated by long stretches of ... nothing! I recently had the chance to see director's cut of Once upon a time in the West, and how different it seemed through the eyes of an adult. I was struck by how this was truly a movie about the most powerful and primal emotions: hate, lust, greed and revenge - mostly revenge. It' s the more like a Greek tragedy. Watching the movie, I felt that whatever the reasons why Leone had chosen a western genre (aesthetic, practical who knows?), the story was so universal it could have taken place anytime or anywhere. We feel we are in a universe much closer to Kurosawa's than John Wayne's. The violence in Once upon a time caused a sensation when the movie was first released. At the time, it was denounced as gratuitous, yet on viewing, one becomes aware of how fundamental it is to the movie. Sergio Leone displayed the themes with a brutality and raw energy which was only emerging in the movie mainstream (think Easy Rider, etc). This is definitely not your run of the mill western."

leevmlafn1,"Aug 6, 2002",N/A,"Here's the history of this great score.  Based on an early script by Bernardo Bertolucci, which was later scrapped, though he still gets credit, Morricone composed the whole score before one foot of film was shot.  Leone took bare bones recordings to the set so the actors could act to the music. But Leone hated one cue: for Cheyennes's character, in fact, he called it ""s**t"".  During the final recording sessions, Leone discussed the Disney movie LADY AND THE TRAMP with Morricone, saying that Cheyenne was like the Tramp: a scamp, a rogue, but down deep a good guy.  Morricone sat at a piano and, after a few minutes thought, started to play the staccato notes we now hear in the movie for Cheyenne's character.  Leone was ecstatic!"
synazirmas,"Jan 14, 2022",6/10,"You might call it an epic. But I do not see a purpose or agenda of this movie. If its merely depicting the tough life in the west, ok fine. But I keep wondering where the story is leading me and I could not find the answer. And to add to my misery was the annoying background song or wailing tune throughout most of the movie. I decided, I am not going to watch another Sergio Leone film."
whpratt1,"Oct 13, 2004",10/10,"Must have been busy during the year 1968 to have missed such a great Western film with Great Actors of the Silver Screen! The picture captured my interest from the very start to the finish. The photography of the pioneer days with a railroad being built in great detail, old railroad cars and outstanding scenery made this a Classic Film. Henry Fonda,(Frank),""Home to Stay"",'78 TV, played a very very hateful character who caused a great deal of pain to many people in this film. Claudia Cardinale,(Jill McBain),""Sniper"",'87,was a very strong willed woman who would do ANYTHING to save her life or her ambitions and had some very warm and sexy scenes. Jason Robards,(Manuel 'Cheyenne' Gulierrez),""Square Dance"",'87, played a very interesting character who had a great deal of depth to his way of thinking!

Nick Beaudine,"Mar 5, 2004",N/A,"Before I saw this movie, I just got done watching Leone's ""TheGood, the Bad, and the Ugly"".  That is Leone's most well knownwestern with everyone.  After watching this movie, I couldn't decidewhich movie is better.  I've come to the conclusion that they areboth great in their own terms.  The first movie is more of an actionwestern.  This is an opera. The performances by Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson are by fartheir best in this genre.  It's great that Fonda decided to be a badguy in this film.  Bronson's mysterious image is a lot like ClintEastwood's Man With No Name.  Claudia Cardinale is veryattractive (for back then).  She is pretty good as the woman on herown that can't make it without help.  Jason Robards is pretty goodas Cheyenne.  I enjoyed seeing western greats Jack Elam andWoody Strode in the beginning of the film.  What if Eastwood, LeeVan Cleef, and Eli Wallach were in the opening, or were the starsof the film?  I was also surprised by the performance of GabrieleFerzetti as Morton.  Morton was a great character, one that I'venever seen before in a western. The editing, cinematography, and direction is well done.  I alsorelished Ennio Marrecone's score.  When Morton's train is lastscene, the piano reminded me of the famous ""Ecstasy of Gold""scene in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"".  The music during thefinal showdown was great. I'm surprised nobody appreciated this movie back in 1968.  It's ashame that Leone could never here its praise now.  See thismovie!"
Reelvtec,"Jan 14, 2014",10/10,"""Once Upon a Time in the West"", directed by Sergio Leone is without a doubt, the single greatest film I have ever watched.Everything from the near silent opening scene to the monumentally epic final moments is pure cinematic perfection. This film also has some of the best cinematography of any Western and the score by Ennio Morricone still stands today as one of the most beautiful and powerful pieces of music ever composed for the big screen.At over 3 hours long its quite a long movie to watch and because of the very little dialogue it might be ""boring"" for few, but anyone who truly respects and loves the art of cinema will fall in love with this epic film.10/10 go watch it right now"

strtmanadammac,"Nov 18, 2006",2/10,"I saw this movie last night. Seeing as it was on the IMDb top 250 I thought, heck why not rent it out instead of watching The Godfather Part III again. Big Mistake. This movie was an absolute shocker. After the first ten minutes I was already half asleep, due to poor writing and tedious acting. In fact this movie is worse than From Justin to Kelly, and to believe that was bad.If you want a good western go and rent out THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY. It's got a better storyline, acting and camera angles. And guess what, the characters actually talk in a hearable way unlike this movie where they were pretty much mumbling."
Prismark10,"Sep 13, 2014",8/10,"Once upon a time in the west has taken its time to achieve classic status in comparison to Sergio Leone's other western. The reasons, no Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda playing a bad guy which was a turn off for American audiences at the time.Charles Bronson plays Harmonica, the hero of the story but like Eastwood's cowboy with no name this is a hero with rough edges. He has ghosts to exorcise.Leone takes his time to tell his epic story, with visuals and music playing an important part as the story. There is plenty of sly humour, plenty of stillness.Bronson who started out playing bad guys and graduated eventually to hero status is inspired casting as Harmonica. Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and alluring as the former good time girl who comes to town and immediately becomes a widow. Jason Robards also gives a powerful performance as an outlaw with a heart and tenderness towards Cardinale's widow.Henry Fonda relishes playing a villain but I can understand the audience of the day being conflicted, just as as modern day audience would be uneasy seeing Robert Redford playing a bad guy in some Marvel film!The film lacks the immediate attention of the Dollars trilogy, but as you watch it you appreciate this movie just as time itself has been kind to it and its reputation has soared."
csm-78119,"Feb 3, 2019",10/10,"Cracking story telling from that line to the final credits. An operatic masterpiece with that unforgettable Ennio Morricone score. Superb performances all round.

bartgodboy,"Oct 18, 2020",10/10,"Personally, this is my favourite Leone film, followed by ""For a few dollars more"". Everything one could possibly want in a movie is masterfully depicted here: Astonishing cinematography, greedy faces, pristine acting(Charles Bronson is a badass without even wanting to be badass), LEGENDARY music that is actually part of the story, great action scenes combined with tension that is still as effective in 2020 than it was in 1968, a great story that'll keep you engaged...there is absolutely nothing here that a person who claims to love movies will not appreciate. For anyone that wants to witness a great FILM and not simply something that'll made you feel ""entertained"" afterwards, movies don't get much better than this masterpiece."
bismarck-2,"May 14, 1999",N/A,"This film made me fall in love with Claudia Cardinale.  I think most western movie fans focus on the hero and the villain in describing a film, but I believe that Claudia Cardinale's ""Jill"" captures the essence of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", and in fact makes it a memorable, although violent, love story.  The entire movie plot revolves around the arrival of Jill at the railhead and the subsequent relationship she has with each of the leading men in the movie.  Cheyenne's last words to Jill still haunt me today: ""You can't imagine how happy it makes a man to see a woman like you - just to look at her...""  No doubt Cheyenne was in love with her, and in the end, so was Frank and ""Harmonica"" (and me).  It's no surprise my current girlfriend has beautiful eyes that look like Claudia Cardinale's.  ""Jill's America"", off the soundtrack, is the musical theme attributed to Jill's character and captures the mystery, beauty, and majesty of the west.  The next time you watch the film, focus in on Jill and you will discover a whole new dimension to the film."
Mohican15,"Apr 8, 2021",6/10,"The Sky Arts team of Ian Nathan, Derek Malcolm and Stephen Armstrong proudly proclaimed ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST as the ""Number One Greatest Western Ever Made"", with John Ford's THE SEARCHERS coming second... So I went into it with high expectations, determined to find out why it had been placed above Ford's 1956 masterpiece of tension and beauty... I came out of it, glad that I had finally seen it but puzzled why so many people loved it and why the Sky critics had rated it so highly. Alas, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST proves to be one of those great cinematic letdowns...I find it difficult to believe that the genius behind the Dollars Trilogy could come up with a movie this dull. I'm all for character development, but do I really need to stare at the fly on Jack Elam's cheek for what feels like half an hour? THE WILD BUNCH was about growing old and losing your touch with reality; SHANE was about the unspoilt innocence of youth and the eternal difference between right and wrong; THE ALAMO was about the price of freedom and the cost of war; and THE SEARCHERS was about redemption and love conquering hate... but after sitting through the 2:45 runtime of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (that, by the movie's end, felt more like 5:45), I still can't tell you what it was really all about. Leone tries to be all things to all people and ends up completely losing the message of his film. There are moments of genuine movie magic, but they are broken up by long periods of the most unimaginable boredom. At the end of the day, I had to ask myself if it really was about anything at all?A loveably roguish Jason Robards and a truly reptilian Henry Fonda shine in their roles along with the rest of this all-star cast, but there's not a grain of charisma to be found amongst any of them. Their monotonous speeches end up blending together, polarising their both their characters and the pace of the movie. And all the heavenly choirs and the breathtaking shots of Monument Valley can't save it from feeling bloated and more than a little pointless...It was the best of films, it was the worst of films... Personally, I'm inclined to the latter rather than the former."
Risasi,"Mar 18, 2006",9/10,"Excellent plot, the story line moves quite well for a longer movie. It seems anything beyond 2 hours now just drag out far too long. (Anything by Peter Jackson comes to mind) And the acting is superb, especially Hank's acting. There are very few who would have played his part better, especially at the time this movie was made. And quite frankly none of them immediately come to mind. And as the storyline progresses Fonda's portrayal of the desperation in his character is flawless. Almost as if he were the personification of the devil himself, and he knows his time is short.Another note on Fonda, his other main movie that year I believe was ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" with Lucille Ball. He played two very distinct characters in these movies. It just goes to show the quality of his acting ability.As for the other characters they revealed depth. Save for Bronson's character. Which is how he should be. Because of his experiences he is left changed. As if he is no longer human, nobody can appeal to him any longer. Except for justice and cynicism. He becomes almost as if he were a law of nature rather than a person.Morricone's music score was again ingenious. But this is one item that absolutely drives me insane. In the latest release on DVD it seems that they actually increased the music score volume to the point where it detracts from the movie. And it seems there are a few songs that are overplayed. I believe this detracts from the overall experience. I found I would constantly be adjusting the volume up and down depending upon whether or not we are listening to dialog or music. It seems like if they had first introduced the music loud, then let it fade into the background as the movie progresses it would have been perfect. I know I would buy a new copy if someone would smack the sound editor around and re-release this DVD."
enmussak,"Dec 24, 2002",7/10,"With the exception of Toy Story 2 being in the 60's on the imdb user list, this one could be the most overrated film.  The story and characters were poorly introduced.  Upon watching this film, and I wasn't distracted or intoxicated, and I couldn't follow what was going on.  Actually, I was distracted by Claudia Cardinale's beauty and her several close-call rape scenes.  Other than that, the story was a joke.I don't know if anyone will agree with me on this, but I think Henry Ford was miscast.  All I could think about with him was 12 Angry Men and him being intensely moral.  He does have a moral, good-guy vibe coming off of him as a villain... just look at the difference between him and Bronson when you watch the movie.  The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly was a masterpiece with a great (well laid out) story and never a dull moment.  This film must be for Spaghetti Western aficionados, because I'm not seeing the greatness here. 7/10"
chadbot,"Sep 11, 2016",4/10,"I was going to check this out after I heard it was Sergio Leone's masterpiece. Boy they were wrong. The Good The Bad and The Ugly stands the test of time because it engages the audience with it's memorable performances and scenes, and a simple plot.. ""Film buffs"" claim this pretentious, three hour bore-fest a better film than TGTBATU. Fortunately, the film had good aspects that save this movie from becoming trash. Bronson, Fonda, and Bobards play very interesting and likable characters that had my investment. The opening scene is the only moment in the movie that resembles the wit and style of the Dollars trilogy. Plus the soundtrack is really good. The bad part is, the plot is SO predictable, which doesn't help its three hour running time and extremely slow pace. Claudia Cardinale is just beauty. She doesn't do much which sucks because she's the ""lead"". If you want good Leone films, stick with the Dollars trilogy(1964-66), Duck You Sucker!(1971), and Once Upon A Time In America(1984)."
TheFilmCasual,"Jan 4, 2025",10/10,"When the movie starts, we are introduced to one of the greatest openings ever. We get a focus on three guys. We spend a few minutes on these guys without knowing anything about them except that they are waiting for someone. Then enters Bronson's character, who mentions something about Frank. Afterwards, we get another scene with new people, this time the McBain family. Again, we don't know anything about these people except that they are preparing a feast because someone is coming. Afterwards, we get a scene that reveals who Frank is. We shift to yet another scene, this time with a lady named Jill. Again, we don't know who she is, but she is later revealed to be the person the McBain family is waiting for. My point is that all of these scenes use a great technique of not revealing who the people are and why they are relevant to the story. However, later in the movie we get to see how everything ties up with all these initial scenes while going to a deeper storyline of what the characters' motivations are, alongside additional characters like Mr. Morton and Cheyenne. Maybe for some people this technique may not work due to it being slow, but I thought it was well done in creating some mystery and suspense.The final duel was a masterful 9 minutes of filmmaking. While not as epic as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly's duel, it was more emotional. With little dialogue being spoken, it is a masterful work of showing and not telling.I thought it was really cool how the music is being played by the character nicknamed ""Harmonica"". Even though thinking about how Eastwood may have gotten this role, Bronson did a great job portraying the silent harmonica player. The way the movie portrayed him as a mysterious guy was good since it made us feel he is hiding something. Not until the final moments of the movie do we get to know the mystery of this character. Frank was also a good villain, being portrayed by Fonda. The rest of the cast were also good.The cinematography is just really good. Even more refined than Leone's previous work, the close-ups and long shots are great. The sounds in this film such as the windmills and the water dripping were memorable and add a layer to this film's Western world. The music is also great, being composed by Morricone once again."
sveknu,"May 13, 2005",9/10,"I usually don't tend to like really long movies, especially when they are made in a sort of artistic way. But this western is an exception to the rule. It's a true masterpiece of movie making. The beginning, for example, is really special. Usually, I would think it was too odd, but in fact I really liked it. Ennio Morricone's music fits this movie so perfectly. It creates a western-atmosphere that couldn't have been better. In fact, the great atmosphere is what this movie is all about. Yes, the acting and the story both are really great, but it was the special atmosphere that kept me enjoying this movie for almost three hours."

JaydoDre,"Jan 30, 2015",8/10,"This film captures exceptional atmosphere. There is a lot of detail in set design. Shots pan around the rooms to show them being absolutely filled with stuff. The towns look real and lively. Silence and extended close-ups are used to build tension scene by scene. This is a film where a fly is such an integral part of a scene that it could be considered a character. It would be fair to say that atmosphere is this film's most distinguishing feature. Some say Sergio Leone spend a bit too much time on it, as the opening scene alone takes about 10 minutes, most of which is atmosphere and tension building.The film is supported by a smart screenplay. At one point, the character Cheyenne raises his hands to drink from a bottle, thereby revealing that his hands are in handcuffs. That's a smart little gem.Ennio Morricone is responsible for the music, as with most Sergio Leone's Westerns. He brings a good variety of noticeable tunes. There are emotional strings mixed with a choir or a female solo, and of course the iconic dramatic harmonica theme for the main protagonist that gets mixed with a menacing guitar. The music is a character in itself.Jason Robards steals the show as a gang leader. He somehow manages to make a murdering criminal charismatic. The main villain played by Henry Fonda is well acted but is a little plain. The main protagonist is a bit corny. His signature harmonica is cool but then he plays that same tune in situations that do not call for it. And of course he talks with the rim of his hat covering his eyes to appear more mysterious. And of course he shoots flawlessly. The female protagonist is played by the gorgeous Claudia Cardinale. You can read a lot from her subtle facial expressions. Unfortunately, she is clearly dubbed, because people found her voice to be too hoarse.That's ok though, as the characters do not speak much anyway. This film consists primarily of expressive eyes, long pauses, and dramatic music. The conversations are very to the point.This Sergio Leone's film is memorable, with many interesting characters, unique musical score and good tension."
Karl-38,"Jan 23, 1999",N/A,"Don't kill me over it, because you can also read that I thought it was a great movie. Yet, there is one minor flaw which caught my attention. The moment that Jason Robards (Cheyenne) asks Claudia Cardinale (Jill McBain) if she knows anything about the man with the harmonica -in the previous scene during her first night at the ranch she heard him play in the dark and took a shot at him lighting a cigarette- the script overlooked the fact that some scenes earlier she was also present at the bar where Jason Robards had his first encounter with Charles Bronson -Cheyenne had his chains shot remember?-. So he would have known that Jill knew about the man with the harmonica. Nevertheless...... I agree with the comments which say they wish some of today's film makers would take a look at this pic before poisoning the industry with their garbage."

tobydale,"Sep 24, 2020",10/10,"I consider this to be one of the greatest films of all time.Why is it one of the greatest films of all time? Why; because everything in and around it contribute strongly to make the experience greater than the sum of the parts.The photography is superb; Leone's use of Techniscope brings the magnificence and drama of Arizona/Utah/(Spain!) to front and centre. The landscapes and long tracking shots are stunning. Leone also uses the full-frame close ups of the faces of the characters to invite the viewer into the powerful emotions of each. We can see every pore in the faces of Harmonica (Bronson) Jill (Cardinale), Cheyenne (Robards) and Frank (Fonda); complete with his wonderful blue eyes. This device is akin to us looking at a mirror and seeing ourselves; in effect, we are invited to see ourselves as each of the characters, invited into their turmoil. It's brilliant.The music by Ennio Morricone is superb. Truly one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Leone uses this (which was written and recorded before filming commenced) to tremendous effect - building rise and fall into the imagery and storytelling. Leone simply lets the music do the talking.Some have commented that the story is ""thin"". I don't agree. Better to look at the journey of each of the characters. I include the railway as a character too. Jill is redeemed; she comes out to the west looking to make a new start and to purify herself. It doesn't look like she will succeed - but by the very end, she does. Harmonica has been appallingly and shockingly damaged in early life. His redemption is vengence. Cheyenne is a bad guy who, in fact, is hugely improved by his contact with Jill early on in the film. Jill is his redemption. Frank is just unremittingly evil - sadistic and vicious. There is no possible redemption for him. Morton the railway baron is not redeemed either and neither should he be for his murderous sponsorship of Frank. As for the railway; it ploughs on into the west - into the future.A superb film."

CoastalCruiser,"Aug 7, 2012",9/10,"Wow. I love the top rated reviews for this movie. Almost poetic they are. If you have not yet seen 'Once Upon a Time...' I envy you. It's probably my number 1 favorite Western of all times. So that you can weigh my opinion, I add 'Lonesome Dove', 'Tombstone', 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', and 'My Darling Clementine' to round out a top 5 list of Westerns to have with you if trapped on a desert island and you must watch them over and over. If they gave me 5 more it would likely be the remake of 'True Grit', 'Open Range', 'Stagecoach', 'The Magnificent 7', or any of the other Wyatt Earp movies except 'Wyatt Earp's Revenge'. I suppose 'Unforgiven' should be on the list, but I have never been able to see what others see in that movie. Have patience with me... I'm also a sci-fi aficionado, yet it took many viewings of Bladerunner before I really got locked in.What you are about to see is the ultimate 'revenge movie' in a western setting. If you have ever seen Sharon Stone's revenge flick 'The Quick and the Dead', fuggedaboutit. Spaghetti Western director Sergio Leone holds court on how to properly serve this genre in 'Once Upon a Time...'.Here are some things to know about the movie up front without spoiling it for you: 1) It's a bit slow. This is NOT Short Attention Span Theater. The pace of the movie is deliberately slow. It's more like eating a simmered roast than a minute steak. Have a beer or a bowl or whatever to let your self synch down to the pace of the film.2) Every character in 'Once Upon a Time...' has their own music. Famous composer Ennio Marricone scores this epic film and endows every character with the exact right music to set the appropriate mood. Much of this film is about the score, so tune in and enjoy the ride.3) If you get confused as to what the hell is going on the movie don't worry. It's not atypical on the first time through. To help with that don't assume all the apparent bad guys are in fact all bad, and don't worry if there appear to be NO good guys for quite some time. It all works out most deliciously.4) There is an early scene where the Italian beauty Claudia Cardinale walks into the railroad station. A crane shot follows her into the station and then seamlessly tracks up above the station to reveal the town she has arrived in. It is a breathtaking single shot with Claudia's character music blaring out. An unforgettable moment! 5) The DVD has one of the best commentary tracks I've ever heard.Enjoy!"
pepino,"Mar 6, 1999",N/A,"If Eastwood did in fact turn down the role as the Man with the Harmonica, it's no loss. Fonda's Frank - ""just a man"" - is a much more complex character than Eastwood probably could have achieved. (The contrast with railroad baron Morton is good stuff).  (I know, Clint was meant for the Harmonica man, but really Fonda was the focus here. Maybe Eastwood couldn't see himslef as villain at this point in his career. Did you notice Fonda's spit - is this where Eastwood got the idea for Jose Wales?). Fonda's portrayal and Leone's direction leave nothing to be desired. Also, Bronson's work here is much underrated - ""I saw three of these dusters. With 3 men in them. Inside the men were 3 bullets"". Bronson is the rock the movie is planted on. But really this film is a gift from these 2 great Italians. A bittersweet gift, but a gift just the same."
