bkoganbing,"Dec 7, 2009",10/10,"When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime. It's not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond.Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed, Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime. The film is simple enough, the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello. That was Scorsese's little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day, although his real name was an Italian one.Nicholson's character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area. He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate. I didn't add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life.Getting this man won't be easy because he has a full bag of tricks. One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy, concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division. A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations.But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood. At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side. There are no dummies on either side, the police aren't keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come.Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast. Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts. Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine.Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time. The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year, he might have been nominated himself if he wasn't up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond.The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson's character is in the film. If you think you know how this film ends, I guarantee you will be wrong. Nicholson's character has survived in many ways, that's all I can say.Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston's atmosphere, as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas. He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time. The cast didn't let Martin down at Oscar time and they won't let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small."
jackgdemoss,"Jul 2, 2019",8/10,"Nicholson, Damon, and Dicaprio make for an absolute powerhouse trio in this classic film. I have had this on my watch list for quite some time, and although it wasn't as rock solid as I was expecting, it's ending was right up my alley. Aside from the phenomenal acting and the satisfying conclusion, I was only impressed with the simplicity of which a complex double-rat story was told. I never felt lost trying to keep track of who worked for who and who was spying on who, because the filmmakers laid it out so clearly for me."
General_Turgidson,"Oct 2, 2006",10/10,"Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese."
Billy_Costigan,"Jan 28, 2009",N/A,"First off, this is an American stylized remake of the Hong Kong hit, Infernal Affairs. I have to give credit to that, a good film. I have seen both Infernal Affairs and The Departed. I personally prefer The Departed, and I think because of one thing: Martin Scorsese. This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and he's at it again. The film has an all star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin.The Direction was amazing. (maybe one of the reasons why he won the Oscar for it) I loved how some of the scenes were shot and set up. Especially regarding the Chinatown, and police interrogation scenes, among many others. The film is perfectly set up with intense, suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times. It works really well. The script is top notch. (Also Oscar winning) Realistic strong dialogue from scene to scene.Another thing I liked more in The Departed, as opposed to Infernal Affairs, was the acting. DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role. Here, he takes on the tough guy persona so well. Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator, but he really takes it to another level here. I can't see anyone else as the character, he fits so perfectly with it. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, being Massachusetts natives, also give solid performances, with their natural accents. Nicholson works well in his role, as well. Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real.Set in Boston, The Departed takes in all the Boston like atmosphere. Beautifully shot scenes of the Massachusetts Golden Dome State Capital building is just one part of the landscape. The Dropkick Murphys song ""I'm Shipping up to Boston"" really fits, great use of songs. Scorsese usually works music into his films really well.""Cops or Criminals. When you're facing a loaded gun what's the difference?"" This quote really represents the film."" Matt Damon plays a state officer in the Police, working for the crime boss of the area, Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Damon's character can be described as a ""bad guy,"" he is really misunderstood. As a kid, he is sort of mentored into crime business by Costello while Costello becomes the father figure Damon's character never had. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young guy, coming from a bad, crime ridden family. He's decides to become a police officer to get away from the crime life he's been surrounded by. Taking all this into account, Captain Queenen (Sheen) and Seargent Dignam (Wahlberg) decide to send DiCaprio's character undercover to find out more about the criminal underworld and Costello. With his family's crime record, he fit's perfectly into the situation. Now you have a highly ranked officer working for bad guy, and an undercover cop in the criminal underworld working for the State Police. From here it's an all out suspenseful thrill ride. Who's who? Who's working for who? Who can you trust? Paranoia threatens everyone. Lies. Betrayal. Sacrifice. How far will you take it?At the heart of this film is character development. We really feel for the characters. We feel like we know them. It's really amazing part of this story and film. Tremendous story telling here.This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crime/drama's I have seen in a while. While Infernal Affairs, came first, I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways. Really solid crime/drama. Check both out when you get a chance. It's really worth it. 9/10"
renogade,"Dec 29, 2015",10/10,"An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston. Let me start off with saying that this is my favorite movie, no doubts about it. the movie starts out slow with it's LONG intro, but picks up and never breaks pace. I normally hate pace breaking in movies, so this is already a big + in my book. the story is interesting to watch as Dicaprio and Damon struggle with their identities while Jack Nicholsen has some fun as the bad guy. This movie has a great plot, cast, music score, length and almost all elements of movies possible such as: drama, comedy, action, crime, thrills and suspense and many more. The Departed is a great movie and should be recognized as one.I find nothing wrong with it. maybe the lack of female characters, but it ain't that bad."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 18, 2024",9/10,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"" is a brilliant tour de force that stands as one of the defining works of the crime thriller genre. With its gripping narrative, nuanced character development, and a powerhouse cast, the film weaves a complex tale of loyalty, deception, and the moral ambiguity that lies at the heart of organized crime.Set against the gritty backdrop of Boston, ""The Departed"" follows two men on opposite sides of the law: Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), an undercover cop infiltrating the Irish mob, and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a mole in the police department working for the crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The dual narratives create a captivating tension as both characters struggle to maintain their identities while navigating a world filled with betrayal and danger.Scorsese's expert direction transforms the screenplay into a visceral experience. The pacing is relentless, and the tension builds to an explosive climax that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. Every scene is meticulously crafted, from the intense confrontations to the quieter, more reflective moments. The film's gritty realism is enhanced by its superb cinematography, expertly capturing the raw emotions and harsh realities faced by the characters.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a career-defining performance as Billy Costigan, conveying the character's internal conflict and psychological turmoil with remarkable depth. Matt Damon's portrayal of Colin Sullivan provides a fascinating contrast; he embodies the charming façade of a man torn between duty and betrayal, creating a sense of unease that permeates the film. Jack Nicholson, in his role as Frank Costello, is nothing short of magnetic, bringing an unpredictable energy to the screen that leaves an indelible impression.The screenplay, adapted from the Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs,"" is sharp and layered, filled with razor-edged dialogue that resonates with the audience. Themes of duality and loyalty are expertly intertwined throughout the film, reflecting the moral complexities of good and evil, and leaving viewers questioning the nature of identity itself.Moreover, the film is elevated by an exceptional supporting cast, including Mark Wahlberg, who delivers a standout performance as Dignam, a foul-mouthed yet insightful cop. His presence adds a layer of authenticity and humor amidst the tension, creating memorable moments that punctuate the narrative.The film's score, featuring a mix of classic rock and haunting melodies, perfectly complements the mood and intensity of the story, enhancing the viewing experience and making each pivotal moment even more impactful.In essence, ""The Departed"" is not just a crime thriller; it is a profound exploration of identity, morality, and the ever-blurring lines between good and evil. Scorsese's masterful direction, combined with stellar performances and a compelling narrative, culminates in a cinematic experience that is both exhilarating and thought-provoking. This film is a testament to the complexities of human nature, making it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences long after the credits roll. ""The Departed"" is a must-see, a film that cements Scorsese's legacy as one of the greatest directors in cinematic history."
ghalibalfalasi,"Jan 9, 2021",10/10,"I have yet to watch a good or a very good Martin Scorsese movie. Every movie I watched is a 10. Also, old Jack Nicholson is as good as young Jack Nicholson."
Alwood,"Oct 3, 2006",10/10,"Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions.All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Sep 27, 2023",10/10,"Boston Police are trying to bring down Gangland boss Frank Costello, Billy Costigan goes undercover to try and nail him from the inside, but his actions are countered by Colin Sullivan, a criminal who has infiltrated The Police, handing information to Costello.This film doesn't date, as I'm watching it, it is now seventeen years old, and apart from the flip top phones, oxycontin, and the fresh faces of DiCaprio and Damon, it has hardly dated.Intense, fast paced, gritty and violent, it doesn't hold back for one second, I'd place The Departed in my top ten list of greatest films. The action sequences are tremendous, and there's a subtle humour rubbing through it. Even if this film doesn't quite fit into your favourite genre bracket, I suggest you still watch, it's an incredible movie.It's one of those films that gets better with subsequent viewings, you may struggle to put some of the pieces together first time round, knowing what's happening only seems to make it more satisfying.The cast, has there ever been a more incredible cast assembled, it's a tour de force from Jack Nicholson, but Damon, DiCaprio, Winstone, and many more are all fantastic.10/10."
pedofski-radar-cole,"Jan 24, 2011",8/10,"Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater. Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot's of misdirection.The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn't a good movie to watch if you're tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who's who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won't be too confusing.While it's certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time.I can't make some of the statements I'd like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently...All that said, if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I'd recommend to you."
MaxBorg89,"Oct 31, 2006",10/10,"He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these ""godfathers"" is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return..."
tysonwilliams-52893,"Jul 30, 2022",10/10,"I guess the title says it all. A master craft in storytelling and acting. Intrigue, suspense, action, and breathtaking performances by all involved. 10 stars from me."
Movie_Buff_Brad,"Nov 11, 2006",9/10,"Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but The Departed was even better than I expected.The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's two and a half hour running time.The film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and adapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them. DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations.See this as soon as you can."
watchmovies247365,"Dec 31, 2020",10/10,The plot line of this film you could almost say is a Shakespearean tragedy. Beautifully written with surprise reveals. Casted perfectly and Howard Shore's score works great to bridge together the scenes. It's honestly as high of a 10/10 as you can get.
SoncoChairman,"Sep 29, 2006",10/10,"Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated."
Balidorf,"Oct 9, 2006",9/10,"The DepartedThe screenplay: Top NotchThe performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performancesThe music: perfectThe Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something.Once again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, ""Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre.""This film is Scorsese's finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances.However the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene.Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.That was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed."
kilroythenomad,"Oct 3, 2006",10/10,"I got to see a sneak preview of it, and I must say: the BEST film of the year so far. Scorcese is at his best and truly deserves his anticipated first Oscar for this film. Also notable are the performances of Matt Damon (such a great ""bad-guy;"" he really must do stuff like this more often), Leo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson (as always), and Mark Wahlberg (best since Rockstar). However, some in the theater with me who had seen Infernal Affairs did say that Departed did not live up to the original. I have yet to see Affairs, but I honestly believe that Departed was pulled off well enough to really bring in some respectable awards in the upcoming season."
lucianotizon,"Aug 25, 2022",9/10,"This guy never misses, i didn't liked this movie, i loved it! One of the best cast i've ever seen and maybe one of the best plot twist too. The acting of DeCaprio and Damon are insane, without forgetting Jack Nicholson who is forever one of the best of all time. One of my fav movie oat, i really recommend it."
IceCream-57,"Aug 20, 2025",10/10,Absolute masterpiece. No I way around it. This film is great on so many levels. Outstanding film. First off the cast is top notch. The story is about a monster that is older and has raised a young man from a young age that is like a son to him. He has him working in the police department so that he can keep a eye on things for him. But the government puts someone in the neighborhood to keep an eye on the gangster and his crew. This is a excellent film.
ayda-ayda,"Dec 17, 2006",7/10,"I was excited to see the movie because of the cast and the story. I was very disappointed after 5th minute because it is the same exact copy of the movie INFERNAL AFFAIRS '. The scenes, the story, everything is the same. I would understand if they used the story as a base and made a movie out of it but I will not accept it if the only thing they changed is the cast. I cannot make a good comment of the movie because it definitely is not a movie of it's own. There is no excitement of watching the movie because I know what would happen on every scene. I will give my vote to the actors only because their performance ( especially Leonardo Di Caprio )was very good but that's all."
aucoinandrew,"Aug 26, 2022",10/10,"THE GOOD:
An absolutely stacked cast gets the job done by bringing their multidimensional characters to life and propelling the story to new heights. Scorsese directs the heck out of this one, effortlessly pacing the film from one scene to the next; there's never a dull moment. The script is clever, deep, and straight to the point. The dialogue is perfect. It's just one of those films that is so incredibly entertaining and enjoyable but also full of rich thematic elements and deft filmmaking.THE BAD:
Yeahhh there's nothing bad about it.WILL I WATCH IT AGAIN:
Of course, there's 10/10 movies that are difficult to rewatch for a multitude of reason (se7en) but this is not one of them."
Jackblyth8,"Jul 23, 2022",10/10,"Arguably Martin Scorsese's most action-driven production sees a high brow cast rise to their assignments and add their own special touches on an already glossed finished product - The Departed is simply flawless.An undercover agent and a spy constantly try to counter-attack each other in order to save themselves from being exposed in front of the authorities. Meanwhile, both try to infiltrate an Irish gang.The Scorsese collection is a breathtaking phenomenon, epitomising his dedication and class in the industry, still, today, the 79-year-old continues to provide entertainment for our film-loving pleasures. The Departed was released in 2006 with Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg (as well as many more great actors) star in the crime/drama. DiCaprio even called his only one-to-one scene with Nicholson as ""one of the most memorable moments of my life"". Scorsese described the film as one of the few he has directed which ""actually contains a plot"", as absurd as it may sound at first hearing, The Departed is a controlled picture which isn't forced, it understands the correct balance of speed in its depiction of the timeline and doesn't sway a favourable way. The watch is well-measured and keeps its audience enticed by its uncertainty and regular sharp turns. 5 Academy Award nominations and 4 wins, only Mark Wahlberg's Supporting Actor nod was turned away, the film picked up a total of 97 awards most notably for its sensational image and the magnificent, artistic work of Scorsese who catalysed the production's success. The writing in the play is infectious with clever exchanges implying nothing to its spectators, credit to the crew who unpicked Alan Mack and Felix Chong's thrilling Hong Kong picture Internal Affairs and adapted it into a trope of cinema.An Irish Mafia tale fuelled with excitement and amazement. 'Entertainment Weekly' put it on its end-of-the-decade ""Best of"" list, saying: ""If they're lucky, directors make one classic film in their career. Martin Scorsese has one per decade"".A signature Scorsese stunner strikes again!"
DrNo7025,"Oct 4, 2006",9/10,"Dare I? Dare I say it? This movie is better than Goodfellas. There, I said it.I saw this latest Scorsese film at an advance screening. Needless to say I was expecting a lot  more than I thought this director (of classics like Taxi Driver but lately of Gangs of New York) would deliver. I was very wrong.Though the exact plot is unimportant, The Departed is about the blurred lines that distinguish good guy from bad guy, and cop from robber, in present-day Boston. With a packed cast (which I need not mention) that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, the acting in the departed is stellar. Living-legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello. Nicholson's nuanced acting was so on-point that at times I felt like I was actually about to be shot by the slimy capo.The Departed is nothing short of spectacular. Funnier that most comedies, Scorsese is still able to amplify the bloodshed and meticulously deliver a stunning cinematic achievement.Bravo, Mr. Scorsese; you have outdone yourself."
fburke69,"Oct 3, 2006",10/10,"Oh my God.I can say without overstatement that I just saw the most gripping and entertaining American film to come out in at least the past ten years.I was lucky enough to get a pass to an advance screening of The Departed this past weekend in Boston. I wasn't sure what to expect and actually planned on being a little disappointed with all the expectations and hype of such an all-star cast.From the moment the opening credits came up, the movie grabbed me by the neck, ripped me out of my seat and didn't let go until the final scene.Each performance is more masterful than the next. Damon was a tour de force as the lead, tapping every ounce of his acting reservoir for this role. Nicholson creates another classic role to add to his already sterling resume. His mob boss would almost steal every scene he was in, if it not for every other actor being so fantastic However, the biggest surprise for me personally came from Leonardo DeCaprio.Having never warmed up to any of his roles or movies, I found myself blown away by him in this. I'm not sure if it was the material he was given, or if DeCaprio has grown this much as an actor, or a combination of both, but he finally won me over with his role in this instant Scorsese classic. Every character is pitch perfect, every scene is right on the money. The plot builds to a crescendo of such dynamic proportions rarely seen on film. I don't want to give too much away, but I'm still shaken from the ride I was taken on.People go to the movies in the hopes that maybe once in a hundred times you get to experience storytelling so masterful and transcendent that it changes the way you view cinema. This is one of those spectacularly perfect times.Forget Taxi Driver. Forget Raging Bull. Forget Goodfellas. As much as I LOVE those movies and as much as they have affected me in my lifetime, The Departed will hands down be Martin Scorsese's Master Work."
damianphelps,"Oct 5, 2020",8/10,I think I would enjoy a Scorsese movie about making butter!He's a genius and we are all lucky to have him.Its a good story (a remake) that is largely swept to great heights by the performances of the cast.There are over 2000 review for this movie so I don't think I need to add much.Its really great entertainment that won't let you down.Enjoy!
bob the moo,"Nov 7, 2006",N/A,"The war between the police and the organised crime in Boston has reached new heights. Both Oliver Queenan and target #1 Frank Costello have placed a mole into each other's organisations. Billy Costigan is selected to infiltrate Costello's ranks thanks to a family background of criminals and working men, meanwhile Colin Sullivan has been groomed since youth to come up inside the ranks of the BPD. As Costigan makes progress it becomes clear to his police superiors that they too have a rat feeding information outwards. With only Frank knowing Sullivan's identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan's, a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning.Having enjoyed the original film, I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up. In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn't realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list, I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it. The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone, so surely America can only do it better? Well, if not better then this is certainly bigger, with stars oozing out of every pore, a big director and a long running time. In regards the latter, the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is. The fact that it is cool, engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord, but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees.The script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters, to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation. Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material. Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend, her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and, as a Sopranos viewer, I was surprised by this. A secondary downside of this (although not totally to blame) is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked. Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat'n'mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character's neck as they raced to hang the other first. The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because, added to the original's strong ending is an extra scene that doesn't have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been.Ironically for such a starry affair, some of the performances are a bit weak, and I'm thinking specifically of Damon. He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped, panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was. Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello's gang of murderers. He works well alongside a scene-stealing Nicholson. At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film. This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack. The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective. The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used. Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and, funny as he was, he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required. Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better, while Sheen is a nice touch of class. The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story, she adds very little beyond the writing on the page.Overall though, this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn't as good as I wanted. The attempts to paint detailed and complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed to be  with Damon in particular left out there with little to work with in comparison to DiCaprio. The moments of slick tension and action are very good though and the only downside was that it made me wish for more of the same and that Scorsese had focused on keeping it tight and taut in the same way that the superior original had."
doomedmac,"Nov 2, 2020",9/10,"Amazing performances, action, script, production, and directing. Exactly what I expected from this amazing director."
TheMovieDiorama,"Apr 2, 2018",7/10,"Now now, before you go and comment, dislike and lambast my opinion, hear me out. This is by no means a bad film, in fact it's better than good. Yet, a ludicrous amount of film aficionados deem this as one the best films from the last decade. I'm afraid I strongly disagree. An amateur Boston cop infiltrates an American Irish gang by following the chief mobster. On the flipside, a criminal from the gang infiltrates the police department and reports the status of the investigation back to the head honcho. It's a vintage crime story that thematically conveys the power of trust. Scorsese is back to what he does best, crafting intricate mafia crime thrillers fuelled by rich character development. The arcs of the leading individuals are fully realised and are played out like a methodical game of chess. Motives are shrouded in mystery, minds are tainted by corrupted ideologies. Scorsese brings in an A-list cast comprising of Damon, DiCaprio and the ever reliable Nicholson who essentially chews up every scene like he is devouring a piece of tender chicken. Monahan's screenplay consistently brings out the gritty Boston upbringing of these characters. It's a harsh environment that lures you into this convoluted world filled with rats and tyranny. Wahlberg's sarcastic banter was a much required element to what is a tough exterior. My reasoning for not rating this excruciatingly high is the narrative structure. There are no surprises in this, it's a ""thriller"" that doesn't excite me. Purposefully indicating who the informants are in both parties at the beginning means a large duration of the film becomes predictably unexciting. It's only at its conclusion that it mistakingly tries to be enthralling by shooting people in the head (literally!). Lazily underwhelming, especially after 140 minutes of character development. The Boston accents also came across extremely heavily from certain actors, particularly Farmiga as she exclaims ""harrrrrdest!"". A well constructed crime drama that unfortunately is weighted down by a mechanical narrative."
pedroborges-90881,"May 10, 2021",8/10,"Like i said, this film is about the mark of a great director, in this case a well paced, well written, violent movie with a great choice of songs, a mark that Scorsese is known for doing so well, but this one here is not his best film (not saying it's bad, far from it) but definitely not the one he should have won the oscar for, in my opinion the film that the Academy should give his best director award, was way back for Raging Bull, also not forgetting that he wasn't even nominated for Taxi Driver, but anyway, judging this film, it have a great cast, full of good performances, especially by Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Wahlberg.Also, this movie is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film called Mou gaan dou, the second time that Scorsese did a remake, the first one being Cape Fear (1991)."
DemiRonin,"May 2, 2011",6/10,"*Note: This film has too many big named actors for me to list them according to their roles. There is a such a plethora of characters in this film that they start to blur so I'm only going to refer to character names for ease sake. Actors you may recognize: DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Alec BaldwinSynopsis: In the beginning of the film we are introduced through montage and monologue to Frank Costello, the ruthless crime lord of South Boston. He preaches about power, grabbing life by the reigns, and about his general philosophy of the similarities between cops and criminals.Next we are then thrown into another montage of Colin Sullivan and Billy Costigan, young cadets going through the police academy. After they graduate we see that Colin is a straight- A, climb the ranks kind of officer but also a double agent working for Frank. Billy on the other hand wants nothing more than to serve. However as a man whose family history is littered with low life criminals he is stuck feeling a bit out of place. Noticeably the black- sheep of his family Billy is given a super secret top mission to fail out the ""Staties"" and instead work undercover infiltrating Frank's gang. Billy thinks long and hard about his decision but in the end is persuaded by the father-like figure Captain Queenan.After a 20 minute long intro, the movie begins as the two undercover operatives work on separate sides, doing their best to conceal their dual identities. In doing so there lives begin to morph and derange to the point they don't know if they're more cop or criminal.The story is less to do with a singular event and more to do with when the two will be found out and gutted. There is a thing about some military microchips being sold to the Chinese but that story abruptly ends mid-movie. The driving force of the movie is more about how Colin and Billy must maneuver, bluff, and lie their way out of trouble. Both sides suspect a double agent among their ranks which increases the tension.Madolyn is the on sight psychologist and while getting into a serious relationship with Colin she starts develop an attachment to Billy as their mandatory therapy sessions bring them closer.Review: First of all this movie is almost 3 hours long! No movie should ever be that long unless it contains elements of fantasy or sci-fi. This film has so many stars and characters that instead of choosing who to focus on, Scorsese gives screen time to EVERYONE. It excessively gives moments of emotional development to Frank and Madolyn. Yes, Jack Nicholson plays a cool bad guy but he acts almost like a narrator spitting diatribe after another about cops, foreigners , and every other social intuition on the planet. Why in a movie that has to deal with identity and suspense is there so much ""other stuff"" added? There are themes about church, race relations, and about settling in your romantic life. All things that are great and interesting but simply should have been set aside for another movie.The cinematography is nothing special and in fact can be distracting at times, best example is when Billy is being grilled by Wahlberg for his intent on making the force. The camera gets a little movement happy constantly closing in on heads while they talk. Although this film won for best editing I have to forcefully disagree with that recognition. The film is adequately edited but in no way is the editing outstanding. A well edited film has great pace, which this film struggles with in its entirety. It's a stop and go viewing experience with scenes ranging from a couple of seconds to five minutes. Maybe it was purposely done that way to keep the audiences awake, but you shouldn't have to sacrifice flow for attention. Otherwise you're simply shaking the viewer to pay attention instead of enrapturing them.The acting is pretty good but none of the performances other than Wahlberg's is something new. DiCaprio mannerisms continues to be the same in almost everyone movie and only different thing about Matt Damon's performance is his accent.The Departed is an American remake of the Hong Kong trilogy Infernal Affairs, which is probably why I am being harder on this film than usual. Also the premise of dual undercover characters has been done before the action film Face-Off so I don't understand all the buzz this film has gotten. Scorsese was a frontier shattering director and I loved his work in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. However The Departed is far from ground breaking cinema and the clearest example I know of success by name.Who this film is not for:-People who don't like gangster/cop films-People with short attention spans"
l-81150,"Aug 16, 2022",9/10,"This film was a remake of the Chinese movie INFERNAL AFFAIRS and
was so much better than the original one. I'm pleased to see that the director won his best director Oscar."
dstan-71445,"Aug 26, 2022",9/10,"A white knuckled crime thriller depicting the cat and mouse game of two cops, one an overworked and overstretched undercover and the other a two faced fa**ot rat holed up in the police department, trying to figure each other's identities out. Both are in too deep and thus will lose their lives if they're found out. So stakes are at an all time high, and they will run over anyone and anything to keep themselves hidden.Leonardo DiCaprio out of all the star studded cast in this flick impressed with his outstanding performance. He was anxiety ridden and dreadful of the uncertainty of his constantly fluxing situation. This is his best role so far, in my opinion. Leo truly morphed into his always unnerved and deeply depressed character. William hated the mob life he walked into, the god-awful mass murderering psychos he was hanging out with, the part where he wasn't able to be his real self, the loneliness of it all and him lacking a normal life. His only escapade was his shrink and even though all he got from her was pity love, she was his sole catharsis. That part was truly heart rending. His character felt all too real. Fantastic performance from Leo who made William Costigan Jr seem human.Matt Damon's portrayal of the deceitful and self serving nasty rat was also excellent. His hubris totally being crushed inside the elevator and seeing him beg to be killed was just funny and a clear display of Damon's broad acting range.Leo and Damon made this movie worth watching. Impressive performances from both.The Departed was a captivating and a truly nail biting experience. A well conceived, well written, well acted and an entertaining thriller that deserves it's popularity and top rating. Sad William Costigan Jr passed the way he did after all the agonizing hell he went through but at least he got avenged. Even though, that's no fulfilling, it gave the movie an acceptable ending. A terrific movie."

greg-1120,"Oct 27, 2006",10/10,"I was somewhat taken aback by the power of this movie. While Godfather II is perhaps the best gangster movie of all time, this flick is a VERY close second. Moreover, it may very well be one of the best movies ever, and it ranks with Scorsese's best, including ""Raging Bull."" The cast was, simply, superb, and as I left the movie, I recounted who will win what Oscars....Scorsese is a lock for best director; the film will win best picture; but the acting awards will be more difficult to determine. Surely Jack Nicholson will win his umpteenth best actor award, and I would vote for DiCaprio for best supporting actor. DiCaprio might get a best actor nomination himself. I thought Mark Wahlberg was perfectly cast in his role as the liaison for the undercover cop. I will see this movie again to ensure that I haven't missed any nuances!"
AfricanBro,"Jan 1, 2022",8/10,"I've watched these gangster or gangster-esque movies before; goodfellas, the godfather, training day, se7en, this one (the departed) etcetera etcetera but I was too young to appreciate them or remember so watching them again now and all I can think of is why don't they make movies like this anymore. I mean they try to.Usually when I see a cast lineup this good now first thought is ""I hope I don't get disappointed"", but in this movie the plot is just as good as the characters playing in it. And the end... often when a movie or series is full of twists and turns towards the end it's either too dramatic or just there to make up for a mediocre movie but it's perfect in this, watching this I can't think of a much better way to end it.Great actors, great directors and great writers came together in this. It's a simple cat and mouse, cops vs gangsters thriller and it's enticing without being too complicated. What I love most is the viewer knows everything that's going on and you're just waiting to see which character in the movie is gonna figure it out first. More often than not the writers always keep a trump card in the script and you only figure it when the characters involved do which is exciting, but it's nice to see a simple thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat like this one."
dbborroughs,"Nov 2, 2006",7/10,"Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it. It is a very good, if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden.The plot is simple, a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force. Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole.The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years. Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists. If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy. Thats not the case here, here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston. Its different enough to discourage comparisons, which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes.Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film. The cast is mostly excellent, with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical ""Jackisms"". Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover. His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination.I really liked this film but I didn't love it. The film carries a sense of having been down this road before, not because its a remake, as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison, rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel. It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs, State of Grace in particular, so it didn't strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them.My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going. Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length. A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time. I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie.Definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure you're going to love it, so much as you're going to like it.7 out of 10."
claszdsburrogato,"Oct 23, 2023",7/10,"Among so many incredible films in Scorsese's filmography, only one of them won the Oscar for best film and that was The Departed. However, in my opinion, this is far from being the best film of his career and, although it is not bad, it is far from being excellent. His direction is great, he manages to develop perfect scenes throughout the entire plot and some very different details. These different details are pleasing at certain times, however, at others it seems tacky. I don't like the look, it's one of the ugliest films in Scorsese's career. The story is interesting and the characters are well developed, but it starts to get a better rhythm only in the final hour. It's an incredible film and deserves to be watched, but I'm not a big fan and I don't think it's as incredible as many people say."
benkarkis,"Jan 8, 2012",2/10,"Scorcese has lost it, between this movie and Gangs of New York and the George Harrison documentary. The movie is way too long, poorly edited, dialogue ugh, I just don't get the hype. Must be the violence.Nobody acts in this movie, it's Nicholoson, Sheen, Baldwin, and Damon being themselves. DiCaprio I give an A for effort. The female psychologist roles is the worst. I couldn't sit through this and I am from Boston. Unless you are a cell phone salesman. This reminds me of Crash all the mainstream media fell in loves with a ""Scorcese Gangsta Film"" how he can go wrong.The Oscars, the media, the brainwashing."
dataconflossmoor,"May 20, 2008",10/10,"I am not saying that I think this movie is in the category with other Scorcese greats such as ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"", actually ""King of Comedy"" is my favorite Scorcese film, however ""The Departed"" is a relatively remarkable film!! The acting in this movie is simply incredible!! The plethora of acting talent simply overwhelms you!! Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, and of course Matt Damon!! I thought Matt Damon's performance was the best acting performance in this movie!! The comment he made which I found to be very interesting was ""The Irish are impervious to psycho-analysis"".. I went to grade school at an Irish parish, and even though they were affluent, they did seem more visceral than many other ethnic groups are!! Boston is the only city in the country where the Irsih control the syndicate. The Italians are accustomed to ruling organized crime in virtually every other city in the United States. Boston is where the movie ""The Departed"" takes place.. The F word replaced a lot of semantics in this movie, and the violence seemed to have some kind of tenet of amelioration attached to it!! ""The Departed"" won for best picture in '2006, as it would appear as though the copious quantity of top notch talent in this film would almost mandate such an accolade!! How were all the problems in this movie solved?...WITH A GUN!! The violence in ""The Departed"" was almost satirical, as it signified a precarious set of checks and balances!! Everyone's anger seemed to reflect a sordid and justifiable pontification for everything!! Many techniques of agitation and vindictiveness with this movie told the movie audience one thing- This is a Scorcese film!! His style emanates a proverbial belligerence through frustration that he has incorporated in so many of his past movies!! I enjoyed this film, and I can definitely see how it won best picture in '2006. What is the best way of saying ""The Departed"" is an excellent movie, by saying this: ""The Departed"" is a really good (F word) picture!!"
tedg,"Nov 5, 2006",N/A,"What a shame. Scorcese, the old one, lived in a world that worked differently than the world of most folks. His world has no God, no laws, no fate, no environment. His world is a world of characters who exude the world. If there are apparent laws, it is because of the force of people creating the space they project into.He works in this way because its his heritage, an Italian legacy both in culture and film. And because it works. A filmmaker's job is to define a world in a film, ideally in the first few moments of a film. There are all sorts of ways to do this and the way we digest what we see has a lot to do with how it is served in this way.One way, the way the old Scorcese used, was to invest wholly in bodies. Focus the camera completely on people, a few very, very strong people, and grow the world and a whole world system  usually based on simple ethics  around it. It means you have the latitude to develop some loud, apparently full characters, but it also carries disadvantages: we never can fold his movies into our lives. We can never overlap our world into his, because his doesn't exist.He knows these limits. He's spoken of them privately, and in his last two films you could see him trying to outgrow the limits of the old Scorcese. With ""Gangs"" he reached far into space, defining places, a city, underground havens, mobs, the flow of rumors through society. He reached to groups. His camera flew, not as expertly as DePalma's but wildly compared to old filmmaker's which was tethered to single bodies. ""Gangs"" overreached and ran out of money, time and the patience of his patrons, so it was wrapped up with some explosive characters.""Aviator"" showed us a new man. I hailed him as the best new filmmaker of that year. He drifted into the world, away from characters. He designated a watcher in Blanchett, something he has never done before, and he let he bring her tools of folded narrative to bear. It was film worth watching, his first one in my opinion.And now we have the old fellow backsliding into his easy manner, his cheat. His way of delivering apparent power with no power. Yes, it is well put together. Yes, it has serious actors doing their bit without worrying about how it fits in the symphony. There is no grand design, just speechifying. Yes, the use of music is perhaps the most competent you will ever find.But it is empty. Again. We lost a filmmaker this year.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
Gus-Lannister,"Jun 28, 2020",9/10,"I've just been binge watching the Scorsese movies for the first time recently have yet to seen taxi driver as the considerable one I've missed but pretty much all his other ""famous"" flicks, I've watched very recently.
I completely understand why people say goodfellas is his best film and I do love that film but this is truly special. Not only is the acting and directing phenomenal but I believe this film has slightly better pacing compared to Irishman or even king of comedy. I think this has the best ending to any of his work and I think mark wahlberg gives a very underrated supporting performance. Overall I think this is one of the best films of the 2000s and is truly a cinematic masterpiece."
sarusso-2,"Nov 28, 2006",9/10,"A really good old fashioned film, with an excellent story and an unbelievable cast. This film really keeps you interested all the way though as you want to know what will happen to the protagonists, and how they will or won't get caught.We have all seen All-Star cast films where they just did not gel, but Marty seems to have got a good performance out of everybody. You can tell that Jack Nicholson has been given huge leeway in how he wanted to take his character through the story, and as always seems larger than life, but do not mistake that for a recycled performance. Without giving nothing away, his meeting with Matt Damon in the cinema is certainly worth watching for novelty and imagination in introducing yourself to someone you know!!! This is the sort of film you come out of the theatre with a big smile on your face, and surrounded by good spirited chattering. There are twists but you do not lose track of events, and just lap up the quality that laces the film from beginning to end.Sure it is not Goodfellas, but then they say that genius only touches you once....but this is head and shoulders above the best that most other directors can make."
supernj,"Oct 28, 2020",8/10,"A great Acting performance! DiCaprio, Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg all deliver such terrific perfromances in this classic movie. If you havent seen this movie, than you must watch it immediately!!"
mwendel,"Oct 18, 2006",6/10,"For a movie over two hours long I felt like there was a lot missing. A lot of the story felt rushed while at other times it felt like it was dragging. The movie just seemed to fall flat despite all the talent assembled on the screen. I don't know if it was the dialog or all the plot holes (there are a lot of loose ends in my opinion).I just always felt like I had a lot of interesting characters but I kept asking myself as I watched this film - what the heck is going on? How much got lost on the cutting room floor? Maybe this film needed to be four hours.I would like to see an unedited unrated director's cut or read the original screenplay for this movie. It covers such a large span of time and seems to jump all over the place without neatly putting things together. And the end seems like a desperate attempt to close off as many open plot lines as possible.Entertaining, yet frustrating. I expected a lot more out of this film and I don't really feel like it delivered. I recommend waiting for DVD."
Hitchcoc,"Jan 1, 2010",9/10,"Wow, this was exhausting. We have a cast of characters, each of which has a dangerous side. They are woven into a complex network of crime and honor. Some are spies; some are mobsters; some are weak; and some are strong. The one thing that fills the screen is no one knows when it's coming. There is so much danger out there and it could be around any corner. The performances are great, particular by Jack Nicholson and Mark Walberg. These are a couple of crazies who seem to enjoy the most insane, continuous process of interaction among crooks and police. They are suspicious and ruthless and absolutely great. The down side is having a hell of a lot of sympathy for anyone. Leonardo DeCaprio's character is probably the most sympathetic but we know the fine line he is walking and that disturbs us. There is so much graphic violence and disrespect for humanity that it's at times hard to like it. Still, it never stops, right up to it's dramatic finish."
dodrade,"Aug 18, 2007",N/A,"Before I saw the Departed I knew it was a remake of Infernal Affairs, so I expected the basic plot to be the same.What I did not expect was for Scorsese to shamelessly copy Infernal Affairs practically scene for scene, word for word in some places.All Scorsese does is change the title, the setting, the characters names, add 50 superfluous minutes, two unnecessary characters and a cop out ending.Scorsese is a great director and deserved an Oscar long ago, but for him to accept an academy award for this outrageous piece of plagiarism is a disgrace.The really sad thing is that so many people have watched and will watch this thinking its a good original thriller, unaware that they are watching a cheap imitation of a truly great Hong Kong film.So please do yourself a favour and watch Infernal Affairs first, only then will you realise what a sham the Departed really is."
jhall_moviereviews,"Jan 27, 2021",10/10,"Absolute classic. Even tho the movie is a remake Martin sure picked a great one to remake bcuz the original Hong Kong flick (Infernal Affairs) was good as well it's just that Scorsese had Americanized it. Great cast everyone was perfect for thier roles especially Leo, Damon, and Jack. This movie is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time. I remember watching it when it first came out to buying the dvd to watching it today online I try to watch it at least once a year it's replay value is super high a film you will never get tired of watching regularly it's just that damn good. Definitely deserving of all the awards it won. It's Scorese best film imo and he's got a lot of classics in this gangster crime action thriller genre. If you haven't seen it yet you must be living under a rock everyone knows about this movie quit waiting and watch it ASAP you will be amazed especially you younger guys who's just getting into the scorsese genre you too will find it too a masterpiece of film making."

alexkolokotronis,"Feb 3, 2009",10/10,"The Departed is a great film to say the least. The film centers around an entire police department's chase of a top boss in Boston. The plot may not seem original but the film gives you a feeling of something new with the intensity of that of a drama and the awe of an action flick.The acting of the cast all around is great with the likes of actors such as Leonardo Dicaprio playing a rookie cop getting his first assignment. As a result of his family's history of criminal activity his first job is to be working undercover gathering intelligence in the dealings of a mob boss played different yet brilliantly by Jack Nicholson. This goes without notice as Nicholson has his man on the inside as well. On the opposite side of the spectrum Matt Damon also plays a rookie cop starting out of the box with a good job though as a result of his honorable family history. There also plenty of great supporting performances by Martin Sheen and Ray Winestone as well as a breakout performance given by Mark Wahlberg.Despite so many explosive performances this film is driven by its story so perfectly directed by Martin Scorsese. With this film Scorsese uses his skill to show the hard and gritty tough life on the streets as he once did so often as well as his fine attention to detail with amazing plot dynamics. What both of these things culminate into is a well rounded and balanced film with an unlimited scope of cops and gangsters. The depth of the film is limitless as it is so well layered. Scorsese here makes the film of his life here throwing out everything he has. Scorsese and William Monahan, who so adapts this film so vividly, combine for one of the most thrilling and psychologically explosive movies in ages as the film so perfectly illustrates nothing is as it seems as well as a chain is only as strong as strong as its weakest link. We may think we know it all from profile and background checks but as long as we don't know whats going on inside a person's mind we won't ever know what the person is truly about."
lastliberal,"Feb 18, 2007",8/10,"I started my day with 2046. I won't recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung (Mou gaan dou, Ying xiong), Li Gong (Miami Vice, Memoirs of a Geisha) and Ziyi Zhang Memoirs of a Geisha, Ying xiong). The music was excellent and Tony Leung's performance was spellbinding, but the movie was hard to follow.I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was on my mind as I watched The Departed, which is a remake of that film. I wish I had a copy with me to watch again and remind me of why it is such a favorite, but I have seen it enough times to know that it still stand above the new version.I just couldn't wait any longer, so I bought my copy yesterday and sat down with some chips to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent. I have never been a big fan of Leonardo. I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the top. Having said that, I can't really think of another character's performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning. It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film. The setup in the beginning was really a bore. Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas, one of my favorite films. I really don't see him winning an Oscar for this film, though they will probably give it to him for ignoring his earlier and better work."
valery-v-bentsianov,"Oct 6, 2006",7/10,"I know that it is not difficult to say that in every remake's case, but this one really got my hopes high. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case this time. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still great, it just falls below expectation. Yes, Di Caprio is great for the first time (he was good in some movies before, but here he is just superb). Nicholoson - is over the top, being 69 years old he is still much more charismatic and believable than his young rivals. The rest of the cast is just good, no flaws.Whenever they tried to stick to the original - everything worked great. For some unfortunate reason they decided to over-complicate already sophisticated screenplay - and spoiled it. There are some unnecessary characters creating the mess, some FBI storyline in the movie that only God knows what that was intended for. And also the ending - I do not know, ending in the Hong-Kong movie was reasonable and understandable, here it is basically the same - but messy. In the original all of the characters had very clear reasons for everything they did, and they lost it here.My biggest problem with that one is that in the original neither one of the main 2 characters was either complete bastard or saint - and here they actually made it black and white.And no, don't forget about Taxi Driver:) this one is very good (especially if you have not seen the original), but not great."
anassaleh-56714,"Nov 8, 2020",8/10,"A great watch, very enjoyable with many plot twists!"
OrrinBob,"Jan 3, 2014",6/10,"Maybe it deserves a 7. It is quite to very suspenseful, with a valuably complex but not arcane plot, well-made, solidly acted (meaning in part that Jack Nicholson does not just re-enact his job as the Joker. DiCaprio was better in Blood Diamond.) The cast is indeed stunning.But right now it is ranked above such trivial fare as Citizen Kane, The Shining, North by Northwest, M, Vertigo, To Kill a Mockingbird, Eternal Sunshine, Bicycle Thieves...(citing only a few whose lower ranks make me want to vomit). I know I am beating a dead horse. It probably is, after all, better than Shawshank (dumb fanboy movie of the world, I guess), Cuckoo's Nest, Inception, Forrest Gump, and arguably 5 to 15 others in the top 46.But it has limited to no imagination and makes no contribution to film history. Its best picture Oscar should've gone to Pan's Labyrinth, or Volver, or conceivably The Lives of Others, or Letters from Iwo Jima, or Little Miss Sunshine--three to five other films to rank ahead of Departed. I haven't yet seen Infernal Affairs, so I can't make that comparison. But in a nutshell, I know Taxi Driver and Departed is no Taxi Driver (#68. Makes me nuts.)"
axk-546-486568,"Oct 4, 2009",N/A,"I understand why you may think this film is good. Just the fact you didn't know about the original movie made in Hong Kong. The Departed cannot even compare to the original - Infernal Affairs. It is like watching a TV movie with seriously bad acting, bad direction, crap music. I can't find anything good about this movie apart from the stolen story line. Are you people blind or something? The story has been changed in parts for the worst. There is no style whatsoever to this film. All I can say is that its the most disappointing remake of a foreign film I have ever seen. Watch the original trilogy to enjoy story telling at its best. Scorsese??? Please!! U have no idea....."
akashgandikota,"Aug 30, 2020",10/10,An endlessly entertaining film that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The performances are pitch perfect and Scorsese's mastery shines throughout.
muchopotalcantara,"Sep 13, 2024",10/10,"The Departed is a gripping crime thriller and a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. Set in Boston, the film weaves a complex narrative of undercover operations and double lives.The story centers on two moles: Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), an undercover cop infiltrating the mob led by the notorious Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a corrupt police officer who is secretly working for Costello. As both men navigate their dangerous double lives, the tension escalates as their paths inevitably cross, leading to a high-stakes game of cat and mouse.Scorsese's direction is sharp and intense, and the film is praised for its tight screenplay, intricate plot twists, and strong performances from its cast. Nicholson's portrayal of the manipulative mob boss adds a menacing edge to the film, while DiCaprio and Damon deliver compelling performances as the conflicted protagonists.The Departed explores themes of identity, loyalty, and deception, and is known for its suspenseful narrative and memorable dialogue. The film won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, cementing its place as a modern classic in the crime genre."
arminazizian,"Dec 29, 2015",9/10,"This is as great of a movie as you can get. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most complete movies of the 2000s. The story-line is engaging, breathtaking, and genius. The cinematography is what you would expect from an Scorsese movie, and directing is top notch. It won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Writing, and Best Editing to back that claim. Then comes the cast of absolute all-stars. DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Baldwin. In today's movies, it seems like every time too many starts are placed in a movie, it backfires, but not in a Scorsese movie. DiCaprio delivered an Oscar-deserving performance, and was absolutely robbed by the Academy. Nicholson once again proved to everyone why he is one of the best actors of all time, as if anyone would disagree. Damon was great, although he struggled a bit to establish himself in accordance to his character's personality, however, he was able to pull it off one way or another and complete the story. Whalberg was as usual his own self, and somehow his personality translated perfectly to his character. Overall, it was a great all around effort by every actor in the movie, even those who didn't receive much screen time to prove that the casting was flawless. The story developed well, providing the essential back-story and taking the time to develop each character thoroughly. Although it seemed as if the ending was slightly rushed (even though this was a two and a half hour movie), the climax with all its plot twists unfolded as smoothly as the director intended. This is a must see movie for any fan of Crime/Drama/Thriller movies. It is also captures some of the best performances by all the main actors, whose fans can not go on without watching.-apologies for not putting the time to proof read this review."
LukeFord02,"Apr 14, 2020",10/10,The cast in this film speaks for itself. DiCaprio and Matt Damon give such a compelling performance and showcase the corruption of the police force. The film manages to also include 3 or 4 twists in places you do not expect and this shows the courage and confidence that Scorsese has as a director. The film is bold and gruesome but is told in such an intriguing way. Jack Nicholson and Ray Winstone are both great and entertain their roles superbly. However i believe that the best actor in this movie is Mark Wahlberg and his role in the film becomes the most important.
RubenMovies,"Jul 3, 2022",9/10,"From a screenplay point of view it doesn't get any better. The acting is perfect, the star cast absolutely delivers.And what a story!! It's hard to say something about the movie without giving things away.So the advice here is WATCH IT; it's an excellent movie."
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Oct 20, 2024",9/10,"This is one of those movies I sometimes fear I'll grow out of, but it never seems to happen. The characters say some things in The Departed that I don't think would be written into a screenplay today, but it otherwise holds up incredibly well. And you can acknowledge the dialogue, to some extent, being critical of overly macho meat heads. Martin Sheen's clean-cut character never says anything terrible, after all (from memory).I generally like the way it expands the tighter (and arguably more stylish) Infernal Affairs and lets the actors go nuts with some big, broad, beefy material here. It does feel like this would've been a strangely fun movie to make, which is humorously at odds with the way most of the characters in this seem to be having a pretty terrible time (Jack Nicholson's Frank aside).This movie is like watching the preparation and then knocking over of dominoes for two and a half hours, all edited magnificently and presented bombastically. I think this is Martin Scorsese at his most crowd-pleasing, and it's a testament to his skills that he can make something this accessible while still making sure it all feel like a Scorsese film. I love seeing a movie balance a bunch of unlikely things at once and The Departed does just that. And it's pretty relentless for the most part, with very few parts that even come close to feeling slow.It's the sort of movie that's never quite as fun the second time around (once you know where everything's going and can no longer be shocked), but it's still a fun ride of a movie worth revisiting every now and then. It's not one of the director's very best films, but it's better than most other director's very best film."
akdjreview,"Dec 29, 2021",7/10,"The Departed is an overused concept we have seen in so many films before. If it weren't for great performances by Dicaprio, Nicholsen, even Wahlberg and a few twists that were shocking this film would be boring. The departed was a disappointment but it had a few moments that kept it interesting. I still recommend you watch it but it's not great."
senyoritademomo,"Sep 13, 2024",10/10,"Performances: The performances in The Departed are exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a raw and emotional portrayal of Costigan, capturing his internal struggle and fear with remarkable depth. Matt Damon provides a nuanced performance as Sullivan, portraying his character's duplicity with subtlety and skill. Jack Nicholson's performance as Frank Costello is both charismatic and terrifying, adding a volatile energy to the film. The supporting cast, including Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin, contribute significantly to the film's impact, each bringing their own strengths to the ensemble."
trancer96,"Jun 26, 2011",3/10,"I expected a lot from this movie based on its high IMDb rating and big names on both side of the camera but it just didn't work. Most it comes down to lazy execution; average acting, directing and script writing from people you expect better. This movie should have been a tense mole-hunt thriller but there was no attempt to give the viewer any suspense. There were no surprises and no reason to care about the fate of any of the characters. As if that wasn't enough, the soundtrack did nothing to help the atmosphere of the movie and the ending was rather unsatisfying. I wouldn't go so far as to recommend avoiding this movie - just don't expect anything great. Not a patch on the Hong Kong original."

kevin_robbins,"May 5, 2023",10/10,"The Departed (2006) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows two young men who grew up on the mean streets of Boston with troubled pasts and shady associates. They both register for the police academy and have two different experiences with one being put on the fast track to promotion and leadership and the other being dragged through the mud, sent to jail and placed on a secret undercover mission. As they head in opposite directions their paths are bound to cross again...This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese (Casino) and stars
Leonardo DiCaprio (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), Matt Damon (Goodwill Hunting), Jack Nicholson (The Shining), Martin Sheen (Apocalypse Now), Anthony Anderson (Hot Tub Time Machine) and Alec Baldwin (It's Complicated).The cast for this picture is absolutely amazing and everyone delivers a tremendous performance. This is likely one of the greatest casts ever assembled. The storyline and script is perfectly written. The back story of each character is perfectly developed, the dialogue illustrated the knots inside the characters and how the inner demons impact their decisions and direction. Nicholson is a perfect villain, and his cunning and ruthlessness is entertaining in itself. The narration is legendary, and the ending is both shocking and rewarding.Overall, this is an all time great picture that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and consider it a must see."
kjarvis1212,"Jan 10, 2016",10/10,"Martin Scorsese, perhaps the greatest American film director of all- time, delivers in a major way with The Departed. The movie represents a return to the material that made him a superstar in the first place. And the result is one of the best American crime dramas ever made. Aided by a brilliant script (William Monahan), and an outstanding ensemble cast, Scorsese is in top form here. It should be noted that The Departed is technically a remake of the Chinese action hit, Infernal Affairs, unseen by me. It also uses the true story of infamous Boston mobster Whitey Bulger as a template for the Jack Nicholson character. But I think it would do the film and the viewer a disservice to think of it as a Bulger picture. It is not. It is its own story with its own characters that stands on its own. The film opens with a young Matt Damon in a local diner, listening to Nicholson's notorious local gangster spouting off in his own poetically vulgar way about how cops and crooks aren't so different. Instant flash forward to the future, and Damon's character is being sworn in as a Massachusetts state police officer. Meanwhile, so is another character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. We learn that Leo's character comes from a family with an unsavory, non-law-abiding past. He's confronted by his superior, Martin Sheen, and his sidekick, Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg might be the single most enjoyable aspect of the film, which is saying a lot. He steals nearly every scene he's in as a foul-mouthed, results-driven hothead. They present Leo's character with an ultimatum: quit the force, or join their undercover operation as a mole in Jack's gang. It's a risky proposition, but one they all know is feasible, including Leo. On paper, he'll quit the force and get back into crime, including an assault conviction and a short jail sentence. Then work his way into the Nicholson character's world. At the same time, Damon's character has been handpicked to run a top secret task force out to snag Jack once and for all. But it appears he's still in Jack's debt. One cop who's really a gangster pretending to be a cop, and another who's really a cop pretending to be a gangster. What unfolds is an epic, wholly believable and ultimately satisfying tale about just how thin the line between good and bad can be. It's difficult to overstate the quality of the acting performances in this film. DiCaprio is incredible as a vulnerable savant looking for some sort of salvation, spending his spare time sitting next to a hospital bed occupied by his dying mother. Damon delivers a strong performance as the wormy overachiever who says all the right things and shacks up with the department's psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga in a very effective performance). Alec Baldwin has some great lines in a small but solid role as one of the squad commanders. Sheen is perfect as the wise and cautious bureau chief (or something like that). When Scorsese has material like this, as in Goodfellas or Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Mean Streets, its as if he's transported to another time and place that allows him to tell the story with an impeccable sense for placement, color, angle, emphasis, and tone. It's like watching Michael Jordan or Jimi Hendrix. It's a special thing when an artist has such control over their craft. If you're the sort of person who likes a well-written, impeccably acted crime drama, and for some inexplicable reason have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and see it."
damlacivici,"Aug 8, 2022",8/10,The acting of Jack Nicholson and Leonardo Dicaprio was brilliant! Love the movie. Scenario and montage was perfect. Amazing cast. Definitely goes to my fave lists.
robmar915,"Aug 4, 2023",10/10,"Another score for Scorsese with this all-star cast in The Departed. The Departed is loosely based on the real-life Whitey Bulger and the Boston Winter Hill gang. Jack Nicholson delivers one of his best performances yet as crime boss Frank Costello. Leonardo DiCaprio also delivers another outstanding performance as William Costigan Jr. An undercover cop who joins Costello's (Nicholson) crew in an attempt to bring down Costello for the many crimes committed throughout the Boston area. Matt Damon stars as Collin Sullivan a dirty cop who was mentored by Costello and joins the Boston Police Department to help further his criminal activity. This is a wild ride from beginning to end filled with cops, crooks, moles and rats."

44to852,"Oct 15, 2006",6/10,"Stylish, Exciting, Thrilling, ORIGINAL..! Oh Sorry I'm talking about Infernal Affairs! So you already know now that I do not feel positive about this remake. This isn't the standard expected from the guy who we loved after Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino & GOOD FELLA's... All I will say is the film just attach's clustered elements of the original. The characters psychology is seriously weak compared to 'IA' but even if we do not compare the 2, The Departed just doesn't make much sense and is (I really am choosing my words carefully here) LAZY! Who, What, Where, When, Why? There is too much talking, too much unnecessary scenarios, too much confusion on the characters - the film dived straight into the characters and not revealing why Damon becomes a cop! Things just happen in this film. There is no sense of compassion towards DiCaprio unlike Tony Leungs portrayal. I really respect Andy Lau, he was very polite to rate this boring 2hr+ film 8 out of 10.. The only thing he did comment on was the character psychology.. Now I know why! *Sometimes you don't need to try so hard to be effective* As Infernal Affairs was effortlessly cool. Departed , even with Jack Nicholson is just Painfully Bad! Slow paced, not much happens, audiences do not feel too involved, Overall Poor Remake or a Classic!"

hazzaboombatty,"May 18, 2022",10/10,"I didn't see this in cinemas when it came out, but I've watched it many times since then. And as it got the Oscar, people denigrated it and said it was Scorsese's worst film (at the time). I never agreed with that.One thing is for sure, this film is starting to look more and more like a masterpiece as time goes on, while at the same time the quality of films in the streaming era just continues to plummet.I'm not going to bother going into the various things this film does well, but sufficed to say you could do a lot worse than watch this for the 3rd.. 6th.. 10th time. It's such a great ride, I love it!"
jnelso19,"Dec 23, 2012",10/10,"Yea that's right, I made an A-Team reference regarding The Departed. Despite the quality differences between these media stories, this film went exactly as planned. So when Brad Pitt and his production company Plan B decided to help remake a Chinese classic, they decided to go all out. Aside from getting the great Martin Scorsese on board to direct and William Monahan to write an excellent script, they felt like it wasn't enough. They hired Leo and an All-Star cast that could only be matched by a corny romantic comedy (Valentine's Day). Then as they say, the rest worked out itself. The acting was superb with Leo leading the way along with Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson not far behind. Not to mention the ten other actors who did their jobs well and when it was all said and done. Mr. Scorsese didn't get denied and he finally won his Oscar. Plus he found his new De Niro with Leo and with this and Shutter Island, the future looks bright as long as Scorsese is still kicking."
Dr-Conejo90210,"Jan 12, 2016",10/10,"'The Departed' is an American crime-thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese ('Taxi Driver', 'Good Fellas'). The film gives us a poignant look at a fictional war on drugs fought by the Boston Police Department against an Irish-rooted mob led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), with his protégé, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) helping him from the inside of the police force while Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio) helps the police department by infiltrating Costello's mob.The story takes place in Boston, following the lives of Billy Costigan, an undercover cop of the Boston Police Department, who is at a crossroads in his life, having just lost all close relatives and with no clear direction in his life, as he infiltrates Costello's mob, and Colin Sullivan, who from a very young age has been the protégé of Costello and who now works for the Boston Police Department, providing Frank with information. As the story unfolds, we see the consequences the characters have to deal with by leading a double life. We watch them as they blur the lines of what's right or wrong, and we get to see just how far they are willing to go to protect what they've built, and to get what they want.In typical Scorsese fashion, the director dwells into the moral aspect of their characters, exploring the kind side of the villain and the dark side of the heroes. The cast is on point through-out all the movie, with the performances by Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg being particularly fascinating.One of the strongest points of the film it's is pace, with the story developing in a fast-pace, leaving no dead-time on screen for the viewer to lose attention. One major critic of the film is that it doesn't follow the original, Infernal Affairs, too closely. While this may be true to some extent, it could very well be attributed to the fact that the original is a three-part saga; it's a given that some of the story it's bound to be lost in the process of condensing three movies into one.While it released more than twenty years into the career of director Scorsese, 'The Departed' is a solid film, with a story that will keep you at the edge of your seat, that's going to keep you guessing as of what's going to happen next. If you're in the mood for a film with a fast-paced, thrilling story, fleshed-out characters and superb acting, then 'The Departed' is a must-see."
muswellmaniac,"Jul 23, 2022",9/10,I don't care what anyone says but this is one of the best movies ever. Leonardo di'caprio pulls off an S tier performance but in my opinion the best performance is Mark Wallberg this movie made his career and gave the movie lot's of depth and tention another great performance is Jack Nickleson even at his age he still brings a sublime performance.My only anger with this movie is Matt Damion because his acting was slightly 1 dimensional which I am sure is not his fault but did disappoint me a bit.
preppy-3,"Jun 2, 2008",8/10,"Film takes place in Boston. It deals with two men (Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon) who are both working to bring down a crime lord (Jack Nicholson). Problem is they're both working for different agencies and neither knows about the other. Things quickly go out of control.OK--this is not Martin Scorsese's best film. That goes to ""Raging Bull"" and ""Good Fellas"". However it is one of his best. The plot has many twists and turns and surprises I didn't see coming. There's excellent use of music throughout and Scorsese really manages to capture the mood and feeling of Boston (not easy to do). Also--since this is a Scorsese film--the word ""f***"" is used a few hundred times and the violence is VERY extreme and bloody. This isn't for weak stomaches. My only complaints here are that the movie is too long--it has one climax too many and some lousy acting lessens it. DiCaprio is excellent in his role. I was very impressed--I never thought much of him as an actor but now I've changed my opinion. Nicholson, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are good too. Vera Farmiga holds her own in a male dominated cast. But Matt Damon is a blank in one of the main roles. His face never changes expression and I didn't know how to take him. Mark Wahlberg is bad too. How he got an Academy Award nomination for this I'll never know. He's as blank as Damon and just swears non stop for no reason and keeps giving obscene finger gestures. I was just hoping somebody would kill him off soon. He wasn't playing a character--he was doing a caricature. Those two bad performances lessen this. Also some of the cast fake Boston accents pretty well (Damon and Wahlberg are from the area so they didn't have to fake it).It got Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards because Martin Scorsese was long overdue for both. So--it is worth seeing but not Scorsese's best by a long shot. I give it an 8."
mstomaso,"Feb 12, 2007",8/10,"The best cast of the year 2007 makes this Americanized adaptation of an original Hong Kong film (Internal Affairs) shine. William Monahan's adapted screenplay has been nominated for an Academy Award, the film is nominated for best picture, Scorsese for best director, and there are a couple other nominations out - somewhat inexplicably including Mark Wahlburg for supporting actor for his roles in this film. Wahlburg's performance, though excellent, is really little more than a cameo, and he has actually done better work (e.g. his roles in The Yards and Perfect Storm). But the Academy won't give him an Oscar for this, especially since he is up against a few Academy favorites and a veteran (Arkin). While I do not think this is Scorsese's best film, nor the best film of the year, it is one of the finest serious crime thrillers I have seen in a very long time.The film is set in Boston, and relies on stereotypes of that city and its ethnic groups that only slightly detract from the film's believability. Despite the fertile ground for psychological examination, the film's slightly absurd pace (DiCaprio becomes a trusted confidant of a crime boss in 3-4months???) the film is not a character study, and, rather, relies on archetypes of good cop/bad cop which are employed pretty consistently and to varying degrees throughout the film.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a performance that exceeds his own high standards, opposite Matt Damon in a life and death cat and mouse game. DiCaprio is undercover for the police infiltrating organized crime, Damon is undercover for an organized crime boss (Nicholson) infiltrating the police. Vera Farmiga is excellent as the police psychologist who ends up connected to both. Damon also gives a nice, edgy, though a little detached performance, and stalwarts Nicholson, Baldwin and Sheen do some of their best work in years. The Boston accents only occasionally slip into exaggeration (and surprisingly - are only over-done by actors who have lived in Boston!).The acting is generally outstanding. The cinematography is above average - there are too many straight pans and rhythmic fast cuts, but the action is always well framed and nicely emphasized by the camera. The direction is, as with most Scorsese work, tight, economical and clean. The script is excellent, and, in my opinion, is likely to give Babel a run for its money for the adapted screenplay Oscar. Contrary to some opinions I have seen here, I did not feel that the soundtrack added much to the film. In fact, if I were to fault the film for anything it would be sound.Excellent film, well worth seeing if you can handle the nihilism and violence it portrays."
mike-2077,"Sep 30, 2006",9/10,"Scorsese at his best. The 150 minutes seems like 90. Stella cast. Jack Nicholson - got to be an Oscar Nominated performance. Leonardo DiCaprio as you have never seen him before. Brilliantly written. Magnificently Directed. Fabulous Photography. And Matt Damon - no more Mr Nice Guy..... A must see movie - A+. Let no one tell you about the film, see it and enjoy it. The film is well paced - it does not have the usually present it most films of 150 minutes plus duration that sagging spot - no way could you cut a frame of this film. Well placed for the awards season and I think this is going to pull a bunch of them, and deservedly so. At last an intelligent movie to grace the cinema screens this year."
PoisonKeyblade,"Feb 11, 2007",8/10,"From what I had heard, The Departed was supposed to be an amazing flick, but it really ended up being just a little above average. I was one of the big supporters of the film at the beginning. I had people all around saying, ""That looks so bad,"" but I knew it looked like a great movie. How can you possibly go wrong with a cast consisting of Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nickolson, and Mark Wahlberg? First off, the performances were probably what made this movie. If not for the sensational acting, The Departed just would not be worth watching. Leonardo was great as the lead, and Jack Nickolson was classic as the crime boss. Matt Damon was good, but he didn't really play that big of a part until the very end. However, the performance that really stood out here was that of Mark Wahlberg. He REALLY proved he can act here with an incredibly memorable character.The plot felt like something new, and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. However, I had many issues with the film. For one, the ending made me want to throw up. One of the worst endings to a film I've ever seen! Secondly, there were just too many plot elements that were left wide open and many things that were never given any explanation whatsoever.The Departed was good, but if you want to see an amazing crime movie, stick with Alpha Dog. Alpha Dog is underrated, so you won't really know what to expect."

sanjanapatnaik,"Dec 12, 2022",6/10,"What a waste of time. One small twist which isn't even worth it in the end- otherwise a typical cop and mole story. Doesn't deserve the level of appreciation it gets, so many better movies at a lower rating.Although the acting wasn't terrible, I cannot fathom how anyone gave this an Oscar. The story was fast moving but concluded in about five minutes in the end and not even in a satisfactory way. Maybe it was interesting or novel back in the day.If someone is making you watch this cause it's 'the best move ever', think again. Go through your wish list again and rethink how you wanna spend your time."

shawnmikedryer,"Dec 30, 2020",10/10,"In this crime drama triumph, Billy Costigan, an undercover police officer in South Boston is tasked with infiltrating the biggest Irish-American crime syndicate Boston has ever seen. He must pose as just another bad man as he attempts to gain the trust of the syndicates leader, Frank Costello. More secrets are come to light when we learn Colin Sullivan is more of a hardened criminal than the appears as he is in a position of power in The Special Investigations unit with ties to Costello is in fact a mole and feeding Costello every bit of information that could harm his business. Both totally consumed by they're double lives afflicting them, they are suddenly in grave danger of being discovered by the enemy. It's now a race against time for either Billy or Colin to uncover the secrets of each other before the two meet untimely demises. What a firecracker those last few scenes are!"
refresh_daemon,"Oct 8, 2006",8/10,"I watched The Departed the day after it's general release. While watching, I tried to set aside thoughts of the move it's a remake of, Infernal Affairs, aside to be able to assess the movie clearly. Now, I haven't seen Infernal Affairs in a while, so this wasn't too hard to do, however, since I was privy to plot foreknowledge, nothing was all too surprising.Since I'd lived in Boston for three years, it was quite a treat to get to see that city again (well, some of it wasn't Boston, but enough of it was). The presence of the Yankee accent was okay, although I honestly wished that some of the less successful users had just gone without the accent altogether, because having it come and go sort of dropped me out of believability at times. There are enough long-time Boston natives that don't have it, that it wouldn't be weird for someone to lack the accent.Almost all of the performances were overwhelmingly solid. At times Nicholson and Baldwin seemed to go a little too over-the-top, but it was forgivable. The direction was canny, careful and generally nuanced. Scorsese has always been an able director of actors and pulled out performances and matched it with an eye for visual that's both invisible, yet entirely specific at the same time.I did have some issues with the film. First of all, Nicholson's character got too much screen time. He's not the emotional center of the film and a lot of what we see of him throughout the film may do a fine job of characterizing him as a badass devil-man, but we get that at the start. We need to focus on DiCaprio and Damon's characters and their stories (they are the centerpoint to the film); adding in all this excess Jack actually detracts from the film. The film's already a little bloated, running 2.5 hours, so a little chopping of extraneous scenes would've been good.The ending was another problem. It all came a little too fast and was a little ridiculous--causing the audience to burst out in laughter--when Scorsese should've taken a little care to lead the emotions to that point. And then there's also the groan-inducing last shot--that really just took the ridiculousness of the end over the top.So, what needed to be done to the ending? More attention needed to be paid to the moles. Towards the end of the film, DiCaprio's Billy comes across as wanting out so much that there's little motive for him to do what he does. The lack of motive leads to a lack of believability. I think focusing a little more on Billy and how the life of crime is breaking him down would've helped the drama, especially towards the end. This also goes for Damon's Colin. The impact of the life of being a good guy on his life really should've played a bigger impact. The events towards the end partially don't make sense because there's not enough motive for him to do what he does with Jack's Costello. Since his characterization breaks down towards the end, the finale just doesn't have a whole lot of resonance.This movie really needed to be more about these two characters, even with the intricate plot. That's where the core of the drama should've been focused, but the attention of the film was spread too thin to allow the end to be convincing.Now I'm going to start comparing with Infernal Affairs:* The encapsulation of the two female characters from Infernal Affairs into one had a lot of potential. In IA, the female characters seemed less whole. Unfortunately, the Departed doesn't give her enough attention to pull any real drama. This is made worse by some cheap dramatics thrown in via a photograph and made a little ridiculous by the change in relationship between her and Billy, which wasn't really believable based on her characterization.* Although I liked Walhberg's performance, his character wasn't necessary. The only reason for Dignam to even exist is to create the American ending. This is where Infernal Affairs manages to get it better. It better crafts a relationship between Leung's Chan (DiCaprio's Billy) and his police boss--the boss is the only one who knows and so when the later events occur, it's that much more devastating--and gives sufficient motivation for Chan/Billy to do what they do in the finale. It also prevents the believability hole that Billy wouldn't seek Dignam after those events.* And this is another place where Infernal Affairs shines--the focus on the two moles. The movie really explores how pretending to be someone else can affect the way someone thinks and behaves. Chan is just as desperate as Billy to get out, but Chan also keeps a better eye for justice, despite his problems. Likewise, Lau's character (Damon's Colin) has to grapple with the life afforded him by being a goody-two shoes and figure out just where his loyalties lie and why. This leads Infernal Affairs' ending to be more effective than the Departed's, because it's not cheap and the impact of Lau's decision weighs with him even after the credits roll. No one laughs at the end of Infernal Affairs.* The Departed doesn't have Infernal Affairs' flash and bang, but that works to its advantage--it's restraint, at least stylistically really helps what drama it has. Having come from a long tradition of Hong Kong films, the style pushes melodrama at times in IA.All complaints aside, The Departed really is still quite an enjoyable film. The craftsmanship of all involved is highly polished and immensely engaging. Even though they share the same base, Infernal Affairs and the Departed are both different films, although they could've learned something from each other. The Departed is really good, but it lacks the resonance needed to bring it to the level of Scorsese's more notable works. 8/10."
Superunknovvn,"Dec 8, 2006",10/10,"It's hard to start a review about a movie when you're still so excited you don't know where to begin. Let's take a deep breath for a moment... okay, and here we go:Although he was snubbed by the Academy over and over again Scorsese never stopped working on ambitious projects. He just kept making movies, and they were all solid and good. Still, somehow Scorsese's work lost the importance and the excitement of the director's best movies. ""The Departed"" brings back a Scorsese that glues your eyes to the screen, that makes you forget time and space around you. This is a film that keeps you thrilled for the entire two and a half hours running time.Truth be told, Scorsese doesn't reinvent himself with this movie. The violence, the callous dialog and the soundtrack including ""Gimme Shelter"" and other classic songs from the 60's and 70's - none of that is new territory. Still, it's a hell of a treat to watch the master at work. There's no one who makes a gangster movie like Scorsese. He understands exactly what the story needs, how it needs to be paced. Scorsese's direction serves the plot and not the other way round, which is what sets ""The Departed"" apart from some of his other masterpieces such as ""Raging Bull"".Quite a lot of movieshave five, six or seven top stars in their casting list. In the end you're often let down because some of them don't really have important roles or only very limited screen time. In this movie all of the big names make something of their role: Mark Wahlberg as the amazingly unfriendly but unbribable cop, Martin Sheen as Nicholson's opponent and DiCaprio's father figure, Alec Baldwin as the frustratingly idiotic boss and Matt Damon as the slippery traitor. The two actors that make ""The Departed"" what it is, however, are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio.Jack Nicholson is just Jack Nicholson. He does what he always does, which means that he's great. He was born to play the bad guy. It's quite amazing that he hadn't worked with Scorsese before and it's like a fanboy's dream come true to see their collaboration working out so well. One can't help thinking: ""What if DeNiro had played the part?"". Sure, that might have been interesting, too, but it's doubtable whether DeNiro would have been able to pull off a villain as clownish and sexed up as Frank Costello.Speaking of DeNiro, Leonardo DiCaprio clearly has proved himself a more than worthy successor as Scorsese's steady collaboration partner. His performance as the tormented undercover cop is once again outstanding. His hounded look alone creates half of the movies' tension. It's quite amazing how versatile this little babyface is. ""The Departed"" should convince even the last skeptics of this guy's talents.At the age of 64 and after movie classics as legendary and influential as ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"" and ""GoodFellas"", Martin Scorsese has delivered one of the very best movies of his entire career. Its characters may not be as iconic as the ones from the movies mentioned above, but the superb storytelling and the amazing acting in ""The Departed"" make this nothing less than a true masterpiece. It's Oscar-time, Baby!"
ejacobs23,"Jan 2, 2016",6/10,"Has there ever been a film with a better cast than this? I can't think of one. Comment if you can. The acting in this is amazing and every actor did their job. I think this is Leonardo's best performance. He did it so well and it was actually like he was the character and not actually performing. The music is awesome. Especially Shipping Up to Boston which is done by one of my all-time favourite bands @dropkickmurphys. The song was the perfect choice for the film and they played it at just the right times. The plot is ingenious and Scorsese directed it superbly. This film even managed to be better than Infernal Affairs, which is what this film was based upon. I love the opening scene with Jack Nicholson's monologue and it really set the film for what was to come. The film also had it funny moments (thanks to Mark Walberg). This film is extremely entertaining and I love the characters. There is nothing to complain about in this film and I could and probably will watch this over and over again. One of the best this century. I was actually sad when this film was finishing because I didn't want it to end. Acting: 10/10 Dialogue: 10/10 Plot: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Entertainment Value: 10/10"
SnoopyStyle,"Mar 1, 2015",8/10,"Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston Irish mobster. He mentors Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) ever since as a little kid. Eventually Colin joins the Special Investigation Unit in the State Police headed by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the unpleasant Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). He works directly under Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). He begins a relationship with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a new police recruit from a family of lowlife criminals. Queenan and Dignam put him undercover. After serving some time in prison, he works with his petty criminal cousin Sean (Kevin Corrigan) and catches the eye of Sullivan's henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone).Director Martin Scorsese goes to Boston to film this gangster opera. The cast is second to none. There is great acting being done here. Leo is terrific holding up even against the peacock acting of Nicholson. Winstone is powerfully rough. Damon is twisting his sweet persona into something a bit more of a douche. There is a bit too much plot and sometimes, the movie tries to do too many things. For example, Scorsese doesn't need some of the camera moves or the back and forth editing which only distracts from staying with the plot. It may work even better with a simplified style. This movie is best at its bloody brutal core especially with Leo acting up a storm."

cinemapersonified,"Jun 13, 2023",9/10,"Rating: 9.4
Overall, a movie that is a must watch, even with its small faults, as it uses Boston wit and humor laced into a story and screenplay to show the effects trauma and crime can have on people stuck in the rat race as the push through through what is ethical, in what is a Martin Scorsese masterpiece.Incredible Direction, Incredible Acting (Incredible from the cast as a whole (Standouts being Leonardo DiCaprio (in his 2nd best role behind Wolf), Mark Walburg, and Jack Nicholson (Even though its pretty over-the-top))), Incredible Story (Filled with symbols of the dark nature of the subject manner (the quest of the rat)), Incredible Screenplay (Mixes humor and trauma extremely effectively), Decent Cinematography (Not a huge fan of the still cuts edited with the shifting cinematography), Decent Editing (See cinematography), Plot Structure was good for the most part (but the beginning was a bit hard to understand (but can get past this after the first 20-30 mins)), Pacing was generally good but there are some slower parts meant for character development (not a huge problem); The movie was a bit on the longer side but there really isn't that many scenes that could be cut (so it gets a pass), Build to the climax is incredible with the ending being extremely suspenseful and unpredictable."
turdferguson1000,"May 29, 2007",10/10,"""The Departed"" is right up there. I can't think of any other movie besides ""Pulp Fiction"" that had me glued to the screen like ""The Departed"". It has a great plot with fantastic acting. If you can get over Leonardo Dicaprio playing his type of role then you will at least like the movie a little bit. I know its hard to imagine him doing this type of role, but he really has evolved as an actor over the years. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. I'm not one of those guys that is going to get all technical. But this movie is real with real conflicts(especially Dicaprio). Marky Mark, Nicholson, Damon, Sheen, even Alec Baldwin played their parts well. Simply one of the best."
karlhinze,"Apr 1, 2007",8/10,"I think that one or two of the performances from the lead actors were overrated.Matt Damon, for me, seems to fluctuate between good and bad performances. He was great in The Talented Mr Ripley and The Bourne Identity/Supremacy. But I thought this was one of his worse films. His acting seemed quite wooden and forced, and I don't think he was comfortable in his role of a boyfriend.I also think that, early on, Jack Nicholson showed his age, although he did improve greatly as the film went on.On a positive note, Leonardo Di Caprio was outstanding. He's one of the most underrated and best actors around at the moment (he's come a long way since his teenage heart-throb status) and could quite easily have added this to his best actor nomination in the Oscars this year. This film would have struggled if it were not for Di Caprio.As far as the film in itself goes, I hadn't seen or heard much about the original Hong Kong version and was glad of it, as I could judge this solely on its own merit.It's thrilling, with so much suspense. Who's going to make a breakthrough first? Costello's men or the Police? I hadn't seen this before the Oscars, and at first I couldn't quite work out how on earth best Motion Picture didn't go to Little Miss Sunshine. But now I can understand why.All in all, simply brilliant."
harrylosborne,"Jan 23, 2021",8/10,"Scorcese does like himself an intricate plot, and The Departed arguably has one of the better storylines in film today, pitting two acting heavyweights against one another for 2.5 hours. Strong acting throughout this cast (DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Sheen etc.) helps push this story along, interspersed with some decent action and more than a few twists.There were points where I felt the story was lagging somewhat, and the romantic interest seemed overly forced to me. However, these were infrequent disturbances, and on the whole this cat-and-mouse story is better than most you will find today. On the whole, definitely one of my more preferred Scorsese flicks, and well worth sitting down and devoting attention on."
IamROCKAS,"Aug 21, 2022",7/10,"A good guy, playing the bad guy, or a bad guy, playing the good guy - who will prevail in a standoff like this? The answers (sort of) lie within this movie, though the narrative is more about them trying to ""out-rat"" each other. What did that lead to? Well, more casualties than anyone could expect, for one. It also resulted in a lot of hurt feelings. Finally, we were left with an ending that leaves quite a lot of questions, even though by that point we had almost all of the answers. If there's a message that this movie tried to deliver, I'd guess it would sound something like ""being a rat doesn't lead to any good"". Seeing the rat in the final shot also gives a similar impression.I don't know why but the ending was pretty blank for me. After losing one of the key characters, it started going downhill. It just felt like that meme when someone is aiming a gun at the person in front of them, while also having a gun pointed at themselves from the back and the guy in the back is also in the scope of the 4th person, getting ready to shoot him from the rafters. Rats were trying to keep their head above water, sacrificing other rats in the process, while someone from above tried to drown them all. The problem here is that all the rats only showed up when water began running from the faucet and that ""someone from above"" was absent. To explain it using a different metaphor - the movie was like a lit cigarette that required harder and more rushed breaths to finish. The twists didn't feel like twists because some of the characters involved in them were so minor and insignificant. The way it collapsed on itself was a bit of a letdown.Even though I didn't like how the final chapter unfolded, I can't say that about the rest of the movie. There were a lot of ups and downs that worked in favor of the rat in the gang or the rat in the special force. The central piece somehow ended up being a psychiatrist, who got involved with both of the rats. It's both a pity and a blessing that neither of them realized that they had their eyes on the same woman. I feel like her part in the story is monumental for both of the rats. Another key character that was monumental to both of these guys is Staff Sergeant Dignam. In a way, he's the secondary true protagonist in the story only made it clear in the end but throughout the movie, he's being a pest to both of the rats. By a pest, I mean he's a hard head that questions both of their intentions and he got into a fight with both of them. His choice of words when confronting them is entertaining as he cusses them out in ways a stereotypical cop with a short temper would but he does it a bit better. It's just too bad that his screen time was pretty much limited, though maybe more input from him would begin to get tiresome. What's worse is that he turned into a ghost for a good portion at the end of the movie. Like his reintroduction just barely made any sense for me. Just like what was in the psychiatrists' package that didn't get another mention. Though it probably is what led to Dinam reappearing, at least that's my guess, I just feel it wasn't explored enough.Overall, I liked the movie, even though the majority of my ramblings were about what I didn't like or didn't get. Hey, just a friendly reminder, if I didn't get it, it doesn't mean it's bad or it's wrong, there's always a possibility that I might have missed a thing or two. And I don't want those few scenes that I didn't like towards the latter end of the movie to speak for my whole impression of the movie. I guess that Scorsese's style and the formula he uses in his movies are just beginning to look a bit old for me and I find myself being less impressed with every movie of his that I watch. That may not be it but it's a thought that I'm beginning to have in my head. It's a movie that I'll need to rewatch again sometime under a different set of circumstances. Maybe I'll find it better then, maybe I'll find it worse but I'll likely feel about the same."
AlsExGal,"Jun 17, 2023",9/10,"Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a gangster of Irish heritage running crime in South Boston. The police are always trying to build a case against him but nothing sticks, so they enlist somebody who is training to be a cop, BIlly Costigan, to go undercover to get the goods on Costello. From a criminal transaction that is supposed to go down that does not, Billy does surmise that there is a rat in the State Police. And he'd be right, while the bad cop, Colin (Matt Damon) realizes that there is a rat in Costello's organization. But the records of who is undercover are off limits for everybody but the two police officers who recruited Costigan, so Colin is going to have to find out through old fashioned probing who the rat is. And so it goes for the rest of the film, with the undercover cop and the bad cop both trying to find out who the other is first, because finding out second would be too late. Complications as well as a police psychiatrist being lovers to both Colin and Billy - and not realizing who either of them truly is - ensues.There is something of a prologue with Irish mobster Frank Costello narrating about his environment, the Knights of Columbus, JFK and black people with the kind of language about the latter of which Disney would disapprove, but it's necessary to paint a picture of what kind of guy Costello is upfront.To me it's the fast food of Scorsese's catalog, but then everybody enjoys fast food from time to time. It does a great job of building tension and suspense, and there are good pay-offs for sticking to the end. Plus it is just plain fun to have a bunch of great actors running around shouting ""microprocessors"" in thick Boston accents."

JoshuaMHetu,"Sep 14, 2019",9/10,"""The Departed"" is arguably the greatest cop movie ever made, and certainly one of the best movies of the 2000s - period. What Scorsese did with this movie was masterful: he took a perfectly good crime thriller (the original ""Infernal Affairs"") and elevated it even higher to become a saga of class, race, betrayal, and ""families always rising and falling in America."" ""The Departed"" is one of the most hard-edged, dramatic, and gripping movies that I've ever seen, with a multi-layered story that keeps you coming back to the film again and again. I love the central premise, which takes classic Scorsese tropes like Catholic guilt and ethnic identity and fuses them with true crime history - Frank Costello, after all, is based on Boston's infamous Whitey Bulger.On a technical level this movie is outstanding: the direction, musical score, and cinematography are amazing - but nothing is more impressive to me than the editing. Thelma Schoonmaker well deserved the Oscar for Best Film Editing on ""The Departed,"" which might not have been half as good if not for Schoomaker's past pacing and experimental style. As always in a Scorsese picture the performances are phenomenal: everyone from Leo DiCaprio to Martin Sheen is on their A-game in this one. Though by far my favorite performance is Jack Nicholson as Costello - he brings together humor, sleaze, and menace simultaneously and it makes for a truly terrifying villain.The decision to set the film in Boston, where the movie's rich themes are deeply ingrained in the city's history, was brilliant. The casting of real-life Bostonians such as Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, and the choice of Dorchester's William Monahan as screenwriter, gives ""The Departed"" an authenticity that many other Boston-set movies lack. After watching this movie again I'll say that I do have a slight problem with the running time - you do sometimes feel the movie's two and a half hour length, and there's a handful of scenes that could either be cut down or removed entirely. But it by no means ruins the viewing experience, in fact despite its length ""The Departed"" remains endlessly entertaining.The fact that Scorsese took good material and made it even better is the reason why ""The Departed"" is perhaps the best remake ever made and certainly one of my favorite crime dramas. 10/10."
bobarino,"Jun 9, 2008",10/10,"If there was any doubt about Martin Scorsese's craft as a film director, The Departed silences any critic of his. However, if there was any doubt in the first place I highly suggest quitting movies. Scorsese delivers an epic in a time where movies are being churned out with no emotion, no connection to the viewer, and reliance on gimmicks so the studios can earn a little dough and taking the prized honor of being the number 1 listed movie on a 12 year old kid's myspace page.The Departed delivers in every facet. The cinematography is well crafted - the camera positions to grasp the scene in its fullest while avoiding being generic and also straying away from overly ""artsy"" camera angles that make the film unwatchable. In fact, The Departed is probably Scorsese's most rewatchable film. There are more twists than a Chubby Checker concert which will make you both gasp and let out sighs of relief.The characters are believable and engaging. Jack Nicholson plays one the most accessible of all the mob villains of Scorsese's past. He is complete slime, but his demeanor is that of an uncle who permits you to watch the TV shows that your parents told you not to. Matt Damon as Colin is like one of those pompous pricks who cheat repeatedly and get away with it, and Leo as Billy Costigan grows on the viewer and as a character through his dangerous line of work as a police informant.The Departed is an American masterpiece."
canadianfunkymunky,"Oct 27, 2006",10/10,"Absolutely awesome. I have had a hard time justifying going to spend the money on any of the garbage that has been coming out of Hollywood lately. But I made a serious point to go see this, something fresh from on old familiar face, or wait two, maybe three, or four, depends how old you are. One thing I think makes a great director is the use of inanimate objects as characters. If you haven't seen this film, watch the Boston State Capitol building appearances. It says more with no duologue than some entire scripts do. Some songs are used with more visual themes than others, but the audio counterpart to the eye-popping candy is so intense I just couldn't wait for the next scene to unfold. And as for Jack well, very very good, best I've seen him in full tilt since the shining. Many people are saying this is Tarantino Based. I am almost thirty, I remember pre-Tarantino. Well pop Tarantino that is, pre Pulp Fiction who knew about his hits, only a few in early years of high school had even watched reservoir dogs. What happened to him is he's gone Hollywood, who else would take such interest in splitting a feature like kill bill into 2 parts, oh yeah ticket sales, revenues, I say CUT IT! The departed said what it wanted to say, THE RAT GETS THE CHEESE! America today needs more films like this that don't have a happy ending, and expose the dirtier side of ""God's Country"".

I didn't particularly care for Matt Damon, but that has more to do with me not really liking his character. I liked Leo's character a lot more.This movie has the viewer navigating through all of the lies and deception. It plays out almost like a thriller where the audience is kept in suspense at all times over when certain characters are going to be clued in on vital pieces of information. It's the game of cat and mouse that both of the main characters play with each other that's very exciting to me. And both characters revolve around the sick and twisted actions of Jack Nicholson's character. The ""I smell a rat"" scene is so good.Definitely a recommended viewing from me. It's spectacular and easily one of Scorsese's finest films."
John_Truby,"Jan 7, 2010",N/A,"The Departed is very instructive in showing us how to write a crime thriller, and how not to. It starts with a terrific premise: cops and criminals have a mole in the each other's organization. But this is also a premise that is loaded with pitfalls. In the Great Screen writing Class, I talk extensively about how you develop your premise, to learn not only the potential strengths of your idea but also the hidden structural weaknesses.In The Departed, the writers must immediately confront the difficulty of two main characters. Again, the need to cross-cut between two leads first takes a toll on the definition of the characters. The writers are so interested in getting the plot going they fail to give Billy (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) a motive for going undercover. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that no one in this movie has a motive for what they do.Lack of character motive (which is connected to the first major structure step, the Need) is always a big weakness. But in a story already dominated by plot, this is a disaster. The characters are nuts and bolts being moved by plot mechanics.The premise does highlight the strength of The Departed, which is the plot. But it also shows us how even the best plot can spiral out of control.Plot in crime stories is all about opposition under the surface, and The Departed is worth studying to see how to create that, not only in a crime story but in any work of fiction. But when you are creating your plot, you have to be aware of the fundamental trade-off between plot and believability. The more you try to hide the opposition under the surface - thus giving you more plot - the more you push the believability of your characters to the extreme. You become so conscious of creating surprise that you force the characters to take actions that they, and indeed no human being, would logically do.This believability problem surfaces right away when Billy, who has been to the police academy, becomes the mole in the Costello crime family. It would be so obvious that this guy is the snitch that I was immediately reminded of Clark Kent and Superman. Somehow when Superman puts on a suit and a pair of nerdy glasses no one can see that he is Superman. In a fantasy superhero story, the audience accepts that convention and lets it pass. Not so in a realistic crime story.The writers keep the believability problems at bay for most of the story. But any story that emphasizes plot always pushes the reveals to the end, where whatever believability problems it has will be magnified as the reveals come fast and furious. Sure enough, The Departed rapidly disintegrates into farce and stupidity. The final sequence is filled with reveals and assassinations, but they are based on actions so mindlessly dumb that the audience is left muttering, ""No! No! No!"" Even worse, this sort of false plot, sprung at the end, kills the audience's sense of investment in the film itself. If it's so easy to assassinate these characters, why didn't they just shoot Costello in the first place and save me 2 1/2 hours of my time.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please go to www.truby.com"
namashi_1,"Jul 12, 2010",10/10,"A remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, Scorsese's 'The Departed' is a haunting film, so effective, that I still have a hang-over of it. Scorsese actually shatters himself by getting into a world of blood, back-stabbing and cruel intelligence. For those who haven't seen this box office smash yet, take time out from other non-sense, and watch this!This Masterstroke takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, where Irish Mob boss Francis ""Frank"" Costello played by Nicholson plants Colin Sullivan played by Damon as an informant within the Massachusetts State Police. Simultaneously, the police assign undercover cop Billy Costigan played by DiCaprio to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, each man attempts to discover the others true identity before being found out. The original Hong Kong flick was a masterstroke! And this is a true and best remake possible! Scorsese has made so many remarkable films, that I've lost count by now. He's at his fiery best and his executes the subject with tremendous ease. A True Legend! His biggest accomplishment was, that, He was finally respected by the Academy-Awards for his work here! Halleujah! Michael Ballhaus's Cinematography is eye-catching. William Monahan's adapted screenplay is marvelous.In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg steals the show with a brilliant performance. The rawness and overdose of abusive language help the talented actor steal the show in this multi-starrer. Jack Nicholson, as always, is flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio is superb, he lives his character from start to end. Matt Damon is amazing, as ever. Martin Sheen proves yet again he's a talent that we'll never forget. He's exceptional. Alec Baldwin is in command after a long time. The veteran scores! Vera Farmiga is perfect. Ray Winstone does full justice to his part. Anthony Anderson leaves a mark as well.'The Departed' is a winner all the way! The film keeps you at grip from start to end, and will leave you thinking about it for a long, long time. It's amongst the finest films ever made! Two Big Thumbs Up!"

jasanderson9090,"Oct 27, 2020",9/10,"This is a great rendition of the original Chinese movie ""Infernal Affairs."" Martin Scorsese won his first Best Director Academy Award for ""The Departed"" and plants the story in Boston with the Irish Mob and the Massachusetts Police Force.
Jack Nicholson is as great as ever playing the Irish boss that is infiltrating the Police Department. Leonardo DiCaprio shines as an undercover cop so underground that only Martin Sheen's character Queenan and Mark Wahlberg's Sergeant Dignam know about his secret operations. Vera Farmiga plays his police psychologist, Madolyn. DiCaprio and Farmiga's chemistry is undeniably electric and roots the movie with hope. Their love affair reaches a zenith while the song ""Comfortably Numb"" by Pink Floyd plays underneath the scene, while the rain falls outside and the characters explore their vulnerability. Matt Damon in an excellent turn plays Officer Colin Sullivan with ties to Nicholson's Costello."
coryand,"Oct 6, 2006",7/10,"Just got back from seeing this in Taiwan (where it opened yesterday, in time for Mid-Autumn festival) Good movie, but decided to re-watch the original (Infernal Affairs) back home... and the original edges over it in terms of emotion, pace and character development.'The departed' is great once it gets going and the premise really starts to kick in,and jack Nicholson is incredible, but I can't help feeling that the director was going for too much humour - from the 9at times0 overly witty dialogue to the closing scene. And some of the set pieces - the elevator scene near the end, for example, are not handled as well as in the original (the audience laughed out loud during the elevator scene, and I'm not sure that was the intended effect).All in all, a good film, but I feel it just misses out on being a great one, especially when compared with its Asian counterpart."
yorktown_hawk,"Jul 13, 2020",9/10,"Brilliantly adapted.
Accents can be a little hammed up, but you get used to it.
Actor selection was perfect. Shoutout to Alec Baldwin for his subtle comedy performance.
The love story within the main plot was a typical pointless Hollywood requirement that added nothing to the movie and could have been removed and no one would have noticed.
You'll always pick up something new every time you watch it."
ccthemovieman-1,"Feb 22, 2007",6/10,"THE GOOD - A big collection of well-known male actors headed by veteran Jack Nicholson give standout performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play guys who are both working both sides of the fence and the big suspense revolves around their characters and if will be found out. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, ---- (the only female with many lines), Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone give superb support. My favorite was Winstone, a guy I'm familiar with from ""Sexy Beast"" and ""The Proposition."" Despite the length of this movie, it keeps your interest all the way. I never got more bored... BUT....THE BAD - ....I did get tired of all the f-words. Usually I could care less about that, but over 250 of them? Sometimes it seemed like every sentence. It was ludicrous and after awhile, your senses seemed bombarded with it, such as too much action can numb you. It just wasn't necessary to have it said THAT many times, and by practically everybody in the film. That's my other main complaint: every character in here is a scumbag: an untrustworthy person who will sleep with anyone and lie to everyone. Baldwin's character, as an FBI director, was the most ridiculous of them all. Both of these faults are typical for a Martin Scorcese film. He's pathetic. Sorry, Marty, but not every person in the world is a low-life as you must be.OVERALL - Nonethelss, to be fair, his movies - like this one - are usually interesting, just the sordid stuff done to excess. If you can put up with the latter, you'll like this film a lot."
tanelteder,"Jan 9, 2011",10/10,"The Departed offers you one of the best stories of mafia. Certainly the best combination of mob and police in the same movie. There are many good mafia films but this one sticks out because of its great usage of police. The value of this movie does not shrink to the fact that the film is mostly a remake to the Hongkong movie. The value is based how this one has been done. I gotta tell you, it's pretty damn high. And the reason behind that is Martin Scorsese. He absolutely nails this film. He, like Francis Ford Coppola, has a special eye for a mob films. And quite simply, this is his finest product.Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy) is one the best actors around. He is always so good. Never seen him underperformed. He gives a great shot here too. Jack Nicholson (Frank) is always reliable. Matt Damon (Colin) was good. But Mark Wahlberg (Dignam) was most impressive. Quite a performance from him. Very confident. In overall, it's just a first-class cast.The Departed is perfect film for a movie night. It's intense, has plenty of action, great story and great performances. Plus there are two huge bonuses. First one - the movie comes about Boston which is a great city. Second one - the movie has an awesome soundtrack which many films do not have. It has everything a winner should have."
joshwebster-44359,"Aug 29, 2020",9/10,"From the start The Departed had me with all its intriguing characters and storyline. The story flowed and moved along nicely, the opening of the movie was brilliant and does what a film should do, it grabs your attention and makes you ask a lot of questions and it only gets better from there with the ending being a absolute masterpiece. This film is perfect. The characters are all interesting and their personalities are shown through the great acting from the cast. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg do some of their best in The Departed with their witty and down to the point characters and Leonardo DiCaprio is outstanding as always and all the acting is very good throughout. The thing I really like about this film is how it flicks between the two characters Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin (Matt Damon) and the contrast it shows of the two but also the similarities.From start to finish The Departed is excellent with its twists, drama and humour. The Departed is one of the best films I have ever watched and if you haven't watched it yet your missing out."
kevin-miller447,"Jul 26, 2011",10/10,"This is Scorsese's masterpiece. I love most of Martin's work but this is his gem. He won best director for this movie and this also won best picture. All well deserved. In my top ten list this is #3. A lot of people don't like this movie because they say the plot is too confusing. Frankly, I thought the same thing after first viewing it. After several watched, I know what was going on and who was who. The dialogue is sharply written and the performances are outlandishly entertaining. Everything about this movie is great and frankly, I don't find any flaws in it. People might think I'm being too generous and that I'm blinded by my love for Scorsese. No, I just know a damn good movie when I see one. This is a gangster drama that hits all the right notes and has a great soundtrack to go along with it. I also love how much they swear in the movie. It's hilarious and its used well too. A lot of times, swearing is abused and overused in movies. Now, I have heard people cuss this movie out for how much swearing there is but realize that people talk like this. Maybe not all the time, but they do. The cast is beyond superb and all of them do a great job. I love this movie, and hopefully someone who reads this, then watches it will uh, love it too. All thumbs up!"
harryjbanks-72944,"Mar 10, 2021",8/10,"The acting was great and the production aswell. The thing that i most disliked about the movie is how dumb and naive Costello was. I mean, he even asked Billy if he was a cop and ever since Billy joined his gang the problems with police started. If he was smart he would have killed him since the first problem they had with the police."
mahen1,"Feb 21, 2007",N/A,"The Departed is one of the best cop moves in years. I hadn't heard of Infernal Affairs before watching The Departed, and had only a vague inkling that The Departed was based on some Hong Kong film. For the first 90% of its length The Departed promises to be a classic, an all time great. It's a film of restrained violence that serves the plot. A cop (DiCaprio) is planted as a mole in a crime gang headed by Jack Nichoson. His task to report on the gang's activities with the eventual object of nabbing the whole bunch including Nicholson.The ingenious touch is that Nicholson too has a mole (Damon) in the police. Damon's task is to report to Nicholson on the police investigations on his gang, so that Nicholson knows when to go ahead with a deal, when to keep low or in some cases Damon would clear the way of police so that Nicholson can go ahead with his plans.Both these moles have been operating in their respective roles for years. So much so that Damon is actually becoming quite a good cop with a moral dilemma, while DiCaprio is becoming quite a bad ass with an equally desperate dilemma - he knows if he plays gangster too long he might actually be one for the rest of his life.DiCaprio is desperate to get out of his predicament and begs the only two cops who know of his identity as a mole (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) to let him back into the police. Before his career as a mole began his records with the police were all deleted. Without Sheen and Wahlberg no one could identify Dicaprio as a cop.This already tense situation is compounded no end when each side discovers at around the same time that each has a mole in the other's ranks. To ensure their own survival Damon and Dicaprio work feverishly to find out each other's identity, and the tension grips you.We are taken through several set piece sequences to what seems likely to be an unbearably tense finale but at this point the move lets us down. There is one too many killings at the end, and I was left wondering whether the serious film-making I had witnessed approaching the end was meant to be taken seriously as the end sequences are almost comic.Nevertheless the ingenious plot device, the powerhouse performances by the leading cast led by DiCaprio make this a very good, highly watchable film. But I was a little disappointed by the ending.Not long after I found out that this was based on the Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs (made in 2002) and proceeded to get my hands on it. My main motive was to find out if the ending was handled any better.Since this is a review of The Departed I'll keep my comments on Infernal Affairs very brief. Suffice to say that the latter is much the better film. It's 50 mins shorter, but in no way loses out in terms of character development. As far as I can see The Departed was 50 mins longer only for the sake of character development. The ending of Infernal Affais is more restrained, and far more effective. Indeed Infernal Affairs is one of the great cop movies in history in any language. The Departed cannot be considered as anything other than a remake. All the key set pieces are copied wholesale from Infernal Affairs as of course is the plot.Martin Scorcese is long overdue for an Oscar, and as everyone knows is nominated this year for The Departed. For a Director who has made such original classics as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull to win for this would be almost an insult. No doubt he feels differently."
HiddenVoice,"Oct 2, 2006",8/10,"One could look at The Departed and can get the idea that this is less a remake than it is a re-imagining of the riveting crime Drama INTERNAL AFFAIRS.It's more of an inspiration than it is a direct lift off.The story may be the same,but there's a vast difference between Scorsese's epic and the Hong Kong Classic.And for that,this film is truly a fascinating look at the ugly worlds of the two sides of the law.Rookie Cop Billy Costigan goes undercover and is assigned to work for Crime Boss Frank Costello and get really close to him to deliver some information about his crimes.Costigan gains Costello's trust and gets involved a lot deeper in his crimes.On the other hand ,a rising police office is actually a mole in the department, informs everything about the Police Department's movements to Costello.But things get deadly when both men are about to have their secrets exposed and the Mobs and the cops discover that there is a mole/informer,and a traitor who's getting things messed up on both sides.And then they both try to save themselves from each other and the Mobs.They slowly get confused with their dual identities and things get deadlier for the both of them as their delicate balance with the Mobs and the Cops gets them too involved with the world they're into.While both men are in love with the same women,one of them has to suffer the consequences.Leading to a shocking conclusion to this epic.There are intense scenes of violence and action and twists that you never see coming.A Martin Scorsese film is always dark,graphically violent,raw,hard edged,and filled with memorable powerhouse performances.And this film is no exception.The Departed is something new and different .Its complex plot unfolds to an even more powerful story ,with characters colliding with one another and facing terrifying situations.Scorsese shows that what it is like to be a cop.Your life is in danger 24/7 ,and that every minute is a risk when you're undercover.Your only fear is having your true identity be exposed.And then,it's all up to the person who's holding a gun to your face.It's a tough film he carved out,and to be honest it's a perfect example of how a remake should be made.It's actually as good as the original,even better at times.And shows that when it is helled by a legendary director who knows what he is doing the results are always great for a remake.To compare the original and this one,I would say this one is slightly better than the original.Otherwise,it's just as brilliant as the Hong Kong version.But the thing about this film is that even if you've seen the Hong Kong version,you'll still be blown away by the Hollywood version.However,comparisons are inevitable.What else can you ask for when you have a cast this big?I could only recall one such film that had such a huge cast at the moment,and that was Ocean's 11.Where that film didn't do full justice with its cast,this film makes use of its actors and gives you a rare piece of entertainment that is thought-provoking and ingenious.Scorsese really have given a great piece of work.I wouldn't say this is his best work ever,his best directed film was GANGS OF NEW YORK ,which he should've won an Osacar for,but it certainly is one his best work since Goodfellas in the crime genre.It's got the usual trademarks of the director.The script is fantastic.The writer has done a terrific job in this remake.It makes the film a standout from the original.Rich CinematographyThe cinematography is rich,and the editing is sharp. The Score is superb,Scorsese's choice of music is great.And the look of the film and its sets are brilliant,getting us old and new Boston.And lots of cell phone use.Well,you're wondering who's the show stealer out of a giant cast like this.Everyone got to do something with full satisfaction.But the real standout here is Di Caprio and Damon.The actors have only gotten better and better recently and here they pull it off again.They are complex and tough characters to play and they play their part brilliantly.Di Caprio's emotional stature is strong.He manages to bring the character's fear and confusion with full conviction.You do feel sad in the end for what happens to him.You will be shocked and it was unfair for the character.Damon on the other hand is superb as the mole who informs the crime bosses.Their face off and rivalries are intense and suspenseful.And of course,Jack Nicholson couldn't have had more fun doing a film like this than doing another sad comedy.His and Scorsese's collaboration is another reason,altogether a different reason, to watch this film.At this age,he could still pull off juicy performances,and do all that he's done on screen really makes you wonder if he's ever gonna do another film with Scorsese again.And his over the top performance is really fun to watch.Wahlberg is great in his role as the tough cop who talks tough to his co-officers.Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are both terrific.Vera Farimiga was a real surprise as a women who falls in love with both leading men.She plays her part really well and you kind of feel sad that why didn't she chose the character that deserved her.Of course, this film is not without its flaws,and I expected it to end with a bang,whereas the writer seemed to have abandoned the script's energy and just concluded it somewhat like the original film.It was an uneven conclusion.And I just wasn't sure why was it necessary to do what the writer did to the main characters in the end.But regardless of that the rest of the film is a tour de force raw drama.A modern classic and a definite must-see of the year.This film can count on its chances of being at the Oscars next year.A sure fire success.The Departed is the most exciting,fun and thrilling dark crime Drama of the year.And it's fully satisfying and very entertaining.Highly Recommended."
LazySod,"Dec 30, 2006",6/10,"Organized crime, organized crime fighting. Corrupt policemen and undercover agents. They seem to be connected at the hip and this film plays with that from the start to the very last minute of it, telling the tale of the actions of a FBI/police combination fighting to bring a hotshot criminal down. Apparently it is a remake of the Japanese film Mou gaan dou (2002). I have not seen that original but will be on the lookout for it now.The Departed is intense. A tad slow in the beginning and maybe a little too fast in the ending, but I guess keeping a very good balance in a 150 minute film can be a very daunting task. The most of it is rather interesting and builds a tension that runs somewhere until the last 15 minutes of the film - but - that is where it all fails. For me the last 15 minutes of film feel glued to the rest but not really connected to that rest and that more or less breaks the film in half, destroying its quality.All in all. A lot of good looking imagery, good sound track, nice story - until just before the end of it. Cut of 15 minutes and you've got a thrilling good film.6 out of 10 dirty cops"
yeung_o_o,"Feb 28, 2007",6/10,"I am a person from Hong Kong. I have seen a lot of comments. The Departed is not a bad movie. If i need to choose, i think Infernal affairs is better. Because Infernal affairs can handle the frame better. IA can evoke your emotions.Some scene is much more better.Some dialogs are very classical in Infernal affairs too.The movie is very significant and profundity.Finally,i want to clarify some facts. Oscars said that Infernal affairs is a Japanese movie. It is a very serious mistake!! Infernal affairs is a Hong Kong movie. Not Japanese or Korean, Or even not a Chinese movie. Although Hong Kog is a place in China,but the language or the laws is different. I hope you not to misunderstand. :D"
Camera-Obscura,"Nov 18, 2006",N/A,"With this remake of the Hong Kong actioner ""Internal Affairs"", Scorsese makes his mark again with a gripping crime saga in the vein of GOODFELLAS (1990) and CASINO (1995). This time he ventures into what must be somewhat less familiar territory for the director, the Irish milieu in South Boston, but screenwriter William Monahan is a Boston native and seems to know his targets inside out.The cast is to die for, with a line-up of almost exclusively A-list actors. First there is Jack Nicholson as Jeff Costello (a reference to Alain Delon's character in Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 classic LE SAMOURAI), a psychotic Irish crime boss. Jack Nicholson simply doesn't give bad performances, but here his performance borders on caricature, but somehow he manages to check it in such away, it remains acceptable. Perhaps Scorsese should have toned him down a little, but who can control Jack Nicholson? Who wants to? Perhaps over the top, but hugely entertaining. Perhaps he is the only actor who can get away with this. The rest of the cast is simply outstanding with Leonardo DiCaprio in a very impressive role as Billy Costigan, an undercover cop infiltrating Jeff Costello's gang. Matt Damon as sergeant Sullivan is somewhat more one-note but it seems to fit his role just right. Perhaps he intended it this way. Mark Wahlberg is very amusing as the most twisted, hostile and foul-mouthed cop in recent screen history.On a credibility level, the film put me to the test a couple of times. Why is Jeff Costello, who runs multi-million dollar drug transports, still collecting protection money in person from Pakistani shop owners? The sub-plot with the delivery of microprocessors to the Chinese for the fabrication of advanced weaponry was truly laughable, especially the encounter between Nicholson and his cronies and a Chinese gang in leather jackets. It looked like a scene from a grade-Z '80s action flick. At times the setting in the film plays more like the '70s, despite the very 2006 cell phones, that play such a crucial role in the film, they almost grow into a character of their own. This must be the film with the most close-ups of cell-phones so far.In South Boston all little Irish boys seem to grow up as cops or criminals. I am not sure whether this film should be seen as a realistic depiction of the Boston crime world. In the core, it probably is, but it's more a like a mixture of '70s values, clothes and family ties, with some modern elements thrown in the mix. Irish blokes standing in front of a restaurant with their caps and all, I don't know. Somehow, it seems more like a throwback to another age. Or perhaps in some places, like South Boston, things never change. But probably that's the whole point. Scorsese always presents us an over-inflated dreamworld, where in the end every person runs wildly amok. With Scorsese, bad guys are not just bad guys. They are out-of-control monsters, whether it is Jeff Costello in this film or Joe Pesci in GOODFELLAS or CASINO, they all have an almost comic book flair, which doesn't make 'em any less interesting. On the contrary, after all, this IS the movies. The truth is no excuse. Often, the imagination is far more interesting.I still have to chew a little on this, but this film is quite an overwhelming experience. One of those films, that was already a classic before it came out. Besides some of the aforementioned reservations, these still were a dynamite 149 minutes.Camera Obscura --- 8/10"
MorganMan1,"Oct 9, 2006",10/10,"Another remake, but a good one. The ""Departed"" is a remake of the Asian produced movie ""Infernal Affairs"".I enjoyed watching this movie and never regretted going to see it for one second. It was enjoyable and very well done. Sure you could find faults and ""untied ends"" left loose and never explained but over all it was one of the very best ""gangster"" type movies I have ever seen! Jack Nicholson had his part down almost perfect and Mark Walberg was great as an edgy, cranky cop on the good. But this movie did one thing very few movies can ever claim; it showcased and proved the actor of the decade, Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes, I would not have ever thought I would make this claim but He has earned it.If you like realistic violence, hard-hitting drama and edge of your seat suspense then this movie is for you. If you like great acting, top notch direction and some of the best story telling in cinema; please see this one. It is the best movie I have seen this year and I have seen a lot of movies. As a rule, I do not like remakes but this one is Superb!"
zetes,"Oct 9, 2006",8/10,"Scorsese's long-awaited remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. Infernal Affairs was a good film, but it always seemed to me like a gimmick, and more like a skeleton of a film than a real film. Scorsese predictably fleshes it out so it doesn't seem as much like just a good concept. The actors add a lot to it, too (though the Hong Kong actors, including Andy Lau and Tony Leung, were very good, as well). I don't think it stands anywhere near Scorsese's best work myself. It doesn't carry near the weight of Goodfellas, for instance. It starts to get a little silly near the end, and the director makes a few really bad choices  especially including that awful image in the final shot. That's just plain embarrassing film-making. And that's not to mention the awful choice the filmmakers made to change a certain part of the ending of Infernal Affairs - the original is definitely stronger in that respect. Of the actors, my favorite was Mark Wahlberg. Matt Damon comes in second, and DiCaprio third. Nicholson has a lot of fun as the gangster. The best comparison with previous Jack performances is actually the Joker from Burton's first Batman movie. Alec Baldwin has probably the most memorable moment, where he expresses his love for the Patriot Act. Well worth seeing, but definitely not best-of-the-year material. I would rank it quite below Scorsese's previous two films from this decade, The Aviator and Gangs of New York."

Loved his mysterious girlfriend, Gwen, aka Kristen Dalton. Although, not a big part, but many stars played smaller roles and were outstanding. Scorcese should win the big one at last. Jack is not only an evil psychopath, but has a prankster, little boy quality as well. Leo shows every emotion there is, Alex Baldwin is hilarious as is Mark Wahlberg. A lot of violence, but aren't all Scorcese movies fairly violent? He knows the mob and how to show their personalities. A big film! Jack is a legend. He brings so much to everything he has ever done, and this film is no exception."
crossluke21,"May 6, 2023",6/10,"I hate to use the word overrated, but that is a pretty good word for this movie. This is Scorsese on autopilot working with potboiler material, but for some reason filmgoers and the film establishment decided to heap this movie with tons of accolades that Scorsese's other, lesser known work is much more worthy of. It feels like a slightly elevated version of dozens of other crime and cop action movies. There are great actors and great performances in this movie, but the plot did not keep me engaged enough to follow its many twists and turns. The ending is so over the top and ridiculous that it borders on parody."
WriterDave,"Oct 9, 2006",10/10,"Martin Scorsese has reached a point in his career where he has free reign to do whatever he wishes as a director. It's hallowed ground for an auteur, and as such, every actor worth his salt would kill to work for him knowing full well that whatever Scorsese chooses to do will be an uncompromising work of art. With ""The Departed"" he has quite possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled. The deliciously convoluted plot based on the recent Asian flick ""Infernal Affairs"" showcases Jack Nicholson as an Irish mob boss; Leonardo DiCaprio as an undercover cop infiltrating the crime ring; Matt Damon as the crime ring's inside man with the police unit assigned to bring them down; Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg as the cops working above Damon and DiCaprio; and a breakthrough role for Vera Farmiga as a police psychiatrist in a love triangle with Damon and DiCaprio. This brief but confusing rundown is merely the tip of the iceberg and reveals nothing of the plot twists and tension riddling every aspect of the film like bullet holes from a machine gun massacre.By now, Scorsese is to crime dramas what Hitchcock was to psychological thrillers. Comparatively, he's at the same point in his long career Hitchcock was when he gave us ""Rear Window,"" ""Psycho,"" and ""Vertigo."" Scorsese could've directed this blindfolded and it would've still been first rate. What's so thrilling about Scorsese as a filmmaker is that he's always directing full throttle with his eyes wide open. ""The Departed"" is so ridiculously good it left me with chills afterward. After a brief departure to big budget Oscar pushes with ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator,"" Scorsese returns to the familiar ground of his most revered projects like ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" Goodfellas,"" and ""Casino."" All his hallmarks are here: fantastic use of music, brilliantly choreographed bouts of violence, heart-pounding editing, deep and meaningful camera shots and movement, religious iconography, an epic and detailed sense of place (in this case, Boston), and highly quotable dialogue that is dramatic and funny and full of pathos in all the right places.With its rising tension and cat-and-mouse theatrics, ""The Departed"" is easily the most viscerally thrilling studio film to come down the pike in many moons. Scorsese doesn't just treat us to his usual bag of tricks, he re-imagines them, and in exorcising perfectly balanced performances from an amazingly talented cast that in the hands of lesser director may have gone over-the-top, he delivers a modern day tragedy on par with greatest works of Shakespeare. For Scorsese, the big screen is his canvas, the camera his paint brush, and the blood splattered across the screen his awe-inspiring brush strokes. He's a veteran, he's a master, and ""The Departed"" is his Renaissance."
JoshtheGiant,"Oct 11, 2006",10/10,"I was never one of those people who thought that Martin Scorsese had lost his touch. I just thought that as he had grown older his interests had changed, and that was completely fine. No because I believe this would not say that The Departed is Scorsese's comeback. The Departed is his best film since Goodfellas, and is a complete masterpiece. The performances are top notch. If Dicaprio isn't at least nominated I will be extremely mad. Wahlberg and Nicholson are also both stand outs, and I hope both get nominations. Damon and Farmiga are both also amazing. The rest of the cast are very good, but don't stand out in the amazing cast. The script is also great. The dialogue is brilliant and they manage to give each and every character enough development to work well. I also hope Shore is nominated for his brilliant score. Those Irish strings and bagpipes pipe at exactly the right time. The Departed is Scorsese's best in years, and truthfully one of his best ever."
kornfreak666_1,"Oct 1, 2006",10/10,"Any fan of Scorcese's work will love this picture. I was a little worried that the cast would not hold up to Marty's genius, but the performances were great. I was most worried about Alec Baldwin and and Mark Wahlberg's performances, but after I saw the film I thought they gave some of the most memorable performance's in the film. The story starts off a bit slow and jumps from story to story a bit to often, but once the premise is established the movie is excellent. The plot can be confusing if you don't pay close attention, but if you're an avid Scorcese fan or just someone who appreciates great cinema, then this is a great movie to watch. This is the best movie I have seen in years. The writing was great, the director is a legend, the cast was incredible, and I think this may be my new favorite Scorcese picture."
iohefy-2,"Feb 13, 2007",8/10,"I waited to see The Departed with antisapation and having just seen it my wait was not in vain.The acting in the movie was the tops, including Leonardo De Caprio, Matt Damon, and of course Jack Nicholson who is great in anything he appears in. Even the bit parts by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were outstanding. The problem I had with the movie was how similar DiCaprio and Damon looked in this movie, I got sort of confused as to who was who. This is a different kind of cop story and I am sure you will enjoy watching the artistry of this unit of actors in this fine movie. It is the best two hours I have spent in a long time, so go see this outstanding movie and you will certainly enjoy it as much as I did. This is Oscar material for sure."
Lady-Janey,"Oct 10, 2006",10/10,"The Departed is the best movie I have seen in years. It's gripping, shocking and hilarious all in one movie. Like the best roller-coaster ride, one second you're laughing, the next you're 'Oh my God!' as something really shocking happens.Yes this movie is a remake of the classic Hong Kong 'Infernal Affairs.' I loved the original but somehow the movie seems to sit even better among the Boston Irish.The performances in this movie are all standout, the leads DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson as well as the support Wahlberg, Baldwin, Sheen and Farmiga. It is their work which makes the Departed special and absolutely gripping. From the hilarious one liners thrown by Wahlberg's Dignam and Baldwin's Ellerby to the intense fear and vulnerability shown by DiCaprio's Costigan as he tries to survive in the world of Nicholson's colourful and terrifying Costello.Surely this movies deserves some acting nods at the Oscars? I would certainly recommend 'The Departed.' You do need to be prepared for Goodfellas type violence and language but if you can live with this then The Departed will be one of the best movies you have seen in a long time.10/10"
Heiniken,"Oct 23, 2006",9/10,"The answer is yes. This is a very good movie. Scorsese is back to his former form. Not that the Aviator and gangs of new york were bad movies, they're actually quit good movies, but not Scorsese good. The Departed is Scorsese good though.The story takes place in Boston which is a new field for Marty. It's actually quite refreshing. But when it all comes down the city doesn't really matter.In terms of acting there isn't much to say. Everybody does their job, and well. EVEN Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon. Dicaprio has really become a talented actor. But Matt is probably the actor that surprised me the most in this movie. I'm not a big fan of his, but he really does a good job here. I expected nothing less from the legend Jack Nicholsen which is one of my favorite actors. And Alec Baldwin probably shows his best performance so far. All in all a GREAT cast.A great movie, Probably better than infernal affairs, but it is Scorsese after all. 9/10"
Morejambo54,"Jan 3, 2021",8/10,"What I mean by that is that it can get a bit confusing, not the plot but the dialogue. So many of the words and phrases in the movie I assume most average people won't have heard and the movie dose t care to explain what they mean, this leaves some of the conversations to be bland and boring. The first half of the movie is really there to build tension, which it does very well and it doesn't disappoint as the end of the movie is insanity, so much happens and your mind explodes with everything that just occurred. The acting didn't stand out to me, even with a extremely famous cast, it wasn't bad though. The tension is really what makes this movie good, you just want to know what's going to happen but it's delayed further and further making you keep watching. Very nice 8/10"
Michael_Elliott,"Feb 29, 2008",N/A,"Departed, The (2006)**** (out of 4)I went and saw Martin Scorsese's latest film today and afterwards one thing jumped into my mind and that was the word masterpiece. From the time I first got on the internet I've always told people they shouldn't label a film a masterpiece for at least 10-15 years so you could see how a film would sink into you. However, I guess I'm going to have to break my own rule because I thought this film was absolutely flawless and it's certainly the greatest thing I've seen in a very long time. I had a top ten of this decade but this here jumps right at #1. I was a major fan of Scorsese's previous two films but this one here is vintage Scorsese. I really feel sorry for those who have to pick Oscar winners because this film is full of possible nominees.DiCaprio once again turns in a super performance and Matt Damon gives the best performance I've ever seen from him. Jack Nicholson is someone you can always expect greatness from and he delivers here again but it was great seeing a great performance from him outside of a romantic comedy. As with Scorsese, this legendary teaming has Nicholson doing vintage work. I'm sure Nicholson will get a Supporting Actor nod but you could also throw in Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Adam Baldwin and even Martin Sheen. In most Hollywood films the movie would spend too much time with Damon and DiCaprio but I thought it was a brilliant move to make this thing more of an epic and give all sorts of character detail to the supporting players. Sheen really shines the most and I'd probably give him a nod before Nicholson.I haven't seen the film this is based on so I'm not sure how much is the same or how much is different but I felt Scorsese grabbed you from the very start with Nicholson's narration cut to a beautiful camera shot and then, of course, The Stone's Gimme Shelter. Seeing the rise of Damon's character through the division was something else that really worked and I personally feel the film could have told more of his story at the start. When the two eventually get undercover I thought Scorsese showed his master's touch again. Most Hollywood films would have just set up several bang-bang scenes but this one here carried the suspense throughout. Little by little plot developments would occur and little by little Scorsese would build the suspense. I was a little worried about the 150-minute running time but the way everything was moving this here could have been doubled in length and still worked just as good.No spoilers here but I thought the ending was brilliantly played out. I can't remember the last time I watched a movie and thought it was over only to be hit upside the head with a complete and utter shock where I was asking myself if something really happened."
elliottthomasc,"Jun 12, 2019",10/10,"After watching this film, I can't ignore how this film compares with the rest of Scorsese's films. In my opinion, from what I've seen, this is Scorsese's best effort. The only films of his I've seen are this one, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, and The Wolf of Wall Street; and in my opinion, this one tops all of those.Amazing acting by one of the greatest casts of all time, and all of the supporting characters such as Martin Sheen who plays an amazing role. Many beautiful shots and great camera work by the god Scorsese. Great script with almost no flaws at all. One of the most perfect scripts I've ever witnessed. Many meanings and ideologies throughout this film using only camera movement and actors body language.This movie is a mental rollercoaster that will make you feel many things all at once.Amazing film, 100% recommended to anyone who loves gore and crime films."
sandeep-challa,"Oct 9, 2006",10/10,"Was desperate to see ""The Departed"" because it was the first time I was catching up on a Scorsese movie in US on release date. (I am from India). Making a 2 1/2 hr gangster flick is a very tough task. But there are so many twists and turns that are there in this flick that 2 1/2 hrs just passed by without my knowledge.Initially i took some time to get into the movie. But once you are there, you will get so involved with the characters that you actually feel whats going on with them. Screeplay was very tight and gripping. To actually make a movie about two guys who don't meet until the end, is quite an achievement. And the last half an hour was amazing. I saw quite a few reviews which said that the climax as not up to the mark. I totally disagree with them. The scene when DiCaprio is shot, the whole theater was shocked and I could hear the sounds like ""Oh!! My God""...Man it was amazing .... I was like ""What the heck was that"" ....One final word ""Marty! You rock, You simple do!!""Planning to catch it one more time this weekend ....."
tiagoalves6926,"Nov 22, 2006",10/10,"I saw this movie yesterday, and think this movie is the best movie of the year in my opinion, Scorsese's will go to win the Oscar of better director and Leonardo DiCaprio will go win Best Actor in a Leading Role MAT makes one great Role and Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson too. this movie is better the Japanese movie. he acting of all the leads were legendary and they all looked very comfortable in their roles. Anyone out there who previously disregarded Leo DiCaprio as an actor will be totally converted as he delivered an astounding performance and showed a gritty side to his character. In fact, he was so good that Mr Nicholson didn't act him off the screen when they shared screen time together. Accolade also has to be heaped on Damon also as he came into his own as the sneaky but smooth rouge cop. Add Sheen, Whalberg, Baldwin and Winstone to the mix and you have the best cast assembled for a motion picture this year.the directed are great the casting was great.the writing are great . the sound track are great too.i wait this movie win many Oscars and golden globes! I love this movie!!"
RobTheWatcher,"Feb 11, 2021",10/10,This is a masterpiece through and through. The story has multiple sub plots going on that all become interconnected and give you multiple angles and perspectives of what's happening. It's just a bad ass movie with some of the best actors ever at their absolute best
raunaq-35764,"Jun 10, 2019",10/10,"One of the best movies I have watched.
Storyline, acting, direction everything was world class."
dsocwell,"Oct 7, 2006",6/10,"I went to The Departed last night on the strength of some of the reviews I'd read. And while it was a fairly good movie, it is not great. In my opinion, Scorsese has taken an interesting story and a very good cast and created a somewhat-better-than-mediocre picture. The photography is very good, the shots well done for the most part, but he has made some odd choices. The most puzzling is the Chinese/microchip issue. This could have and, in my opinion, should have been omitted. It doesn't move the plot, it doesn't add depth or breadth to the story and it doesn't help to develop any of the characters.Some of the acting was uneven as well. I love some of Matt Damon's work, but I never felt an emotional connection with this character. I had the sense that I was watching him act. Even his accent isn't consistent, changing from the Boston Southie he displayed in Good Will Hunting to Midwestern.Jack Nicholson is Jack Nicholson, and that's the problem with his portrayal. Unconvincing.There are other issues I have with this movie, but on the positive side, Mark Wahlberg and Alce Baldwin are both quite enjoyable to watch. And by far the best performance, without question, is given by Leonardo DiCaprio. This young man can act! He has a way of becoming the character and his performance here is worth the price of admission.So, my suggestion is to go and see this movie, but don't set your expectations at the level suggested by some of the almost hysterically glowing reviews. If you do, you will be disappointed."
dr_foreman,"Nov 3, 2006",6/10,"I guess film critics and movie buffs are going to give four stars to any old Scorcese-directed gangster movie, huh? Even ones that don't deserve four stars, like ""The Departed.""I must admit that it's not a bad film, by any means. The performances are mostly solid, the Boston setting is unique and interesting, and there are some genuinely suspenseful scenes. But, on the other hand, there are also plenty of scenes that feel either completely unbelievable, or totally flat, or a noxious combination of both.The plot, which gets needlessly convoluted at times, involves a mob ""mole"" in the police department and his counterpart, a police ""rat"" in the mafia. Apparently, it's based on a Chinese film called ""Internal Affairs,"" but I've never seen that movie so I can't make any valid comparisons.Personally, I couldn't stop thinking about ""Donnie Brasco,"" the similar Johnny Depp/Al Pacino movie about a rat in the mafia. That film contained genuine emotion, complex character relationships, realism... all qualities that are pretty much absent from ""The Departed,"" which feels like an unrealistic Hollywood production all the way. The only apparent advantage that ""The Departed"" boasts is that it has a trendier director than ""Donnie Brasco."" But I think Scorcese pretty much drops the ball in this case and doesn't deserve to be automatically credited as a genius - just how cutesy and self-indulgent is the last shot of ""The Departed,"" anyway?Some people complain about Jack Nicholson's performance, but it didn't really bother me. His scenery-chewing is a nice change of pace from watching DiCaprio and Damon act all earnest and depressed all the time. (Incidentally, I also thought Mark Wahlberg's foul-mouthed cop was very funny and entertaining.) The real weak link in the acting chain is Vera Farminga as the love interest. She's supposedly a psychiatrist, but she gets so emotional and confrontational with her patients that she completely fails to come across as a professional. She's also a bit insipid and doesn't really have chemistry with DiCaprio or Damon.My other major gripe with the film is that the editing is often choppy and strange. Scorcese doesn't linger long enough in most of the scenes - he simply dives into the middle of the action, and jumps out again as quickly as possible. This MTV-style editing doesn't really enable me to get immersed in a movie. And some of his choppy little scenes are downright bizarre and don't seem to fit in the movie (like the weird one where Nicholson goes to the opera.)I suppose that modern films are so bad that critics freak out when a remotely competent movie like ""The Departed"" shows up in theaters. It's a welcome relief from movies about CGI animals and superheroes, sure. But is it really a masterpiece? A top 100 movie on IMDb? Hardly."
tobysen,"Jun 30, 2023",N/A,"The plot of this movie has too many plot holes. In the beginning, Leonardo's character Billy has just graduated from the police academy and only spent six months in prison, yet he manages to convince the gang leader Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) that he's not a cop, and it is unbelievable that Frank easily believes him. Then, in every mission, Billy becomes a key figure. It is more reasonable in the original that Chan Wing-yan (corresponds to Billy) had been taken away while still in the police academy and been undercover for ten years, with Hon Sam (corresponds to Frank) been undercover for three years.And, It's unbelievable that despite Frank suspecting a mole several times, he never doubts Billy, who came from the police academy, had the most apparent suspicion. However , every time he can shake off suspicions.At the end of the movie, there is a chaotic shootout, and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) emerges as the ultimate winner. It's impossible to discern what Scorsese intended to convey here. In the original version, besides telling an undercover story, it also conveyed the idea of giving bad people a chance to reform themselves. However, just when you are expecting the movie to convey its final message, it abruptly ends with this inexplicable shootout and the main characters are dead."

daveysnoek,"Nov 22, 2006",10/10,"Scorsese spend a lot of years lingering on different projects. Gangs of new York was okay, The aviator was quite good but every fan of Marty was secretly hoping for a new crime flick from the master. And this is the one! The Departed is brilliant. Absolutely stunning. Like Goodfellas, it's one of those rare movies where everything just..works. The acting is amazing. I was never a big fan of Leo DiCaprio but the performance he gives in this changed that. His character is very well developed and you feel for him right away. Matt Damon gives a surprising turn as a underhanded moll infiltrating the police. And of course there is Jack Nicholson in a blistering performance. Jack radiates menace, madness and charisma as Irish mob boss Frank Costello. A true legend at work. And he hasn't lost his touch. There is a reason for his 12 academy award nominations. And for this he will undoubtedly get his thirteenth.In the supporting roles Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver the goods. Wahlberg is a scene stealer with some of the best lines and he has fabulous chemistry with both Sheen and Baldwin. Ray Winstone also shines as Costello's right hand man, Mr French. His part in this movie is overlooked in many reviews. But it is a golden one.The crew knocked this out of the park once again. The camera-work looks effortlessly smooth and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is impeccable. To top it off there is a very strong soundtrack with the indestructible Scorsese-favorite Gimme Shelter.The Departed is Scorsese rising back to the up. even though he was never really away."

rkcrawf-2,"Nov 14, 2006",10/10,"and I love mob movies. I loved this movie. When I think of mob movies, I think of the Godfather(s), Scarface, and Goodfellas, in that order. It's not the Godfather, but it is definitely a classic. The story is better than Goodfellas (yes, I know that was based on a real story, but this one seems more realistic). The violence and dialog are so much more satisfying than Scarface. You feel like the violence makes sense, and isn't there just to decorate the movie. And the characters are nearly as compelling as the Godfather. The acting (and writing) is so good, that I will be disappointed if there are not multiple Oscar wins for the cast and story. I could easily see ones for Nicholson and DiCaprio (and I normally don't like Leo).I'm not sure what the running time was, but if anything I felt the film was too short. It was paced well, and tidied things up nicely, but I felt like I wanted to spend yet more time with the characters to understand them. Imagine if you only got one movie to know who Vito Corleone was...And of course, the directing was A++. Scorcese is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. W/o giving things away, some of the duality, and contrasts are brilliant. One guy has one phone which he switches the sim cards. Another has two phones, which he carries around openly.I can't wait to see this movie again!"

The characters are played amazingly. Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and all the other A-list actors were a lot of fun to watch on screen. But Mark Walhburg takes the cake for me. To leave it as vague as possible, I love how he ends up. The twists and turns of this movie are amazing and the ending is just ""mind-blowing""."
gcarreon,"Oct 15, 2006",6/10,"First, I like to comment on the brilliant performance by Leonardo DiCarpio and Jack Nicholson. I'm not a film critic, but DiCarpio and Nicholson had the best lines and the best scenes in the whole movie. The scene in the restaurant where Leonardo pleads his case that he is not the ""rat"", while Jack Nicholson sniffs his wine glass, eats a bug, and pulls a gun out on DiCarpio was entertaining, gripping, and climatic. Mark Wahlberg also put in a great performance with the limited facetime he received in the movie.The movie had twisting plots that at times confused me, especially at the beginning where I actually didn't know if DiCarpio was undercover or not. The scenes that he busted up the two guys in the store and him selling cocaine with his cousin probably was the reason why I was confused for so long. I know that some movies are not suppose to be spoonfeed to the audience and sometimes it takes mentally looking back at scenes to figure details out. This I don't mind at all, it's rather interesting.Overall it was a good movie, I don't give it the credit that many give it because the past week I was hearing it was Scorsese's best film, but it was lacking what films like Goodfellas, Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull had. What I'm saying is that the movies I mention above had the street elements involved which in turn described how the characters grew up and acted like they were. This movie didn't have that, it had the accents, but I feel it lacked the quality neighborhood addage that many of Scorsese's films have.I do recommend this movie, it has some of the best current actors at or near their peaks. You may want to keep the children and wife away though."

MichaelMargetis,"Feb 23, 2007",10/10,"""You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice... I quit. You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a f*cking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else. Okay?"" - Billy CostiganWalking into 'The Departed' the latest Scorsese picture I didn't know what to expect. The way it used to be, back in the 70s and 80s, was when Scorsese released a film you knew it was going to be spectacular and a contender for 'Best Picture'. Now, unfortunately, you cannot say the same thing. Besides blessing us with some of the Best American Films Ever Made (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, GoodFellas), in his recent years some of his other films have been more than a little disappointing (Kundun, Bringing out the Dead, Age of Innocence, The Aviator). I wanted to think positive, and think maybe this could be on par with Scorsese's early efforts. Despite the talent of Jack Nicholson of the bad guy, I was pretty sure it was going to be good, but the same old disappointing stuff we got from him in recent years. But, when those ending credits started to roll, I realized, I could NOT have been more wrong. Believe most of the critics and myself when we say 'The Departed' is not just excellent, but a masterpiece, and one of the best films Scorsese has EVER made.'The Departed' is based on the superb 2003 Hong Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs'. Remakes usually are inferior to their originals, but in this case, 'The Departed' is 10 times better than 'Infernal Affairs', featuring acting and direction that is literally 20 times better. Instead of Hong Kong, the story of the remake is set in Beantown, or Boston. An up and coming rookie cop with a criminal family history, Costigan (DiCaprio), is commissioned by his superior officers Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg) to go on a secret undercover mission and infiltrate the crew of the charismatic yet incredibly violent crime boss, Frank Costello (Nicholson). At the same time, a street hood practically raised by Costello, Sullivan (Damon), is commissioned by Costello to go undercover and infiltrate in the Boston Police Department. The film quickly becomes a thrilling cat and mouse game of wits between Costigan and Sullivan, to see which of the two will come out victorious. Scorsese's riveting Boston crime drama also stars The War Zone's Ray Winstone as Costello's equally twisted #1 man, Mr. French, The Manchurian Candidate's Vera Farminga as a psychiatrist working for the Boston P.D., who forms a relationship with Colin, and Alec Baldwin as the sarcastic, easily-irritated, but constantly fun to watch police Lieutenant who tells Colin one of the benefits of getting married is that the other cops won't think you're a 'homo'.Analyzing the different aspects of this film, there is really nothing to complain about, but so much to praise. First off, the acting is perhaps the best out of any motion picture released this year. Jack Nicholson is absolutely outstanding not to mention bone-chilling in his supporting role as Frank Costello, creating what is his best 'bad-guy' yet. It will be virtually impossible for Nicholson to be denied an Oscar nomination for his work in this, seeing as though whenever he's on-screen he steals the film, even if he doesn't have lines. Matt Damon is magnificent in his role as the calculating gangster posing as Bostod P.D., but the real breakthrough and the finest performance of 'The Departed' is Leonardo DiCaprio. In a tour-de-force performance that gave me goose bumps, DiCaprio completely makes up for some of his lack-luster performances in the past and then some. I predict DiCaprio might receive another Best Lead Actor Oscar Nomination for his work in this, God knows he deserves it 100%. In smaller roles, Mark Wahlberg is hysterical and scene-stealing as the demeaning police Sergeant who always has some smart-ass nasty comment to say to someone. Martin Sheen is solid to say the least as the Police Captain, Alec Baldwin is quite humorous in a tiny role as the Lieutenant, and Vera Farminga is fantastic in her role as the precinct shrink. Rounding out the cast, Ray Winstone is perfect as one man no one wants to screw with, Mr. French, and The Shield's Anthony Andersen is merit-able in an almost unnoticeable role as another cop who works with Sullivan.William Moynihan provides a masterful screenplay which redeems him for the scattered and stilted screenplay he provided for 'Kingdom of Heaven'. The dialog in 'The Departed' never seems stiff, and most of the time it is laced with side-split-tingly funny yet gritty one-liners from both the criminals and the cops. The cinematography and film editing are astounding, but the real secret to the success of 'The Departed' is Martin Scorsese's breathtaking directing abilities. Scorsese outdoes himself with 'The Departed' which is as stylish as 'Raging Bull' and as entertaining and engrossing as 'GoodFellas'. Scorsese has been nominated seven Academy Awards for 'Best Director' and has never actually won, but mark my words, 'The Departed' is probably going to be the film he finally gets the trophy for. Not just because he's overdue, but because his surprisingly exceptional work in 'The Departed' is more than deserving.Out of all these nearly perfect aspects of the film, the only down-side is that the first fifteen minutes of the film aren't very gripping. No worries, though, the rest of the two hours and fifteen minutes fly by and will have you pinned to your seat. It's one of those films you don't want to end because you are having such a fun time in the movie theater. 'The Departed' is the best film of the year, thus far, and is a reminder of why we as a people go to the movies. Grade: A (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, AZ, 10/07/06)"
mark-fullam,"Oct 23, 2006",10/10,"For all you Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas lovers out there.. you MUST see this movie. its got everything - violence, blood, great 1 liners, great actors, good story.. the lot! I was hooked on this from the first moment I saw it... its a great movie. The Cranberry Juice Bar scene is a classic, along with a many others.. I thought Jack Nicholson deserves a nomination for his character... it was superb.. Technically, the camera work is excellent, some of the ways Scorsese has filmed are just pure genius. It really made you get into the film. The language is course, so if you don't like the ""Cee U Next Tuesday"", then don't go and watch it!. The soundtrack is also very good and matches the mood of the film very well. Overall this is the best film I have seen all year.. by far... I WILL be buying this 1 on DVD... 10 out of 10!"
chadhas,"Oct 29, 2006",10/10,"this is my second time commenting on a movie, the first was when i gave x-men 3 a 1 for being so terrible, and now I am giving The Departed a 10 for being so, so amazing. For all you movie buffs out there, remember how we always say they don't make real movies anymore, movies with plots, and characters, and development, and story lines, and subplots, and just amazing direction...well this is finally a movie we can say reminds us of the good old days. THIS IS A PERFECT MOVIE, AND IF NOT, IT IS VERY CLOSE TO IT. So no talk about what its about, no talk about what happens blah blah blah...just go and watch the Departed and enjoy a true gem for its time."
PCT1970,"May 16, 2019",9/10,"""Infernal Affairs"" is a superb film and so is this ingenious remake. I didn't think Scorsese could top two of his previous gangster masterpieces, ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" but he has. This film has superlative performances by all the actors involved. The plot revolves around two moles, one who infiltrates South Boston's well known criminal organization and the other who infiltrates the police investigating the organization. Once it becomes known by both sides that these moles exist the cat and mouse fight for survival between the two begins. For years Scorsese worked with DeNiro which earned him a Best Actor Award for ""Raging Bull"". However Scorsese has been continuously snubbed for a Best Director and Best Picture Award which he has deserved many times over. Recently he has taken DeCaprio, an excellent artist, under his wing and finally the favor was returned. At last Scorsese has been rewarded for bringing out the best performances from his actors. This film does an outstanding job examining the mobster lifestyle, authority, politics and corruption. This film has masterful acting, directing, cinematography, editing and screenplay. It is one of the finest in it's genre and a bravura film by Scorsese. Bravo Academy! You finally got it right."
fiolvb,"Aug 16, 2020",8/10,"Lots of details - including the soundtrack - make this movie great. Too bad that the credit doesn't go to the rightful author of such a beautifully intricate plot and that's why it's just an 8/10.
Nicholson's acting is superb, Di Caprio and Damon do pretty well, too. Loved Wahlberg's character."
pocilja,"Nov 5, 2006",6/10,"The Departed left me cold, much as many in the movie end up. It was fair, but fell far short of the hype that has been heaped on this flick. Plodding in the middle, with a lot of unnecessary exposition, the movie is too long - perhaps a sign of Scorcese's age. It is nowhere near the level of Casino or Goodfellas, but the plot is interesting. The last 25 mins make the movie exciting. Unfortunately, it closes on a note that makes me question what the actual point was. Acting was generally good. Nicholson, DiCaprio and Damon turn in decent performances (especially DiCaprio, who I doubted could pull off a tough-guy role). Wahlberg's character is extremely irritating and unrealistic. There is no way that a character like his would be present in such a high-ranking position at the state police level. Sorry - people just don't talk like that. I didn't find the movie any more violent than any of the director's previous work (perhaps even less so). However, a major problem I have is that the movie goes out of its way to be VULGAR. I found it quite tasteless and it detracted from my enjoyment of the film. There was a lot of nasty sexual talk in reference to women, etc that not only made it difficult to enjoy with my girlfriend, but felt unnatural. There is also plenty of racial humor to throw around which could possibly be overlooked for the sake of realism, but in light of all the potty mouths also comes off as a bit much. No better than your average misogynistic rap video, I hate to say it, but I don't think this should've been released as an R. It is worse than that. With its decent acting, witty lines and intensity nearly derailed by it's vulgarity, watch and weep for the end of taste in Western cinema."
st_reilly,"Dec 1, 2006",1/10,"This film should have just been called ""Infernal Affairs - Slightly different ending"".All the ranters and ravers of how glorious a film this is are those obviously oblivious to the existence of the far superior Hong Kong original.I'll admit I'm a huge fan of most of Scorsese's other work & was highly anticipating this release but upon watching this I was hugely disappointed, so much so that I almost fell asleep, & the only other times that has happened was during the remake of The Wicker Man - enough said there.Advice for anyone who has not seen this would be see the original & pray Hollywood doesn't make a sequel."
HAPPYMEGHA,"Jul 29, 2020",9/10,"Great movie, very suspenseful. I would recommend it for everyone to see great actors working together to make a this movie. Thrilling Scorsese crime drama with a five star cast and lots of twists and turns. With great performances by Nicholson, Damon, DiCaprio and Wahlberg. The Departed for me is one of the greatest mob movies of all time."
christinadanielle182,"Oct 28, 2006",10/10,"I only went to see this movie because I am doing a project in school about Martin Scorsese. I did not really think that I was going to like it but it was so great!! Martin has a way with doing things in his movies that make them so much different than any movie that I have seen. Leo Decaprio really shines in this movie as does Matt Damon. Actually the cast was a total ""A"" cast. Mark Walburg will keep you laughing every time he is on the screen. This movie has a lot of cussing so I don't think that kids should see it but I would recommend it to anyone else! I promise that you will not be disappointed in this movie. Oh and it is pretty long but it is full of action the entire time!"
akkoziol,"Jun 18, 2007",10/10,"I think is a reworked version of the Chinese movie Infernal Affairs. I haven't seen it but after watching this it reminded me a little bit of Hard Boiled with Chow Yun Fat. Most of the time, foreign movies are reworked by American directors and it turns to crap. While I cannot yet comment on the original, if it's anything like this version, it must be pretty good. This is way above some of his best works, including Goodfellas and I LOVE Goodfellas. I couldn't believe he could top it but he did with this movie. I was sucked into the plot and white-knuckled all the way through the climactic end. Brilliant stuff here folks, don't wait another second."
reggaeregan,"Oct 22, 2006",N/A,"Thought it was pretty terrible. Jack was jack (again) Leo looks like a child and wouldn't last minutes in this scene. As a thriller it didn't thrill and nowhere was there any real visual flourishes ....and please Martin stop using the rolling stones, it doesn't give your film any more depth.This is one of those films were men stand around making grand speeches, indulge in some violence and all take it very seriously and critics fall over themselves when really its dull, dull , dull.This is no 'Goodfellas'PLease speak up anyone who agress as I am sure I will have a few people who disagree with me on this board.THe only plus for me was that it wasn't as terrible as 'Gangs of New York' or as dull as 'The Aviator'"
wandering_rose,"Feb 15, 2007",10/10,"I wouldn't want to spoil one second of this perfectly crafted film by giving anything away and you should do the same when recommending it. Often the advertising hype and public frenzy about a movie proves to be ill-founded. However in the case of ""The Departed"" it was well deserved. Martin Scorsese drew stunning performances out of already incredible actors. The seamless dialog and high emotional intensity didn't let up for a moment. Nicholson was the ultimate sleazy sociopath mob boss and Damon portrayed the pretty-faced bad boy to perfection. DiCaprio continues to astound me with his deep complexity as an actor. I was quickly drawn into his precarious situations and often found myself literally holding my breath on his behalf while awaiting the outcomes. Even Wahlberg and Baldwin, though their roles are supporting rather than lead, maintain a powerful presence throughout. Oh, and let's not forget Martin Sheen(Where has he been, anyway?)excellently playing one of the lone good guys in the film. I am not generally a fan of violent gangster-type movies, and I admit to much cringing and eye-closing. But the story, the acting, the dialog and the edginess hooked me right off. Nicholson's voice-over in the first minutes introduce him as a man with a definite idea of who he is, where he belongs and what he wants out of life. The interactions are snappy and believable with a few really memorable volleys between Wahlberg and Baldwin. We actually had to pause the DVD at times in order to fully enjoy them lest we be still laughing instead of paying attention. I appreciated the non-Tarantino-like directing. Rather than making the violence twistedly funny there are humorous moments within an intense and violent story. And the scarceness of ""Naked Flesh"" kept the story true to its purpose. Well done, Mr. Scorsese."
odie_ven,"Apr 12, 2007",1/10,"Seriously, what's the big fuss about this movie? Too long, too pointless, too slow. After an hour and a half I just couldn't keep watching it. I like suspense movies. This isn't one. Is it supposed to be about the characters? The info about them was so eschew that I didn't know them very well after 90 minutes. What was supposed to be great about it?I absolutely despised that this won best movie in 2007. Seriously. Far better ones in the category. It's outrageous that this is ranked better than movies like Aliens, 2001 Space Oddysey and Forest Gump. Skip it, or just rent it and see for yourself."
bertcampooper,"Oct 17, 2006",N/A,"Since this seems to be the place for overrated and disappointing ensemble movies, this movie should be right at home here. The great cast delivers on the performance end but the story itself is beyond awful. The ending rivals such distasteful and unsatisfying movies such as Road To Perdition or Open Water.Anyone that says they like this film places style over substance. I don't care how slick or how good the performances are, if the story is this disjointed and unappealing, then the movie is crap. This is simply one awful cinema experience regardless of the cast or their performances."
barberoux,"Oct 16, 2006",8/10,"""The Departed"" was good but not excellent. Jack Nicholson hammed it up through most of the movie. If he had less screen time I would have thought he made the movie but there was too much of him being too much. Matt Damon portrayed the nasty little sh!t I always thought was in him. He was great. Leonardo DiCaprio was also very good portraying the mental stress I would think a mob mole would have. Mark Wahlberg could have been a bit over the top but I think his character's personality evolved from working with big ego macho cops and, for me, he was very believable. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone were good in their supporting roles. Vera Farmiga was OK. I guess I didn't believe her as a therapist. I think she need a bit more meat, emotionally, and as the girlfriend, physically. I didn't see the original, ""Infernal Affairs"" so I can't compare the two. This version's story, especially towards the end, seemed rushed and forced to finish with the big gun battle but the mechanics of the movie's cop story was secondary to the story of the two moles. If the movie is examined for the story of the cops trying to get Jack Nicholson it comes up short but the mole parallel story was intriguing and Matt and Leo were great. It was a violent movie and the ending was a bit much. Well worth seeing but not Scorsese's best. His best are icons, ""Raging Bull"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Mean Streets"". ""The Departed"" was just a good movie"
fejimanz,"Oct 9, 2006",10/10,"The Departed (2006) Dir: Martin ScorseseRating:If you like good things... go see this film. Scorsese's best film in years.What's Good About It:They say that people elevate the level of play if they believe in their coach, (Which is evident this year in the miracle that is the Detroit Tigers) and it is evident that every one of these actors (great in their own right) upped every ounce of their game for Scorsese. Scorsese is back to what he does best, (after more than a decade since Casino) and he shows that he hasn't lost any of his balls in the decade, despite the scientific likelihood that his ability to procreate has decreased with age. Anyways, despite a couple things I didn't like on his end, this film was gloriously directed, with the pace of a healthy bowel movement (slow and steady with spurts of speed and spatter). It also brings back a lot of the directorial instinct I liked from Taxi Driver, and haven't really seen him explore again. Some people say that being a child, and being elderly are very similar, and I hope that this is the beginning of Scorsese's second childhood, where he re-finds what made him a unique voice to begin with.OK, the acting in this film is some of the most top notch acting by a group of individuals I have seen in a long time. They don't act like an ensemble (ie United 93) which is what made the film a lot better, all were individuals who were after their own goals, and all even appeared to have their own mini film within in the film. It's something that doesn't work very often unless you get the right mix of actors, and this mix of actors is glorious, all of which I would love to work with.I would love to write a paragraph on all of them from Ray Winstone to Alec Baldwin to Kevin Corrigan but that would take FOREVER... so I will talk about the highlights. Finally... FINALLY!!! someone cast Leonardo DiCaprio in a role that he was suited for, I didn't like him as 'Howard Hughes' in the The Aviator, I thought there were dozens of actors better suited for that role that Leo (I am not saying that he was bad, he just didn't have the tools or the look). I am of the belief that Leo gets miscast more than any other actor, just because people really wanna have Leo in their films, and in only 1 out of 4 films is he ever cast correctly (Such as; Catch Me If You Can, Titanic being the reason people wanna cast him and do so incorrectly for everything he was casted in before this i have no qualms with) I think Leo really defined himself as an adult actor with this role, before he was playing roles that he was still coming of age, or still the young kid. This was an adult role that he took and hit out of the ballpark, out of the number of Oscar nominations I assume this film will get, his will be one that was actually deserved (not to take anything away from the rest of the film, its just a film that the academy will over praise... I am sure).I was happy to see Martin Sheen kickin it again on the big screen, and he was great. The team up with Mark Wahlberg's character made for some of the most memorable portions of the film. Both these actors are actors that I have enjoyed for a while, and I am happy to see them both doing something other than The Italian Job 12 (Wahlberg) and small screen fare (Sheen).That will be all that I go into detail about what is good, for there was so much that I can't really get into it all unless I write an epic... and I don't write epics unless its about 'poo' or 'holes in my shoes' so I shall move on to...What Was Bad:I am going to go out on a limb and say Jack Nicholson. He is so close to brilliance in this film, but I feel it crossed over into ridiculous cartoonish evil. Really I hate to say it, because there is so much to like about the performance, but I even feel that the film makers saw what I saw, and his part in the film feels edited down (also from the information I have read in interviews, and other literature on the film). Though I will give him praise for taking risks in his character (for there were many), because there isn't enough risk taking in Hollywood today, and it was great to see a well established actor (who is known for taking risks) take some.Also I will say this, and I won't write any spoiler, though it doesn't hold a bearing on the story... the last frames of the film, almost ruined it for me... They did something I despise, and that is toss in a simple ass visual metaphor and symbolism just so that the idiot average film goer can think he figured out a ""subtle"" insinuation from the film maker... when and if you see the film you will know what I mean... it's literally the last frames of the film before the creds.Epilogue:If you like any Scorsese, see this film. If you like any Quentin Tarantino (specifically Reservoir Dogs), see this film. BUT DON'T TAKE YOUR MOM'S OR YOUR KIDS!!! This film is rough... so show it to people judiciously."
etl33,"Oct 3, 2006",8/10,"quite good. a little more violent than the hk original though; Scorsese shock value which actually works. plus a bit more humor to spice it up. though i liked both movies, the original turned out to be more suspenseful while this one was the grittier drama. Mark Wahlberg steals the show whenever he's on screen. And his character wasn't even in the original movie. All the major actors did a splendid job. From Alec to Wahlberg, everybody turned in one of their most memorable performances. However, the role of the shrink is just pushing it. Just way too incredible that she's been sleeping with the two guys who are after each other. They could have done away with this subplot, just like in the original. can't say it's Scorsese's best work though. If we are talking crime drama, Goodfellas and Casino are the still the jewels."
PersianPlaya408,"Feb 13, 2007",10/10,"I finally saw the long-awaited classic film from Scorsese. This is one of the best films in the last decade and I am still having a personal discussion with myself on comparing it with some of the my ultimate favorites such as Goodfellas, Casino, Rounders, A Bronx Tale, The Deer Hunter and I am pondering even ranking it higher than my top 3 films the first two godfather's and taxi driver. I think i will need to watch it a couple more times before making such an important decision, but after seeing it once, one thing is for sure, The Departed is a masterpiece. Everything put together by Marty in his own perfect stylistic fashion. The violence is perfect, the cursing is perfect, the actors absolutely committed. Nicholson, Wahlberg, and Dicaprio check in for 3 of their best performances of their careers (and thats saying a lot for nicholson whose had an amazing career). Matt Damon was also good here, a bit subtle and overshadowed by his peers, but nonetheless always convincing. Vera Farmiga was charming and very good in the female lead. Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone and Martin Sheen were perfect in their selective small roles as well. Marty did a great job with this one. I liked Howard Shore's score a lot and Michael Ballhaus's cinematography was amazing, absolutely Oscar worthy. IMDb Rating: 8.4. My rating: 10/10"
LeonLouisRicci,"Jan 3, 2013",7/10,"This has enough violence and gritty street stuff to be another intriguing descent into the world of crime and punishment for Scorsese and his blend of attractive brutality, but it is vastly overrated. It can be confusing and less than engaging as its myriad of mobsters and cops parade in and out of frame with varying results of believability.The acting and characterizations are all over the place with wide ranges of volume and machismo. One example is that the affairs of the heart here are never founded and come across as less than real. Take the scene in the restaurant. Is that for one minute real with its forced laughter? Or the bedroom/sex scene.It is a movie that seems full of itself rather than full. The complexities are so twisted and run by so fast that its hard to keep up with it all. It could be that the pacing is such to give it that dizzying feeling of being trapped like a rat in the bowels of the beast, but its breathless energy sucks the life out of the story and its just whiz-bang, bang, bang, bang.While not without its attractions of audacious anarchy, and it delivers so much that it is hard not to get involved in the goings-on. But the Director has made many better films and one cannot get the feeling that the adulation for this one is misplaced or in place of past disregards."
envision1,"Oct 3, 2016",6/10,"I wanted to love it, I wanted to be captivated, I wanted to be taken for a ride of action, mystery, and suspense. And well It was like ordering your favorite meal only to bite into it and find it sorta tasted like it was supposed to. You keep chewing trying to love it but it's just a bit off. That's this film.It plays out like a slick mystery novel - everything revolves around the narrative and everything happens to conveniently fit perfectly in place.While this isn't bad necessarily it comes at the expense of the characters being more interesting. Even with the all star cast line up it doesn't do much to give anything more than a cardboard cut out for the characters.How this won an academy award is certainly a wonder. Either the competition that year was terrible, or the judges simply looked at the names in the credit roll and felt like in order to keep their jobs they had to vote for it.The movie opens up laboriously slow trying to give you a background and history of the main characters, but what it fails to do is make you feel connected to the characters - it comes off slow and trite. It's just too forced and almost feels like a soap opera for the first 15-2 minutes.The major low in the film is when Billy somehow is supposed to fall in love with Madolyn and vice versa. The movie makes about as much effort to sell you on it as a bad porno. IE: Therapist girl gives one session with Billy, kicks him out. And then somehow a few scenes later they're knocking boots. It was just so terribly unrealistic or believable, but then again most other things in this film are. Now film works by the viewers suspending but this film just fails to really engage the viewer with the characters which would then allow you to suspend belief. So many things in this film come off as trite.Overall a watchable film but despite it's all star line up it's a very forgettable film."
popcorned1,"Oct 9, 2006",10/10,"I haven't voted ""10"" for a movie before - I've always felt that giving a ""10"" rating is that's like saying there's no room for improvement, and there are always elements that could have been done better. And no matter what you're doing, there's always room for improvement. But this was a definite 10. The pacing, the plot, the characters, the performances... This was a terrific movie. There's no doubt that in the future The Departed will be the new benchmark for this genre.The cast is brilliant. I have always been a fan of Nicholson, and here he is even better than usual. Some say he is too over-the-top, but I disagree. The character he plays is himself over the top, and I think it is a perfect performance. Damon's Colin Sullivan is a stunning picture of evil. A man with terrific abilities and, the way he looks to that golden dome, a man with dreams of other better things, but he is so hooked into his patron that he can't get out, and in the end embraces the entanglements as what his life is. Leonardo is such a classic tragic figure in this. Unbelievable... To be willing to sacrifice himself in this way. I think it shows a more realistic picture of what this kind of double life must be than anything I have seen.Every supporting character is just as flawlessly portrayed. I may never vote ""10"" again, but this one deserves it. Scorcese's best ever."
one_way1983,"Oct 16, 2006",9/10,"Great film! The film is very funny and you can hear the laughter in the theater with the numerous raunchy jokes made by Nicholson, Baldwin, Walberg and even Dicaprio. This was an all star cast and the film was beautifully acted. Martin Scorse shows why he is a great director because he kept me surprised throughout the film. What you expect to happen does not happen. This is a film that kept me entertained throughout and I don't regret going. the best gangster movie I've seen in years. Leonardo Dicaprio deserves some type of nominations for best actor for this film because the emotions he brought to this role was better than great. Seeing the transformation in his character due to the circumstances that he is forced to partake in makes him a hell of an actor that is deserving of a golden globe or Oscar nomination."
Joseph_Gillis,"Oct 10, 2006",8/10,"Plot Outline: A police plant tries to infiltrate a Boston gang-lord's crime empire, while the gang-lord's police mole tries to expose him.Talk about the proverbial 'film of two halves'!!Martin Scorsese's latest film ""The Departed"" is his loose re-working/ trans-location of the acclaimed Hong Kong thriller, ""Infernal Affairs"", which spawned two sequels, one of which was, effectively, a 'prequel'.When I saw the earlier film on the festival circuit some three years ago, I was bowled over, even more than I had been by John Woo's kinetic thriller, ""Hard-Boiled"" from some 10 years earlier. What made ""Infernal Affairs"" so special, besides the technical excellence of the production and the fast-paced, high-octane action, was its emphasis on characterisations: particularly in what I regarded as the key, indeed the only players of any necessary substance: Tony Leung as the police plant, and Andy Lau, as the crime-lord's mole.The problem with Martin Scorsese's 're-working', and, while I recognise that he is at liberty to expand the narrative to broaden the supporting characterisations, is the way he allows himself to be compromised by the star turns and the 'alternate agendas'.So, and in what I refer to as the first 'half' we get too much of: Jack Nicholson, (whose HK equivalent was, at best, a two-dimensional peripheral character), revelling in an excessive quota of 'Jack-isms': think 'The Shining'; ""Batman"", etc, etc. Alec Baldwin, in his latest incarnation of his 'Glengarry Glenn Ross'/'The Cooler' hard-man, seemingly revelling in his ever-expanding waistline; Leonardo Di Caprio, who had to be given plenty of opportunity to emote, his 'Aviator' Oscar play having fallen short. while Ray Winstone gets to drop the Cockney hard-man stunt in favour of its Bostonian equivalent.Then, just when I was about to doze off, having realised too late just why Martin Scorsese needed 140 minutes to tell his story, he cranked the gears up a few notches.Matt Damon's gang-lord's police mole realises he's got to move fast before Di Caprio's good guy undercover cop brings his (Damon's) employer's empire crashing down and, in a daring move, orders a police tail on the head of the police undercover unit, thus hoping to flush out Di Caprio: the resultant 10 minutes or so of breakneck, white-knuckle tension, even if it does rely too much on the original and 'The French Connection' for inspiration, is almost worth the price of admission alone,culminating as it does in a tragic death which ultimately precipitates a breakneck pace of cross and double-cross.This is where Scorsese really comes into his own, with the kind of frenetic, yet sure-paced action sequences not seen since the heyday of ""Goodfellas"". Pausing briefly to swiftly despatch Nicholson's crime-lord, (which couldn't have come too soon, in my opinion), he constantly keeps us guessing as to the next twist and turn of the tail, and which of the 'double agents' will eventually prevail, and at what cost.A 'film of two halves', indeed, and while the second 'half', of perhaps 50 minutes or so, probably contains more cinematic merit than most Hollywood productions of at least the past 5 years, ultimately this has to be seen as a missed opportunity for Scorsese.As with 'The Aviator', Scorsese seems these days to be compromised too much in his artistic 'vision', to such an extent that I don't believe that this is 100% the film he wanted to make. 'The Aviator' seemed to me partly an Oscar vehicle for Di Caprio's (admittedly fine) acting, and part Scorsese 'Citizen Kane' homage: granted it was, after all, a Di Caprio vehicle.Here, once again, it appears to me that far too much screen time is devoted to 'Jack-isms', and more (unconvincing) brooding Di Caprio 'emoting'. As if, 'the Aviator' pitch having failed, they'd make sure of it this time. The trouble is, while Di Caprio is certainly a fine actor, who, I believe has yet to achieve his peak, more often than not he's trying too hard in this film in what is an underwritten role, lumbered with often puerile dialogue.And, where acting is concerned, don't get me started on Alec Baldwin, (whose acting capabilities seem to decline in inverse proportion to his waistline), or to Mark Wahlberg's cardboard-cutout undercover sergeant 'character'. Matt Damon, who doesn't try too hard, almost reaches what for me was his peak of 'The Talented Mr Ripley' But it was good to see Ray Winstone doing a 'foreign' accent, for a change.Once again, Scorsese's choice of music was impeccable: And I so loved his apt placement of Roy Buchanan's sublime, bluesy guitar rendition of Patsy Cline's ""Sweet Dreams"".Would that all of Scorsese's moves had been as sure."
dini-n,"Jan 2, 2007",10/10,"Definitely the greatest movie with a lot of stars in it. When you see the cast you think is gonna be bad movie just because it has a lot of stars in it but that's not a case with this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is great like always he lives with the character, same for Matt Dammon, but what makes this movie even greater is no doubt Mark Whalberg, he is great and different from that what we are used to see him. And in the end Jack Nicholson, well you all know Jack, NO WORDS, he just has to be the best.... like always. So I am very pleased with this movie and I won't think twice about seeing it again. Martin Scorsese has done a great job and gave the real movie liker a great movie to spend 90 great minutes. I saw the voting and I think that this movie deserves more then 10."

I was never much of a Leo fan but I fell in love with him in this movie and am now going back and watching as many of his movies as possible. He plays an EXTREMELY convincing role as Billy Costigan. The movie kept me intrigued 100% and I was never bored. I knew the ending was coming up (based on the events) but found myself wishing it wouldn't end yet (even though it's actually a longer movie). I consider the movie to be of Matrix style in which you must pay complete attention to really grasp everything that's going on. The movie is complex and has a surprise ending. It does however, explain its title...The Departed. This is most definitely a MUST SEE movie."
sbrdar,"Oct 8, 2006",6/10,"Having seen Infernal Affairs, I had expectations that were perhaps unrealistic. The 2002 film from Hong Kong had action and depth. The writers of The Departed took an excellent story and expanded it. The additions made added nothing to the story, in fact they detracted from the main characters' struggles. The expansion of the mob boss character only served to highlight Jack Nicholson. While I enjoy Jack as much as the next person, the story is more about Costigan and Sullivan and their struggle with each other and their own demons. I will admit that the acting was very good. Unfortunately, a great cast does not necessarily mean a great movie. Scorsese was over the top in terms of the violence and side stories. All in all, I was very disappointed. I expect American audiences will be pleased enough."
sansay,"Feb 27, 2007",1/10,"This movie sucked big time. I agree with all of those who complained about the abusive and unrealistic cursing, specially when coming from the cops. It makes no sense that educated people whose job it is to run investigations would keep talking like that all the time. But even if you choose to suspend disbelief on that matter, there are just too many inconsistencies to be able to let yourself taken in for the ride. Other viewers have described them very well, so I thank them for saving me the time. I also felt a great disappointment since I used to think that Martin Scorsese was a great director. Well no more I guess. Just another big commercial production which just doesn't fly... Too many heavy weights and too much pandering to the lowest common denominators, this recipe usually favored by Hollywood only succeeded in giving me an indigestion... buuurrrp!!!"
DavidHasselh0ff,"Feb 8, 2007",10/10,"I consider myself a very discerning movie watcher, and am completely opposed to cheesy, Hollywood ridiculousness UNLESS it comes from Martin Scorsese. The guy could make an infomercial for spray on pubic hair and I would love it. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the Departed, and actually thought that the last shot of the rat on the railing with the government building in the background to be a perfect way to end things. Is this as a result of my devotion to Scorsese? I have read some posts that point out this scene as ridiculous, and I am just wondering what the consensus is on that particular issue? Alec Baldwin gave yet another incredible performance, almost on par with his movie stealing acting from Glengarry Glen Ross. The other thing I could see someone not hopelessly devoted to Scorsese taking issue with was the scene in which Costello's guy died on the couch before revealing Costigan as a bad guy. That seemed a little bit ridiculous. The violence in this film was done beautifully I thought, and yet I read some conments stating that the part where Martin Sheens character hits the ground and his blood sprays up on Costigan as looking fake. I could not disagree more, I though it looked quite realistic. Am i completetly blindfolded by my respect for Scorsese?"
the-movie-guy,"Oct 4, 2006",9/10,"(Synopsis) The city of South Boston has been taken over by the Irish mob boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The Massachusetts State Police Department has set up the Special Investigations Unit to collect evidence and put Costello and his men in jail. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has just graduated from the state police academy, and has been assigned to infiltrate Costello's gang by the unit chief. Billy joins the mob and begins to earn Costello's trust. Years earlier, Costello was able to get one of his men, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), to infiltrate the state police. Colin is assigned to the Special Investigations Unit, the same unit that is trying to take Costello down. The only problem for the police is that Colin keeps Costello informed as to what the police are about to do. Eventually, the police and the mob discover that a mole has infiltrated their ranks. Each man is living a double life where one misstep will mean life or death if he is caught.(My Comment) This was a noteworthy movie with many memorable performances. Jack Nicholson's performance as an evil psychopath will get him an Oscar nomination. Several others probably will also be nominated for this film. The movie is graphically violent and shows the dark side of crime. It shows what it takes to work uncover as a cop or as a criminal. Costello said, ""does it matter who is holding a gun to your head, it is all the same."" Both sides risk their lives every day. It is a long movie, but the time passes very fast.

lee_eisenberg,"Feb 24, 2007",10/10,"The 79th Annual Academy Awards will run tomorrow night, and ""The Departed"" is one of the Best Picture nominees. All that I can say is that they have to award Martin Scorsese this time. ""The Departed"" hits you like I have almost never seen in a movie. It is an absolutely great movie in terms of the acting.First, we get narration from aging mafioso Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). He's been pragmatic about many things throughout his life, but he's never given up his life of crime and being one of the nastiest people whom you could imagine. Then, there's Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), joining Boston's police force but secretly infiltrating the mafia. Next, there's Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), one of Costello's acolytes secretly infiltrating the police. Add psychologist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) to the mix, and you have a practically explosive situation.One thing that you should understand about this movie is that almost every character is a total creep and there are basically no good guys; Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) is particularly bad. With all these characters being so vile, it is no surprise that we see violence and brutality that movies almost never show. It's the sort of stuff that makes you feel like the characters are pounding your face in. Don't be surprised if you walk away from ""The Departed"" feeling very shaken up. And you'll probably never want to be a cop after watching this.Anyway, I say that even if they don't give the movie Best Picture, they gotta give Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar. His direction is top notch (as is almost every other aspect of the movie). I wholeheartedly recommend it. Also starring Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Kevin Corrigan."
departed07,"Jul 18, 2007",10/10,"Taxi Driver was hailed at the movie of the seventies; Raging Bull was the film of the eighties; Good Fellas was the film of the nineties; now in this decade, Martin Scorsese returns to his mafia roots, not in New York or New Jersey, but brings his mafia to Boston where in this update of Infernal Affairs it's mean, violent, frightening with full of surprises, and Jack is Back making The Departed Martin Scorsese's definitive film of this decade.""When you're faced with a loaded gun...what's the difference?""In The Departed, Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon play different sides of the law that go in the opposite directions in their careers; Leo is Billy Costigan, a smart recruit who flunked the academy but is hired by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the foul-mouth Sgt. Dignam (Mark Whalberg) to go undercover inside mob boss Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) team and get any information; Matt is Colin Sullivan who is not only a smart prodigy to Frank, but once he is promoted to the Special Unit Investigations leaded by Capt. Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), it's up to Colin to make sure that he gives Frank the early step.In a game of cat and mouse, both sides of the law want to find out who the mole is in their operative sources while at the same time both William and Colin are taken in by the father-son figures of their work with Frank thinking of William as a son despite his henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone) breaking him down. Just like most movies, there is always the love interest. Vera Farmiga who is unknown to a lot of general film freaks like myself plays the police psychiatrist who falls in love with Colin's Suffolk education attitude while she sees Billy as her patient and falls for both characters despite not knowing that both are undercover operatives.Everyone gives top notch performances, but everybody knows that the one who steals the show is none other than Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello. Nicholson's performance as Costello brings back the devil's grin that made everybody loved villains in the first place; compared to the sadistic Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York, Jack's performance is one that people will be talking about and reenacting.On another note about the film, the editing of the film is top notch with Thelma Schoonmaker giving it all she's got bringing energetic life to the movie. The screenplay by William Monahan is excellent after reading the script from purchasing the two disc special edition on February 13, 2007 and this is Martin Scorsese's best film ever."

Buddy-51,"Feb 22, 2007",7/10,"In Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed,"" Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play dueling ""moles"" working at cross purposes on opposite sides of the law. Di Caprio is Billy Costigan, a rookie recruited by the Massachusetts State Police to go undercover to infiltrate the gang headed by Irish mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Damon is Colin Sullivan, a seemingly straight-laced detective who, in reality, is a ""rat"" planted by Costello in the heart of the investigative unit, whose job it is to tip the mob boss off when the cops are getting just a little too close to his unsavory operations.The film, a remake of the Hong Kong flick ""Infernal Affairs,"" finds Scorcese back in the familiar territory of tough-talking ethnic gangsters (although for once the Italians are let off the hook) and urban violence. In terms of box office receipts and year's-end awards ceremonies, the return trip has certainly paid off handsomely for the director. Yet, for all the accolades it has garnered, ""The Departed"" falls short of the ""Goodfellas"" glory of a decade and a half ago for reasons that are not always easy to pinpoint or fathom.On the positive side, Scorcese, never one to stint on his performers, has gathered a powerhouse cast for the occasion. In addition to Di Caprio and Damon, who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far, the movie boasts Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles. Nicholson does yet another variation of the sardonic, scenery-chewing bad guy he's done countless times before, but since nobody does that shtick better than he, we don't mind watching it yet another time.The greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline, as the parallel cat-and-mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion. There's a near-balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side. One must credit Siu Fai Mak, who wrote the original screenplay - here skillfully adapted by William Monahan - for much of the film's success.Yet, despite its many virtues of script and performance, there seems to be something oddly lacking in ""The Departed"" - a kind of unity and focus that turned ""Goodfellas"" into an instant classic of the gangster film genre. The deliberately clipped editing, which results in abrupt, awkward transitions between individual scenes, gives the film a self-consciously hurdy-gurdy quality that seems more artifice than art. The dialogue is often more mannered than it needs to be, and Scorcese has done surprisingly little to make the Boston locale an integral part of the drama (think back to how Sydney Lumet's managed that feat in ""The Verdict""). The story is interesting, in and of itself, but we never find ourselves very deeply engaged in the fate of the characters, which is the last charge one could ever level against ""Goodfellas."" Moreover, even the violence in ""The Departed"" is handled much less effectively than it was in ""Goodfellas."" In the earlier movie, the violence - and even the threat of violence - was cringe-inducing, unsettling and disturbing, with the Joe Pesci character, in particular, keeping the audience in a state of dreaded anticipation throughout, but in ""The Departed,"" the blows land with very little impact, and the violence is really not much different from what one might find in any decently executed, garden variety action film.Perhaps it's unfair to keep making these constant comparisons to ""Goodfellas,"" a standard that, let's face it, very few directors would ever be able to live up to even on their best day of film-making. It's just that Scorcese set the bar so high, for himself as well as for others, with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product.A good film but not a great one."
joycecarrera2002,"Oct 23, 2006",10/10,"With this type of all-star cast, you have certain expectations when seeing this film - and it MET or EXCEEDED each and every one of them! The acting was impeccable, you either hate who you should hate, or love who you should love. Mark Walhberg was hard-core, Leonardo was, as Leonardo usually is, gorgeous and believable and deep, Matt Daman played the asshole to the tee. Jack Nicholson, well, what can you say about one of the greatest actors ever to step foot onto the big screen. When he wants to look like the devil, he IS THE DEVIL! The ending was such a shock and it kept on coming and coming  like we all love.Annoying factors: WHAT WAS IN THE LETTER? What happened to the baby? Those are unanswered questions that should have been included in the ending. Will there be a PART II to tie up all the loose ends? There should be  but who is left????"
rallierf1,"Dec 6, 2006",6/10,It is a 100% copy of the Internal Affairs movie so actually there is nothing original about it. I watched both movies back to back and compared them and not only i found that it was thoroughly copied but also this high paid cast wasn't a match for the Chinese actors which were really embodied in the roles. If u think u liked that movie i pity you because u actually lost the opportunity to really enjoy the real masterpiece (INTERNAL AFFAIRS). Damn it seems that Hollywood has run out of original ideas completely!!!! As soon as i watched the first few scenes i realized that it was a duplicate and knew exactly what would happen in the movie.IF I could RATE IT SUB-ZERO I WOULD!!! I ONLY REGISTERED JUST TO WRITE THIS ONE COMMENT BECAUSE I FIND IT DISGRACEFUL FROM Hollywood!!!!
jte6451,"Mar 28, 2019",9/10,"""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want the environment to be a product of me."" - Frank CostelloA remake of the Hong Kong thriller, Infernal Affairs, The Departed is once again yet another crime masterpiece that deals with identity and deception, and it's all done in such style that only Scorsese can pull off.Set in contemporary Boston, it follows Irish Mob boss Frank Costello who plants a mole within the Massachusetts State Police while, at the same time, the police sends an undercover cop to infiltrate Frank's organization. Eventually, both sides realizes what's going on and both moles race to identify each other before their covers are blown.In an age when remakes are often inferior to the original, there comes a remake where it takes the original concept and gives it its own unique style, and this is no exception. From its moving cameras, to its cinematography, Scorsese incorporates his own style into this film and gives it a gritty and tense feel to it. The editing, for the most part, moves at a steady and flowing pace, even if some moments where the editing moves frantically.The two major themes the movie deals with are identity and deception. Both moles are simultaneously trying to discover who each other are, but, at the same time, trying to blend into an environment they aren't originally from without revealing their true motives. It's also noted that both men, despite being different from each other, constantly competing in a similar manner is so clear and strong that it makes for some really intense moments.These intense and emotional moments wouldn't be possible without its star-studded cast, and each one delivers. Leonardo DiCaprio puts on a captivating performance as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon is great as Colin Sullivan, and, of course, Jack Nicholson, who might be the best performance in the movie, is outstanding as Frank Costello.Overall, The Departed is an excellent thriller. Emotionally gripping, thematic, and elegantly cinematic, it's one of Scorsese's best films and it's one of the best pieces of cinematic art.Final Verdict: 9/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness."
aleksandarthemight,"Jan 25, 2013",10/10,"Well I m not big fan of Scorsese but this movie is great,I really love Leonardo DiCaprio(I m not homo)he s one of my best actors and I get really mad when he get killed but I was very happy when Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon)get what he deserve,he was like sneaky,freaky,cocky bastard ready to stab you in the back,Jack Nicholson(I don t like him to much)but he was hilarious especially with scene in cinema full of perverts.Vera Farmiga from Running scared to this well Scorsese should take her more and I should watch more movies with her.Daddy Sheen well no comment for him ,his the old school so I give respect for that.Anthony Anderson(I don t see point of his role Scorsese probably put him because of rumors about that Scorsese was racist)Mark Wahlberg,well what should I said I don t know he never be specific like actor,you can watch him in comedy,romance,actions but honestly I got no opinion about him,Plot is great,script was very strong and scenes are pretty tense.Anybody who said that movie is boring and stupid, he should need watch movie again."
Oktay_Tuna,"Jul 6, 2020",9/10,"What a magnificent movie this was. The acting, directing, writing, production design, song choices; all were brilliant. I think, Jack Nicholson is the movie's indispensable factor. The Nicholson-Leo and Nicholson-Damon relations were by far the best part of this movie. The dialogues were sharp, the acting was fabulous and the directing was awe-inspiring. Just like all the Scorsese ""pictures"", this movie takes its time at the start, and delivers magnificently at the end. There were a lot of unexpected events in this movie, compared to Scorsese's other movies, which I really enjoyed. Brilliant movie, go check it out(if you haven't already)"

All those phrases you hear when you watch a movie trailer, ""Gripping..."" ""Breath-taking..."", totally apply to this movie. See it. Love it. Enjoy it.

elliotjeory,"Jul 27, 2020",10/10,"I love this film. The way it is shot, the characters and the acting is all done on a grand scale. So many enjoyable quotes from Jack Nicholson's character. Many iconic scenes like a typical Scorsese film and of course a fantastic soundtrack on par with Scorsese's previous films."
DaveDiggler,"Aug 13, 2007",7/10,"The 2006 Academy Award winning director Martin Scorsese has brought us some of the greatest films of all time to American Cinema and stands as one of the greatest directors to ever live. With films like ""Raging Bull,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" Goodfellas,"" and more recently ""The Aviator"" and ""Gangs of New York."" Marty now has the best film of 2006 to add to that list of greats with ""The Departed.""""When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"" This is coldly and meticulously uttered by Boston Mob Boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The significance of the memorable quote tells us that no matter who you are or what you've done; when death is staring you in the face, it takes no prisoners. Costello says this to a group of young impressionable kids and among these impressionable kids is Frank Costello's next and future pawn- the wise, savvy, charismatic, charming, and slick talking Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon, who gives his best acting performance of his career on the heels of another great performance in Robert De Niro's, ""The Good Shepherd"". From the start we see Colin headed down a path of corruption and deception as he is groomed to become a spy in the Massachusetts State Police for Frank Costello and his Boston mafia. His counterpart, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a cadet who has been kicked out of the academy and the only way he will ever be able to serve the commonwealth is by going undercover and infiltrating Frank Costello's crew for Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen). Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) are the only two people that know Billy is a cop. Academy Award nominee, Mark Wahlberg does a great job as the fast talking, always ready for anything, humorous cop that will make you think this is a comedy at certain points in the film instead of a thrilling drama. Dignam can be cold, callous, and most of all, a dirty cop like the rat he hunts for in SIU.As Billy and Colin rise in their respective fields, the tension mounts as suspicion in both the State Police and Costello's crew heats up in search for the rat(s). There are twists and turns in every direction. As they become more and more aware of each others presence the anticipation becomes almost unbearable as both look to find each other and take each other out to protect their own skins.The film brings in plot twist after plot twist and manages to maintain its structure thanks to a perfect script by Academy Award winner, William Monahan. The two opposing figures in the film- Colin and Billy- frantically search and scheme their way to the top all the while sharing a sexual relationship with a psychiatrist, named Madolyn. Both characters fall for her and both unknowingly become twisted in a love triangle that only she knows about, but has no clue how grave her situation is. The motives for each falling in love with the psychiatrist is something to pay close attention to. Look for the reasons Colin wants a girl, and look for the reasons Billy wants a girl. One is putting on an act at all times, and both men struggle to keep their identity in check.Costello puts fear in the heart of both Billy and Colin as he starts to question everyone around him as the heat is turned up on him. Jack Nicholson gives one of his greatest performances of his career, and an Oscar worthy one at that. The psychological fear and mind games that he plays with both Colin and Billy make them fear that their conscience might be getting the best of them. This is something to truly admire and become utterly stunned by as both actors do such a great job of portraying the paranoia. Costello is not your typical gang leader. He is upper class with a little L Street mentality still left in him. He like's to go and listen to the opera. He loves fine wines and lobster dinners (with a side of bloody hand that could make anyone queasy- especially the nervous wreck that is Billy Costigan.). He also doesn't mind indulging in a little annoying fly, that may be crossing his face at the wrong time, or even a little coke to set the mood so that he's comfortably numb. He has his flaws as every man does, but Frank doesn't recognize any weaknesses because he's just so good at making a habit of getting away with murder. The very deep characters surrounding Costello, along with Costello himself, make this a ""must see."" We watch the drama unfold as the pressure on both Colin and Billy mounts as their guilt of deception and criminal activity makes both men start looking for a safe way out. They realize they both can only take so much and neither sees a way out that doesn't result in death. Colin wants to become a political influence in the community as he goes to law school at nights while Billy just wants his identity back. Neither are able to depart from Costello as he has a strangle hold on their every day lives. This is where we see the characters become three-dimensional and where we start to gravitate towards the characters- good or bad. We see what they are and how far they've fallen. Their weaknesses make them so humane that it's impossible to not feel or root for them.As the body count rises and the pressure is turned up one notch at a time before the final standoff the film becomes mesmerizing. The shocking and surprising ending will leave some pleasantly surprised or some looking for answers and disappointed. For most directors this would be their crowning achievement, but for Martin Scorsese, it just another classic to add the resume."
kairingler,"Jun 28, 2008",10/10,"Wow this movie really takes you're breath away. What an all-star cast, you have Jack Nickolson, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Anderson, Matt Damon, and Leonardo DiCaprio. i think i like Leo's character the best though,, there are a lot of plot twists in this one,, i think this is also probably Jack Nickolson's best work in a very long time, this kind of role seems to suit him, Mark Wahlberg's character was very intriguing too, Matt Damon did a fairly decent job here, this is much better than the Good Shepard,, which Leonardo passed on wisely.. This gangster movie has it all,, people getting thrown off of roofs,, blood splattering everywhere,, hey i almost forgot Martin Sheen is also in this,, and he did a superb job as well, i think this is the best since Goodfellas, this movie has a lot of twists like i said,, i won't ruin the ending,, but you will be in suspense right up until the end, no matter who you choose to root for,, all in all i have to give this movie a very big thumbs up."
ddaigle3,"Feb 18, 2007",6/10,"My main objection to the movie was the vast amount of flaws in the storyline, e.g., Damon was selected to this elite team and no one questioned how he could afford the apartment when he was raised by an elderly grandmother with no money...Dicaprio comes into the police when he knows that the only person there who can identify him as an undercover cop is gone, how stupid is that...Wahlberg quits and leaves Dicaprio without anybody to help him and shouldn't Wahlberg be at least a little suspicious that his boss was killed because he was being followed by Damon's crew, don't quit because you keep your friends close and your enemies even closer...why did Damon warn Nicholson about the second tail when he sent the message where the exchange was to take place...why did Dicaprio stay around when Sheen got killed, he was not the type to go into shock and he knew he was being chased by the killer crew...why did Sheen not protect himself against the killer crew...and finally the shrink she was allowed to live even tho she knew that Damon was guilty.

Playing the creepy crime lord that will do anything to get what he wants. I'm not going to give anything away about this film but the ending is great.

Faisal_Flamingo,"Nov 8, 2006",8/10,"What a Disappointment! .. The Departed Goes Actually Nowhere! I'm not saying the movie is awful but it isn't great .. yeah, there's a big load of excitement but I think it is too big for the movie to handle it and most parts of the movie aren't even, it is an OK at its best .. Martin Scorsese did cast a bunch of Hollywood's class ""A"" Actors and he was relying on the good performances that they could give to empower the movie but unfortunately they all were So-So except for Mark Whalberg who gave an OK performance but his little role didn't give him a chance to do any better .. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was bad & disappointing .. so is Matt Damon. Nicholson's performance is OK but not at his best.What I miss in that movie is the depth .. I feel like if it is a cheap thriller movie with a great excitement but it makes no sense sometimes. I felt that the movie is disconnected and not very solid!!! When you read most of the reviews that praising the movie .. you feel that it is the movie of the millennium or of the year .. but actually The Departed goes nowhere .. it was going to be an OK thriller that you watch and forget about it the next day until the horrible ending blew up all the ""OK"" work .Martin Scorsese did a great job on cinematography but he didn't give a depth to his exciting story. I'm a big fan of Scorsese's .. Martin Scorsese has directed great movies that we loved such; After Hours, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas .. I wouldn't call ""The Departed"" one of his best .. probably his worst.I'm not comparing the moving with any movies .. I even haven't seen ""Infernal Affairs"".It is an exciting thriller .. you will enjoy it but by the ending you will feel that you are lost in the middle of nowhere because of the lacking of the necessary minimum depth and it was just a stupid ending. I highly doubt that the movie will receive any big nominations at the Oscars or any other big film awards.That's what Hollywood dose to a movie! .. it makes it only ""pretty"" pointless picture! Overall, it isn't a bad movie .. it is enjoyable most of the time .. watch it without high expectations and you will save the big disappointment."
Awakening124,"Oct 8, 2006",9/10,"Acting: Top notch. Everyone involved gives a top caliber performance and, let me just say, it's so good to see Nicholson being the crazy badass we all know and love again. Even though Baldwin doesn't have much screen time, he steals the show with almost all of his lines.Dialogue: I cracked up more than once, and I felt myself barely breathing the rest of the time. It went from darkly humorous to riveting in a flash, and did so brilliantly.Story: I gasped more than once during the ending, if that's any inclination. This movie's long, but it more than held my interest the entire time so I'm not complaining.So why didn't I give The Departed a ten? It was held back from true greatness by shoddy editing (I noticed at least ten inconsistencies, and I'm sure there were more that I missed since I was so entertained) and a very serious flow problem. It jumped from scene to scene so quickly that I found myself confused a decent part of the time, especially in the beginning, and a good portion of scenes were completely useless. For example, there's a one minute long scene of Nicholson's character throwing crack on a bed and telling a hooker to snort it 'till she's numb that comes out of nowhere, and disappears just as quickly. You could say it was to show how screwed up his character was but, trust me, there was plenty of whacked out crap to serve as proof of the villain's madness, so the scene was useless.Despite its flaws, though, it shouldn't be missed. Scorsese does it again with this brutal, dark caper that keeps you guessing up until the end. You'll laugh, you'll jump, and you'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor. There's one scene in particular, centering around a cell phone 'conversation' in which nothing is said and both characters stare at the phone, simply thinking. If the actors weren't as brilliant as they are, it'd be a waste, but their talent lets you practically be able to read their minds. Simply brilliant.If you're a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Scorsese, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg or Alec Baldwin, GO SEE THIS MOVIE."

kevinrajeshvellimana,"Apr 20, 2021",10/10,"Considering the overwhelmingly positive critical as well as laymen reviews this movie has garnered over the years, it would certainly be an understatement to content that this movie solidified the quality of Scorsese as a promising and exceptionally talented director to such an extent that it earned him his long awaited 'Academy Award for Best Direction'. This movie also turned out to be the only Scorsese film to ever earn an 'Academy Award for Best Picture'. This movie is certainly my second favorite Scorsese film of all time (behind Goodfellas at #1). This is undeniably one of the best movies of the century so far. This movie has it all! From top-notch acting to a complicated and tricky plot involving dilemmas of the protagonist as well as the antagonist and spectacular action sequences to notoriously brutal violence. This movie perfectly encompasses everything that is expected of a Scorsese film. Certainly deserves a 10/10 rating from me."
sonnylavelle,"Feb 13, 2019",8/10,"I finally saw this again after first seeing it at the theatre in '06, and it's gotten even better.Everything about this movie is excellent. The acting is next level and the craftsmanship that Is applied to every shot is a dream. I shouldn't be surprised of course, but it's nice to still be surprised sometimes!"
javert-8,"Aug 9, 2020",8/10,"Spent the first part of the film thinking DiCaprio and Damon were the same person and thinking it was some sort of flashback/Sliding Doors thing! Doh! Once the penny dropped I really enjoyed it, especially the ending, was not expecting that."
dioditto,"Nov 15, 2006",1/10,"First of all, I must say this is THE worst Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen. I usually like Scorsese's movie, but this one is the first one I have encounter that totally blow me away in its awfulness.My first problem with The Departed is the casting. They got a bunch of baby-face fruitcakes like Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Anthony Anderson and Mark Wahlberg which totally throws the suspension of disbelief out of the window. It is like watching a bunch of boy scouts playing cops and robbers - None of them look like cops - more like boy scouts.Secondly, the acting, is just wooden. There is no subtlety in the acting, and they try to cover that up by over-acting, and constant swearing. (Perhaps it is to make them look more ""mature"" for their part.) Now, about the plot, it is pretty thin, and confusing at times, lacks clarity or resolve. The several scenes made me cringe, particularly when Jack Nicholson tries to torture Leonardo DiCaprio, it just seems totally unbelievable after Jack Nicholson violently tortured DiCaprio and he trusted him AGAIN!!Now, about Matt Damon's acting in this movie, it is pretty god damn bad. In fact, what acting!!?? Matt Damon just doesn't emote at all!! He is as souless and as wooden as a robot. It is extremely wooden as if he is the living proof that Pinocchio exist!Leonardo's acting is more of his usual self, pretty boy in distress with endless whinings to anyone who would lend his ears to him - but in this movie, he seems particularly out of place. The character development lacks subtle internal conflicts presented in the original character so involving and multi-dimensional.Jack Nicholson is just his usual sly scoundrel self. Totally uninspiring acting. Same goes with Martin Sheen's super stiff acting. Anthony Anderson is totally mis-casted in this movie as if he is a comic relief (and yet there is nothing comic about it)The character development and inter-character dynamics are almost non-existent between the two rivaling characters (Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon) it is as if they are in two separate movies. The movie not only lacks any subtlety but blatantly plays up the caricatures of what we perceived as ""mafia"" - loud mouth constantly swearing goons - it is both extremely cliché and uninteresting.The plot is also pretty confusing due to extremely bad direction, it lacks focus, and the camera work is also chaotic and uninteresting."
mattfogarty9,"Jul 15, 2019",10/10,This is the best crime movie in 20 years for me. I can watch this one over and over again.
lukem-52760,"Aug 18, 2019",8/10,"The Departed is one of if not the best films of legendary Director ""MARTIN SCORSESE"" i know his masterpiece would probably be the Classic Taxi Driver but his edge of the seat, suspense Cop Thriller ""The Departed"" is definitely in the top 5 of the best movie's Scorsese has ever made, along with the brilliant ""Cape Fear"" that's another Classic suspense Thriller from the legendary Director. Scorsese definitely studied the 70's Cop Classic Serpico whilst making this movie.The Departed is a gritty Cops & Criminals Thriller with a brilliant cast of some of the best actors in Hollywood!!!Leonardo DiCaprio is TRULY outstanding here as young undercover rookie Cop Billy Costigan, leo gives one of his greatest screen performances & nails the in over his head panic of his character, you really feel for Billy as he is put in some deadly situations & is constantly on the edge of thinking he could be found out any minute & get killed, it's a fantastic role & performance from leo.Legendary star Jack Nicholson brings his maniac charm to his role as big time gangster Frank Costello, a superb performance from Nicholson who is both funny & scary at the same time!!!Matt Damon is great as the slimy ""Rat"" who is a cop but works for Frank Costello, a good solid performance from Damon.Mark Whailberg is excellent in his role as mouthy police sergeant Dignam, he's an intense presence & a cool character.Legendary old school actor Martin Sheen is also excellent as Queenan, the detective working with undercover Billy & he has some incredibly intense & scary moments.The beautiful Vera Farmiga gives a great emotional & torn performance as girlfriend of ""Rat"" Sullivan (Damon) & Doctor/love interest to Billy (leo).Legendary British tough guy actor Ray Winstone is brutally scary & gritty as Mr. French who is Costello's right hand man.Also we have another Hollywood legend with Alec Baldwin who is the best i think I've ever seen him act as Ellerby a tough no-nonsense cop trying to bring down Costello.A fantastic cast in a brilliant gritty,brutal,intense Cop Thriller. Of course Scorsese's Masterpiece will always be Taxi Driver, that film is too damn Amazing."
mr-siyi-deng,"Feb 9, 2007",10/10,"It is no secret that The Departed is a remake of the successful Hongkong movie Infernal Affairs. I watched the original one in 2002, right after it was out. I wasn't so impressed then, plus it has been quite some time, so I barely remember any details. But I still can recall the general idea I got. It has a script with intertwining clues which generates considerable intensity, even if several leading actors' performances are mediocre at the best.I mistakenly extended my old opinion to the Departed, and delayed watching this masterpiece because I thought it could be overrated. As soon as I finished watching it, I realized that I want watch it again, right then. It is a completely new movie, spiritually. The affiliation in the screenplay to the original one is unavoidable, but Martin Scorsese did a great job in substantiating the cop and criminal story with his own interpretation. If the original Hongkong movie delivers the sense of cool and cool (sorry I couldn't find another proper adjective, since all what they tried to do is to be or pretend to be cool; anybody, anytime, anywhere.), The Departed is on the other hand all about crime, homicide and deep unrest. Infernal Affairs attempted to get into various profound philosophical topics such as causality, karma, the nature of human being. In my opinion it overextended itself to gain ground for none. The Departed starts less ambitiously and puts more effort on setting up the backgrounds. The psyches of the main characters become subtler and more authentic. DiCaprio's role rooted in the Irish Section with a family heritage being either bankrupt or criminal. This setting credibly fits into DiCaprio's expertise and explains why he is picked to play the mole. Another bold but effective modification of the original script is to combine the role of the 2 lead actress into one, a change proved smart in that it not only reduces redundancy but also creates an convincing love triangle.Even better is the award-worthy performance of its shiny all-star cast. Matt Damon (as Colin Sullivan) persuasively presented us a deceitful rouge cop, especially considering those dutiful roles (Private Ryan~) he used to act. Jack Nicholson (as Frank Costello) skillfully portraits the aged corrupt boss with a strange paternal charm. Vera Farmiga's Madolyn is gorgeous. Intellect and sensual, she is just the right person for this character. And Leonardo DiCaprio, eventually get enough matured to break the Jack-of-Titanic prince-of-charm stereotype, really outperformed himself in his rendition of Billy Costigan. (BTW Leo also did a great job in Blood Diamond, another highly enjoyable Oscar nominee.) In my opinion Dicaprio is the biggest surprise I got from this movie.Some people have been concerned about the excessive curse and violence in this movie. To me these are necessary materials to faithfully depict the restlessness of those who plays with darkness so intimately.The Departed is a timely reminder to the industry that good movies are made of solid storyline and engrossing acting, not of superficial CGIs or eye-candies. Cheers Martin Scorses, Cheers all men behind this great movie. If The Academy won't give you the deserving awards, surely the audience will hold a place for it in their memories."
ahmadsmalik7,"Jan 11, 2025",10/10,"This absolutely brilliant movie (produced by Brad Pitt and directed by the legend Martin Scorsese) is just amazing. Dicaprio gave,what is for me, the greatest acting performance in history of cinema in a compelling storyline alongside a star studded cast. I mean this movie is peak gangsta and lightyears ahead of the Godfather. Can't believe no one ever really talks about it with the same enthusiasm as goodfellas or pulp fiction. After watching this I finally understood why Scorcese is so revered in Hollywood. Easily one of my favourite crime/gangster films and ridiculously unpredictable yet consistently entertaining."
Dilanoliver,"Jul 5, 2019",10/10,"Synopsis: South Boston cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) goes under cover to infiltrate the organization of gangland chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). As Billy gains the mobster's trust, a career criminal named Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police department and reports on its activities to his syndicate bosses. When both organizations learn they have a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin must figure out each other's identities to save their own lives"
ecatalan98,"Mar 31, 2007",7/10,"THE DEPARTED is a long and intriguing film where opposite rival bands infiltrate each other to gain inside scoop info. The guys who do the ""infiltration"" are Matt Damon, doing the bad guy on the good side, and Leonardo DiCaprio vice versa. The story develops slowly and you have to pay close attention to all the minor details because so much is given that you might lose some info. The bad guy of the story (Jack Nocholson )doesn't appear to be all that mean and bad. In fact, you don't feel much for any of the characters, except maybe for DiCaprio's. This aside, the movie moves at a fair pace, although the beginning is a bit slow. By the time the movie's over you hardly notice what's going on. This is a finely crafted movie, big budget and stuff and a fine Martin Scorsece film, but, in my humble opinion, don't think it deserved a best movie award. I think most of you out there will agree with me that Scorsece has done way better in the past: TAXI DRIVER, CASINO, GOOD FELLAS, RAGING BULL, etc. I think the Academy felt so wrong and sorry for not awarding ANY of his past movies that they just had to give him an award this time around. Having this said, THE DEPARTED isn't a bad movie by any terms! But it is certainly not Scorsese's best."
ian-usher,"Oct 10, 2006",1/10,"Sorry, thought this was very bad.Terrible story, have not seen Infernal Affairs but State of Grace and even the pilot of The Shield were far superior and credible.Wahlberg too weak for the role, his scenes with Baldwin and Damon were comical.Alec Baldwin, enough said...Nicholson overacting wildly the rat impression made me cringe.DiCaprio's performance was going OK until the line ""I can't believe you are so vulnerable right now"" - Vulnerability! couldn't see that emotion anywhere but it seemed I was supposed to, which made me question the whole performance.Matt Damon was actually quite good.Direction - the film looked good, sounded good but all to no avail when tied to such a poor story.Not trying to pick a fight just my opinion. Nearly every review has been positive surely someone else hated it?"
Screen_O_Genic,"Jun 27, 2019",9/10,"Two cops from opposite sides of the law unknowingly get into a duel matching wits and dealing with the twists and turns of fate in this standout movie of the grey area that thinly separates crime from the law. The stars aligned for this memorable take on the cop genre and what stars and how they deliver! Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin shine in this added gem to Martin Scorsese's directorial crown. Enhanced by a gritty and humorous script this is one flick you'll never forget. A blockbuster upon release and winner of multiple awards this fave of both critics and the public is one of the few instances where artistic and commercial success are both well deserved."
antoniotierno,"Oct 30, 2006",8/10,"This is probably different from other Martin Scorsese's movies but it's truly enjoyable. Cast is excellent and each one of ""the splendid actors gives his best. Dialogues are strong and believable, soundtrack's really great and suitable; as far as I can see there's no moment when rhythm is not steady or story lacks of focus. Furthermore it handles subjects like power and loyalty in a way reminding Mathy's masterpiece ""Good Fellas"". We could say, to sum up, that Scorsese is back with his humor, his class A actors (Jack Nicholson is huge) and his creating Shakespearean atmospheres. ""The Departed"" is purely entertaining and gritty and its action is enjoyable 100%."
0w0,"Aug 27, 2019",10/10,"It's an absolutely stunning movie. You are constantly left in the dust, just trying to make sense of what just happened, and just when you think you've got a hold of what you just saw on the screen, Scorsese slaps you upside the head and leaves you reeling again. I've literally never given a movie 10/10, this is the first one... and this movie truly deserves it. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is amazing; Matt Damon's performance is top-tier and Mark Wahlberg's character is absolutely hilarious with his character being brilliantly overshadowed by the other characters. Scorsese's best film ever."
buckeyes-05926,"Apr 17, 2024",10/10,"This film has some of the best actors Hollywood has seen at their absolute best. It has Jack Nicholson (minus the joker), Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, plus director Martin Scorsese at their absolute best. This film is not for the faint of heart. It is rude, bleak, violent and defiantly not PC. Yet is also is totally OK to laugh throughout this rat's nest of paranoia, deceit and bloodshed. This makes you have to keep your eyes on the final till its final frames. The final frame also happens to be an uncharacteristic, but well-earned, wink. The original film was gritty and entertaining and Scorsese best crime drama a territory in which Scorsese is an unchallenged master."
salvaggio_john,"Oct 7, 2006",10/10,"The Departed is an Amazing Film. I found the film contained good dialog, shot composition, and lighting as well as fantastic editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. Not as long as Gangs of New York (2002) but it still contains the action and clever plot twists and general excitement found in most Scorsese pictures.The Departed is authentic, captivating and heart felt. I predict Globe and Oscar nominations for Mark, Matt, and Lenonardo. Martin Scorsese's brilliant mind as a director shows up in this work of art and he better get the Best Director Oscar. He has worked for too long and too hard his entire career and has yet to receive one. Possibly best supporting actor for Alec Baldwin, or Martin Sheen. I rate this film 10 out of 10, a superb masterpiece of ""Crime Art"" as i call it. Better than Casino (1995).The film kept the entire audience intrigued and amazed at the hard depiction of corrupt Boston police, and an eye opener to modern Irish gangs. A grand remake of a Hong Kong film called ""Wu Jian Dao"". The Departed is fantastic."
shattenjager777,"Mar 27, 2007",6/10,"Martin Scorsese was once one of the world's great filmmakers, but the truth is that he has been rehashing some combination of ""Raging Bull"" and ""Mean Streets"" for the last quarter-century. Even his latter-day masterpiece, ""Goodfellas"" repeats the revisionist gangster themes of ""Mean Streets"" with the visual language of ""Raging Bull"" almost exactly copied. In this way it's unfortunate that ""The Departed"" is more of the same.However, even in his darkest hours of imagination, Scorsese has always been a competent storyteller whose films are filled with excellent, vibrant performances, spot-on editing and of course his much-revered knack for choosing score material. In this way, it's fortunate that ""The Departed"" is more of the same.The story is one that inherently involves all of Scorsese's favorite themes: violence, identity, and loyalty. It tells two essentially identical inverted story lines: (Slight spoiler, but no more than the commercials told you) A young man who has grown up learning from gang leader Frank Costello becomes Costello's mole inside the state police and a young man who has grown up surrounded by criminals becomes an undercover police officer who infiltrates Costello's organization (spoiler over). The intertwined stories are perhaps the most interesting part of the film, since this take on narrative is something new to Scorsese's repertoire, but it unfortunately is not handled perfectly. Some of the editing is coarse for no obvious reason and yet Scorsese does not provide us with any visual cues that either show that we are supposed to be confused or help us orient ourselves.Meanwhile, the acting is perfect all the way. Mark Wahlberg may be a one-note actor, but his character is his note. Meanwhile, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent in deep, layered roles, though Damon does not have the opportunity DiCaprio does to chew up the screen now and again. Martin Sheen is used perfectly in the type of role we're getting used to him playing. Most importantly, the borderline-campy theatricality and evil of Jack Nicholson is used to absolutely perfect effect in devilishly comic portrayal of an underworld kingpin.Oddly, one place where the film goes awry is in its use of music. While certainly the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" is used wonderfully, to great effect and absolutely appropriately (almost as well as the instrumental section of Derek and the Dominoes' ""Layla"" in Goodfellas), some of the music was annoyingly distracting. This problem also crept up on Scorsese's last film, ""The Aviator,"" at a few points, which is a disturbing and disheartening trend in the director's career. It almost sounds as if he is trying to insert more ""hip"" music with which he is less familiar (and which he may even like less) and thus is forcing it into place far more than when he uses some of the classic rock anthems and classical standards he has used to such great effect in the past and even in this film. The presence of composer Howard Shore obviously doesn't help, either, as the master of the Very Standard Score delivers the same thing he nearly always does--a bag of clichés.Overall, the film is worth sitting through once, and probably worth more than that if you're unfamiliar with Scorsese's work. However, it's not much more than that. Watching ""Raging Bull"" (or ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" for that matter) again is definitely a better use of one's time. It also certainly wasn't the best picture of the year--""United 93"" was."
Calicodreamin,"Jan 12, 2021",7/10,"A well made bloodbath, but a bloodbath none-the-less. The storyline was interesting and had some clever and jaw dropping moments. The characters were well cast and well acted, but lacked depth. Great cinematography."

Since a Chinese guy i am(is it a correct sentence?I literally have no idea ..),longlong time ago in 2002,it just make me wow when i see《Infernal Affairs》(Chinese version of The Departed).like all the film cannot be compare with this one. and as we know,since millennium Hong Kong movies just affected by something and still on the road from worse to worst. i do hope you can have a look at the Chinese version.From my point of view, it is insane The Departed get this high score and good comments.i am used to saving good films in my computer, and The Departed just deleted immediately.Have a good time!"
indyfan2009,"May 24, 2008",9/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is the only movie I'll ever give a 10 to, but this movie is as close as you can get to that. I love this movie. This is one of the most engrossing films I have ever seen. The writing, cinematography, direction, and acting are all awesome. It is an intense movie that kept me on the edge of my seat. And the ending is of this movie is beyond words. Blew me away. Damon is in my favorite role of his next to Jason Bourne. Jack is great. And even Dicaprio, who I am not a fan of, is pretty good. Marky-Mark of course is funny and great in his part. Martin Scorsese is a fenominal director and made this movie amazing. I love this flick. Kudos to Scorsese. He can make mob stories like no one else."
Billy_Boy_,"Apr 15, 2025",10/10,"The Departed is a modern crime epic and a masterclass in tension, deception, and brutal storytelling. It might not be Scorsese's best film (I personally like Goodfellas a bit more), but it feels like his sharpest and most relentless. It also meaningfully differs from Scorsese's other crime epics since this time around it's not about italian gangsters, but about the irish mafia which certainly adds a unique touch.The acting is nothing short of incredible - exactly what you expect form one of the most stacked casts ever assembled for a movie. However, the most memorable thing about this movie will forever be the shocking twists in the last act that make the film even more iconic."
mazurcki,"Feb 25, 2023",9/10,"You can not go wrong with that man, can you? For me, this movie was one of the best I've ever seen. The suspenseful aura was definitely there. It's the kind of movie that generates a ""wow"" from you every other minute. Ever watched Scooby Doo as a kid? You think that the bad guy must be the one that you pointed out, but hey - it's not him! That feeling of being certain about what happens next and the realisation of your mistake is what makes this movie good. You feel like you can easily predict the next scene and BAM - here comes the wow part. However. There was something unsatisfactory hidden in that movie. At some point I felt lost by the tempo. Is it too fast? Maybe. Is it too fast for me? Surely. I would love it to last longer, to let this movie get every detail, squeeze the juice out of it! Also, there is this thing that bothers me. One moment of the movie was like The Irishman for me which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's the same director, right? But it felt almost like copy paste kind of thing. I guess I'll leave it for the review of The Irishman and leave you guys to figure out which part I meant. Maybe someone saw it too?"
dhughbnks,"Aug 17, 2019",9/10,The Departed creates a cast with incredible chemistry and turns the real life story into a fun and engaging movie.
paul2001sw-1,"Mar 21, 2009",6/10,"Martin Scorcese has directed some fine movies, but his remake of 'Cape Fear' was amongst his weakest, a near-identical (and thus pointless) remake of the original. So news of 'The Departed', his version of 'Infernal Affairs', made me apprehensive. For those who don't know them, 'Infernal Affairs' and its two sequels, were brilliant films: violent yet cool, stylish but in no way shallow, and for a westerner like myself, interesting for their take on the Hong Kong underworld (a refreshing contrast to the over-familiar world of American gangsters). To be fair, in this case Scorcese has borrowed the plot elements but made his own film, a long way from a straight copy. Unfortuantly, he has also lost most of what was great about the originals. In the place of the cool, interesting world of Hong Kong, we have a very loud and direct movie full of wisecracking, foul-mouthed, ultra-macho American hard-men. Some of the writing made me squirm, it's not that the lines themselves are especially bad, but there's a depressing lack of originality in the way the script is constructed. Secondly, in the original movie, I cared for both leads, but in this film both Matt Damon and Leonardo di Caprio's characters (it's a starry cast all round, with a face you recognise in every role) are equally unappealing. And whereas the original movie dared start with the setup complete, leaving questions about how the plot got to this situation unanswered (at least until the sequel), Scorcese lacks the courage to do the same, walking us through the complete story in broadly chronological order, then adding some random, pointless minor time-shifting (the occasional scene shown out of sequence) as if in homage to his predecessor, while failing to understand the rationale of the device. The sad thing is that some of Scorcese's early movies, such as 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver', were as fresh and unexpected as 'Infernal Affairs' was; but in 'The Departed', he has reduced a classic to the Hollywood model of what a gangster film should be, and somehow won as Oscar for the achievement."

valadas,"Jun 28, 2009",6/10,"This could be a good film if it weren't for a few loose ends in the development of the story and a couple of strange coincidences made up to maintain the plot in line with the general structure of the script. This said what is left to remark: first of all the superb performance of Jack Nicholson, perhaps one of the best of his career, as Costello the Mafia gang chief. Then the good technical quality of the movie and the excellent acting of the other performers. One word too for the good form of all the violent scenes which are truly made and convincing. In conclusion, a movie that can have you agreeably occupied for about 3 hours without adding any special event to the history of cinema."
stargrazzer108,"Dec 23, 2013",5/10,"It's not only me who thinks this, but with also with this plot it seemed to even accentuated as these two great actors who look too similar; a work colleague said the same.These two need to be separated in films really IMHO - LOL! Just check the web for More Confusing Celebrity Pairs lie these two.So the film was quite good, but a bit too unnecessarily violent for my taste.This could have been implied rather than showing, but suppose that gave a grizzly murderous 'reality' to the story.The plot had enough to keep you interested all the way to the grizzly endings.Jack Nicholson was very good in his role and made you believe he was a gangster.I didn't watch the bonus DVD as felt I's seen enough of the story line."
dhruvdude,"Oct 16, 2006",10/10,"After walking out of the theatre after watching the departed, I felt like going to the ticket counter, and buy the ticket for it again. The departed can best be described as the most powerful and the most entertaining movie of the year. It's very hard to decide who was better than who in the movie because everyone gives a great performance. Leaving Nicholson, Dicaprio and Damon aside the supporting cast too gives a great performance.Martin Sheen and Wahlberg gives some great support to the cast. My favorite scenes includes the one involving Martin Sheen, Wahlberg and Dicaprio. These scenes are really well executed. I have always been a big fan of Scorsese, and even this time he doesn't disappoint. He surpassed my expectations by leaps and bounds. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for making the departed.Dhruv Puri gives the movie Two Biggest thumbs up way up."

Obviously recommended if you like Gansgters stories."

From Di'Caprio and Jack Nicholson to Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and Alec Baldwin; this was an absolute classic and one of my 10 favorite movies ever."
