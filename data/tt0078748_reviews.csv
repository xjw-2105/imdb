pooz_the_gun,"Mar 28, 2021",8/10,I just came around to watch the original Alien on Netflix and I have to say that I was positively surprised that a horror movie from the '70s is this suspenseful and effective.The characters actually behave like thinking human beings. The soundtrack is great and the direction is superb. Especially when comparing this movie to the modern movies with similar stories that borrowed many of the things that are working well here.A classic every horror and overall movie fan should watch.
chrishn,"Feb 6, 2005",9/10,"In ""Alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""Nostromo"". The crew is in cryosleep, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds.The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy.As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement.The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness.This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes, and none of them are true villains.All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't just the Alien itself, it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin, that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title ""Alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10"
Fella_shibby,"Mar 24, 2021",9/10,"Everything has already been said about this great film n there seems to be little left to say but lemme contribute a lil more by praising how good this film is.I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs n as a kid i found it to be a bit slow but was shaken by the chestburster scene.The facehugger terrified me as a kid.Revisited all the four parts in the early 2k on dvds which i own.Revisited this part again few days back as i am on Alien movie marathon n very impatient to check out Prometheus n Covenant.I feel that this part is inspired by Bava's Planet of the Vampires.The ruins with the skeletal remains, the design and shots of the ship itself does have the deja vu effect.This one is atmospheric n dark, gory at times, it has enuff stuff for sci fi fans, it also has slasher n war like tone.But the best thing is the feminist tone where in this part the women are not being cast as the helpless victims."
gogoschka-1,"Feb 11, 2018",10/10,"'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, ""lived-in"" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) ""retro"" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space).I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jan 16, 2020",10/10,"Alien remains one of the most original, terrifying movies of all time. Compare this with the lame sci fi horrors we get nowadays, 1979, and it still packs a huge punch.Fantastically atmospheric, chilling and terrifying even now, the story holds up incredibly well. The special effects were incredible for the time, no wonder the franchise is still in demand, though sadly nowhere near the quality of this one or its amazing successor.The music is fantastic, the direction is incredible, and as for the Alien itself, way ahead of its time. Weaver is phenomenal, but arguably she's upstaged by the creature.You can't help but remember scenes days after watching it, it definitely has the chill factor.A cinematic masterpiece. 10/10"
adrian-trent-442-142266,"Aug 27, 2022",10/10,"First seen in 1979 , I was 15 Mum dropped me off. Seen once every five years since.Seems to get better and better as time goes on, maybe because as I mature, I appreciate the fine acting details or is it that there are fewer and fewer films to compare Alien to. Alien is a masterpiece in so many areas (in no order); Editing, photography, acting, direction, art, music, sound, script. In fact Alien ought to be mandatory viewing for every film director whether budding or currently or even as a refresher for well seasoned film makers.It's so clear Ridley was able to make the film he wanted to make without interference from non creative parties."
a-alexander119,"Apr 23, 2021",10/10,"When I see reviewers ratings less than five I have shake my head in disbelief. Alien set a standard that has yet to be equaled let alone surpassed. I watched it on the wide screen when it was first released, and over a dozen times since. And even though I know what's coming, the hairs on the back of my neck still stand up. What a brilliant work of theatrical genius."
dognemur,"Oct 19, 2022",N/A,"A lot of people describe the suspense and terror that this movie demonstrates as its best characteristic, which is certainly valid. It is intense, and can be held up as one of the greatest horror movies of all time, easily. I would argue, beyond that, that it's one of the greatest movies of all time in general. It's basically perfect sci-fi; with absolutely gorgeous sci-fi design and brilliant execution, with beautiful sets and effects that hold up today. It has great dramatic moments and even some twists. None of the sequels, to me, hold a candle to this.It feels a bit like Blade Runner, with its borderline avant-garde use of quiet moments. However, unlike Blade Runner (which is just as strong a film) this movie uses its nebulous setting and ominous set design, music, lighting, and sound design to instill a deep, troubling fear in the audience."
boardertrash,"Dec 23, 2022",10/10,"I'm often amazed that people prefer Aliens to the original, I guess it's down to personal taste but in my opinion the first film is far and away the best. It's the way Ripley's whole world just unravels gradually from the get go, the pacing is sublime and it simply doesn't have to rely on tons of action set pieces like the second film does. My assumption is some people find it too slow but everytime I watch it I just marvel at every scene, the effort that went into every detail. The true mark of what an achievement this film was for the time is also how nothing appears dated even now in HD or in 4k, there are countless instances in the second film where it's blatantly obvious scale models have been used and it always bugs me. You have to remember this was made when Christopher Reeve's Superman was about which vfx's look terrible in comparison, blows your mind doesn't it?! Don't get me wrong I enjoy all of the Alien franchise movies, they do gradually worsen in sequence apart from Prometheus which is joint second place for me. I won't go into script or acting, needless to say both are top drawer and feel completely authentic and natural.A masterpiece! Simple as that."
ContagiousLasagna,"Sep 21, 2018",10/10,"What makes Alien great is it's synchronization of sound, visuals and showing great attention to detail. Not only that but Alien has an unnerving atmosphere right from the beginning. We're introduced to a crew who is not exactly too friendly to each other add to that the ship. It's huge, and with its halls and corridors, it feels almost like a maze.Enter Alien, a ruthless parasite with humanoid form yet it lacks any civilised traits of a human. It does have humanoid form but it doesn't give a single emotion. The design of the monster is what's the most terrifying (and it still holds up despite Alien being released in 1979). The creature is also better adapted to the ship's interior making a big part of the movie feel like a sinister game of cat and mouse.What I particularly like is how the characters are written. They are not Hollywoodized heroes, in fact, there is no hero. They're just people which makes them even more threatened. The performances are all equally realistic and do deliver. Kudos to director Ridley Scott for using crafty cinematography and combining it with shadows and lights in an eerie way. The music is unrelenting and combined with Scott's cinematography, sound and visuals it adds to the eeriness.The plot is also not another Hollywoodized cliché. It's more like ""survival of the fittest"". The characters battle true terror as they race to survive or outlive each other, they're all just a part of a race to see who will prevail and who will die.Final Rating: 10/10"
deepfrieddodo,"Oct 23, 2022",10/10,"Not only is Alien one of the greatest sci-fi films created, it is undoubtedly encapsulates all the best elements of the horror genre too.The plot is perfect. Simple enough that missed dialogue doesn't throw the audience out of the loop, yet complex enough to demonstrate the depth behind the context. Twists are utilised at the perfect moments to ensure that intrigue remains at a high while tension is at a constant. Characters superb, with no real stereotypes of tokenism added in to no effect.Visually, the 1979 release is still far more aesthetic than films released 40 years later. The sets are superb, costuming is great, and the lighting to capture the right atmosphere is perfect. Brief glimpses of the Xenomorph establish the fearsome foe without putting everything on show and lessening it's impact, and is a perfect example of why costuming and puppetry done right will always look better than CGI.An excellent cast, with Weaver's breakout role supported by the likes of Hurt and Holm. Dialogue is delivered realistically and always at the right intensity, and never out-of-step with the perfect directorial pacing.A phenomenal start to clear franchise material, which no matter how wayward later editions go, will always be a classic. Somehow Alien's sequel matches this performance too."
hellholehorror,"May 4, 2021",10/10,"This was made in the seventies. Seventies. The picture quality is stunning. Undeniably stunning. The sound is perfect except minor issues regarding occasional muffled dialogue. God it looks good. Rivals and beats many films made thirty years later. The blend of suspense, horror, science-fiction is perfect. The budget is perfectly used. Perfect. I say stick with the theatrical version, the various director cuts are not as well paced, add irrelevant scenes and don't fix the one bit that annoys me - the jump cut on Ash's head. Stay theatrical and think of the best film ever made and you would possibly have this. There may be a scant few other films but this would be the first. The ending is so intense and fearful without cheap techniques. I love it. Very minor technical issues are forgotten through fear, fascination and legacy."
aaronthomas1976,"Oct 17, 2019",10/10,"Alien is the pinnacle of sci-fi horror, and it is the standard for which all are measured."
Patuquitos,"Jan 31, 2005",10/10,"Back in early 20th century, Lumière brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with. I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.In my opinion, 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurate:The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you, but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation, John Hurt is a master, and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed, and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet, 25 years after, to be matched.The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic, claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description, the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release, some scenes were stomach churning.The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a sci-fi flick in space ever.The tagline. ""In space, no one can hear you scream"". THIS is a tagline.And, of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.So, what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it, as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.Oh, I almost forget! There's a lovable cat in it.RATING: 10"
davewalls,"Sep 19, 2022",10/10,"Some say the beginning of the film is slow, and I can see what they mean, but I did not find it slow myself, as the beginning of the film, is fascinating pure science fiction, that kept me gripped.Once the alien gets lose, the speed of the film is actually quite fast, as it hurtles at increasing speed, towards the finally.The photographic look of this film, is incredible, as is the casting and the performances of the actors.The score is perfectly fitting and creates that sense of wonder, as they glide deep into space.A must watch for anyone, who likes science fiction or is simply interested in watching, a piece of film history."
oneshotstop,"Jul 20, 1999",N/A,"Director Ridley Scott's well-honed talents of pacing and editing create a tense atmosphere that superbly conveys dread and fear of an unknown, unseen evil entity.  In 1979, the technology didn't exist to generate a computer image of a Being from another world, and thank God, because this film would have sucked just like all these post-Alien creature features do.  Everyone who loves this movie knows what I'm talking about.  Ridley Scott had to be extremely careful not to show a full shot of the Alien, except in very brief scenes, and not to reveal exactly how it moves, because then we would see that it is just some tall, skinny guy in a rubber suit.  Nowadays, some computer guy would whip up a really scary-looking, but nevertheless FAKE-looking (yes, computer guys, we can tell) Alien, and the director would not have to even think about trying to breathe life into H.R. Giger's hallucinations to make a successful picture.The dark, cold beauty of this film will never be equaled."
shortround8391,"Apr 17, 2009",10/10,"Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with ""Predator"". This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes ""Halloween"" look like ""Chicken Little"". You can forget about all those rubbish ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, 'cause ""Alien"" just takes horror up to so many levels! In ""Alien"", we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an ""SOS"" from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the ""Company"" regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.As other classic films should always have, ""Alien"" does great on the characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman, Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool, times when she's afraid, times when she's angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a character.The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular, Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here. Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what ""Alien"" has.And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better, very futuristic, yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect something to happen, nothing happens. And ""Alien"" is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that can excite/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.This is the legend that I'm talking about here, folks. Don't miss the chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life. Take my word for it....I'm practically a movie buff, so I know what I'm talking about...."
jazzest,"Jan 31, 2005",6/10,"The very reason of the huge and continuing success of this 25-year-old sci-fi classic may be the simplicity in its storytelling and its art direction, which has seemingly made the film timeless and universal.A simple And-Then-There-Were-None type of story has no era-related influence from the late 70s, while many sci-fi films tend to mirror the world at the time they are made. Staged mostly in a closed environment inside a spaceship and briefly on an unknown planet far from Earth, the film practically has no connection to any particular culture.The designs of aliens' colony on the planet and of the alien by H. R. Giger must have been remarkably cutting-edge back in the time; for contemporary eyes, they look rather simply beautiful. The title design at the opening is also appropriately simple: Green LED-like lights turn on one by one to form the letters of ""ALIEN.""The film doesn't look old at all after 25 years and probably will never do. This is one of great examples that simplicity attains eternity."
bob the moo,"Oct 16, 2001",N/A,"The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course the real star is the one we see least of.We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level."
Pluto-3,"Aug 14, 1998",9/10,"The beginning of one of the greatest series of all time. This film will always remain a classic. It's scary, influential and insanely entertaining. Not just that but Ridley Scott actually has a great sense of style and mood and he plays with that a lot, to make us shiver. There's also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It's fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let's hope they'll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !"
philipwest89,"Sep 19, 2011",10/10,"In the crowded gallery of horror films, Alien hangs in a prominent position, high above its rivals. By virtue of its deft blend of psychology and physical horror, it lifts the genre out of the graveyard and into deepest space . While its scale models, grimy characters, and shimmering soundtrack may no longer appeal to a generation of audiences who revel in the hotchpotch storyboards of 'Drag Me To Hell', Alien still commands great respect, and rightly so. It has not lost any of its cutting edge, even after thirty-two years.Alien's simplistic premise keeps the film tight and lean; a taut, slow-burning game of cat and mouse involving a vicious, shadowy creature whose acidic blood can melt the very girders of the ship it has invaded, and a compelling blend of the brave (Ripley), cautious (Dallas), and mechanical (Ash). There are no meaningless references to childhood memories or superfluous romance. The characters and their personalities are weathered, believable, and their mission plausible. The profit-driven search for mineral ore provides a realistic corporate counterpoint to the main story, which sees the seven crew members dragged, somewhat unwillingly, into the extraterrestrial's world. With the possible exception of Ash, they did not seek this encounter; the computers lead them to it. How each crew member responds to the situation is key; in effect, seven sub plots form, each focusing upon something different, be it a crew member's mannerisms, their way of thinking, or indeed, a violent death (Chestburster). This is Alien's greatest appeal; it provides an insight into the human mind, as psychological horror movies should. Which crew member do we, the audience, root for, admire, or resent? Who can trust who?Sigourney Weaver, so often credited with inspiring a roll-call of female cinematic heroines, rightly earns every syllable of praise that has been heaped upon her since the film's release; Ripley's resourcefulness and courage are marvellous to behold. However, as the genuinely disturbing android Ash, Ian Holm is supreme; his reserved demeanour and considered approach masking the motives that lay hidden out of sight.As an exercise in sound and vision, Alien is a memorable spectacle. There are many moments that are striking. The colossal hauler Nostromo, futuristic and industrial in design, dominates the screen as it crawls slowly, almost gracefully, towards Earth. The sheen of the soundtrack and the echoing calls from the freighter to 'Antarctica Traffic Control' are atmospheric to the core, while the fogbound alien planet, littered with blackened mountains and the silhouette of the hulking, derelict vessel, is hauntingly desolate. Spaces where, in modern horror films, the gaps would be filled with meaningless dialogue, are left vacant. The viewer can interpret what they see with no need for speech. Ridley Scott's vision of 'horror first, science-fiction second' was, without a doubt, fulfilled; audiences should ignore the flashing lights and controls of the spaceship and focus upon the Alien. Around which corner does it lurk? Who becomes its next victim?Alien is a film of immense quality. It has the capacity to frighten and to deceive. It flows precisely from scene to scene with no wasted shots and most tellingly, does not stray off course by incorporating fanciful special effects or worthless roles filled by fringe characters. One spacecraft, one extraterrestrial, seven humans, and one cat is all we are given. And quite simply, anything more would have been a waste. While the genre of horror may have moved on, the art of horror is captured perfectly, here, in the blackness of space."
BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Apr 15, 2004",10/10,"This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Everything is so carefully and expertly constructed to the point that repeated viewings are just as good as the first. Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.The story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel ""Nostromo"" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.The music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.This is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad. ""Alien"" came first and it is easily one the best. 10/10Rated R: violence/gore and profanity"
Theo Robertson,"May 20, 2003",6/10,"Nice to see that a few all too rare reviewers agree that Ridley Scott`s ALIEN is a rather overrated film , yes I agree with everyone that the set design is fantastic but the film suffers from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY syndrome in that it has a very slow sterile atmosphere which makes it difficult to connect with the characters . The only character I felt any sympathy with was Kane and that`s only because he was played by the excellent John Hurt . As for the rest of the crew I couldn`t care less if they got eaten or not . To all intents ALIEN is a corny B movie script ( I think we can ignore all the pseudo-intellectual claptrap involving subtext - it`s a B movie script ) produced by A list techniciansTrivia point : Ridley Scott was working as a BBC designer in 1963 and legend has it that he was due to work on a fledgling sci-fi series but became unavailable at the last moment which meant Raymond Cusack worked on this new show called DOCTOR WHO and it was he who designed the Daleks undoubtedly the most visually interesting creations in the history of television.Talking of DOCTOR Who check out the 1975 story ` The Ark In Space ` which has a very similar premise to ALIEN  but is far more enjoyable"

WalterFrith,"Jan 22, 2005",N/A,"""In space, no one can hear you scream."" This remains my favourite tagline ever for a movie. When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier. The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and 'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed. It is director Ridley Scott's best effort on the big screen for making fear the best character in the film."
I_should_be_reading_a_book,"Jul 21, 2019",10/10,"They don't go any better in Sci-Fi/Horror. Even tho it shows its age --computers, technology, props and costumes- it grabs you like a hook in your belly from the start. Young Sigurney Weaver and Veronica Cartwright provide a high breeze of fresh air in the otherwise oppressive mouldy interiors. It was Ridley Scott at his best, along with other early masterpieces like his much accoladed debut 'The Duellists'. It is one of those films that set landmarks and that you don't tire of watching time and again. You will find yourself longing towards the era when films were created with physical props and costumes instead of present CGI gluttony. One of the true choice films for your top 100."
silsworld,"Mar 30, 2005",10/10,"Three words perfectly describe ALIEN: Long, dark and ominous.You know you're in for a good time when even the opening title gives you a shiver. The music plays perfectly as the word 'ALIEN' slowly appears, line by line. Then there are the establishing shots of the ship; poorly maintained, claustrophobic.And then there's basically forty minutes of people in a ship pondering and eating and getting along (or not). The film has one little thing that allows it to draw you along so slowly - a promise. A promise made by the advertisements and hype that this was going to kick your ass. You just had to wait.But when it happens, it happens. Though the film doesn't speed up per se, there's a lot more happening in front of the screen to make it at least look like stuff's going on. The first half crawls almost depressingly, but the second half catches your eye and refuses to let go.I suggest everyone sees this film. Even if you skip through the beginning, you need to see this. It defined sci-fi and horror all in one.It's perfect."
imaginefortnitekiddy,"Jul 18, 2022",10/10,"The Film is just well made, revolutionary for it's time and still watchable for younger generations, although young people might find the beginning ab bit to long.One of the best films i have ever seen.It would be a crime to give this movie a grade under 9."
Mediatation,"Sep 26, 2024",10/10,"The first of the two punches that made Ridley Scott a science fiction directing icon, ""Alien"" is a masterpiece as both a science fiction and horror film. Along with ""Star Wars"", it popularized the lived-in sci-fi aesthetic, while also defining the sub-genre of space horror with Giger's iconic Xenomorph design.Sigourney Weaver stands out as a star even among an extremely talented cast, as she manages to depict Ripley as a tough, resourceful spaceship crew member whose empathy still bleeds through. It remains a terrifying monster-slasher film with a haunted house feeling spaceship setting that feels inescapable due to the harsh, barren environment of outer space that surrounds it."
sim-g,"Jul 1, 2019",9/10,"Visually stunning. Sounds and score of despair. Down to earth and beliveable acting. Slow paced, yes, but that's a good thing. It is building the tension, minute by minute. The menace take its time...but when it comes...it delivers. The script is to the point - simple and complex at the same time. The direction is superb...Ridley Sott is a legend and this partly why. And finally...Sigourney Weaver is amazing as our hero, Ellen Ripley. Alien is the ultimate scifi horror classic."
alexx668,"Jun 17, 2008",6/10,"Despite it's legendary status, the truth is that Alien is just a horror movie set out in space, i.e. the alien monster taking the part of the serial killer that's murdering the cast one by one (minus of course the main character, in this case Ripley - played by Sigourney Weaver). So, nothing original, apart from that it's set in outer space.Then where does that leave us? Well, two things are really of note. H.R. Giger's design of the alien planet and the creature itself - chilling and nightmarish, in what is the brush of a true artist, and also Ash's poetic reflection on the alien monster: ""Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility."" ""I admire its purity. A survivor.. unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.""And yet despite the atmospheric approach, it's unclear what angle or view, if any, the film offers. Seemingly it condemns the instinctive effort for survival of the alien creature, yet in the end it's the morally bound humankind which prevails. In fact, the scene in the end where Ripley comes face to face with the alien and kills it by shooting it in outer space is probably the film's center of gravity. The alien creature is for the first time looking insecure and scared of dying, but Ripley (guided by her own instincts) shows no remorse. Here, the roles of the hunter and the hunted are blurred, and so is the moral status of mankind.Other minor themes are the remorseless capitalist stance of the mother/company, which also hides a metaphysical meaning (the company is called mother, it controls the destiny of the crew, has it's own purposes, has it's chosen representative amongst the crew with the robot Ash etc)."
ForTheMostPart1999,"Nov 8, 2022",9/10,"Alien is a well done, out-of-this-world horror film that leaves some good scares and some epic scenes. The alien itself was splendidly creepy, the humanoid was really neat, and the spaceship was awesome. Most of the main characters were not all that compelling, but with a story like this, it all mixes together nicely. This also included some well designed special effects, including the alien, and especially the cargo ship that carried the crew (and the cat). I can certainly see why this was a big hit during it's time, and as mentioned before, I would have to say that it still is a really good hit today."
SoumikBanerjee1996,"Jul 10, 2020",7/10,"Coming from Ridley Scott, The Cult Classic ""Alien"" that truly shaped Sci-fi genre afterwards; is a remarkably well made film. That inspired so many filmmakers to indulge themselves in these kind of fascinating tales. Considering the era it belongs to; that alone makes it much more impressive but at the same time it still has some pertaining isssues which I really want to discuss.Set in the dystopian future, where space travels have now become a norm and astronauts are instructed to explore newer life and organisms beyond our solar system constantly.
The plot revolves around one of those ships, named ""Nostromo"" containing 7 people who have just woken up from their sleep capsules after their mothership received a distress signal from a nearby planet. The story continues from thereon.Released back in the 1979, the art direction, cinematography, the VFX; everything looked pretty amazing. Even by today's standards they seemed almost competitive. Although it has some isssues regarding the usage of underwhelming Prosthetics, Make Ups but I can understand the limitations they had in those time and age.I would not have complained at all, had I seen this earlier; maybe 10-15 years back. But unfortunately after so many years of experiencing better Sci-Fi productions, at the age of 23; only now I have decided to see this classic for the first time. Too late in the party I guess!Therefore I couldn't unsee the shortcomings on Make Ups, And Props that are being used because of how Hollywood itself as a industry has evolved in terms of Artistic approaches; I couldn't simply nod my head for nostalgia sake and say those were perfect. Sorry I Just Can't!Another issue I have with the characters themselves. Apart from Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver, others seemed weaker in terms of build ups and their individual personalities. I couldn't even care for any one of them. I loved Ripley as the strong lead who single handedly carried it on her shoulders. Without her inclusion this would have been a unpleasant viewing!As for the sound design and background music goes; that was awesome. The makers used a subtle layering of Music whenever situation is demanding. Other times pure silence did the work. Full marks for the audio department.Screenplay and the Editing looked sharp most of the times. On few occasions I found out the cuts or the transitions to be unclear and interrupted in midway. I watched the director's cut, haven't seen the Theatrical one yet so that might be the case but I did notice some glaring issues regarding various frame transitions throughout the runtime. I might be too nitpicky here, but for a cult classic that is both critically acclaimed and loved by the fans; I think I can.Now don't get me wrong, my criticism is my own personal viewpoint. And I know I'm in the minority here but as a reviewer I needed to express an honest opinion. And I just did that with clear enough explanations.That doesn't mean I didn't like the film, Definitely I did. I really liked the film. The scares, the tension, the suspense alongside an amazing camera work, art direction and sound design it certainly grabbed my attention. But still it couldn't make a lasting impression on me. I wanted to love this, as a Sci Fi Enthusiastic; I wished it to be among the best. But to my overwhelming expectations; It missed the spot."
Infofreak,"Dec 12, 2002",N/A,"'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not ""stars"" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking ""below deck"" crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!"

neil-douglas2010,"Dec 7, 2022",9/10,"A classic in sci fi horror movies, this one gets you right from the start. It's a claustrophobic film and never lets up, the trouble is it's been remade so any times and never bettered.The crew of the Nostromo have just woken up but are nowhere near Earth, instead their ship has received a distress beacon. Except it's more of a warning, and on the planet Kane (John Hurt) is attacked by an alien lifeform. Trying to get back to the ship Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) says the land crew should be put in isolation. Dallas (Tom Skerritt) disagrees and lets them on the ship. BAD IDEA, as one by one the crew is killed, of course there is a bad apple. I won't tell you who but it's pretty obvious as the film progresses. Sequels followed, all starring Weaver and they're all good in their own ways, but this is the superior movie in every way. It certainly helps with a great cast and a superb special effects crew."

cesarferrolho,"Aug 11, 2022",10/10,"Probably my favourite sci-fi/horror movie of all time.Not much to say really....In essence, this is ""just"" a creature movie, BUT, made with the best production on everything you can think of... Sets, Design artists, Cinematgraphy, Cast, Wardrobe, Special effects, Screenplay, etc etcOne of Ridley Scott's masterpieces."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Apr 21, 2008",7/10,"This film is quite popular, at least judging from it's rating(as I'm writing this, it's placed #50 on the top 250 list). I realize that this was probably a benchmark for special effects when it was made, but now the effects seem incredibly dated(which they don't, at the very least to the same extent, in pieces from the same period, best example being Star Wars), and many scenes seem clichéd today, even though I suppose they were fresh when it was made. I guess the main problem with the thing is that it doesn't age well, but I also think it lacks too much in both character development and humor... just a little comic relief would have made the nearly two hours go by so much easier(for me, this merely gets slower and less watchable with each repeated viewing). Attempts at making you laugh fall flat on their faces. There are far more unintentional laughs to be had, at various corny and odd things(why does this have so much weird stuff in it, and why do the people who love it just accept that?). More often than not, to me(and one person I know who *loves* these movies), this just ends up being too hard to take seriously. I'm willing to entertain the theory that Ridley Scott's stuff just isn't for me, I've yet to be amazed by him. For how much sheer, unsynthesized acting talent this has, the players have next to nothing to work with(they do turn in fine performances). Nonetheless, the film does manage to scare me and provide some shocks, even though I've seen this and the other films at least three times before. The film manages to establish a pretty nicely done, spooky atmosphere that lasts for most of the film, despite its shortcomings and the very formulaic ending. The plot isn't bad, and it takes off almost immediately, keeping you fairly interested. The characters are so-so, though there aren't any really startlingly poorly written ones. The creature effects are decent enough, and they do not fail to impress at least a little. The editing has moments that are just strange, the cinematography has reasonably little to offer. Props to whoever ensured that the realism was kept at such a high level. The sets, and in general the production design, is all well-done(some is nothing short of breathtaking). I've read one suggestion that stories set where this is and similar are more straining on the audience, and they are more likely to be bored, in spite of the potential talent possessed by those who put it together... I'm inclined to agree. There is some language, and violence as well as gore is also featured herein. I have to admit, I see this as valuable more as an introduction to the world of the title creature, and find, for example, Cameron's expansion of, and further adventure within, it considerably more worthwhile. Don't expect a masterpiece, and prepare to test your patience, especially if you've seen many of these films. The ""Director's Cut""(though he feels the original fits that bill better... hey, at least it's not as bad as the alternate name, ""Extended Version"", which is even a misnomer as it *shortens* the overall length) adds a few things, which you may find worth a look, if you like it(not that there are that many, I count five chapters with additions in the DVD's own breakdown). The commentary track is an OK enough listen, some of the stuff said is cool to hear. I recommend it to fans of alien-type science fiction, and fans of sci-fi horror films(as such, it's good enough) in general. I suggest any possible Alien-fans to-be to start with this film, rather than any of the other films. The series works best in correct order. 7/10"
owenpont-70803,"Dec 30, 2021",10/10,I mean what do I need to say? Its a masterpiece of a film. It combines horror and Sci-Fi perfectly. The scene when the alien comes out of the guys chest is gross and amazingly done. Ripley is a great character and she is shown perfectly in the movie as the hero. Overall this movie is just awesome in about every way.
LancelotSB,"Mar 31, 2025",6/10,"The storyline was great and surprisingly captivating, especially considering it was made over four decades ago. The action scenes were decent, and I found myself chuckling at the alien scenes, as well as the overly obvious spaceship scenes. I'll give it a pass, though, since it was produced a very long time ago. The casting was strong, and the acting was impressive-I particularly enjoyed watching xxxx.The musical score was amazing, although the sound effects felt quite outdated. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It was very nostalgic and has high replay value. I would definitely recommend it."
Luan_Barr,"Oct 14, 2022",8/10,"It's a classic, but why? Because this film broke several horror paradigms, such as that women are always powerless, or that horror couldn't be more subjective and calm, and so on. The originality of this film is huge, making a wave of horror films that are inspired here.As I mentioned, the movie is subjective, it uses your mind and your creativity, so you can make your own guess as to what Alien is entirely like. It uses the most primitive human fear, which is the fear of the unknown, and because of that, it takes a longer time for the alien to appear in the plot. For some this is bad, for others not so much, for me it is sensational.In addition to primitive terror, the screenwriters still found time and space to make very interesting criticisms and allegories, such as that the crew (men) who were abused by FaceHugger so that the Alien will be born, or the criticism of capitalism and corporations who care only for profit and not for the workers.This movie has tremendous importance for the movie industry in general, not just for science fiction and horror. His precise decisions that fill the film with qualities, made new directors and screenwriters inspired by it. It's excellent, the most obvious decision when talking about an Alien movie, it's literally the biggest reference."
LeonardoOliva69,"Aug 14, 2024",10/10,"These are some big words in terms of cinema and one of my favorite movies of all time.We are in the presence of a masterpiece of the seventh art and the beginning of one of the most interesting franchises in history.An unpretentious movie that led to an iconic character of Lovecraftian cosmic terror and one of the most important action heroines in history along with Sarah Connor.The atmosphere of tension, the murky, the darkness and dirt that surrounds the environment and the plot.A Machiavellian corporation that pulls the strings so that an android acting as the executive arm foments terror and desperation allowing events to occur.""In space no one can hear your screams,"" an incredible mantra.Those who have never seen the movie should go into it without knowing anything at all.It is the perfect prototype for a movie of this genre where you don't know who can survive, but we do know that the vast majority will die...
Exemplary practical effects and the design of the genius of H. R. Giger bring us a perfect being, an insatiable killer, who doesn't reason, who kills by instinct.Perhaps its sequel (which I love and think is brilliant) demystifies the xenomorph as a creature of terror a bit, adding a lot of lore to the universe. However, in this movie, we have a space horror thriller that could rarely (or never) be reproduced in the cinema, no matter how hard it was tried.A must for fans of the genre and a good reminder for the next movie that is released, which seems to have a lot of inspiration in ""Alien."""
zoemadson,"Nov 25, 2021",10/10,"Highly effective Sci-Fi horror involving a spaceship crew intercepting an S. O. S. From a derelict ship on a desolate world, where one crewman becomes infected by a sinister organism, one that grows in size, and is difficult to kill...Extremely well directed and designed film has a great cast of actors who really bring them to life, especially Sigourney Weaver, debuting as Ripley. Alien creature itself is terrifying in this, its first appearance, and the story is intriguing and smart, alien planet highly atmospheric, suspense unrelenting.A true classic."
Bryan_Roderick,"Apr 26, 2016",10/10,"Alien (1979)To commemorate 4/26 Alien Day I thought I'd watch this movie. I think Ridley Scott is my favorite Ridley. That's saying a lot when you know how much I enjoy Daisy Ridley as an actress. Not only that, but he's also one of my favorite directors. Easily in my top 10 if not top 5. It's a shame that he's never won and Oscar.Alien is a staple in Sci-fi Horror. It's a hard genre to mash together and produce something good, let alone phenomenal. With the exception of the Alien series I can only name Pandorum off the top of my head that would fit into that meld of genres.Alien also had a strong female protagonist, one that wasn't really established as the main character till the second act. It's sort of reminiscent of Samus from Metroid.Speaking of main characters: Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, is easily one of the most recognizable female characters in all of science fiction. I'd only suspect that maybe Princess Leia would be more. Even if it was her first time as the leading lady she did a wonderful job that stands the test of time.I'd be hard press to not talk about Kane, played by John Hurt, as a demonstration of not only an intense and agonizing scene, but the wonderful use of practical effects that will terrorize and also make you feel pity for him. I won't spoil this old movie, but I'm sure you all know which scene I'm talking about. If you don't you'll know by the second act.People seem to forget that Ash was played by Ian Holm. Bilbo from The Lord of the Rings, and Priest Vito Cornelius from Fifth Element. His scene towards the end of act II reminded me of playing Alien Isolation the video game. Though it should be the other way around. Remember the first time I saw Alien was when I was nine.John McClane will be known for his catch phrase. Darth Vader for his many quotable lines. I believe Ripley has an amazing phrase she says in the movie that out of context is not a spoiler. ""I got you! You son-of-a-bitch.""Can I say that the writing in this film is off the charts. People have a real reason for being there. Each character is on their own a beacon of personality. There isn't a character that's forgotten after watching the movie recently. I couldn't even name half of the party in the Hobbit and I saw that just the other day. Just goes to show you the respect I have for character development. Thank you Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett. They both worked on Total Recall, another great Sci- fi film.Verdict: Cult Classic, must watch. If you didn't get the chance to see it in theaters today, since it was playing at the Alamo Drafhouse, make a note in next years calendar. 4-26-2017."
vithiet,"Jun 9, 2019",9/10,"I've seen this movie many times before but just watched the Director's Cut for the first time. Besides a couple of scenes with very dated special effects, it has aged very well and remains a classic that set up all the rules for this type of movie. Younger generations may think it's a bunch of predictable, overused tropes but they should keep in mind this is the movie that inspired everything else they might have seen!
Having watched the original Blade Runner recently to prepare for Blade Runner 2049, it's also interesting to notice how much of the atmosphere and gritty elements/shots in Alien help mold what would become another genre-defining movie for Ridley Scott."
robojames,"Mar 13, 2021",10/10,"I find it almost impossible to talk about older films like Alien without griping about CGI and the current state of mainstream cinema. This review is no different. Alien is so much better than the pap we get from present-day Hollywood.Watch this movie and be shocked by how it a) takes some time to build up its cast, who aren't wisecracking, superhuman hunks and lingerie model types, b) uses practical effects (out of necessity) that actually look and move like solid objects that could exist, and c) doesn't revel in pointless gore or rattle the screen with a ton of frenetically cut action scenes that do nothing to further the plot.In short, ladies and gentleman, this is a film that takes some time and care with its story. It may be a simple story. It may be basically a haunted house thriller or Jaws in space, but it wrings every last drop of tension from the script, setting and monster, making for a classic that will watched for decades after the likes of Transformers or World War Z are mostly forgotten.One final note about Alien and this type of thriller in general: it heightens the audience experience to wonder how they'd react in the same situation, whether they'd have the guts to face down a snarling monster like the xenomorph or if they'd cr*p their pants in the corner and wait to be eaten. Because Alien features characters that actually talk, panic, squabble and make decisions like some plausible representation of actual human beings, this is a possibility. The film is called Alien, but it's also very much about the humans."
Mr. OpEd,"Apr 26, 2003",7/10,"In space, no one can hear you yawn.The first Ridley Scott film I saw was The Duelists. LOVED it! So I had high hopes for Alien. I saw it when it came out in 1979. Admittedly, the film had a disadvantage before the credits rolled: I saw it in Hollywood and the line for the film was far scarier than the film could possibly be.As I sat watching it, it seemed familiar, like a film that really freaked me out as a boy: It! The Terror from Beyond Space. ITTFBS had a monster that just couldn't be killed and it was on a ship in space so there was NO escaping it (none of these fruity escape pods in 50s sci-fi). I haven't seen ITTFBS since, but it ranked right up there with Mars Attacks bubble gum cards for giving me the creeps.So Alien was a remake. There's no crime against that, unless it ends up being the film Alien turned out to be: not very scary, pretty funny (for the wrong reasons) in spots, and politically correct (the enemy isn't so much the Alien as BIG BUSINESS that wants the Alien brought back no matter what the cost). I haven't seen the complete film again for several years, but as it was on today and I found so many parts so ludicrous, I had to vent.First, a plus: the sequence leading up to the face hugger eggs was, if sluggish, rather intriguing (why do space-age cameras of the future take such bad pictures?) and the sets were great! But we are introduced early on to the film's unending and uninteresting mumbled dialog. I guess this was supposed to make the film seem more `real.' They were improvising some of this, but it might as well have been `caterpillar watermelon' crowd-scene improvising. This got old fast.The stomach bursting was a shock! But that quickly faded as the Alienette looks like little more than a nasty finger puppet and literally zips off screen WB-cartoon style. It gets worse. After a fight to the death involving a rolled-up issue of Evil Android Monthly, Ash's head comes off. A few minutes of poking a prosthetic mock-up of Ash's head which looks NOTHING like the actual Ash, there is a clumsy cut to actor Holm's head poking through a hole in a table. Meant to be gory and gruseome, this is all just inept. And the gurgle/burble white ooze everywhere made me chuckle -- it looked like someone was having a Dairy Queen nightmare.Before Ash, the only enunciator in the bunch, is sent to that big milk carton in the sky, he tells us the Alien can't be killed and that the crew is expendable. Daft! How can one transport something that can't be killed which, if it decides it wants to kill you (and everybody else, which seems to be its ""thing""),  can't be transported? Well, that's just the way those big, evil corporations work, I guess. I'll bet the same people behind Wendy's and Swatch are planning something just like this right now! In space, nothing makes much sense!And speaking of that tag line, I had hoped that this would be a scary, `real' tech movie, following in the footsteps of 2001. No. Sadly, in space, everyone can hear you scream, and mumble, and just make a TON of noise (especially Lambert and Parker throwing those cylinders around; they were probably killed because the Alien couldn't sleep!). And when did steam become a high-tech necessity. Is it DRY in space and they need a nuclear humidifier on every deck; a leaky one, at that?The last ten minutes are fairly tense: will Ripley slip into something even more comfortable than skin-tight t-shirt and panties before confronting the Alien which is no longer fast and dangerous in the confines of the escape pod, but stumbles around in the ubiquitous steam until it can be ejected like a drunk who's stayed past closing time?There. I feel better now."
cjm1d,"Jul 13, 2022",7/10,There are some fantastic visuals in this that are nonexistent in the other alien movies. Really great storytelling with good suspense. The writing and script were top tier. My one complaint was that the story had a few clichés that occur in any movie about aliens in space. Other than that it's one of my favorite space films.
willwoodmill,"Feb 14, 2016",9/10,"Alien is one indisputably one of the best science fiction, and horror films ever made. And easily one of the most influential ever. As it basically invented and defined the science- fiction horror genre, paving the way for films like the thing, and predator.One of Alien's best aspects is its amazing cinematography and creature/set design. All of see work together to give the film a visual style that was unlike anything scene at the time and Ridley Scott would re-use in Blade Runner. Alien's magnificent visuals can be strangely credited to Alejandro Jodorowsky, who found and assembled all the different artists used in Alien for his adaptation of the novel dune, which was unfortunately canned before shooting started, but every cloud has a silver lining, and Jodorowsky's Dune's silver lining was Alien.Another one of Alien's best aspects is its pacing and atmosphere, though some people today may call Alien ""boring,"" these people know nothing about film and are not to be trusted. Alien opens with a slow footage of space, as the eerie score plays, open credits come up, and the title is slowly spelled out, this is then followed by a slow montage of the empty ship Nostromo, followed by the crew slowly waking up from cryospleep. In fact we don't see any sign of an alien until 1/3 of the way through the film, and we don't see the main alien until halfway through the film. And this is why some call it ""boring,"" but these people came to see the wrong film, they expected something like predator, a straight forward action film where the hero tries to kill the creature, instead what they got was something more like Halloween or Psycho, a subtle unnerving film that builds tension and doesn't blow its load all at once.The characters in Alien are also far above the average horror movie, they aren't annoying teenagers, or people that we just want to see die. They're relatable diverse logical characters, that have really natural chemistry, as can be seen in some of the films earlier scenes. And another interesting thing about the characters is, we have to figure out which one the protagonist is, it isn't revealed immediately and makes all lot of scenes much more tense because we don't know which characters are going to die.Though Alien begins slow, the final scenes of Alien are some of the most ""on the edge of your seat"" scenes ever, I don't won't to spoil anything for anyone who somehow hasn't scene alien yet, but you will most likely be on the verge of a heart attack while watching.One final note, I recommend you watch the original version first, and then you most definitely should watch the directors cut.9.6/10"
the50xbomb,"Sep 1, 2022",10/10,"One of the best lit films of all time, the attention and care towards how the sets, actors, and Xenomorph appear in darkness and light is so commendable and is what keeps this film looking so fresh. Alien is basically what happens when a creative team is given the ability to build an immersive world while also making a tense horror movie about an alien killing people on a ship. It has indulgent landing and launching sequences, an infatuation with the anatomy of its creature, accurate specs of its ships layout, it's not a hard sci-fi watch per se but you can tell if Ridley and the crew had more money this film would probably be much longer. As it is I think it has the perfect length, also huge props to that fantastic cast where every character is clear and well motivated. I love this movie so much."
poppasilverback,"May 25, 2016",10/10,"I first saw this in a cinema in 1980 while I was at university. As a huge sci-fi fan I assumed this would be some kind of low budget monster movie that would be mildly diverting. I'd never heard of Ridley Scott before... I came out of the cinema stunned and wanted to see this again immediately. To say it is one of the greatest sci- fi films of all time is under-rating it. It is one of the greatest films of all time.Performances that are pitch-perfect from a stellar cast. The first dirty, grungie space vessel that I'd seen in a film - more gritty and real than anything that had ever been offered up before. A freighter - not a fighter or a star-destroyer or something glamorous. Just a working freighter.And a villain that was relentless, a perfect killing machine. Tougher than anything - with acid for blood! And in the end a heroine that was just as relentless. Ripley. Legendary now, revolutionary then. If you haven't seen this, your film education is lacking."
covington_c,"Aug 14, 2022",10/10,"This movie gets it right in every way! I remember seeing this at the drive-in, when I was a kid! Most movies don't hold up over time, b/ this one ABSOLUTELY does. Great directing, acting, storyline, plot & casting! Definitely in my top 5 of ALL TIME! The shock value off the 1 scene alone still leaves you in the what tf did I just see zone, even if you've already seen it 10-15 times!"
CalRhys,"Mar 4, 2019",N/A,"Tonight I got the chance to view the perennial sci-fi horror classic in all its glory on the big screen, celebrating 40 years since its inception, and my god does it stand the test of time.Derek Vanlint cinematography is masterful to say the least, perfectly embodying the elements of horror through utilising claustrophobic camerawork and a bleak blue and grey colour palette, however, it's his use of lighting that truly captures the chilling overtones. Shafts of light seep in through vent grates, puncturing the smoky atmosphere in abundance, strobe lighting creates a sense of agitation as the creature hunts the crew members one by one, whilst flurries of neon blue and red shimmers ground it to its science fiction roots.The sound, or lack of, further builds unease, with Jerry Goldsmith's humming drone of a score crafting an eerie tension that only erupts when utterly necessary, standing as one of the first films to EFFECTIVELY utilise jump scares. The use of clanging chains and scraping metal highlighting the anxiety being established alongside impressive and colossal sets. The production design is utterly stunning, from the confined corridors of the Nostromo to the vast expanse of the alien world.This film will forever remain an exemplary addition to the sci-fi genre. Gorgeous and terrifying cinematography, a haunting score, immense set design and some brilliant performance from the main cast, that aided in creating one of the greatest female action heroines of all time, upping her game further in Cameron's follow-up action flick. 'Alien' is truly masterful."
KoolCatReviews,"Apr 6, 2020",10/10,"This isn't just an 'alien' film this is the alien film. A film that succeeds in both the horror and Sci-fi genre. Having seen both versions of this film directors and the theatrical, I must tell you to watch this film. The acting cast is great, the story flows and is logical but that's not even the best part. The special effects and CGI have never really been topped by any other film. Even in the newer 'alien' movies or the 'alien vs predator' franshise. Nothing has created true horror in the 'alien' universe such as this. A classic most people would call it, after all it is the alien movie."
Rich359,"Feb 26, 2017",6/10,"After viewing the film again after 37 years, and loving it when I first saw it, I realize that it has many flaws. Most noticeable are: 1) the horribly developed dialogue between crew members. Obviously the writers never worked in a factory like setting, or for that matter, any setting where they had to communicate with small talk with co-workers. Compare this dialogue with the dialogue from the 1951 Thing or even Forbidden Planet.2) Sigourney Weavers character is way too harsh. It may have been a sign of the times to create a ""strong woman"" but in the film she comes off needlessly harsh and unappealing.3) Overuse of technical effects like the strobe light. Why does a ship have strobe lights anyway?4) A very big rip-off of the film ""It, the terror from beyond space. The plot line and dialogue was better in that one as well."
scriff998,"Aug 27, 2014",4/10,"I read all the great reviews on this film and I wonder if everyone but me has lost their mind. At best, this film was average. It had some striking visuals and a few good scary scenes. The problem is, the movie takes way too long to get to those scenes. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is boring and empty (and often incoherent). A lot of the movie is poorly lit, between that and obscure shots of the alien and the blinking computer lights and meaningless images on computer screens and technical talk, there were parts where I didn't know or care what was going on. Very little of it was entertaining, the majority of the film just bored me. The most overrated horror movie ever."
chucksteel,"Dec 26, 2022",10/10,"My friend and I saw Alien when it was first released, at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. We were teenagers in high school. We sat in the front row. After Star Wars had come out 2 years previously, we were still waiting for something else equally comparable to come along. With this, we finally got what we had been waiting for. Not only was it a great science fiction movie, it was also one of the greatest horror movies.I went in to this knowing next to nothing what it was about. All I had to go on was the line in the poster: ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" I just had to find out what it was that was gonna make us scream. I found out all right! They came up with quite a terrifying alien monster. This was the kind of thing, once the crew of the Nostromo started to learn its true nature, during the course of watching the movie, it was chilling to think they might not be prepared to stop it.Now, decades later I regard this as one of the greatest science fiction movies, and also one of the greatest horror movies. If you are a fan of either genre, or especially both, you need to check this one out. And don't stop at this - there is a whole fictional universe that has been created, the Alien and Predator movies, many of which are worth your while."
LordBlacklist,"Mar 5, 2006",10/10,"Review 1 of 4Alien is one of those films that will never age. It takes the simplest story and tells it as well as it can be told. I look at this film as the first in a trilogy, many may not agree with that, but Alien is a perfect beginning. It establishes an entire world and makes it feel real. Everything feels new and interesting. The things that are not explained in this film are exactly what makes it so fascinating to watch. Where did that ship come from? It doesn't matter. Like a good novel the film allows you to fill in the pieces with your own imagination. This goes for the alien it self, since we see so little of it that it becomes all the more terrifying for it. Ridley Scott is like a painter with his images. So many frames of this picture seem like they could be made into still photographs. Alien is science fiction and yet with the way it is shot and acted the movie feels like a documentary. It's that sense of verisimilitude that has made this movie last for so long. So much is present in the subtext. I get the feeling that one of the underlying themes of the film is that technology in the future will little by little overtake the lives of human beings, but paradoxically the nostromo still needs a crew in order to operate. I believe this film is one of the few realistic depictions of what encountering a real Alien life form might actually be like, and that it may not be what we are expecting. something that has always stood out to me about the film is the level of familiarity that the characters have with their surroundings. Many science fiction films love to draw attention to their futuristic technology but the characters in Alien react to it like a construction worker would with operating a crane: it is their job. This film is so good for so many reasons. The performances are nothing short of amazing, the set design exquisite, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is subtle and evocative, but the main reason for me that alien still holds up after all these years is that it takes itself very seriously. There is no Hollywood style self referential humor that would saturate the later entries of the series. Sigourney Weaver may have gotten the academy award nomination for Aliens, but her work here is very solid. She plays a character who through much hardship finds strength within herself that never appeared to be there to begin with. If you look at the Alien series as a trilogy this is the film where Ripley discovers who she really is, or defines her character, and the only way one can do that is through the choices they make in extreme circumstances. This is a film of great tension and subtly, well worth seeing over and over again to pick up on all the layers of subtext that may have been missed the first or second viewing."
Darkside-Reviewer,"Mar 22, 2019",10/10,I decided to finally review Alien after watching it on Blu Ray I have seen it many times before and it still blew me away seeing a movie now forty years old still looking better than most modern movies Alien is a classic atmospheric movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish the beautiful direction and camera shots make the movie look incredible even today if you haven't already seen this classic I recommend watching it on Blu Ray and enjoying a classic at its finest.
HD7,"Jun 18, 2019",N/A,"Alien has something that current horror movies lack and that is fear of the unknown. For a good portion of the movie, we didn't know what the alien looked like. Alien builds up tension by not showing us what the alien looked like or what it was doing.
The characters were amazing during the whole movie. They weren't there just for the alien to kill, they actually had characteristic unique to them. Each character felt real and relatable.
The best part of the movie was definitely the alien. Like I said above the alien was never shown completely without purpose. It was moving with the intention of killing everyone on board.
Ridley Scott direction was excellent. From the atmosphere to how the alien goes on board the ship, everything was on point. I loved the atmosphere of this movie, it was a claustrophobic during most of the movie.
This film is not an action film, so it doesn't have fast sequence moments; this movie takes its time and is a very slow pace. But, that is what makes it work."
claszdsburrogato,"Sep 3, 2023",6/10,"Alien was released 44 years ago and still impresses with its technical quality. The scenarios and visual effects are perfect, managing to be better than many of the current films that have much more technology to create something better. The Alien has a wonderful and iconic look, making him one of the most striking villains in cinema, even though he doesn't appear all the time. Not showing up much is what makes him so awesome. The tension scenes work really well because you don't know what he's capable of and you can't see him. The characters are well developed and the fights between them are very natural. There is only one moment where the visual effects are not so good, but that does not negate all the aesthetic beauty and writing of the film. Perhaps this is the best science fiction in cinema."
skeen-69248,"Apr 16, 2017",9/10,"At the end of the day, Alien is now roughly almost 40 years old. 40 years is a long time, and we've seen cinema evolve drastically over that period, yet Alien retains everything it had back in 1979.Everything from the atmosphere, the long shots, the slow build-ups, the creature design, the characters, the plot twist, I could go on. It really does become difficult to find flaws in this movie. Granted some of the FX are pretty dated now, but you have to remember how revolutionary they were back in the day.Alien is a masterclass in sci-fi horror, far and few films can claim the level of superiority that Ridley Scott's masterpiece still holds."
SkullBucket444,"Jul 9, 2025",7/10,"This movie holds up well for when it was released-the story and execution were solid for its time. That said, I personally lean toward the sharper visuals and more immersive scenes found in newer films, which does lower my overall rating. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it doesn't fully align with my current preferences.One thing that stood out as a weakness was how some death scenes were handled, especially those involving the alien. The quick, chaotic camera cuts made it hard to follow what was actually happening. There wasn't enough detail or clarity in those moments, and they ended up feeling more confusing than intense. That aspect definitely could've been done better."
ma-cortes,"Mar 3, 2014",9/10,"This horrifying as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , chills , profanity , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . The commercial vessel Nostromo with a crew in deep-space sleep wakes up and receives a distress call from an unexplored planet . The futuristic cargo ship picks up an unwanted passenger : a malicious extraterrestrial . After searching for survivors, the ill-fated crew heads home only to realize that a deadly bioform has joined them . The merciless alien lives on human flesh and continually changes form . Then the Earthlings have a hard time figuring out the whereabout of the heinous being that is running amok .This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s and 80s . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creature by the artist HR Giger , it was conceptual artist Ron Cobb who came up with the idea that the Alien should bleed acid . Extraordinary as well as astounding special effects in the chestburster scenes , the rumor that the cast, except for John Hurt, did not know what would happen during scenes is partly true and it was filmed in one take with four cameras; for instance, Veronica Cartwright did not expect to be sprayed with blood. The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien . ¨Alien¨ is clearly inspired by ¨It ¡ the terror from beyond space¨ . Sigourney Weaver breathes fire into Ripley and remaining actors are all magnificent as the crew of a futurist starship such as Tom Skerritt who is awesome in compelling lead role as commandant , Harry Dean Stanton , Veronica Cartwright , Yaphet Kotto , John Hurt and special mention to Ian Holm . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Ridley Scott who keeps everything bouncing at an absolutely frantic pace . Ridley Scott cites three films as the shaping influences on his movie: George Lucas' Star Wars (1977) and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (1968) for their depiction of outer space, and Tobe Hooper's Texas chain saw massacre (1974) for its treatment of horror .It is followed by ¨Aliens ¨, also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Bill Paxton , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; Alien 3 ¨ in which the alien regenerates and causes wreak havoc on isolated planet prison , being directed by David Fincher with Charles S Dutton , Paul McGann , Charles Dance ; ¨Alien: Resurrection¨ by Jean Pierre Jeunet with Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott . All of them starred by the great Sigourney Weaver who performed one of the best female leads created in years . Furthermore, ¨Alien vs. Predator¨ (2004) by Paul Anderson with Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Lance Henriksen , Colin Salmon , Tommy Flannagan and ¨Aliens vs. Predator 2¨ (2007) by Strause Brothers with Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis and Robert Joy ."
acdc_mp3,"Feb 8, 2022",10/10,"I have seen this movie countless times since 1979 and it still delivers on the aspect of being far from earth, on a planet you do not know, with a spaceship of unknown origin, and encountering a nasty lifeform. These people were blue collar workers; not the brilliant scientists and doctors that you see in today's movies regarding aliens. No, what you see in 1979 is much more realistic of how humans would be when encountering a complete unknown. In movies like Prometheus and Life, the overall common sense is nil and the smarmy, charming and very attractive geniuses are completely opposite of what brilliant people of science and medicine are really like. In reality, they are mostly awkward, quiet, strange and in many times extremely plain in appearance. In Alien, everyone comes across as tired, annoyed, curious (Kane) and finally terrified. A very real progression that leads to the outcome.Most of the bad reviews I have read on IMDB come from viewers who have grown up on the CGI oatmeal that most movies rely on instead of story. It's sad that they don't realize how great the story of Alien is.The cast back in 1979 was mostly unknowns which added so much to the reality and everyone played their parts perfectly.I am watching the movie right now as I write this and even though I know exactly what is going to happen, I am still tense and in awe of how good it still is.If you do not like this movie, I pity you."
aaronbfontenot,"Sep 30, 2020",10/10,This is truly a must see classic for any sci-fi fan let alone Film buff.
jansundstedt,"Nov 2, 2021",10/10,"What can be written or said about a masterpiece that hasn´t been written or said before? Not much, I suppose, but I just have to get it out of my system. ""ALIEN"" is a masterpiece in the art of movie making - period! It is as classic as it is legendary. Those who think otherwise, I´m sorry but you are a lost cause. I cannot praise this film enough. You could say that I am obsessed with it - it is that great.This is what you can achieve when you have top notch talent in every department: Writing, directing, editing, scenery, art department, special effects, music, acting, et cetera. As opposed of today, when totalitarian and political correctness handcuffs creativity. It´s not a coincidence that I personally detest most films coming out The System (i.e. Hollywood) today.First of all we must go down on our knees and thank God for Dan O'Bannon, Ridley Scott and H. R. Giger, for being the three principal people responsible for bringing ""ALIEN"" to life. Especially O'Bannon, whom without there would be no movie in the first place. It´s a pity that he (outside the hardcore fan-base) hasn´t been given more attention than he has. Just think about; if ""Dark Star"" had been a (moderate) success, maybe ""ALIEN"" would never had seen the light of day?Ridley Scott, what can I say? The man is (was?) the best visual director in the business, bar none. Only Kubrick could compete with him in that department. It may be O'Bannon's idea, but Ridley Scott brought that idea to life. Every single shot and every single frame is a work of beauty and art. The composition of every scene is so beautiful and shines with a touch of class that - with a few exceptions - is rarely often seen today. True genius, Ridley Scott.Last but not least, the utmost praise most go to Hans Rudi Giger. He brought something horrifying and yet beautiful to the screen that audiences hadn't seen before and perhaps hasn't seen since. LV-426 and its surroundings is all thanks to Giger (minus the chestburster and - in part - the facehugger). A masterstroke by Scott and O'Bannon insisting on getting Giger onboard. His biomechanical art is out of this world!Kudos to each and everyone. All of the actors who are perfectly cast; the art department; sound editing; special effects (that are astounding); Brandywine (for agreeing to produce it) and to Alan Ladd jr. Who green lighted it (at the time being the head of 20th Century Fox). Jerry Goldsmith put the icing on the cake with his eerie, evocative, haunting and yet beautiful score. Even though Scott and sound editor Terry Rawlings played copy and paste with the score and cues, plus incorporating the music from ""Freud"" in places.This is a great film. A cinematic achievement that I can watch over and over again. If nothing else for the framing of the picture and the visuals. I love this film. A sure 10 out of 10!By the way, did I mention how utterly scary it is?..."
Johnny-31,"Sep 9, 1998",N/A,"Every house has a room that strikes fear in the heart of young children. It is usually in the basement, next to the furnace where no light from the rest of the house seems to reach. When parents tell their kids to get something out of this room, they usually have to enlist the help of an older sibling just to make it down there. This room was my bedroom when my mother rented Alien for my twelfth birthday. I am now 26 and it has been a few years since the last nightmare. Alien is, without question, the scariest, most frightening movie that I have ever seen. If you want to permanently scar your children, have them watch this movie."
Leon_Chang_2000,"Jun 15, 2012",7/10,"Having just watched Alien for the first time, I cannot give it more than a 6/10. The film was mediocre at best. It began slowly, and honestly, never really picked up; in fact, I almost decided to stop the movie and go do something else since it was quite boring.Let me explain a bit further. The characters are weak, showing no development and very little likability. Thus, I had no care for them throughout the film and so they provided little incentive for me to keep watching. If anything, the pure annoyance at the characters' decisions made me want to turn off the movie even more.Furthermore, the plot was very straightforward and could not stand by itself. If you think for a moment about what would happen in a film named ""Alien"", chances are you are spot on.Because of this, I have a feeling that this movie must have stood on the laurels of its visuals and its novelty during the era. For contemporary viewers, these no longer hold much weight, and so the movie crumbles. As an analogy, I believe that similar remarks will be made about movies like James Cameron's Avatar in a few decades.To summarize, this is not a film that has withstood the test of time."
jeremiahcourter,"Dec 7, 2023",10/10,"I don't even know where to begin in reviewing this incredible film. I can't do it justice. This film creates the perfect atmosphere of ever mounting suspense with what has to be the best soundtrack ever made for a space horror film. Even the beginning title displayed at the start of the film makes you shift uncomfortably in your seatAll I'll say is that this movie haunted my dreams as a kid with a strange yet beautifully dark fascination. Even now, at 40 years old, the xenomorph both terrifies me and creates within me a sense of wonder behind its mysterious origin and nefarious capabilities.Truly the perfect organism."
fh147,"Sep 3, 2024",7/10,"Slow Beginnings where we get to learn the characters, then when s*** hits the deck it gets out of control. I really enjoyed my time with this movie the first half an hour was fine, but got them when it got going I could not look away.The lighting looked amazing how it keeps having those bright shines and complete Darkness at the same time, so you can see what was happening but dark holes in the screen at the same time very much good.Special effect and set designs also helped, it looks like something out of this world, That's Star Wars happened two years before it's hard to believe when looking at this movie.I have seen so many games and movies that is in some way inspired by this movie, but I still got hooked in. The acting feels so natural with the feeling of these ideas Space Truckers, the people are talking over each other like normal people but you can still understand it because the audio design is so good.Would absolutely recommend and the 4K Blu-ray is amazing to look at."
eskwarczynski,"Mar 21, 2016",3/10,"Beautiful cinematography and incredible visual effects can't save a painfully generic and rather mediocre film. I've watched Alien twice, both times causing me to scratch my head in regards to why it is considered to be a classic.Yes, the poster is cool, the tag-line is cool, the production design is cool, and Sigourney Weaver is obviously really cool. But the movie just isn't. It's an unoriginal slasher film that takes place on a spaceship.Unlike Mad Max: Fury Road – which also has a minimalist story – the action in Alien doesn't lead anywhere, it just sort of happens periodically. Overall, it feels like a walk through an overproduced haunted house at a county fair. The sets may be realistic but the scares often fall flat."
TrulyOnFilm,"Jun 1, 2025",10/10,"Alien is a masterpiece. A perfect fusion of sci-fi and horror that still holds up as one of the most atmospheric and suspenseful movies ever made. The pacing is slow in the best way possible, building dread with every quiet corridor, blinking light and echoing footstep. It's a film that knows exactly when to explode and when to sit in the silence.The design of the xenomorph is iconic for a reason. It's terrifying, unknowable, and feels like a true predator. And Ripley? One of the best final girls of all time. Sigourney Weaver brings this quiet strength and intensity that carries the entire film, especially in the final act.It's beautifully shot, perfectly scored, and absolutely soaked in tension. From the chestburster scene to the final showdown, Alien is a clinic in how to do sci-fi horror right. It's not just one of the best of its kind, it is the blueprint."
blastshafira,"Nov 19, 2018",9/10,"The very first movie of the Alien movie franchise and definitely one of the best sci-fi movie of all time and for me, the best movie in the whole franchise. Despite being an old movie, the props are UNREAL. It's unbelievably realistic, fascinating and the details are gruesome yet magnificent.
It's bewildering how someone could think of such story in 1979 where the whole alien-conspiracy was not a hit. and what's more amazing is how clear they plot is. No filler and needless details. The movie certainly gives a very tense feel even until the very end.
If i didn't know what time the movie was made, i would've guessed it was made in the 2000s. Definitely a must watch because it lives up to everyone's expectation. They still put a little bit of moral value in this movie-- that science is not necessary if it means putting humanity at risk. All the casts successfully portray their characters."
manisimmati,"Mar 8, 2018",9/10,"In terms of sci-fi horror, Ridley Scott's »Alien« is as good as it gets. As many people have pointed out, the story is basically B-movie stuff: a spooky monster haunts some hapless people, only this time they're in space. Scott stages the rather simple plot like an arthouse flick, beginning with the slick and lifeless introduction to the space ship Nostromo. The atmosphere is unbelievably tense throughout the movie: from the industrial Nostromo, the stormy planet V-426 to the phallic Alien designed by H. R. Giger.In many ways, »Alien« is the antithesis to Stanley Kubrick's »2001: A Space Odyssey«, the most megalomaniac movie ever conceived. Ridley Scott shows us that space travel won't be about philosophical self-discovery. It will be about dirty, senseless work. Of course, there are also some gender issues at stake here. Sigourney Weaever as Ellen Ripley might be most badass last girl in movie history - and maybe the first female action star that is not reduced to her womanhood.If »Alien« has one problem, it's the fact that it betrays its B-movie roots. There is a wannabe-deep scene near the end of the movie that feels affixed, as if Ridley Scott wanted to reconcile the intellectuals in the movie theater. That wasn't necessary at all. Still, if you're into stylish and evocative sci-fi, horror or sci-fi horror, you need to watch »Alien«. Man, what am I talking about? If you're into movies at all, you need to watch this flick."
dworldeater,"Nov 26, 2021",10/10,"Alien is Ridley Scott's masterpiece. This kicked off a mostly excellent franchise and influenced cinema as whole. Designed with great detail by brilliant artist HR Geiger the Alien brings forth a new level of intergalactic terror. Alien is completely different from anything that came before and took sci fi horror to new heights and gave it a lot of depth. The ensemble cast is excellent and is lead by Sigorney Weaver and had Yaphett Kotto, Tom Skerrit and Harry Dean Stanton as strong support. In my opinion this film is flawless and still looks incredible today. The special effects are amazing and the acting and direction is spot on. Alien is incredible and in my opinion is timeless. The film aged well and is essential and a classic."
Dutch90,"Apr 2, 2018",N/A,"The wave of horror films from the 70s and 80s was filled with what many would consider classics. Halloween, Hellraiser, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are all entrenched in the public consciousness and a must see for any film fanatic. But few of these, even the really good ones, rise above the level of 'cult' classic - they have a dedicated fan following and are certainly good films in their own right, but never really rise above their genre. Needless to say, the *true* horror classics hail from the black and white era of the 30s, 40s and 50s, but I'm specifically referring to the 70s/80s wave here. In my book, three of those rose above the level of cult classic, to become true film classics - The Thing, The Excorcist and Alien. And Alien is the one to rule them all.In many ways, Alien is the base on which every sci-fi horror film of the past forty years was built. Every film made in this genre, no matter how innovative in other areas, rips off Alien in *some* way at least. From the unique design, courtesy of the late H.R. Giger, to the bleak and pessimistic future set design - even more so than the grimy 'used future' and interstellar warfare of Star Wars, Alien is the true antithesis to the giddy optimism of Star Trek - and the greedy corporation trying to exploit the beast at the expense of the characters, and humanity at large. Watching it now, it may seem like you've seen all this before - but that's only because so many others learned it from Alien.Story-wise, Alien is not much to look at. Though innovative at the time, it is a very basic 'space-explorers-encounter-a-deadly-organism' tale that we've become familiar with by now. The brilliance lies in the execution - Jerry Goldsmith's creepy score, Ridley Scott's slow, atmospheric direction and the authenticity of the characters. Alien's characters aren't particularly developed, but engaging all the same. We get to know them not through deep backstories or dramatic character arcs, but their interactions - including several improvised scenes - which showcase them as relatable, working class everymen. These aren't the mystic heroes of Star Wars on a quest to save the galaxy, or the elite Starfleet captains commanding a ship exploring the vast reaches of space - these are your everyday working stiffs, sent out to the middle of nowhere on a gig. Space holds no enthralling mystery to them - it's their working environment, much like sailors out at sea. And when they encounter a dilapidated alien vessel on a barren planet, there is none of the exciting mystery of many space exploration tales - rather, there is a sense of impending doom. And we see their very human reactions when they encounter this fearsome extraterrestrial predator - fear, anger and desperation. This is not the childlike wonder of first contact, but the terror of being trapped in a tin can with an animal trying to eat you. As icing to the cake, there is no real 'hero' to the story. Ellen Ripley, played brilliantly by Sigourney Weaver - by now synonymous with the Alien franchise - does not emerge as a 'natural leader' among the group. In fact, she doesn't really lead at all - she becomes the story's sole survivor mainly through happenstance, because she is fortunate enough to not be in the wrong place when the Alien comes out, and spends enough time studying it to figure out a way to outsmart it. Later films elevated Ripley to a more mythical status as the woman who kept surviving the Alien incursions, taking away from her human vulnerability in this film.None of this would be as effective without the film's briljant creature design and special effects. Making the most of its modest budget (reportedly, Ridley Scott built the Space Jockey set without full permission from the studio) and using SFX both sparingly and effectively, Alien has managed to stand the test of time much better than its 1986 sequel Aliens. H.R. Giger's creepy, sexually charged design - inspired both by outlandish fetishes and deep phobias of rape - has not been matched in the decades after, though many have tried. This isn't a cheesy green space invader with a laser gun, but an *animal* - a fierce creature, trying to feed, survive and procreate. The humans it encounters are no mortal enemies or puny natives to be conquered, but either prey or merely in the way. In fact, it isn't really an evil monster - it's just doing what it does to survive. This, in fact, makes it a more effective antagonist rather than if it were just your average creepy space man. Later films respected this core foundation, but unfortunately moved away from the ilusive, deceptive nature of the Alien and turned into insectoid cannon fodder, dangerous mainly because of its large numbers. It's easy to forget that, at its core, Alien is supposed to be about suspense instead of action.No film, both within the series and outside it, has ever matched the briljant effectiveness of Alien. It is a film that was never meant to be A-list, but became so anyway because it was just executed so well. This is truly one for the ages, and a must-watch even if sci-fi and horror don't appeal to you."
gabriel_sanchez,"Dec 29, 2024",7/10,"It is 28 December 2024, and Alien seems like the perfect Christmas/Years-End movie to watch. Does it stand its own 45 years after launch? Well, sort of...There is nothing to say that has not been said before about Alien. Countless reviews in different media talks about its greatness and how it revolutionized sci-fi horror. To these statements, Alien remains truthful, a well-made sci-fi horror-driven drama about 7 contracted personnel in a container ship that wake up suddenly from cryo-sleep because of an unknown beacon from seemingly uncharted territory. Far away from Earth, and bound by contract, they investigate the beacon to find an alien life-form that might put their lives at risk.Most, if not all elements of Alien have undergone scrutiny, dissection from plot to cinematography. Yes, it is a simplistic plot that sort of works; yes, the slow-paced, slow-driven terror is amusing, for the most part, but can be quite tiresome. No news here. Thus, this review focuses on the nit-gritty aspects of this film in current times: what still works, what does not work anymore, starting with the latter.This review uses the Director's Cut for basis.Avoid the terrible mistake of watching the Director's Cut if you are to watch Alien for the first time. There is a reason for the existence of a Theatrical Cut and, later, a Director's Cut to make the scene, usually launching after the success of a movie or its Director - and Ridley Scott is a famous, famous individual. The Director's Cut is, well, one version away from Raw, and, in Alien, the pacing is weird, unexpected cuts destroying continuity.Maybe by the end of the 70s, Alien was frightening, but times were simpler back then. In 2024, this movie ranges from respectful classic to boring altogether. Movie aficionados find the cinematography and careful design to be top-notch, masterfully done for the time, especially considering that the CGI element is little to none, but today's audience expects action, and Alien provides little. The entirety of the movie is the characters trying to chase this unknown creature in a methodical way, while camerawork is worried about the aesthetics of the ship. When they do hit the creature, deaths happen mostly offscreen, to the unsatisfaction of the audience.The dialogue is also cringeworthy, a series of unnatural exchanges that feel scripted, at best. There is your fair share of expository speech, and then there is character development, which is sort of minimum and idiotic. Two characters complaining about their pay checks all the time; a weird Scientist that behaves like a plank; a woman that is hysterical from the start; a Captain that leads nothing. And then there is Ripley, which starts dull and ends dull, her emotional constraints unclear in the story until the unclimactic end.Yeah, the ending is far from amazing too. It basically just happens, no final confrontation, no sudden realization, nothing.Now, the elements that work are the ones that have sustained this powerful franchise.In the sci-fi horror genre, Alien is a ground breaker that shows that simplicity works. Give us cool trinkets and some exposition and we fill in the gaps.As aforementioned, the Cinematography is great, evidencing the aesthetics of the ship and focusing on the terror aspect through its slow drive.The antagonist is this interesting hunter beast, the perfect killing machine. Its motives are crude, rudimentary, but its coolness overcomes its dullness. Everyone knows the power of the Xenomorphs.Alien is one of those movies that stands the test of time as a fine piece of Art. Like such, average watchers might miss its intricate designs, dismissing it as old stuff, at best vintage. Those that look beyond should notice its raw power and fancy its clever prospects.Just... just don't watch the Director's Cut first."
elijahbutler-40119,"Feb 19, 2018",10/10,"I remember when I first saw Alien as a teenager. This movie scared me to the core and it's STILL scary and very suspenseful to this very day! I love movies from all genres and horror is one of my favorite genres in cinema history and when it comes to horror movies, Alien is DEFINITELY one of the greatest ones of all time! Ridley Scott's direction in Alien has a HIGHLY suspenseful feel throughout the entire film and it somewhat makes you feel disturbed and uncomfortable and that's one of the reasons why this film is so iconic! Sigourney Weaver as Ripley takes this ENTIRE film from opening to finish! She was EXCELLENT in this film and this is definitely one of the greatest roles I've seen in ANY movie which makes this one of the greatest roles in cinema history! All of the other characters such as Brett, Parker, Kane, Dallas, Ash and Lambert played by Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, and Veronica Cartwright were really interesting and engaging characters throughout the entire run time of the film and the acting in Alien is ABSOLUTELY mind-blowing which was another reason on why this movie is insanely scary! Now let's talk about the creature in Alien known as The Xenomorph, this thing is just.................ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING AND AWESOME! The Xenomorph has to be one of the scariest things I've ever seen in ANY movie in my entire life! Ridley Scott also decided to not show this creature for the majority of the film which was a little more terrifying, because you never really expect or know when this thing is going to come or what it's going to do to the crew or what the creature looks like when you first watch Alien and it is just GENIUS AND FANTASTIC SUSPENSE FILM-MAKING! Something else that I also love about Alien is of course the iconic chest burst scene! Most of you who have seen Alien know what I'm talking about, but when they were shooting the chest burst scene, the actors were 100% unaware of what was going to come out of John Hurt's chest so when the Xenomorph burst out of his chest, their reactions were legit and real and that's just so awesome! This movie also holds one of the GREATEST jumpscares in cinema history when Dallas is in the air shafts and out of NOWHERE he runs into the Xenomorph and you don't actually see him die by it, but you see it appear and you just hear this EXTREMELY LOUD screeching sound and static sounds in the background and every time I watch this movie, that jumpscare STILL sends chills down my spine and it's a jumpscare done right! There's also something else I absolutely love about Alien when the crew finds out that Ash was a robot that was sent by the company to send this life form back to earth and it is a VERY clever twist that was HIGHLY unexpected and it's all done by the genius mind of Scott and the tension he brings in this film! Alien is one of my all time favorite movies and it has stood the test of time VERY SUCCESSFULLY and it has inspired many film-makers and it will continue to do that, because it's a timeless masterpiece and a classic film and Alien DEFINITELY gets a 10/10!"
Lechuguilla,"Dec 29, 2008",2/10,"A rat in the attic is a good metaphor for this unimaginative ""sci-fi"" flick from director Ridley Scott. The human crew aboard a Hollywood-conceived spacecraft diddle and dawdle. They chitchat about this and that; they eat; they smoke; they look at outdated computer screens; they emit petty frustrations. Finally, after interminable plot filler, and after our space voyagers have displayed requisite incompetence (what would film stories be without incompetence?), ET shows up on-board, less cosmic than sleazy, like something the cat drug in from a b-grade horror flick. Now, our beleaguered ... and incompetent ... crew promptly sets forth to deal with the menace.But our spacecraft-trapped rat has vanished into the woodwork, probably to escape the crew's incompetence and/or all the hammy acting. Where did ET go? Behind the stove? Under the frig? Inside the computer? Nope, he's in the attic. Quick, fumigate. Oops, too late. The house is condemned.I'm constantly amazed how easily sci-fi fans can be satisfied by conventional, stodgy stories, and cheesy, overbearing special effects. Where in this film is a sense of the cosmic? Where is the originality? Where is the science fiction in all of this?"
jacquelineess,"Nov 2, 2019",10/10,"This is a MASTERPIECE.
The PACING, the cinematography, the acting, the ALIEN, everything is impeccable.
They don't make movies like this one anymore!
EXCELLENT!!!!"
SnoopyStyle,"Oct 25, 2013",10/10,"An alien distress call from an uncharted planet awaken the crew of the deep space towing vessel Nostromo. They go down to the planet to investigate only to bring back something dangerous.The story is a fairly simple creature feature in a spaceship. Ridley Scott took that simple story and gave it everything needed to make a new standard in sci-fi horror. Before it the sci-fi horror is the mainstay of B-movie schlock. After it the genre reach a new golden age. The same way that Star Wars pushed the envelope, the same can be said of Alien.The atmosphere is fantastic. Ridley Scott has packed in some iconic scenes. Who can forget the meal scene? It's going down in movie history. That are some movies that transcend a simple movie. This is one of them."
anders-rock,"May 29, 2011",10/10,Every second of this movie gives me the shivers. Even in the slow moving first half the atmosphere is so ominous and creepy and the acting so excellent that I'm never bored. The movie builds up the tension so masterfully you're on the edge of your seat all the time. I've heard some people say that the effects are dated to which I will answer: No not really. The monster is a man in a suit with some mechanics in the head and while there are a few shots where it's movements seem a little stiff we rarely see it and when we do it's only for a short duration and it actually in many ways looks more real than most CGI creatures of today. The artwork and design is one of the reasons this movie holds up so well to me. The ship looks appropriately old and battered up and the alien itself is pure genius. This movie just keeps thrilling me every time I watch it.
nmholland,"Mar 5, 2016",10/10,"Alien is directed Ridley Scott and stars Sigourney Weaver in her breakout role as Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut that belongs to a crew that receives a distress call from an unexplored planet while in space. They respond to the call by landing on the planet, and searching it. They seemingly find nothing, but, upon leaving, find an unwanted visitor aboard their ship. Once they figure out that this ""alien"" is superior to humans in most every way, the film becomes a battle to either kill, or at most escape, the deadly creature.This film is widely considered one of the best horror movies of all time, and I can really see why. I can also see why some consider it one of the best films of all time. Alien is teeming with suspense, and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat for almost the entire run time, say for some exposition in the beginning. Every time the audience gets even a subtle glimpse of the beast, each and every time there's a subtle jump, singularly due to the amazing practical effects of the alien itself.To start with some pros, the directing is utterly fantastic, to say the least. Ridley Scott does such a good job working the camera; it makes every emotion pop right out of the screen and suck the watcher right into the movie, drawing out the tone drastically. Some of the long takes can pull forth the tension throughout the scene, or the fear that a specific character feels at the present time.The acting is also amazing, starting with Sigourney Weaver. She gives one of the most breathtaking female performances in cinema history. Her character, Ellen Ripley, is a very strong and independent female; one in which no male is required to make her who she is, unlike most female leads today. If movies delivered more characters like Ripley, films would be better in almost every way.The hands down best thing about this film, however, is the simplicity of the plot. One can only imagine a person pitching the idea for this film, saying ""a crew of astronauts are stuck on a ship with an alien that kills them."" The straightforwardness of the plot is so astounding, it makes one do a double take upon the complexity of a horror, or even action, film in the modern day. This simplicity is present in many ""best films of all time,"" such as Die Hard (1988), or Jaws (1975). Overcomplicated plots are one of the many reasons why too many movie goers say ""they don't make'em like they used to.""Overall, Alien is understandably one of the best films of all time, thanks to the characters, directing, and clarity of the plot. I'm going to give Alien an A+, or a 10 out of 10."
PredragReviews,"Apr 20, 2016",9/10,"""Alien"" is one of the most intense Sci-Fi thrillers to have ever graced the silver screen or the home theater in any format! It is the film's intensity that provides such an incredible draw to this extraordinary film. I was pulled in by the ultra high sense of realism. This film almost feels like a documentary because of a lot of the subtle hand-held camera work (read; not like the shaky, seizure inducing hand-held work of today's films). There's much going on in that film that was revolutionary for the time. Great ideas, design, cinematography, subtle, very realistic performances.Sigourney Weaver stars as Ellen Ripley in her film debut role. Weaver is absolutely perfect for the role, and was practically the first girl-power type female heroine who single-handedly carries this international blockbuster right through until the final minutes. John Hurt also plays Kane to excellent effect, especially in his death scene as he frantically wriggles on the table with the alien inside him. Harry Dean Stanton is brilliant as Brett, as is Tom Skerritt as Dallas. Yaphet Kotto is also perfectly cast as Parker, who provides many on-screen laughs. Veronica Kartwright (who later went on to star in The X-Files some 20 years later) stars as the lovable Lambert, the only other female member of the crew along with Ripley. Ian Holm as Ash is absolutely brilliant in his role as the android secretly sent on board to bring back the alien life- form, while - in his eyes, and ""Mother's"" - all other crew members are expendable. The acting in this film is really first-rate, which is another big factor in why the film works so well.The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself is right on the money. It amazes me how well visually this movie still holds up. It feels as rich and deep cinematically as most anything today due to Ridley Scott's brilliant visuals. You watch this film at certain points and it feels as slick and polished as any current genre film without the hollowness or incompetence.All in all, Alien is a terrific sci-fi horror movie that plays with your senses incredibly well. Nothing happens for the first 30 minutes, and that is exactly the director's intent. By doing so, a feeling of extreme suspense is instantly formed, leaving you on the edge of your seat until the very end.Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
Red_Identity,"Mar 19, 2012",N/A,"Believe it or not, I had never seen an Alien film. What prompted me to actually see it was the fantastic Prometheus trailer that debuted. Even if the film turns out to suck (which I really doubt) it would still have been worth it to watch the original Alien.What can I say? Fantastic. The music, the slow-paced nature of the first half, together with increasing tension as the film goes along is incredible. Once stuff hits the fan, it never lets you go. The film is also quite scary, an it made me jump various times. Why? It knows how to build tension incredibly, and the final 20 minutes are truly perfection. Both the sound and visual effects work to make the film a very effective experience, as does the wonderful cinematography. Bring on the Aliens, bitch!"
Falko_h1,"Jun 10, 2024",7/10,"""Alien,"" directed by Ridley Scott and released in 1979, is a landmark in the sci-fi horror genre. The film stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, a crew member of the spaceship Nostromo. The crew responds to a distress signal from a desolate planet, only to discover a deadly alien life form that begins to hunt them down one by one.Scott's direction excels in creating an atmosphere of dread and suspense, utilizing the confined spaces of the spaceship to enhance the claustrophobic terror. The film's slow build-up masterfully increases tension, and H. R. Giger's design of the alien creature remains iconic and deeply unsettling.The cast delivers strong performances, with Weaver standing out as a resilient and resourceful protagonist. The practical effects and set design are impressive, contributing to the movie's immersive and foreboding environment.While ""Alien"" is a highly effective thriller, its deliberate pacing and minimalist dialogue might not appeal to viewers seeking more immediate action. Nonetheless, the film's influence on both science fiction and horror is undeniable, making it a must-watch for fans of either genre. ""Alien"" offers a chilling and suspenseful journey into the unknown, blending atmospheric horror with sci-fi elements to create a timeless classic."
djbeardpaperclip,"Dec 16, 2024",6/10,"Alien stands alongside Jaws as one of the great shock horror movies of the 70s.The huge cargo carrying juggernaut of a space craft harbours an industrial aesthetic far removed from the bright futurist spaceships of earlier times. The plot is good even if the action is limited to creeping around the service ducts in search of the unwelcome alien intruder.The only duff note is the glimpse we get of the creature as it is expelled into space, when it briefly and unexpectedly resembles a thin man with a long tail and an elongated head.Sigourney Weaver steals the show as the female hero in tiny pants."
acedj,"Mar 16, 2019",10/10,"This is a masterpiece. From the long, detailed shots of both interior and exterior of the ship, to the fleeting glimpses of the alien, this is cinematography at it's best. The movie is paced slow, in order to build tension, and it was the right decision. Alien paved the way for a whole new genre of movie, scifi horror. Ridley Scott birthed an instant classic, and unfortunately has not been able to repeat such a marvel."
UniqueParticle,"Oct 16, 2019",10/10,"Captivating development I can't believe I have only seen once before today many years ago! The sound and special effects is so well done, very translucent legendary classic like nothing else. So nice to see all the young actors in their prime. The look of Alien and drool was so perfect; I am so grateful to have been able to experience it on the big screen, sorry if I overly talk about that although I did get my ticket in August so I was ready. One of the greatest films ever made on earth and I am glad I own in 4K, I got that not too long ago."
Real_Review,"Jun 11, 2019",10/10,"I had seen this a couple of times prior to watching it with the expressed purpose of reviewing the quality of the film. It's a classic - if you live in America and watch movies, then you really can't escape having seen 'Alien' (1979) at least a couple of times. I always thought it was ok - a fine movie. I'm not a sci-fi fan and I don't particularly care for Sigourney Weaver. However, I created this numeric review system since the last time I saw this film, and I have reviewed 130 or so films now for IMDB. Regularly reviewing films with this metric has changed the way I watch a movie. Now, there is this constant comparison in my mind, weighing the qualities of the film I am watching verses all other films of the genre.'Alien' (1979) is one of the greatest films of all time. The 1970's effects not only hold up, but are still impressive, due to extraordinary cinematography. Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ripley and she adds surprise sexuality to the film toward the end. The writing shows the ship to be a microcosm of societal conflicts - duty verses survival, equal pay for equal work, and the battle for women's equality in group decision making. And, then there is The Alien. I capitalize his name (or title?) because he is one of the biggest box office draws of all time. Nicholas Cage wishes he had the career of The Alien.This film has some great qualities and no noticeable flaws. I am proud to award it my 6th perfect score.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

TheLittleSongbird,"Jan 11, 2011",10/10,"Easily one of Ridley Scott's finest films, and one of the best of the sci-fi genre. Alien is simply wonderful, with imaginative production design especially and a magnificent score from Jerry Goldsmith. The pace is also right on the money with a purposefully slow build-up, the editing is great, Scott's direction is superb and the story is wonderfully structured with seldom a dull moment. The script is also thought-provoking, clever and well written, while the atmosphere is just spellbinding with a perfect mixture of false scares and genuine jolts. The acting is also top notch, Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ellen Ripley, who is not only one of the most iconic characters in film history but a contender for Weaver's best ever role. It is a delight seeing fine underrated actor John Hurt, and he is great to watch as the curious crewman. Overall, defines the term sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
timwebley,"Sep 15, 2021",10/10,"This is going to sound extreme. But I see the pyramids of Egypt and wonder how a primitive society achieved such a feat. If Alien (1979) was releases in 2021, It would still be a feat of design, suspense and sci-fi genius. Absolute classic, absolutely years ahead of its time."
jackasstrange,"Nov 2, 2013",7/10,"I never was a big fan of the Alien series. Always thought that they were way too dumb. However, i've never watched the very first one; the one which started everything, the original Alien. Until today. And to be honest, i am a bit disappointed. It's a very well made film, even more for the standards of 1979, but to the story itself...well, i just don't care for it at all. Sure, the film has great visuals, the spacecraft is full of interesting details, but the story is dry. The character development is not adequate at all, and this is an aspect which i consider fundamental in any film. We don't have any deep idea of who are the persons in there, or what they were doing, or what they are going to do. Then, the thriller? Almost none. And it's not scary. To the well of the truth, almost all the times the 'scariest' moments were very predictable and even unintentionally comic.But nice. It's a classic, right? Well, personally, i don't give a dawn. Because besides the fact that it is an extremely well made thriller with an Alien as the main villain , It has nothing more to add. Maybe it was very good back in the 70s and 80s, but not anymore. 7.3/ 10"
michael-3204,"Jul 11, 2016",10/10,"I first saw ""Alien"" the day after it opened, knowing very little about it except that the cryptic TV commercial for the film looked cool and its advertising slogan (""In space, no one can hear you scream"") was compelling. Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott were mostly unknown and the rest of cast, while recognizable, weren't typically headliners in highly anticipated Hollywood releases. This had ""B-movie"" written all over it, and in many ways it is very much a B-movie made with A-list skill, craftsmanship and imagination.It's impossible, all these years and several viewings later, to separate myself from my first experience of watching it. I can't forget that I nearly jumped back a row, to the accompanying screams of a nearly full theatre of moviegoers, during the now-famous chest- bursting scene. The iconic imagery of the film -- the sensuous design of the alien ship, the ominously large corpse of the alien spaceman fused to his giant perch with bones bent outward, the unknowable originality of the titular creature and its unpredictable life cycle, the lived-in character of the commercial towing vessel Nostromo (""Star Wars"" excepted, in most depictions of space travel at the time everything had a factory-fresh gleam) -- all became almost instantly iconic and influential for a reason. Having experienced this film's introduction into an unsuspecting world, it's not possible to look at it through the eyes of contemporary film fans who come to it later and might judge it by a different standard.All of which it to say, I admit to being incredibly biased in my assessment of how well ""Alien"" holds up despite the considerable advances in visual effects since it was made. What looks a bit dated today is the depiction of the on-board computer ""Mother"" and the bizarre blinky-light room in which it is housed. Most of the rest of the tech depictions are fine, mainly because the story doesn't rely on whiz-bang futuristic tech to propel it. The basic (and, alas, inadequate) weaponry with which Nostromo's crew tries to contain the alien was understandable then and now, on a non-military vessel with a civilian crew. The surprise reveal about the true nature of one of the crew members still makes sense against the backdrop of corporate shenanigans in which the crew operates. Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's story carefully constructs the sense in which the deck is stacked against our heroes in ways they don't fully grasp until a few of them have died, and it does so mainly by making the crew anything but heroic. These are ordinary workers who snipe at each other and complain about their pay and try to advance their place in the hierarchy the way workers everywhere do, and maintain an uneasy camaraderie and mutual respect despite workplace tensions that are eminently relatable.A lot has been written about this film as a metaphor for both male and female rape and the predatory nature of sexuality. While the film's design is stuffed with incredible sexual imagery, I'm not really sure what that analysis gets you. ""Alien"" is essentially a very effective, beautifully shot horror movie set in outer space. It employed and helped solidify horror movie tropes we're all familiar with. It's not afraid to take its time to build atmosphere, character and suspense, which might (but shouldn't) try the patience of people used to the faster pace of current films. To me, it was and remains an almost perfect movie."
BaskingintheWind,"Apr 30, 2025",10/10,"This is my personal favorite horror film of all time, and still ages well every year that comes by. This is a good Sci-Fi/Horror movie. This is one movie that everyone should at least watch once in their life. It is a damn good movie, it is scary, fun, thrilling, jaw dropping, and if you want to watch this movie watch the director's cut, it's honestly better. The alien design is scary and grotesque and the practical effects on the movie is so good, and looks better than any new movie that uses SGI. But if you want to watch a movie that is scary, and feels like a cyberpunk'y movie, then give this a watch."
livena-90188,"Feb 17, 2024",9/10,"The creature design by H. R. Giger is particularly noteworthy, offering a glimpse into a nightmare world that was both mesmerizing and horrifying. The visual effects, which combined models, practical effects, and innovative techniques, set a new standard for realism and immersion in sci-fi films, effectively transporting audiences into the distressing reality of the characters.Personally, I hold a deep appreciation for ""Alien."" Its mastery in atmosphere, tension-building, and the sheer creativity of its visual storytelling not only makes it a favorite of mine but also solidifies its status as a seminal work in the film industry. The movie's legacy, which has inspired countless films and filmmakers, attests to its remarkable quality and enduring appeal. ""Alien"" is not just a testament to the artistic and technical capabilities of its era but a timeless classic that continues to captivate and terrify audiences to this day."
Josef_Schweik,"May 4, 2019",10/10,"There are many so-called scary movies, but the scariest ones are those that play out in our mind. Where your imagination completes the picture and your brain delivers the jolt of horror! Alien is one such movie! I saw it first at 15 and was scared out of my wits, and it really was not until my 20s that I could look at the whole movie without goosebumps.Now, after watching the movie perhaps 100 times, I am still attracted to it and drawn into it. But my perception of it changes. Having seen it today again on TV, I realized the really positive message was that the CAT has survived :) The Nostromo crew is dead and the ship destroyed, a colony would be set up on the planet and destroyed again, Ellen Ripley loses her daughter and ultimately her life, but the Weyaland-Yutani Corporation prospers. Everything sucks except the cat makes it! And that is good :)Bottom line: Cat 1 - Alien 0"
gwm-06737,"Jul 9, 2021",10/10,"Most of the 10 ratings cover the important points of why this film is so important. I can only add that aside from the outstanding pre-CGI visuals, sets, miniatures, etc., what is really worth noting is the dialog in this film. It flows in such a natural, believable way throughout....which is saying something given the nature of the genre. Not a cringe-worthy moment to be found. So different from today's frenzied and forced sci-fi."
satannama,"Jul 1, 2006",N/A,"A rebuke to Star Wars. This is horror the way Darth Vasder should have been in the hands of a real film maker instead of Lucas's indulgent fantasy about fluffy monsters. Those who don't know what its about the synopsis is an abandoned derelict space craft harbors eggs which have a life cycle similar to insects and John Hurt gets his most famous role. Dark tortured tense this also precedes Das Boot surprisingly with its mobile camera, the first use of steady cam, and tense claustrophobic darkly lit sets. Has received a minor backlash because it is so good and critics hate admitting this genre can produce classics. Watchit again and again and never be disappointed"
alvarax,"Jul 3, 2025",6/10,"Alien is one of the movies that is considered a Sc-FI classic, but for me it's just all right but I'm not a big Sci-Fi guy so maybe I'm not the right reviewer for this film. Regardless the plot is pretty good, the acting is fine, the eerie tension is there but it just drags and drags and by the end I just didn't really care anymore.The setting is cool and the discovery of the alien is interesting and when you see it it is freaky to behold. This film is only a horror when it comes to it's blood and gore; it's not particularly scary except for a couple of scenes.I will say the film is a bit gross at times, which I suppose is a form of scary.The acting is ok but you don't really get attached to anyone.I think Aliens is better than the original but the film is all right and is worth a watch though do so when your prepared to be patient with it."
lourensini,"Feb 3, 2012",6/10,"Directors must realize that ain't darkness that build a thriller. It's the plot. And I'm not going to do a personal review saying the movie is amazing just because Ridley Scott directed it.Alien is too much overrated. And except the fact it's a pretty original movie, it has nothing to call my attention. There ain't nothing amazing about the actors and the plot is mostly predictable. You can see whats about to happen since they get out from the spaceship to explore another lost ship in a distant planet.The Soundtrack follows whats going on in the movie, thats nice (or is the minimum music producers should do. But it ain't no The Untouchbles.The worst part is the constant dark screen. And when it ain't black, is black and blue. Of course, its supposed to create a thriller atmosphere. But it doesn't. It just makes you try to imagine what the f**k is going on through the hole movie.Actors perform well (but not impressively), at least if we compare this to Alien Ressuraction.The reason I'm giving it a six it's just because Alien its and amazing creature, smart and with incredible capabilities to procreate without and male (through parthenogenesis, I assume). And to kill whats near by it without even feel threatened."
hall895,"Apr 6, 2013",5/10,"Upon its initial release critical reaction to Alien was mixed to negative. One notable review described it as an empty bag of tricks. One critic dismissed it as an overblown B-movie. Another called it deeply dislikeable. Then a funny thing happened. Audiences saw the film and liked it. The film became a big success. It wasn't long before the film was being touted as a classic of its genre. Critics who had initially panned the film went back and wrote entirely new reviews praising it. The film was now beyond criticism. Nobody would dare admit they did not love it. Truth is the critics had it right the first time. This film is just not very good.Alien is meant to be a scary monster movie but the scares certainly don't come fast and furious. This film takes a long, long time setting itself up. Director Ridley Scott tries to build suspense. But this slow build drags on far too long for the film's good. Tension and intrigue drain away, boredom sets in. The film is often described as ""Jaws in space"" in that it's a monster movie in which we see very little of the monster. But where Steven Spielberg kept Jaws crackling along Scott's film gets terribly bogged down. Jaws also benefited from compelling characters. No such luck with Alien. Sigourney Weaver has some presence to her playing the key role of Ripley. But that character doesn't really spark to life until very late in the film. The rest of the cast has very little to do. A boring group of characters prone to doing stupid things. Like searching for a cat instead of, you know, escaping the giant murderous Alien. There are some notably fine actors here, including John Hurt and Ian Holm. But the script fails them. The characters never inspire much feeling in you at all, giving you little reason to care about their fate. There is very little story here, no character development whatsoever. A late reveal of one character's background proves more silly than shocking. The film has a memorable moment or two. But one or two moments in a two-hour film aren't nearly enough. This monster movie is monstrously overrated."
danielfarmer-80144,"Sep 5, 2021",10/10,"An absolute masterpiece of a film. This is how you make a horror film. The plot is fairly straight forward but its the cast and characters that make this movie. Superb acting from the likes of Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm and John Hurt make you really invested in the characters. What i liked about Alien is that you do not really know who is supposed to be the main character until about halfway through the movie which makes it feel much more realistic and believable. There is also some unexpected twists in the plot which are really shocking.The Alien design in this movie is the most awesome thing ever. Its so unique and terrifying. It is in my opinion the most interesting 'antagonist' so to speak created in a horror film to date. So must more interesting than a man in a mask just stabbing people. The practical effects are astonishing and its mind blowing how realistic they made this look in 1979. It still holds up perfectly today. This is one of the most well directed films i have ever seen. Every shot is perfect and carries meaning. The setting and locations are absolutely beautiful and the pacing is perfect. If you're an aspiring filmmaker and you want to learn them this is a must see.Alien absolutely masters the art of suspense and creating an unnerving atmosphere. Everything in this movie from the alien and Alien ship design by HR Geiger, the beautiful sets and cinematography and the incredible sound track by Jerry Goldsmith creates an atmosphere like no other film. The audio is also very well balanced. The film knows when to use music and when to be silent, it just uses them at the perfect times and it all helps to make one of the most suspenseful movies i've ever seen.This movie is one of the most perfect and beautiful films ever made, is my 3rd favourite movie of all time and in my opinion the pinnacle of Sci Fi and Horror. 10/10."
truemythmedia,"Jun 24, 2019",10/10,"The settings in this film are exhilarating and claustrophobic, the characters are funny and likeable and we want them to survive, the creature is horrifying and vile, and the storyline is tense and exciting. This might be the most popular alien franchise ever made (there are more sequels for this than there are for ""Predator""), and that's a well-deserved title. Personally, this is in my top ten science fiction films (and maybe in my top ten horror films as well); it's a movie I'll return to multiple times over the course of my life, and its one I doubt I'll ever grow tired.

Joshumms,"Dec 22, 2021",10/10,"This movie still holds up, honestly frightening and all the sets and practical effects are cool to see. It is insane how the alien in this movie looks better than the one in covenant almost 40 years later."
chaos-rampant,"Sep 14, 2012",N/A,"This one really needs no introduction, this pitch black vision of an unfathomable darkness. If I was asked to run a film class, this would be a prime example to study: collaboration, reinvention, conceptual design that accommodates damage to it, the journey of shared vision from page to space. It does everything right that could easily have gone wrong. The backbone is an extremely coherent space world and mythology, as complicated as we find in Star Wars but with only necessary snippets provided instead of platitudes. On top of that, you have (expertly executed) the age old story of an encounter with ancient evil. But this one has biology, structure that horrifies more. The icing on the cake is a final layer about the nature of the encounter, your encounter with 'alien' vision. Hold this thought.It is amazing to revisit this in retrospect of how much it changed and how much has changed since.In the 1970's, one of the hottest and most troubled film properties for a while was Dune. The scope and detail of Herbert's books called for a a film on a massive scale, a blockbuster, and that was a time when the blockbuster was still a fluid concept. It was a time when you could dream the unthinkable: a 10-hour Jodorowsky extravaganza with the creative involvement of Dali, Welles, Gloria Swanson, Delon, Jagger, designed by H.R. Giger and scored by Pink Floyd. Extensive pre-production work was axed when money decided the venture was impractical, and basically nuts. The world safely went with the Spielberg-Lucas model, nurtured from Jaws to Star Wars. The prevalent business model for a Hollywood blockbuster these days, is a bankable producer-director in charge (he can be a little creative), and contract out the design and effects-work to individual SFX studios. We're getting poorer every year and the products more bland, because of this IKEA mentality.Anyway, the smoke from the colossal Dune collapse turbulently shifted in two directions. We got the two Phillip K. Dick adaptations in the 80's, one of them Scott's Bladerunner. The other is right here. Inbetween, Scott had been next in line after Jodorowsky to tackle and swiftly abandon Dune.What happened, is that a guy called Dan O'Bannon (effects-man in that first Dune) drifted to screen writing to pull himself up from a financial hole. Out of many stories he penned, one was about an alien passenger wreaking havoc mid-space. In its first incarnation, it was going to be a Corman foamcore cheapie called Starbeast. Hollywood tapped the project, considering workingman Aldrich to direct. Daft choice, thankfully axed. This one needed new, excited blood like O'Bannon.Ridley Scott came onboard, fresh and eager from a Kubrick-influenced debut. Kubrick's 2001-notions of cinematic space as a clean and silent roar, elegant design, and controlled visual eddies from symphonic flows of the camera, all of that was carried over into this, and is openly acknowledged in the first shot. O'Bannon(a horror guy) introduced Scott to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and more pieces from the Dune jigsaw: Foss and Moebius were carried over to sketch the world of the film. H.R. Giger was flown in from Switzerland, with alien-designs so disturbing he was held over at LAX.And that is how it came together. The story was recycled from spare parts (Forbidden Planet, Planet of the Vampires), dressed in 'used' scrapyard aesthetic and Giger's diseased-looking biology, and finally given Texas Chainsaw- violence in the engine gears and fabric. And the nature of that collaborative encounter with the product of vision is sketched in the actual film, in the way it made a difference.You have a colorful bunch of professionals in the same 'ship', each one a specialist in his field. Each one has his own logic about what the voyage is all about, but not necessarily equal say. They are earthbound before a beacon signals from the void.It isn't until later that we find out a narrative of discovery had been set in motion around them, and that narrative is controlled by non-human agents, actual devices (Mother - Ash), which is why it's both simple and precise. The actual author won't be seen until Prometheus, one of many things mucked-up there.The discovery is of something that we go on to understand has structure and design, and the instinct to do as designed challenges human conscience. And this is why Scott's presentation matters: it is not a guy in a suit we see, it is abstract shape, pure organism morphing before our eyes.The second expansion is that it is not the story of explanations that matters, but the journey to retrieve new vision. This has been obscured, because that vision is a monster, and because on both ends of that story (Weyland - Engineerworld), you have only vague bits of clearly engineered worlds that we want to know more about (hence, the heavy Alien fanfiction that distracts by too much clarification).It's all here though. The story was something to get you to where the void signals.The real deal is in how we come to terms with something that is new and seemingly dragged strange and whole from the void.And it takes a dissonant - human - element to muck up the precise Weyland gears of the narrative, and actually give birth to the thing. A machine would never be curious enough to touch the egg.This is brilliant. It's all in the coordinated bursts of machine-reason to human-chaos to inscrutable creature-reason and back again, and the way that is choreographed into an environment that bleeds and bursts into our vision (best seen in the discovery of the alien ship).Our vision itself is the alien being born, space impregnated and convulsing with the process."
lotus_chief,"Jul 27, 2004",6/10,"I bought this DVD, thinking it's a certified classic and that I'm bound to enjoy it immensely...seeing that I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies. After watching it, I thought I missed something. Was this really it?After realizing my less-than-enthusiastic thoughts on what I had just seen, I immediately rationalized that I did just watch the movie 25 years later, and that there's probably no way I can get the effect that audiences had when it first released. So much has happened in movies nowadays, that I've basically seen it all. I appreciate what Ridley Scott tried to do here, by letting us wait, and wait, and wait, and wait some more. It's Hitchcockian, and I'm a big fan of his. 'Alien' is more suspense than anything, it seemed that after the suspense is gone, and everything that was supposed to happen happened, and the alien was finally revealed in all its glory, there isn't much left to hold on to. For some reason, 'Alien' comes off as incomplete and, surprisingly, unintentionally funny at some points. I just couldn't get past the fact that the events in the film could've been avoided if it wasn't for the utter stupidity of the crew members. 'Alien' wasn't scary by any means. The alien itself is marvelous; I was always intrigued by the creature, just the look of it! Only a crazy mind could've come up with something looking like that.I've read some reviews here on IMDb stating that the sequel 'Aliens' is superior to the original, I'll have to see that to decide for myself. Also, I only watched the Theatrical version on my DVD, maybe I'll be able to appreciate the Director's Cut more?although I read in the DVD pamphlet that the Theatrical version is Ridley Scott's favorite. Therefore, I'm giving 'Alien' a pass of sorts, seeing that it's a landmark in a genre that's been squeezed dry for so long now. Maybe with future viewings I can come to enjoy it even more, but my initial reaction is that 'Alien' wasn't what I expected. I can still appreciate it for the pioneer that it is, but it seems a bit overrated.** ½ out of **** stars"
joepooppop,"May 8, 2021",9/10,"So I just watched it and omg this film is amazing. The acting is amazing each and every one of them but the best is probably Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). This is just a timeless sci-fi film and one of the best and this movie is all a lot creepier and scarier than I thought. And finally the xenomorph they amazing. This isn't the scariest film but maybe one of the best sci-fi films up there with Terminator 2, the matrix, and 2001 a space odyssey. So this is a good you should watch it."
sinscopefilms,"Aug 30, 2024",6/10,"Alien is undeniably a landmark film in sci-fi, though my experience with it was mixed. This film is heavily influenced by 2001. A Space Odyssey, i.e., (1) the production design that actually stands out, with its strong aesthetic and attention to detail; (2) the soundtrack, with its violin orchestration, adds to the tension but carries a darker, more mysterious vibe; (3) the VFX - it is impressive for its time. While I appreciate the homage, I found myself enjoying Space Odyssey more.The slow pacing didn't fully capture my attention, leaving me disengaged and less intrigued. The writing left me with mixed feelings, leaving me confused as to who is the protagonist of the film, yet it has a meaning in themes such as teamwork and survival.Overall, it's clear that Alien was groundbreaking for its time, but for me, it didn't quite live up to the hype, especially after watching Alien Romulus, which you would think is incomparable. While I recognize Alien as a classic and understand its significance in the sci-fi genre, it didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped. It's a good introduction to the Alien franchise, but from today's perspective, it feels overrated and somewhat outdated. Despite this, it remains a product of its time, and for that, it deserves recognition. However, my personal enjoyment was limited."
Saint Just,"May 29, 1999",1/10,"What do people see in this film? I am not one for horror films, though I do like this alien stuff. Nothing happens in the film. Nothing. We spent most of the time waiting and waiting for something to happen. This movie could have been cut to half an hour, easy. There is a saying that says that fear is being scared of the unknown, something that the X-Files has done really well.Unfortunately, this film has tried to do this too and has gone too far. Rather than waiting for something to happen, while on the edge of our seats, we wait and wait and wait and wait. We barely get to see the alien and the special effects are pretty poor. Sure it was a long time ago so we can't expect too much, but look at Star Wars which came out around the same time. They were much better than alien and Lucas had half the money.Alien is simply a boring movie that deserves no credit."
F.Gama,"May 2, 2017",10/10,"I remember the first time i saw Alien... i was 9, and my father recorded it on VHS from a TV Channel here in Brasil. I took some time to watch it, because i was a little afraid to see it, but when i finished watching it, the cinema thing became one of my favorite hobbies. The atmosphere is perfect: 7 truckers (performed by 7 excellent artists) trapped in a Gothic spaceship with an serial killer machine that you don't see completely until the end of the film. Back then i saw it for like 48290482904 times and until today it makes me emotional for the superb work of Mr. Scott. It is a must see... forever!"
AkselI-72,"Jul 15, 2025",9/10,"Where to begin? ""Alien"" (Directed in the year 1979 by Ridley Scott) was a movie I had heald off watching until about a week ago. Everything was great in this movie, but there are two key things that stand out to me. The first thing are the looks of this film. Whether it's the giant oddly shaped alien building, the halls and detail that went into the hand-made set, or the grotesque look of the Xenomorph, this movie is one looker for sure. The second thing that stands out to me is the ominous, mystery behind the aliens. What was the giant building's purpose? What was the giant skeleton doing there? Mystery shrouds this classic. ""Alien"" gets a cool 9/10 from me."
tinkerx-92472,"Sep 5, 2024",9/10,"Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) is not just a sci-fi film-it's a masterclass in tension, atmosphere, and horror. From the very beginning, it lures you into a hauntingly desolate world. The film's pacing is deliberate & slow, unraveling a growing sense of suspense or dread as the crew confronts the creature.Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ripley is iconic-she emerges as a symbol of strength, intelligence, and survival in a time when strong female protagonists were rare. The entire cast, including John Hurt and Ian Holm, contributes to the claustrophobic, paranoid dynamic that defines the movie.The production design by H. R. Giger is a work of art. The alien itself is a terrifying creation-its sleek, bio-mechanical form brings the perfect mix of beauty and nightmare fuel. The minimalistic score and use of sound are brilliantly unsettling, turning silence into a weapon that heightens suspense.Despite being over 40 years old, Alien has aged remarkably well. It's a testament to practical effects, storytelling, and the enduring power of fear. Unlike many modern sci-fi films that rely heavily on spectacle, Alien excels at the slow burn. It keeps you on edge, never showing too much, but making you feel the creeping terror just around the corner.Alien isn't just a movie-it's an experience. A blend of horror, sci-fi, and thriller, it remains one of the greatest films in cinematic history. A must-watch for any fan of the genre."
AkselI-5,"Aug 22, 2025",9/10,"Ridley Scott's Alien is a masterclass in atmospheric horror and suspense, blending science fiction with the terror of isolation and the unknown. Released in 1979, it redefined space-set storytelling and established a new standard for creature features.The film follows the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo as they respond to a distress signal from a desolate planet. What begins as a routine investigation quickly spirals into a desperate struggle for survival when a hostile alien lifeform infiltrates their ship.At the center of the story is Ellen Ripley, played with quiet intensity and resilience by Sigourney Weaver in a breakout performance that would go on to define one of cinema's most iconic heroines. Weaver's Ripley is not just a survivor-she's smart, skeptical, and ultimately the moral and emotional backbone of the film.Visually, Alien is stunning. H. R. Giger's biomechanical design of the alien creature is nightmarishly unique, and Scott uses shadows, claustrophobic corridors, and silence to build almost unbearable tension. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing dread to mount gradually rather than relying on cheap jump scares.Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score, combined with minimalist sound design, amplifies the film's eerie, isolated tone. And Dan O'Bannon's script smartly keeps exposition minimal, letting the terror unfold naturally and organically through character interaction and mounting suspense.What makes Alien endure is its simplicity. It's a haunted house story in space-tight, primal, and deeply unsettling. Unlike many of its sci-fi peers, it resists over-explaining the monster, instead focusing on the crew's psychological unraveling and the raw survival instinct."
carpenterscottr,"Aug 17, 2022",10/10,"I saw Alien on first release. I was in high school. Up until then I had never truly seen a film that frightened me so much, not even Jaws (although that had it's share of jumps). No, Alien had me cowering behind the seat in front of me.I watch it now, and within the first 15 minutes I'm thinking ""Why can't anyone make movies like this any more?"" I mean just the simple atmosphere of the Nostromo slowly waking up is so majestic.The more recent Alien movies, like Star Wars, eschew that majesty for quick edits and big set pieces. I don't know what happened. All I can think of is the quote from Aliens: ""Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away?"""
Dethcharm,"Apr 15, 2022",N/A,"Upon its release, it was obvious that Director Ridley Scott's ALIEN was something special, unlike any science fiction-horror film before it.Drawing loosely from past deep space adventures, Scott took us into a desolate, haunted place full of dread and terror. Primarily a ""monster movie"", ALIEN presents us with a creature from our darkest nightmares. H. R. Geiger's design is still fresh and startling to this day. It's sleek, reptilian body, topped by that elongated, eyeless head, is an incredibly effective creation.The human crew of the Nostromo are mostly nourishment for this hellish thing.The classic scenes abound, from the discovery of the egg chamber, to the ""bloody birth"", to the discovery that one crewmember just may be hiding a secret, etc.That's where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) comes in. She's resourceful, smart, and called on to be far stronger than she might, at first, appear. Ms. Weaver made this role singular. We will always remember the final confrontation. Ripley shattered stereotypes, setting the standard for a generation of tough female heroes.Imagine sitting in a dark theater, having never seen anything remotely like this before. Having no frame of reference for what was playing out on the screen. It was all fresh, new, and astonishing.Still is..."
thechrisfigaro,"Dec 26, 2024",6/10,"While Alien is often hailed as a classic, it's hard to overlook the baffling behaviour of its characters. Despite witnessing the clear danger of the alien, the crew shows little urgency or precaution. Their choices range from negligent to outright absurd-like a character wandering off to find a cat, predictably meeting their demise. Ripley seems to be the only one with a shred of common sense, which makes the others feel like caricatures rather than competent professionals.The atmosphere and design are praiseworthy, but the lack of logical decision-making from the crew undercuts the tension and makes it hard to stay invested.Overrated."
serafinogm,"Jan 20, 2018",10/10,"I was a graduate student when I went and saw this film. I was working on a Masters in Computer Science at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and I went with a friend, a doctoral candidate (I was his grader). I had no idea upon walking into that theater I was going to be pinned to my seat so overwrought that I was going to get a splitting headache (only one other movie has caused me a headache and that was 'The Passion of the Christ'). I know the movie seems tame now but at the time for a student who rarely got a decent nights sleep and who was emotionally drained from the constant stress the Masters program put me through (sure I can write a compiler in a week, no problem!) it was just too much for the senses and nerves. This science fiction masterpiece was also the ultimate horror picture. The kids of today probably would think nothing of it but it blew me away! Where's the ibuprofen as I'm getting a headache just reliving the experience!"
Ralpho,"Apr 27, 2002",6/10,"I wasn't real impressed with this movie because it seemed like any other horror movie, but in a science fiction setting.In fact, I believe that was the secret to the movie's success. Take your typical horror movie plot - a monster is stalking a group of people, killing them one by one - and set it in the future, in space, and you've got Alien. It probably attracted a lot of science fiction fans to horror and horror fans to science fiction.From a more esoteric standpoint, I was disappointed that the settings were so dark. Maybe it worked on the big screen, but it failed in my living room.Credit-wise I'm curious to know why Tom Skeritt had top billing over Sigourney Weaver. The latter's character is obviously our hero and has all the best lines, while the former's character is killed halfway through the movie.It would be like giving Jack Palance top billing in City Slickers, although he contributed much more to that movie than Skeritt contributed to Alien."
bengreenb,"Jul 1, 2007",3/10,"This film was historically significant for its work with special effects and cinematography. It is not fun to watch, though. I found the film slow-paced and unexciting. It might have been a shock to see an ""alien"" on screen in 1979, but watching such a movie today is the film equivalent of playing the first Mario games-- it's dated. We see special effects every day now, not only in movies but in advertisements on TV. This movie relies on its special effects, which are admittedly well done, but are not enough to justify rating a movie highly in 2007.The Alien didn't scare me. More than anything, it grossed me out... but it never induced horror or fright.I'd suggest this film to the film professors, but not to my friends."

If you don't have basic intelligence or insight don't watch American cinema. Simple as that... Of course you wouldn't like this movie. Calling it slow just shows you grew up on Michael Bay or sikh bollywood crap you're conditioned and made to think is good. Sad really.The most idiotic comment is from the muppet who said I carry around more technology in my pocket every day than they used to make this... These are the soulles saps who have decimated the industry.. They think a hollow digital set looks more realistic and convincing, no love fora slow burn story. I can go on and on lol. I'm 39 btwI know I should review the movie, but all of us with taste don't need to hear anything else.

iazurdiaCR,"Apr 16, 2024",6/10,"The art production is amazing and the camera work, plus the great soundtrack, succeds in building tension and suspense.But, Alien (1) lacks in character development and, mostly, in fluidity and attention to detail in its storytelling. The edition in the first half makes it look like an old vhs that keeps jumping forward leaving behind unseen parts that are important to understand the development of the story (plus the merging of practical effects on scenes looks like a low budget school project; even for a 1979 movie).Eitherway, you have to see it to introduce yourself to a great villain like Alien, but it is enough watching it once. The sequels are another (and better) story.PD. The best actor was the cat. What an amazing expression when the grown alien appears for the first time."

destroyerwod,"Aug 13, 2024",7/10,"As crazy as it may seem, i never saw the original Alien or even its sequel, altough i did came across Alien 3, Alien Resurection (wich was the new movie when i was a teen and on age to watch this and my first in the franchise), and a few spin-offs later like Alien Vs Predator 1 & 2. So only Aliens left for another day.I decided for this review i would review it 50/50 on both its ""classic"" aspect as well as how it hold up in 2024. The first thing that comes to mind is the creature are no secret anymore. We seen them countless times and we know what they are, so the mystery aspect and how it can impact the movie is something harder to judge. I do think its many forms and ""evolution"" is well done.My biggest issue tough, and its no secret if you read any of my other reviews, is the pacing. The movie is very slow. The first hour is basically a set up and a lot of it could had been cut out without impacting the movie, even the suspense and atmosphere. That said, if we go in the 1979 shoes and what they could do with special effect and how these could be considering very advance for the time, i guess for a first viewing it was something phenomenal.I have to take into consideration that Star Wars was released 2 years early tough, and spaceships and stuff like that was already done, so the miniatures and cool effects were not the first. That said, Alien do bring a more ""realistic"" aproach on the concept, obviously with a 1979 vision (old computers, screens etc).Ultimately i do have to admit the movie did bored me at times a bit during the first hour, maybe because i already knew what was this creature, so its really hard to judge it for that specific part.But i do think tough that in the second hour, the horror element and pacing was a lot better. Some peoples could complain the movie is ""too dark"" and you can't see much of the creature and the violence, but i personally knew about this and had no problem with it.Overall i think the movie aged perfectly fine when it comes to special effects, overall story, characters, atmosphere, but do can feel a tad long during its first hour.I am happy i can finally say that i saw it, and i do feel if a teenager would start by this one instead of the more modern ones, once he pass the look of the computers and tech wich is obviously ultra retro, he could have a very good movie with genuine scares and suspense and kinda forget its that old.Im gonna go for a 7 out of 10 for a 2024 viewing with MY personal experience. It was enjoyable, but there was not much surprise for me sadly. But i did felt on the edge of my seat a few times during the more suspenseful scenes, so the movie wins at what it aimed to achieve."
criticj,"Jul 30, 2022",10/10,Alien's iconic moments of terrifying creatures that take on human life in the most gruesome way ever make this flick an ideal viewing!!! Loads of gun action and escape from danger await you on the thrill of your life!
mariselacoornejo,"Nov 27, 2021",9/10,"Sigorney weaver did an amazing job, so amazing that i was screaming for her to drop the cat and run at my computer. The visuals are so amazing for a science fiction movie from the 70s, and the storytelling is incredible. Ridley scott makes it more than easy to root for the heroine, even though naming the main character after yourself is a little narcissistic. All in all an amazing movie though."
buckeyefanohiostate,"Mar 27, 2021",10/10,This movie scared me so bad when i 1st saw it the design of the Alien is so great and the way you 1st see it surprises ya and from then on things start to get crazy! The way this movie is shot is so great you feel the fear of rounding every corner and the way the alien blends in has you thinking its any and everywere lol this is a must watch for a any horror fan.
weirdcreep,"Mar 19, 2021",10/10,"I wish they could still make movies like alien.
The best work Ridley scott made.
It's brilliant, a work of art, timeless......"
djjimmisgr,"Dec 23, 2021",9/10,"No matter how many years have passed since this movie came out or how many times I may have watched Alien, it will always give me goosebumps. Amazing horror atmosphere. One of the best sci-fi movies of all time!"
heisenberg12,"Feb 6, 2016",9/10,"There are relatively few films in history that are so solid and well made that they are the definition of a 4/4 star movie. Alien is one of those films. Movies have become so flawed in recent decades that truly handing out the full rating of 4 stars out of 4 (or 10 out of 10 for IMDb) has become a stretch.Without a doubt, Alien is not only a classic and the best science fiction horror movie of all time, but it is also one of the best films of all time. It is one of the coolest, most bad-ass, and horrifying films you will ever see.Sigourney Weaver is phenomenal in the role that shot her to fame. She is the heart of the film and plays her part with a sort of innocence and naive youthfulness that is endearing and real. Who would have ever thought a woman could be so bad-ass in a science fiction/action/horror movie in 1979?This movie is so good shot for shot that you will be glued to the screen. You can't miss a minute, nor will you want to. Even after all the similar sorts of horror and sci fi films that have been made which have borrowed from Alien, none of them can put together what Alien did.Some movies just rock. They just know how to open,know how to show, know how to tell, know how to explode, and know how to end. This is one of them. The ending is perfect and a perfect example of how to tell a story and end a movie, something many films of today can learn from."
danfigh,"Nov 9, 2025",6/10,"But, this does not hold up in 2025. For me it's not horror (although for its time can understand while it fits that genre), certainly not very sci-fi and for a thriller, it's reasonably predictable. Every decision the crew make is absurdly naive; are we supposed to believe these people have some expertise and can travel through space and be so stupid? This is the hallmark of low grade horror but expected more for a ""classic"" film. I felt a lot of the dialogue is inaudible; is that a ploy by Scott to draw the attention of viewer in? It was more irritating than anything else. Visually, it's giving me 2001 vibes and the cinematography uses those up close angles to create feelings of claustrophobia as they run which adds to the chase down fear vibe. But I found this overall fairly average. It's my Dad's favourite film and I wanted to like it but it's no more than a 6 from me."
masonsaul,"Sep 23, 2024",10/10,"Alien is the quintessential sci-fi horror that's rife with mystery and all the better for not answering some of the major questions as to how this stuff works whilst still delivering a lot of exposition that only makes the titular creature all the more terrifying. It's suitably scary, allegorical and assembled with tremendous technical craft from the slow reveal of its title set in the silent vacuum of space where no one can hear you scream.Even though it's obvious now, it's still really satisfying to see Sigourney Weaver becoming the protagonist over the course of the film. Early on other characters are positioned in front of her, she's given minimal dialogue and comes across as a little cold since she prioritises company policy. However, once she's front and centre she is amazing with a palpable sense of fear balanced by her ability to remain calm as much as possible.The rest of the cast are terrific as well since they're thoroughly convincing as a team who get along well and have their own little groups. All of that makes Ian Holm stand out even more. He feels off even when he's trying to be jovial and is just so unsettling when he's at his coldest which makes the big twist around his character more coherent with subsequent viewings since his performance hides it in plain sight.Ridley Scott's direction is so effective because of how patient it is in that first half. It takes 5 minutes to meet the characters and nearly half of the film for the Xenomorph to actually appear but it's never boring thanks to gorgeous set design which makes every aspect of this grungy, lived-in world so fascinating to experience. The scares are all timers too that hone in on misdirection to always catch you off guard.The design of the Xenomorph is phenomenal, especially since there's nothing that comes close to its extremely distinct look. With H. R. Giger involved, it's undoubtedly very phallic in nature which enhances how intense the Xenomorph is in every way. Jerry Goldsmith's score is beautifully barren, only requiring a handful of notes to make everything feel incredibly eerie from those opening moments in space."
margetic_1,"Dec 2, 2005",7/10,"This would have to be one of the worst sci-fi movies i have ever seen.It took to long to get to the plot, the plot was bad (not mentioning was it is).It wasn't scary, it wasn't exciting, it was boring.The best part of the films is when the credits start, it was still pretty boring then.If you want to watch a good sci-fi movie watch Aliens(number 2) or the fourth alien movie.It is definitely the most boring and worst alien, sorry sci-fi movie out there.Stick to watching star trek or star wars, something good, not some rubbish, cheap film from the 70s.But it was good that some introduced an alien into a movie, but they picked the wrong movie.DO NOT WATCH. BORING.0.5/10"
Saint Just,"Aug 14, 1999",1/10,"This movie is very slow, very dull and very boring. After waiting half an hour for the movie to start after many long and dull shots at the area, the movie begins to move. After lots and lots of boring visuals, the story begins to move, though never takes off. Personally I hated the movie and has been given a vote of one by me in the user vote.I don't recommend you see it, but it's vote of 8.2 by other viewers might suggest otherwise. My personal opinion is that it was made in 1977 so people have just voted for it as a classic.It deserves nothing as a classic.No stars"
benxrichardson,"Jan 25, 2022",9/10,"Watching Alien in 2022, it's hard to believe the film was made in the 70's. This is a masterclass in film making. Ridley Scott did an amazing job with Alien.Sigourney Weaver is outstanding, she set a new standard for female scifi/action stars.Alien is a must watch for anyone who loves film and enjoys an edge of your seat thrill ride."
RileyH-741,"Aug 22, 2025",10/10,"Ridley Scott crafted a Sci-Fi horror classic with 1979's ""Alien,"" and despite it being close to 45 years since its release it still holds up. From a screenplay written by Scott and Dan O'Bannon, it takes up to space where the crew aboard the ship Nostromo get a distress call from an alien vessel and go to investigate. When they come across a nest of alien eggs, one of the organisms inside it latch onto the face on a crew member and it leads to an atmospheric, tense, and scary thrill ride as everyone aboard fights for survival. I really was expecting this film to not be as good this time around, but this remains one of the best Sci-Fi horror films ever made and one of Scott's best if not his best work.This cast of characters is amongst some of the best in film, as the camaraderie between them makes them feel like a family more than just crew members on a mission. Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright, and Yaphet Kotto are all great in their respective roles creating these memorable individuals with personality who find themselves in extreme peril. Weaver ends up being the main character by the time the final act rolls around, as Ripley becomes the heroine and remaining survivor amongst the crew with her resilience and quick thinking skills. Skerritt as Dallas remains my favorite of the group, but Ian Holm as Ash might be even scarier than the actual xenomorph as you're never sure of his angle up until it's revealed why he was brought on the mission to answer the call.H. R. Giger's production design saw this film get nominated for an Oscar and it should've won, as the creation of this alien planet they're inhabiting is absolutely slimy, dark, and obscure. The ship itself stands out with a bright white color amidst the shadowy atmosphere of the scenery, confirming how out of place this crew is in terms of dealing with this xenomorph and makes for a claustrophobic environment for the horror to really be impactful. Derek Vanlint's cinematography works so well to create a distant tone as space looks phenomenal in this film, but in addition is how the visual effects come together with the practical effects to make a genuinely frightening set of alien monsters who will indeed end your life.""Alien"" is a masterclass at creating discomfort in the viewer, as from the opening shot we enter a realm of tension and uncertainty where Scott doesn't want us to ever get comfortable. Even when we're watching this crew have a nice family dinner, it's abruptly interrupted with the iconic chest bursting scene that saw the director not tell the cast what was about to happen which made their reactions authentic. One of my favorite jump scares of all-time comes from this film when Dallas encounters the xenomorph as he looks through the ship with a torch, as it gets me every time despite me knowing it's about to happen. I had to make this film a part of my 31 for 31 horror review series."
AnActorExplains,"Jan 27, 2024",10/10,"""Alien"" is one of the few shining pinnacles of not only perfect but industry defining cinema. Regarded as one of the top three greatest horror movies of all time, it's a definite contender for first place. ""Alien"" is exceptional for many reasons, but some notable aspects include an incredible visual landscape that truly gives a sense of atmosphere to the plot; a patient and careful pace thru which attention to detail and a true love of the characters evolves, and, most importantly, a flawless script in which every word is carefully chosen. Plot and subplots are developed and each member of the cast is fleshed out. ""Alien"" sets many standards; not only in moviemaking as a whole, but also in the Horror genre. This film surprises, deceives, concerns and overwhelms.It's hard to find issue with any aspect of ""Alien"" but one shortcoming is the lack of a proper soundtrack. The monster effects are somewhat dated, but can still stand their ground. When a director truly loves his craft, and his producers are smart enough not to interfere, he will attend to every single aspect of a production. When I say that ""Alien"" is a perfect movie, I truly mean it: perfection in cinema is defined by an experience of effortless acting, correct dialogue, flawless cinematography and next to no errors in plot and film. Many examples of this perfection exist, and its sad to see the industry half-bake most of its creations. As an example, the sequel to this movie is an immediate and very apparent drop in quality, but is still miles ahead of anything being filmed today. ""Alien"" is a movie worthy of purchase and repeated viewing, and an example of the wonderful art mankind can achieve."
Kysugo,"Feb 10, 2024",10/10,"Alien is one of those movies that was ahead of it's time. It's eerie, ominous, atmospheric and chilling. Best of all, it's a movie that takes its time. It doesn't feel the need to have to rush into things - it creeps up on you creating a lasting tension, anxiety and fear. The sound design, sound effects and music play a vital part in the tone and feel of the movie - almost like a character in and of itself. There's these drone-like synth noises throughout the movie that create an uneasy feeling. The ship feels like it's lived-in and even seems like it's abandoned, almost haunted. The attention to detail in this movie is astounding and super intricate. There's so much that's told just in visuals alone. Ironic how Kane (John Hurt) is the first one to fully wake up. I never realized it before, but there's some good foreshadowing in this movie. The practical effects were brilliantly and cleverly done. You can tell with certain aspects that it's movie that was made in the late 70's early 80's, but I think this is what gives it its charm.It seems like the crew has known each other for quite some time and have been on other missions before. Clever storytelling and great character development. The characters have this rawness and grit to them. The acting is phenomenal. Everyone brings their A-game. Ian Holm gives a menacing and deceiving performance as Ash. Very impressive and unique concepts and designs from H. R. Giger and the team. The face hugger and Xenomorph are such terrifying and brilliant concepts. Timeless ideas that still to this day are sought after.An iconic, legendary and unforgettable movie that revolutionized the Sci-Fi Horror genre. It's also a movie that warns us about the dangers of technology and AI. There's so much to unpack from this movie and this is great since it warrants multiple viewings. The way Ridley Scott chose to shoot the movie makes for a personal, claustrophobic, deceiving and intense experience. I can also see where the creators of Dead Space might've gotten inspiration for the atmosphere, lighting and interiors of the ships in the game. Overall, it's one of the best Sci-Fi movies in the history of cinema, a masterpiece. If you haven't watched it, I don't know what the hell you've been doing. But you should definitely watch it. This is one of the essentials, a must-watch."
and_mikkelsen,"Apr 8, 2023",9/10,"Even after all these years, this movie holds up insanely well! Some movies becomes milestones in cinema.. and this is one of them!Everything about this movie works, to the point where I have no criticsm other than it can feel a little bit slow at first as it establishes the premise! Though once this movie gets going... its an intense thrillride until the credits roll! This movie oike to lure you into a false sense of safety, creating some of the most iconic scenes in cinema!The effects and set pieces still looks very real today, to the point where even the actors got scared back then! I can only imagine sitting in the theaters, watching this movie for the very first time, without knowing anything about it... truely a legendary experience!"
mauriceyoung-49925,"Jan 30, 2023",10/10,"This film held me in awe from start to finish. Although thirty five years of age when I first saw it I was almost hiding behind my seat from the beginning.... I knew something was going to happen, something awful, but was nowhere near just how awful the awfulness was going to be. And then it happened....the awfulness began...and it didn't let up until all the awfulness was put back into its place and love and tenderness returned. But it was a close thing. And I was left wondering how certain people have the vivid imagination to bring about such an incredible environment for the cinematic public to ponder."
GluStick,"Jul 17, 1999",7/10,"This was a good movie. The only thing wrong with it is nothing happens. It takes too long to get where it's trying to go but when it gets there, it's a fun ride. It's a well made movie. The f/x a good for it's time. The make-up f/x were really cool looking. The actors did their parts very well. The script was very good too. The only problem is the plot. It needed a lot more action. I really liked the movies that followed. Aliens IS the best sci/fi around. Alien3 was a good movie that no one really liked. Alien: Resurrection was a really good movie. I loved that one. The whole series is great but this isn't the best. I think the reason it's so highly rated is because it really stands above the normal slimey-alien-from-outer-space movies. For that, I give it credit. For the plot, well, that's another story. Alien B-"
nathanielqwilson,"Aug 25, 2018",3/10,"I try to remember when I'm watching this that I am very much a product of my generation, by which I mean that I have a very short attention span and I'm not good with slow pacing. When it comes to horror I like a slow burner but there must be lots of little, uncanny things happening.Like watching a Tarkovsky movie, this one has a lot of meditative pauses and a lot of purely logistical content that often doesn't seem to make too much sense. It is one of many films that is very famous for being original where many other films have taken the premise and tone and improved upon it. I remember watching a parody on ""American Dad"" and thinking if only Ridley Scott had actually made this film so compelling.A couple of amazing, instantly iconic moments notwithstanding (and with a wonderful sense of design with its lonely, junkyardish ship and a super Alien), I would not say this has stood the test of time and is really more for viewing for historical interest.Overall my favourite part was Sigourney Weaver's anal cleavage."
Christopher_Reid,"Jan 21, 2018",9/10,"Alien is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time and it also happens to be a horror, making it all the more tense and exciting to watch. Its strength is its patience combined with top-notch visuals and music and an original plot.The look of the movie is incredible from start to finish. The Nostromo spaceship, the interiors, the Alien itself. Much of it was designed by H.R. Giger, a German with a unique and fascinating style. He also worked on Jodorowsky's Dune (which never got made) and you can see similarities in the design. They seem to combine the organic with the artificial and often border on the sexual. The inside of an alien spaceship is full of imaginative and strange details like nothing you've seen before. It's a shame Prometheus was such a terrible attempt at expanding on the story behind it...The score by the prolific Jerry Goldsmith is one of his best. There are faint echoes of more innocent sounding woodwinds with swelling, ominous strings in the background. It's mysterious but captures mankind's natural sense of wonder - it's not completely evil. As one character says at one point, they practically admire the alien, despite its capacity for destruction. We can't help but feel similarly. There's a juxtaposition of beauty and death. In Interstellar as well, the characters go on journeys at the edge of what's possible, seeing incredible things but also facing the serious risk of death. Our universe (and the beings in it) can be a harsh but beautiful mistress.Like all the great horror movies, the monster or threat is only gradually revealed. We're in the dark along with the characters. The details surrounding the alien, how it reproduces, what defence mechanisms it has, what on Earth it even is are very cool. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is a strong female character who is forced into a survival situation. She's one of the few to use common sense throughout the whole movie. She's cautious where others aren't. She know why certain rules are in place and gets frustrated that others would prefer to take risks. As it turns out, she was right the whole time.There are slow shots moving down corridors, letting us take in the designs of the walls, sometimes with emergency rotating lights and gas clouding things a bit. The movie takes its time setting things up and creating a mood. When things do happen, they have more impact because of the calm moments in between. But I enjoy the quiet moments just as much. There's always plenty to take in and ponder.There are many twists and turns in the plot. This keeps things tense - we don't know what might come out of nowhere, who can be trusted, where are you safe. There are some frustrating horror cliché moments where it seems like problems could have been prevented if the people were less stupid at key moments. But we also get to experience some imaginative situations which aren't yet possible with current technology but might well become realities in the near future.I have to admit, I don't find the alien itself scary. But I like its presence and the overall mood of the movie - it's a very well made horror. It's more about suspense than jump scares. It builds up the anticipation and a sense of inescapability. The tone is a bit depressing in some ways. These humans are in the middle of nowhere. But we do get the impression they're heading back to Earth and usually spend their journeys in some kind of cryo-sleep. This movie's an exception to their routine. But a film like Jaws is much easier to relate to while still putting the humans in a setting (the sea) where they're out of their comfort zone.Aliens is a great sequel but the rest are more average. Alien goes down as the best of its genre, a horror sci-fi that takes its time, confident in its story and visuals and creates one of the most memorable movie monsters of all time with characters we care about."
Asentiff2004,"Dec 25, 2013",8/10,"Deep in space, the commercial vessel the Nostromo receives an emergency distress signal from an unexplored planet. After having arrived and conducted a search for survivors the crew returns home only to discover in the most terrifying of ways that a deadly and seemingly invincible bio-form has joined them, and is slowly hunting them one by one.Terrifyingly claustrophobic is a brilliant way to describe this movie. The tension escalates as the movie plays its course. The pacing is brilliant from master filmmaker Ridley Scott. Sigourney Weaver in her most iconic role does a brilliant job portraying Ripley. The feeling of being closed off, the feeling of the Nostromo being a giant claustrophobic maze in which the viewer desperately wishes to escape make this one of the greatest and most terrifying films of its generation. With shocking surprises and twists throughout including the iconic dinner scene that still to this day can be shocking for a first time viewer. The score of the fim only adds to the tension and seemingly silent but deadly tension that continues to mount as the film plays on, only at its conclusion does the viewer finally feel as though they may take a deep breath. Spawning 3 sequels, 2 cross over films, and a loosely tied prequel, Alien has proved to not only resonate these many years later but maintain its popularity within the mytho's of classic American cinema."
kaaffilm,"Mar 27, 2023",10/10,"""Alien"" (1979) is a masterpiece of science fiction horror that has influenced countless films in the genre. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film tells the story of a crew of astronauts on a mining vessel who encounter a deadly extraterrestrial life form on a remote planet. The tension is palpable from the opening shot, and the film's visual design is striking and otherworldly.One of the film's great strengths is the strength of its characters. Sigourney Weaver delivers a powerful performance as Ellen Ripley, the ship's second-in-command who emerges as the film's heroine. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, and Yaphet Kotto.The film's use of suspense and horror is expertly crafted. The Alien itself is one of the most terrifying creatures in cinema history, with its design by H. R. Giger perfectly capturing the sense of dread and horror that permeates the film. The sense of isolation and helplessness that the characters feel as they are stalked by the creature only adds to the tension.""Alien"" is also notable for its visual effects, which have stood the test of time. The use of practical effects gives the film a sense of realism that CGI-heavy films often lack. The iconic design of the Alien and its spacecraft have become iconic in their own right and have been referenced in countless films since.Overall, ""Alien"" is a masterpiece of science fiction horror that stands the test of time. Its powerful performances, expertly crafted suspense and horror, and striking visual design make it a film that deserves its place in the pantheon of cinema classics."
jacknreading,"Mar 19, 2012",10/10,"Just saw that Ridley Scott will soon be bringing out a film (Prometheus)that has roots in his masterpiece ""Alien."" It prompted me to go back to user reviews of this epic film, and in one of them, from 2005, a reviewer identified as Patuguitos simply and rightfully acclaimed ""Alien"" as the perfect film. Bravo--it is true. This film was victimized by bias against its science fiction genre, garnering awards only in the areas of special effects, set direction, etc. Yes, it features a fearsome creature (brilliantly shown in increasingly frightful glimpses):apparently Oscar voters felt this disqualified the film as a serious piece of cinema. Absurd--""Alien"" deserved nominations, if not wins, as Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Editing, Set Design, Special Effects, Score, and perhaps other categories. I have been a discriminating film-goer for almost 60 years. To this day, ""Alien"" stays with me as one of the most thrilling, satisfying experiences in a theater I've ever had. 32 years later, it has lost none of its impact. Yes--the perfect film!"
HorrorFilmHellion,"Aug 1, 2022",10/10,"There have been quite a few fairly modern sci-fi horrors that are great, but this is still my vote in 2022 as the all-time best. So much realism, plausibility, and restraint in all the characters and their motives and actions. The atmospheric dread, shot framing, creature and artwork.. I watch it every year, and still enjoy this masterpiece in 2022. The successor to this one is superb also, but in different ways."
Tornade,"Apr 17, 2016",10/10,"This movie is one of the best sci-fi movie, it's actual in my top ten sci-fi classic.The actors are great.The special effects (for those time) are perfect.The story is very good (one of the best sci-fi story ever).Directing, of course, is awesome (thanks for your chef d'oeuvre, Mr Ridley scott).If you like sci-fi you must see this movie, guarantee you'll love it ! The young generation should take a lesson from this movie and watch it thousand times, just to take notes and try to do something good as it is."
shiftyeyeddog,"Jul 5, 2007",6/10,"Alien is not a bad movie. In fact, it's a pretty good one. More of a thriller than the sci-fi/horror ones that its sequels were. But therein lies my only problem watching the Director's Cut when it was re-released in the theater. I was reminded what a slow, borderline boring movie it is for the vast majority of its running time. Still, it was the only one I hadn't seen on a big screen, so it was cool to see it. I'll still take Cameron's Aliens over this any day. For that matter, I'm one of the few who actually liked Fincher's Alien3. Resurrection, well, I liked a lot about it, but there was plenty not to like as well."
The_Rider2004,"Jul 25, 2023",5/10,"Waittt? Whattt? Dude Said Alien was a bad film. What's he on? Well we'd all be boring if we had the same opinion. But please here me out. This film was largely flat, boring and I was unsatisfied with the movie. This is Overatted. And it's OVERATTED for many reasons. And I'll explain why. I might change your mind, I might not. But atleast put my view into perspective, even the so-Called 'Best films' aren't always that good maybe on rewatch or in general for other people. And I'm sure it was good for it's time so I'm not going to ignore those things but what I will do is explain why this film is not amongst my favourites.Plot,Starting out with the plot. Which was simple and at times effective. But didn't really convert any expectations and didn't really have any twists and turns to keep you entertained. What didn't make sense to me as to why they were searching for a Cat when an Alien is on board. And I wouldn't ask this question if for alot of the film there quitley speaking there lines and more to my previous point they are mostly sitting down and doing very little. The Plot doesn't really have anything noteworthy about it. I felt it was a long boring drab film that doesn't do anything. Even with it's premise. It's impending doom which don't get me wrong is a great idea and the slow burner might of worked. But for me the characters were dull and uninteresting which I'll get too later. But the plot is bear thin so there's not much to talk about.Characters,Good part of the story is character growth. Some form of depth. So that we can root for them in more ways then one. But however I found the characters rather dull as I have previously said and that's down to the fact that they have nothing that's distinctive about them. There all the same, and I get they have the same job and probably the same role idk it never gets mentioned as to why they are there and why they do the job that they do. But they should atleast have some distinctive character trait to set them out from the rest. But they don't, and the acting is rather dull too. They don't have a personality which is a problem in a big budget film like this. And in any case. The characters are hard too root for as they have nothing to do. And you can only go so far with the ending doom slow burner type story and for a lot of you it works, for me it put me to sleep, well almost. Being rather one note characters.Set Designs,Which on the whole is perfect. The Ship has a great module and the set designs on the inside of the interior are great too. Bright and colourful which makes it stand out. And way ahead of it's time. Which is a plus. I can see why this is loved by so many. The chlostrophibia feel on the one hand is done well in this movie. I suppose that the set designs had something to do with that.The Alien,Well even though the film is called this, the Alien isn't involved until the 1hr 30 minute mark. Where the film only has another 25 Minutes as I'm not including the credit sequence otherwise then it would be 30. I get it the film is meant to give you a long lasting feeling of dread. But for me there's no substance to it. If your going to call your movie 'Alien' then the Alien should be the main focus of the film. And not having 5-10 Minutes of Screen time. If the title was labeled something else, then it might of worked but the Alien only being in it's own film for less than 10 minutes in a 2hour film! Feels rather redundant and a clickbait title to get viewers attention which worked. And people say the same thing about other movies so its only fair to talk about this one in the same sense. The work on the Alien is also way ahead of its time so that's a positive.So overall I got some enjoyment out of it like the Special effects, set designs and impending doom. But for the majority of the film nothing happened leaving no real emotion or impact. And if you still like the movie after my review then more power to you. But I just don't feel the same way about it. I get why it's held as a classic to most of you. But for me it's nothing more then a bland forgettable movie in space. So sorry but I'm giving it 3 stars out of 10. But now time for the Verdict.Verdict,3/10 Some scene stealers but overall Bland and pancakes are less flat then the characters."

Andrew_M1911,"Aug 5, 2019",10/10,"What else is there to say about this masterpiece of movie? I mean there is great effects, dope set design, blood, and my favorite protagonist of a horror movie ever."
xiaoli7377,"Dec 15, 2022",10/10,"""Alien"" is the one of the first films that I think of when I think of the word ""atmosphere."" Ridley Scott brilliantly crafts a setting in this sci-fi horror classic that is still explored with prequels and sequels. It's not just the setting though; it's the way that the plot slowly builds up and there are many moments of downtime to get a little familiar with characters. This film, along with other late 70s classics such as ""Halloween"", really set up the blueprint that most modern horror films replicate.This movie is a marvel on a photographic level, with much of the shot composition and lighting and set design really making for a dark and claustrophobic experience. The idea of a huge 7 foot tall monster with acidic blood and a retractable mouth-within-a-mouth that hunts the crew members off one by one is a horrifying thought.Much props has to be given to Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This was a breakout role for her, and it's a role that she further explores and brings even more perfection to in the sequel. Most of the other characters aren't really worth mentioning other than Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) who I found extremely obnoxious and annoying (I can tell that this was probably Ridley Scott's intent with the character though). I also really liked Yaphet Lotto's character, Parker. No nonsense.This is a must watch. Many classic horror movie tropes were spawned from this one. And with decades past it's still extremely elusive to track down, much like its eponymous alien."
SuperMegaTont,"Sep 2, 2025",9/10,"Some argue that Aliens is a better film than Alien, but to me Alien, the 1979 sci fi horror classic is not only superior to Aliens, the action heavy sequel, but miles ahead of every other prequel, sequel and spin off.Indeed, it's a shame that the more the Alien universe is expanded, badly, diminishes the original.Lean, dark, original, scary, brilliantly cast and with iconic HR Giger Alien world designs this is a terrific horror classic that remains not only the best Alien film, but one of the best horror films of all time."
Endless_01,"Apr 14, 2017",9/10,"In 1979, the world was taken by surprise to the best science fiction horror film, the best movie of aliens and one of the best horror movies. Alien is undoubtedly a fascinating masterpiece of science fiction that has absolutely every great aspect to hit us for a century and until eternity, a movie that will be remembered as one of the best of all time, here was born the true King of all the movies of aliens, we will probably never see a movie that has astonished us as much as this, but its legacy continues today and tomorrow.Going to see this movie in its opening day, was to see one of the most terrifying experiences in its time, something so magnificent and at the same time, creepy, a movie that showed us the true meaning of suspense and terror to the unknown.With a slow but entertaining advance, building the characters and the atmosphere, gradually increasing the mystery and beating at the end with the extraterrestrial surprise. Every detail is very carefully designed, with very realistic airs, making us feel as if we were really on board a spaceship, the actors are impeccable and teach the true madness of facing something unknown. The sounds are a masterpiece, with an incredible atmosphere and effects, the size of the alien, the sounds of the ship, doors opening, listening to the protagonist walking, weapons, gears, everything helps to create an atmosphere so dark that it surpasses All expectation, but the final prize, is taken by the Xenomorph, the alien number 1 in the film industry. Absolutely great, any fan of science fiction will find this movie spectacular, even lovers of terror or suspense, a movie that everyone should admire."
sage4676,"Jan 14, 2023",10/10,"I saw this movie in theaters when it was released in 1979 at least four times. I was just turning 18 that year so yes I went on my own accord. Eventually, when VCRs, DVDs, Blu-Rays came out I owned it in each version, and it was worth it. Ridley Scott raised and set the bar very hi for any subsequent Sci-fi movies to come out after it. Any other Sci-fi flick I saw after this one was, 'How did it compare to Alien?"". This Is one of those movies that no matter how many times you see it, viewing it remains worth your while. Sigorney Weaver set the bar for female leads too. After her performance, female leads as badasses became not so uncommon. I loved the movie so much I even looked up how the creature was designed and learned the H. R. Giger was the primary influence on what the creature looks like. Several more Ridley Scott films fell into my favorite list too. This film is so good that I can count on one hand how many I have given a '10' rating to. I personally think that 'Aliens' is just good, but takes a different approach to compete storyline. In Aien, the first time you see the creature emerging, better known as the chest popper, you will be totally surprised, and it's worth it. When you become a fan, I can only suggest that in a bare minimum of items to own, buy the first three of this series and you will be pleased."
Wilander,"Oct 11, 2002",N/A,"I read a review of this, which said it was dull, overrated and basically awful. The reviewer preferred ""Aliens"". This is a classic example of the bland film tastes of many, (mainly American and British), audiences today. This is a movie which redefined terror, that pushed the limits of set design, that wasn't afraid to make you feel physically ill, at times. We all know the plot by now, (rusty spaceship is summoned to help an abandoned planet, picks up an unwanted alien passenger, and the rest of the plot concerns the crews attempts to escape from it), which makes it both accessible and yet unknowable, expected yet still fresh. If you want a dumb, P.C, ""Oh look, we're being post-modern aren't we clever?"" movie, then watch most of what Hollywood's produced in the past decade. If you want something of quality and substance, watch this. And it was made by an English director! YES!!!"

Gafke,"Jan 14, 2006",10/10,"Commercial star ship Nostromo, returning from a routine mission, are detoured when an alien SOS is intercepted. Awakened from hypersleep, the crew are obligated to land on the alien world where the call for help has originated, but the ship is slightly damaged during the landing process and three of the crew set out to explore the hostile new world. They come upon a derelict spacecraft, the skeletonized remains of an alien creature with an odd wound in its chest and a cache of strange egg-like objects. Crew member Kane is brought back from the exploration unconscious and with a bizarre, crab-like creature attached to his face. He is still alive, and indeed, the creature on his face seems to be keeping him alive for reasons unknown. The Nostromo is repaired and the crew leave the desolate planet behind. The crab creature soon leaves its perch on Kane's face and dies, and Kane emerges from his coma, apparently in good health. But the purpose of the alien soon becomes terribly clear; Kane has been impregnated with an alien embryo which births itself from his chest in a shower of blood and gore, killing Kane and escaping into the ships air ducts before anyone can react. The crew set out to destroy the creature, not realizing immediately that its accelerated growth has transformed it into a huge and vicious predator whose only desire is to kill them all.Very loosely based upon the 1958 horror film ""IT! The Terror From Beyond Space"" Alien is a masterpiece of Gothic horror, a haunted house movie on a spaceship. Flawlessly directed by Ridley Scott, Alien, whose plot is actually fairly simplistic and nothing new, is so filled with dread, so claustrophobically genuine, that it seems like nothing ever seen before. Ghostly steam, clinking chains, long dark corridors where anything can be hiding, the suspense is unbelievably suffocating. We never really get to see what the alien actually looks like until films end, and so the quick flashes of tail, head and mouth are so brief and so confusing that it only adds to the horror. Plus, Alien does what no ghost story can do - there is no way out of this ""haunted house."" There is no escape from the horror within.The performances are all outstanding. The alien is not the only menace to the all-too human crew; there are also soulless corporations and short circuiting androids to be dealt with on top of everything else. Faced with these dilemmas, every single crew member of the Nostromo are absolutely believable. They're tired, stressed out, rude and bitchy and they spend a good lot of time griping and snapping at each other, but they drop what they're doing and stand together, protecting one another without hesitation when they must. The gore is minimal; the death of Kane is the bloodiest, nastiest moment in the whole film and because Kane, played by John Hurt, seems to be the nicest of the crew members, it just makes his painful death scene all the more horrible.Alien is a grim, visceral, satisfying horror film and remains the unsurpassed best film in the series. Alien is an established classic and should not be missed."

Overall, an iconic horror film that is a major influence for the sci-fi genre as the movie does a pretty good job playing hind-and-seek with this mysterious Alien, even though it can be slow at times.Direction: Pretty Good
The direction on a macroscale is good as he builds the overarching conflict well and uses tension to bring out the horror in the alien and the fear of dying; the direction on a microscale is pretty good as each performance has a part in how they reach to what is going on; the storytelling is good as it progresses through a pretty simple story, and uses tension to heighten the stakes as the conflict unravelsStory: Pretty Good
The concept is pretty simple yet effective as the movie boils down to a hide-and-seek with the alien, and the movie does a good job at incorporating a twist to heighten the stakes; the plot structure is pretty simple, but the exposition feels very long; the character writing is pretty good as it fills all the archetypes of a ""crew"" movie, but also does a good job at providing some depth for Ripley as she tries to do the right thing and navigate through her fearScreenplay: Pretty Good

movie_fan18,"Oct 25, 2020",3/10,"If you're after a flashy shock 'n' schlock movie, then look no further than Ridley Scott's ALIEN. Directly recycling the formulas of the space-shocker B movies from the '50s, notably THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD and IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE, this 1979 blockbuster attempted to mingle together science-fiction and horror, two of the most popular genres of its time, in a more sophisticated manner than those primitive '50s pictures. It also tried to emulate the style and success of STAR WARS and JAWS, which were the two biggest money-makers in the box office at the time. The result is a vastly overrated, unimaginative flick with a heap of overbearing effects. Besides the production design, the filmmakers have done very little to differentiate it from those old-time creature features; the movie is just a trendier rip-off.Its stodgy story follows a group of seven astronauts who must deal with an extraterrestrial after it manages to gain access to their spaceship. With this slimy menace running around the dark corridors playing a sinister game of hide-and-seek, the astronauts are killed by it one by one.Being the proficient designers they are, director Scott and his special effects team pull off all the ostentatious visual tricks they want to create this ghastly environment. They've added lots of spooky sounds too, like metallic clanging noises, the pounding of human hearts, robotic beeps and chirps, the wailing of sirens, and the shrieking and retching of the dying astronauts. Even the cheesy-looking killer alien has been carefully crafted. But it's a shame to find that this seems to be all that the crew is capable of. ALIEN is the jack-in-the-box type of scare movie, where, in order to get a fright, something has to unexpectedly happen or pop out. This lazy tactic has become favoured by movie audiences, and it's easy to see why; jumpscares are effective and simple to do. ALIEN typically makes the audience anticipate the scare through pretentious shots of nothingness, camera movements and the soundtrack's increase/decrease in volume. Because of the film's audio-visual craftiness, it happened to largely influence horror and sci-fi movies, including this year's UNDERWATER.The petty characters have meaningless chit-chats; they laugh, they shout and curse, they mumble technobabble. The suspense lies in their eventual deaths, but they're so shallow that empathy amounts to a simple shrug of the shoulders. Some have considered the film as one of the greatest of all time. What a stretch! I heard that director Scott got his training in advertising. It really shows - ALIEN is little more than a special effects showcase."
alisoncolegrooveq,"Jul 5, 2009",10/10,"Ah, here we are....the dregs of the IMDb reviews, where teenagers and 20-somethings who have rarely seen a film made before 1980 tell us how a masterful film like Alien is boring and slow..These poor mentally crippled creatures know no patience, know nothing about the craft of cinema except what their short attention spans can consume in junk food bytes (pun intended).Ignore these little trolls...Alien is a landmark classic of cinema with it's horror suspense and extraordinary visual design (Cobb vs Giger) - a film that still haunts the imagination all these years after i first saw it as a teen. Like 2001, the images are unforgettable, a cinema experience you can become completely immersed in.The late 70's, my youth, were in many ways were an incredible rebirth of science fiction and horror cinema, and it's worth noting how Alien in a sense bookended Lucas' fantasy reinvention of sci-fi with Star Wars. Ridley Scott's great vision in bringing all these elements together in Alien and Blade Runner literally changed the course of fantasy films alongside Lucas'.Many comments here also focus on comparing Alien to Aliens, which is ridiculous..It's simple...Alien is a horror masterpiece, and Aliens is a brilliantly executed action film using Alien as it's inspiration.If you don't like Alien, you don't like films...it's that brilliant."
mstomaso,"Jun 8, 2007",10/10,"While there is a general resemblance to the classic pulp sci fi film, ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"", Alien is an expertly crafted and thoroughly original film. In my opinion, it is also vastly superior to all of its descendants, including James Cameron's action and special effects smorgasbord, Aliens.As a teenager, I was so intrigued by the premise of this movie that I was one of the few people in the United States who went out and purchased Alan Dean Foster's book ""Alien"" and read it before the film was released. The book was actually very good, so I knew I was either in for a big treat or a total disappointment when I went to see Ridley Scott's Alien on opening night. Of course, there was no disappointment.Scott assembled a great cast, none of whom (at the time) had a great deal of face recognition except, perhaps, Ian Holm. He placed his characters in stasis aboard a long distance freight ship (""the Nostromo"") owned and operated by a mining company. The ship is grimy, a little broken down, and a bit cramped. The habitat module is one very small portion of this enormous commercial barge.The film uses sound beautifully. Both the amazingly haunting and memorable postmodern soundtrack and excellent soundscape are flawless. The film opens with the ship's computer beginning to power on the ship's systems, and even though the scene consists of nothing but sound effects and mostly immobile hardware, it is permanently burned into my memory.The crew is awakened, and unlike most sci fi films, almost immediately begins complaining about being brought out of stasis early and bickering about how much they should be paid for what appears to be an extra duty. Soon, we learn that a communication signal has been picked up on a planet nearby and the Nostromo's shuttle must descend to the planet and investigate.All of this is established effortlessly by Scott's fantastic directing, cinematography and editing, but rather than spoiling any aspect of this brilliantly plotted and presented story, I will discontinue my plot summary here and move on to the critique.Ridley Scott has directed two of the best science fiction films of all time - Bladerunner and Alien. These two films are completely different and also radically innovative for the sci fi genre. Alien reintroduces realism the the genre. The crew is not a bunch of heroic freedom fighters or righteous warriors. Instead, they are corporate staff members and a couple of administrators - a captain (Skerrit) and first officer (Weaver) who are the company management representatives, mechanics, a science officer/ship's surgeon, a navigator, and geologists (it's a mining company). The ship itself is not a sterile faster-than-light Maserati in space, but a gritty, messy, cramped, barge. And the alien is TRULY ALIEN. 'nuff said about him.H.R. Giger's organic/cybernetic art enhances the other-worldliness of all of the scenes that take place off of the Nostromo, and of course, the design of the alien itself. An enormous contribution that should not be overlooked.It doesn't really matter which version of this film you see. They are all terrific. The director's cut adds a couple of scenes which appeared in the book, but were left out of the original release. Personally, I don't think these scenes really add much to the film, but it is a matter of personal taste, since all of the versions I have seen are 10s.Recommended for anybody who can tolerate sci-fi."
antonjsw1,"Sep 1, 2015",N/A,"Ridley Scott's first mainstream Hollywood film is still fresh and powerful 30+ years after it was first released. The story of a commercial spaceship crew diverted to explore a distant planet as a result of the detection of mysterious signal getting themselves an extremely unwanted visitor and the subsequent horror than ensues makes this a landmark science fiction horror film. A fairly straightforward plot is helped by Scott creating a truly superb visually arresting atmosphere, thanks to great work by production designer Michael Seymour and cinematographer Derek Van Lint. It starts of epic, then transitions to the mundane, before building a growing sense of uneasiness leading to claustrophobic suspense and dread that just keeps building and building until, in the final act it turns into a nerve-wracking horror- thriller as key characters fight for survival.While Ridley Scott deserves great credit in pulling this all together so well, kudos has also to go to the whole cast for creating a wonderfully naturalistic approach to their roles, and being able to define their characters so uniquely and clearly, even if they are archetypes – Yaphet Kotto as the engineer with a chip on his shoulder regarding the preferential pay that the officers get, who nevertheless when the chips are down does demonstrate heroic qualities; Harry Dean Stanton as the fellow engineer who may have some form of brain damage, possibly brought on by historic substance abuse but knows the mechanics of the ship inside-out; Veronica Cartwright as the ships navigator, who acts as the link to the audience as a professionalism is gradually striped away as she is consumed by fear; Ian Holm as Ash, the enigmatic and quiet science officer who has only just jointed the crew at the start of this journey; John Hurt as the curious, fearless and gung- ho second in command, Tom Skerritt as the level headed, approachable but experienced Captain, and of course Sigourney Weaver (for whom this was her first film in a significant role) as what seems to be the young, less experienced but confident and assertive career-driven up and comer Ripley. The growing tensions between the characters, particularly the way that all the character butt heads with Weaver's character works well in the development of the story, and despite relative inexperience Weaver is terrific in the role, and helped create an iconic character in science fiction that would lead to three sequels.Kudos also has to go to the technical crew for creating a terrific atmosphere for the actors to work in – this was helped by Scott deciding to film the movie in chronological order of the story rather than a more typical logistical shooting order. The decision to hire the dark surreal artist HR Giger certainly brought a fresh new look to science fiction, but Michael Seymour's production design is truly brilliant and the way that the Alien is presented on screen is still pretty much the best – keeping its appearances limited and quick – nerves are so shredded by the end of the movie that seeing the monster in more extended full body shots where it is more obvious that it's a man in suit doesn't pull you out of the picture. Credit has also got to go to the brilliant Oscar winning visual effects team – as well as the aforementioned HR Giger, it also included in-camera effects from both Nick Alder and Brian Johnson, and excellent miniature photography from Dennis Ayling. Alder had cut his teeth as a director of effects photography on the Gerry Anderson TV show 'Space 1999'. After Alien, he has worked as an on-set special effects expert on an array of films including Empire Strikes Back, Conan the Barbarian(1982 version), Legend, Jewel of the Nile, Leon, Braveheart, Lost in Space, Behind Enemy Lines, Blade 2, Underworld, Hellboy, Shanghai Knights, Ghost Rider, and would win a BAFTA for best visual effects for the Luc Besson film The 5th Element. Johnson's early credits including work as a special effects assistant on 2001, before also cutting his teeth on Space 1999 as a 2nd unit director overseeing the visual effects. After Alien he would work on a variety of films including Never-ending Story, Dragonslayer, Slipstream, Dragonheart as well as winning another Oscar for best visual effects for Empire Strikes Back and a BAFTA for his work on Aliens. Carlo Rimbaldi was already an Oscar winning special effects veteran of over 20 films prior to working on Alien, and had just prior to this film completed work on both King Kong (for which he had won his prior Oscar) and Close Encounters. He would go on to win a third academy award for his work on E.T, and would go onto work on Conan the Destroyer and Dune. Denis Ayling followed this film as a cinematographer in British Television. Giger's did occasionally work on other films (creature designer on Alien 3, visual designer on Species) but his legacy is that the basic Alien look and design influence has survived through 3 excellent to OK Alien sequels, two poor Alien v Predator crossover movies, two disappointing Alien prequels, a batch of (very bad) Species sequels.Another noticeable contributor to the film's mood was the music – which should have been credited to Ridley Scott and Editor Terry Rawlings. Jerry Goldsmith's original score was extensively edited, cues moved around and classic music from other compositions fitted into the scores, but nevertheless somehow the music works very well.All of this helped make Alien a truly outstanding movie. The atmosphere created is so visceral that the film always leaves you with an impact after when the film is overOverall a landmark science-fiction classic."
neil-476,"Jan 3, 2008",7/10,"Alien is a good film with a number of major flaws, some of which should never have been allowed into the final released print. I saw it in the cinema on its original release, and was throughly looking forward to it being both a sci-fi and horror fan.1. So I was bemused to spend the first 5 minutes wandering over every square inch of the Nostromo. It was almost as if I was being told ""We've spent 5 million bucks on these sets, and you're going to see every square inch before we even start the film.""2. An hour of inconsequential fluff before anything happened. An hour!!3. Face hugger - good, from the alien spaceship to its final demise in the sickbay. This was more like it.4. Chestburster - absolutely horrific. Until that is, it looked round like a curious cartoon mole popping up out of a mole-hole, and skittered off to hide and grow. Everyone in the cinema laughed. Everyone. The entire impact of the chest bursting - thrown away. I can't believe that they wouldn't have been aware of this before putting the film into release.5. Rewiring Ash. Sigourney Weaver is wiring up a dummy head prior to Ian Holm's head, protruding through a false floor, answering her questions. So how do they bridge the transition from false head to real head? By using a cutaway to Ripley concentrating on the task in hand. No, they don't bridge it at all - instead, there is the most jarring jump-cut in the history of cinema. Even people who aren't versed in the grammar of cinema know that something cronky has happened, even if they can't put their fingers on what it is. This is Basic Film-making, first term, first lesson. Just plain awful.6. From here to the end, apart from the illogicalities and unanswered questions, the rest of the film is pretty good.Is that enough to make up for those glaring glitches? Not in my book."
Onethought,"Jan 20, 2006",10/10,"I give it a 10/10 without doubt. I am not giving it a 10/10 out of compassion but because of the creative and cinematographic (relative)perfection. Please mind that even though it has a new directors cut re-release, this movie is actually a full 25 years old!!! Even when you watch it now it stands it own and that is the magnificence of the art-director and of Ridley Scott, the film director.Ah then you get to see one of the best (or simply the best) female action heroes ever created on screen. Sigourney Weaver is just so memorable. Please don't forget that the brilliance of this movie launched a whole quadrology. That itself is a testament to this first one: Alien. The second one Aliens directed by James Cameroon is an epic in itself but much of the foundation was (perhaps inadvertently) laid by Ridley Scott in this movie. Please note another side effect was that female heroes were used by Hollywood after this movie in very big productions.Each shot, each scene and sequences build up the film in a fantastic manner that is old school but still so difficult to achieve. It is like Da Vinchi's painting. It is old school style. But still difficult to do. Story is about the crew of a mining ship who end up with an alien while answering an SOS call. Alien: not as in an illegal immigrant (er.. this is not a political movie about borders and immigration...) Alien as in the most scary creature ever devised. Truly alien. In every way it is so brilliant.I had a great experience when I watched it again. Definitely one of the all time greatest movies."

sylviavalek,"May 11, 2014",10/10,"Alien, (as well as all sequels, and prequels), is one of my favorite science fiction movies ever. It is one of those movies that you can watch a million times and never get sick of, it just has a really smart, interesting story, and the storyline and characters all work perfect together. The actors are great, especially Sigourney Weaver, and she is very good as portraying Lt. Ripley. The movie is set in the future, and is basically about a spaceship that gets a call while in space to check out a distress signal coming from a distant planet. The crew of the spaceship come into contact with an alien lifeform, and must fight to survive, as well as save the human race. The feel of the movie and characters is very authentic, which, (along with the excellent story), is why I love it so much. It is basically a science fiction thriller, with a very ""on-the-edge-of-your'seat"" feel to it."
vipcorp-954-708527,"Apr 1, 2014",10/10,"Not much to say that hasn't been said about Alien. I am doing my small part to pump the rating up to a solid 9 where it belongs.I saw this on the big screen during it's opening week when I was 11 in a REAL theater - huge (holding 1075 people), packed house, spring-rocking seats, 70mm film, six track Dolby...wondrous. I have watched Alien at least 50 times since and I will never grow tired of it.The overall mood of the film is chilling and suspenseful. The detail and sheer beauty of the Nostromo's interior is stunning. I could easily watch an entire hour of slow, sweeping pans of the rooms and corridors alone. Nothing before or since has ever come close.The special effects in Alien are fantastic by any standard. Yes, there is one scene in which someone attempts to stand something upright on a table and another where something appears to be moving on a dolly that reveal some limitations, but these are more than acceptable trade-offs for the realism of makeup versus CGI. I am sure the editors wished they had a few more takes to work with, but they did their best with the shots they had and these very minor flaws do not detract.I would have thought that by now, CGI would be a match for ""old-fashioned"" silicone and makeup, but sadly no. CGI still looks fake and has never produced a single, believable, creature or superhero in all these years. Ever. I find that very sad. I don't know if it is because the technology for realism just isn't here yet or if it is simply a lack of human talent in adding in the ""imperfections"" that make things look real. I suspect it's a combination of both plus a lack of budget for the time it would take and I don't think we will see real-looking CGI for at least another 30 years. I wish more films today would shun CGI altogether. Models, silicone and makeup are far superior. Come on CGI effects teams - CATCH UP!Well, that's my rant on CGI... But although the sets and effects are wonderful, Alien is not a special effects film. It is pure suspense and horror in a sci-fi setting, done to perfection.Alright that's enough. If you are the one person alive who hasn't seen this, what are you waiting for? If sci-fi or slow suspense is not your cup of tea, so be it. It takes all kinds to make a world, but give it a shot - give it its due. Alien is truly an amazing work of art."
LoneWolfAndCub,"Jun 24, 2005",10/10,"Alien is by far one of the greatest movies made. Directed by Ridley Scott, you can tell by the eerie, bleak opening credits that your not in for a pleasant ride.This movie starts out with introducing us to the crew of the Nostromo, who are returning to Earth. Along the way they receive a distress signal. They go and investigate and everything takes a turn for the worst when a crew member comes back on board with a parasite attached to his face. When the alien then breaks free all hell is raised.This is a great movie. The suspense is by far some of the best filmed and the dark atmosphere heightens are sense of terror. Well acted by Sigouney Weaver, Ian Holm and Tom Skerrit this is a genre defining movie which holds to date one of the most shocking scenes ever filmed. The 'Chestburster.'5/5"
bowmanblue,"Sep 28, 2014",10/10,"I'm writing this review not because I think 'Alien' needs another 5* review, but because I read a post on an internet message board by someone saying, 'I can't believe this piece of junk is considered scary!' So, I re-watched Alien, trying to see if I could see where this poster was coming from. I guess there are now two types of viewers. The first - like me - grew up on Alien in the late seventies/early eighties, where it was one of the most ahead of its time films ever made. It started off the whole 'monster-munching' movie genre, where a lone creature stalks and eliminates a team/crew/whatever one by one. There have been countless B-movies made since its release in 1979 which have tried - unsuccessfully - recapture its look, feel and financial viability, but pretty much all have failed.Then you have the new generation - those who have grown up with 'Avatar' as the 'normal' quality of film. It's fair to say that Avatar is a vastly superior film to Alien, but only because it has the budget etc. If you're used to seeing thousands of alien creatures fighting over a mystical landscape, watching a single creature (which, as some times, comes across very much as a bloke in a suit) jump out of the darkness about five times in two hours, comes as a bit of a let-down.However, when it comes to purity, Alien will beat pretty much every movie ever made (even its highly-regarded successor, 'Aliens,' which - although also excellent, is not as pure as the original, as it blends genres more).If you know Alien and generally appreciate horror and/or science-fiction, you'll probably already love it. However, if you're new to the genre and primarily are used to modern filming techniques, you may have to put yourself in the place of the audiences back in 1979, who had never seen such a claustrophobic and tense piece of horror.The xenomorph itself, now looking a little dated (in my opinion the dragon-thing at the end of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland looked more horrific!) may not cut it compared with modern special effects, but - again - it was way ahead of its time. Alien will stand the test of (cinematic) time. Film history will always have a place of it (and Aliens), just don't go thinking that films have always been made the way Avatar and Lord of the Rings have."
emms75,"Apr 11, 2004",10/10,"Alien is a chilling suspense thriller set in space. Directed in 1978 by Ridley Scott, this film is important to me, as I admire the techniques used in order to generate a response in the viewer.Back in 1978, the director couldn't rely upon today's modern digital effects to grab the audience's attention. Instead, he relies upon techniques such as camera angles, a clever set design, and a superb soundtrack to slowly build tension and create feelings of fear, vulnerability and intimidation within the audience.It is at least half an hour into the film before the audience are aware of the extent of the horrors that follow. Until then, the uncertainty of not knowing exactly what we should be afraid of only adds to the tension. The eventual release of the tension, which has gradually built up, inevitably has more impact.The film is set in a time and place unknown to us. However there are several ideas in the film which we can recognise and relate to, making the story believable, therefore more frightening.For example, the idea of travelling far in space for the purposes of a mining expedition is something which the viewer could accept as likely to be happening in the future. Also, the seven characters on board the ship have an obvious class system, something which we can all relate to in any work environment.These are some of the qualities which make Alien so popular, making it an inspiring piece of film making."
tfrizzell,"Oct 26, 2000",N/A,"""Alien"" is one of those films that has spawned numerous imitations, but none have come close to the brilliance of their inspiration.  Definitely scary and somewhat difficult to watch, the film deals with an outer-space crew that accidently runs across an unknown organism that is bent on killing everyone.  Sigourney Weaver became a super-star because of this film, but she gets ample support from everyone else.  Tom Skeritt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton, and John Hurt all do amazing jobs with the material.  Ridley Scott's direction keeps the audience tense and on edge throughout the film's running time.  A really great film from the horror and sci-fi genres.  4 stars out of 5."
strong-122-478885,"Jul 3, 2014",6/10,"Well, at this point, what could I possibly say about 1979's Alien that (in the past 35 years) hasn't already been said about 100x before?It's actually quite surprising to see that after all of these many years (and after all of its many imitators) Alien still rocks when it comes to its shocks.Whenever discussing Alien there's one very important person, directly involved in its production, who I find rarely gets any mention or recognition for his vitally important contribution to this Sci-Fi production.And that person is Swiss-born artist H.R. Giger who was the one responsible for the design of this truly awesome and terrifying creature with its acid blood and a ferocious appetite to match.You can be sure, without Giger's fantastically fantastic creation, this Sci-Fi/Shocker would have never had the enduring impact that it inevitably has had over these many years.On May 12, 2014, Hans Rudolf Giger (at 74) died in Zurich, Switzerland. In respectful memory of this man, I believe Sci-Fi/Horror movie fans everywhere owe this dude plenty of well-deserved credit and thanks."
hitchcockthelegend,"May 12, 2019",10/10,"Alien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon. It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.The space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...Back on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.On plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.Some still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid conventions.With art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.It made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.Now 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly so. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10"
malik-the-hot1,"May 31, 2010",7/10,"This film is overrated and i expect everyone to stay away from. The movie itself is very slow, outdated. Opening scenes look like some old spaceship movie based on outerspace landing, the movie is so dull it keeps you waiting for anything to pop-up, although i must admit it is a bit creepy, but too slow. I watched this movie alongside the predator, and i must say the predator is far entertaining movie, i eagerly wanted to see an alien with something innovative, but it lacks what the predator has i.e: heat vision and array of weapons. The alien movie reminds me of the film relic released in 1996, accept that sorry to say that relic has an edge over this one, because its more entertaining, rather than this boring farce, which i regret wasting my time on, the only decent alien movie of the franchise has to be aliens, all the rest after that have been worse than even this one. 2/10"
mm-39,"Jan 6, 2002",5/10,"This film is okay, but the more I watch it the less I like it.  The film does not age that well.  This film must have been a real shocker in 79, but very average in 02.   I guess the build up from Aliens 2 gives this film a big let down.  A creature runs around the ship, and we have a bunch of hack and slash.  It is worth seeing the first time, but I would not want to watch it a second time."
mdw0526,"Jul 15, 2019",9/10,"This movie is still a classic after all these years, and proof at what a master filmmaker Ridley Scott is (the original ""Blade Runner"" is in my top 10 films of all time). Scary, suspenseful, and full of tension, this is what good filmmaking is all about. We already have the 1986 sequel ""Aliens"" queued up to watch (and it's supposedly one of the times when the sequel is better than the original)."
jbassindale-70444,"May 15, 2016",9/10,"This movie predates my childhood, since I was born at a time when horror was sadly beginning to fade into the cliché standards of today's ""scary movies."" This is the sort of horror movie everyone remembers, and it has stood the test of time like no other movie in the genre (with the exception of, perhaps, Psycho or The Shining). The phrase 'in space nobody can hear you scream' has never been so effective, and the movie relies on atmosphere to generate this effectiveness. This is a risky decision for any movie developer. If that atmosphere is not established well enough, then the movie loses all sense of fear and tension. Here, however, this is not the case. The alien is instantly established as a threat - thanks to that infamously gory scene in the cafeteria (you all know which one I'm talking about) - and this, combined with the tight hallways and sense of claustrophobia, is what shapes Alien into the chilling experience that is renowned more than 25 years later."
xuenylomluap,"Nov 17, 2019",10/10,"At 12 years old, my father handed me the book version of Alien, by Alan Dean Foster. I remember him chuckling and telling me I'd like it. Once I started reading, I became absorbed by it. My father was right. This was the year the film was released, and at 12, there was no way of going to see it. So I became obsessed with getting to see it. After the film was released, I stumbled upon the photo book The Making Of Alien, and after finally seeing H.R. Giger's creations, I was completely blown away.Alien is a tightrope of tension and fear. It's the most atmospheric movie I have ever seen. All of the cast are solid in their roles. Ridley Scott and crew did an amazing job of recreating H.R.Giger's designs, and Scott's direction is flawless throughout. The set designs inside the Nostromo, and the gritty 'space truckers' feel of the film, add to the realism. Which makes for a great contrast when they finally discover the alien derelict, with it's nasty surprises.John Williams's score is amazing. Suitably dark and bleak, with just a glimmer of hope.So, from a 12 year old's crush, and to finally seeing it a few years later, I can say with ease, Alien is without doubt, my favourite film.Total perfection."
Pramitheus,"May 15, 2016",10/10,"I am watching this movie in 2016 and still the practical effects almost made me puke. Ridley Scott's space horror is one for the classics. I have obviously watched many movies with gore and aliens and sometimes both but all of them try to force feed you. The set pieces don't seep in and the audience is made to jump from one gory situation to another. BUT this is Ridley Scott we are talking about. The one who started it all. I actually had watched Prometheus 1st and had a vague idea about the Alien franchise. Now after re-watching Alien I am beginning to connect the dots.The plot is probably known to everyone by now. So just skipping over that. Starting with the direction. The slow paced direction allows you to feel the atmosphere. The situation. It makes you understand the psyche of each of the crew members aboard the Nostromo. You start to care and while watching it I often wished to not get emotionally involved because I knew what was to follow. The face-hugger scenes was much more creepy and disgusting than when the Alien arrives, because the Alien is shown in the dark and mysterious. So the effect of the goriness is only understood when the witnesses arrive but the face-hugger is on screen. It is puke-worthy.The acting was very natural. The lines almost seemed unscripted. The equation between all the crew members was very evident from the beginning. I should seen through the fact that Ash was an android but it was well hinted throughout the film. It is very subtle. So subtle that you are bound to miss . As I said, the pacing is very steady. You'll feel the fear. The set-design is amazing. All in all it was a enjoyable movie. Ridley Scott is the master of space oriented movies.Final warning. IF ANY ASTRONAUT IS READING THIS AND WANTS TO SPACE TRAVEL, DON'T LAND ON UNKNOWN PLANETS"
doctorcrypticat,"Mar 4, 2016",10/10,"Alien (1979) is easily one of the greatest horror films of its time, and is still today. The atmosphere it provides along with the setting go hand in hand. Providing an almost claustrophobic environment with nowhere to truly run and hide. With its tag line, 'In space no one can hear you scream,' becomes true. The characters having no one to contact or to run away being that they're blanketed by space. The unique personalities of all the characters make them each interesting for their own ways. And the build up and tension created by the movie allows for the scares to come much easier. This has been and may forever be my favorite movie."
michaelamurphy,"Jun 23, 2007",6/10,"The 1970s are very well known for movies that scared audiences out of their mind. Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" startled audiences with a sophisticated kind of imprisonment whose purpose was to cure when really it could have been used in the next ""Hostel."" ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" frightened audiences with the realization that there is barely escape when in a burning building or a sinking cruise liner. Finally ""The Exorcist"" did the worst, in short, it made every viewer sleep with their light on for the rest of their life. The decade closed off with another sci-fi horror classic, ""Alien.""""Alien"" is the story of a spaceship crew who is awakened from chronological sleep to investigate a distress signal from a distant planet. After a bad landing, the crew of seven sends a crew of three out onto the surface to investigate. When one crew member, Kane (John Hurt) is lowered into a derelict ship, he is attacked by an alien being that clings to his face. Meanwhile, crew member Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) translates the supposed distress signal into a warning, however, they do not understand why it would be a warning until it's too late. An Alien being is now loose on the ship.The crew is now faced with a challenge, a loose killer Alien on the ship. They must keep together to stay and alive and make themselves kill or be killed.Known as a sci-fi horror classic, ""Alien"" isn't all that it's worked up to be. Being in every book of movies that are ""must-sees"" and #51 on the Top 250 would peak anyone's interest, but i can assure you, it's nothing special, just another sci-fi movie.If you want to see a good, classic Sci-fi movie, you'd have a better chance watching the original Star Wars trilogy again or even ""Starship Troopers."" ""Alien"" is nothing more than an entertaining movie. With decent acting, mediocre plot, good directing, and a forgettable twist. I can say that I can only give it an 8 marking it solely on directing and entertainment. If I rated it solely on plot and conflict, it would be 5/10. I'm sorry for anyone that did really enjoy this movie."
kilgoreboys,"Apr 4, 2018",10/10,"Horror movies today could take a step back, take a long look, and find their own piece to take. Now, of course, I sincerely believe the film industry should try it's best to be original, although let's be honest, that won't happen. Everything in this movie is perfect, I mean that. The script never falls apart with one of the most steady spaced movies I have ever watched. The acting is unknowingly great, depending on your observations of certain characters. The ship is fully developed, with a crew that does not hesitate in any scene with their brilliant chemistry. The ship design feels dirty and lived in, keeping the advanced look. Every time a button is pressed to put in commands or a lever is pulled the ship responds. The Alien design is many peoples favorites, feeling real. For 1979 this movie is revolutionary in visuals and props, never looking too fake. If there is anything I would have to say this movie does best on, it is the cinematography. Derek Vanlint gave the job of a lifetime, alongside Ridley Scott. Alien is one of my favorite movies if you have never watched it....fix that. Alien, of course, gets a perfect score."
jakethesnake-42007,"Mar 19, 2021",6/10,It's a classic so I needed to see this movie and when I did I just found it ok. I found it slow and it dragged on abs by the time it got good it ended. The acting is great I'll give you that abs e story is good I just don't think it's the best sci fi film.
kernan_pcb,"Jun 5, 2006",4/10,"this film was misdirected, unoriginal, cheaply produced and it all showed. the plot line was absolutely atrocious and although the producers may have added in extra splashes of gore to direct attention from the otherwise horrible performing i do not think it can really be considered to be a horror. i accept that it was going to have a challenge to compete with the seemingly unrivalled success of Star Wars (1977) however to expect to actually give George Lucas a run for his money wit this production was ludicrous. i am not quite sure that i have seen another film with quite the level of subordinate scripting and meaning that does not go directly out of its way to be considered as a joke. e.g. scream"
muffinbestcat,"Mar 23, 2016",9/10,"Ridley scott worked very hard on this movie. It may be a little slow, but ridley scott made sure he told the story right. if your willing to be patient then watching this film will be rewarding for you.the visuals of the film are almost perfect for the time it was made. what really makes the movie is H R Giger's work on the creature and the alien spaceship. With a strong director the artistry came together to make one of the best films ever made.Others may disagree but I wasn't impressed by the acting. Not necessarily because I thought it was bad acting, but because the actors didn't bring much interest to the film for me. I found them very monotone and dull compared to the brilliant visuals."
saymaraza,"Jun 5, 2016",9/10,"Alien is one of the first movies directed by legendary 'Ridley Scott' (Blade Runner, Gladiator) The film is a classic in the making. When i first heard about this movie i was around 10 years old, obviously too young to watch the movie, now i am 17 and i have watched it for the first time, now twice i enjoyed it so much. This is honestly one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the 70s, probably is my favourite Sci Fi movie of the 70s, and one of the best of all time. The Sequel 'Aliens' (1986) was directed by James Cameron, another one of my favourite directors. Director of 'The Terminator' (1984) which stands as my favourite Sci-Fi movie of all time. The reason i didn't want to see Alien when i was younger, was because i always felt scared of the Alien, i used to have horrific nightmares of them just thinking about them. When i went to Disney world, i have always loved Movies, so i decided to visit a Movie ride, the Alien suddenly popped out of the ceiling, of course it was only plastic, but looked real enough. So i had always been too scared to watch the Movie. I didn't know what i was missing out! As i watched it i didn't know what i was worrying about. It's very different to watching it on Screen than seeing for real. I am nearly 18 now, so i am not really scared of anything anymore, i would definitely go back to Disney and try out that ride again, just to see if it still scares me, I think now i've finally seen the movie i appreciate now that it's not real, and i find it interesting than scary now more than anything, because it feels like I'm in the movie. When it comes to Ridley Scott director 'Prometheus' (2012) a prequel to Alien, that wasn't very scary at all, it was more of a mystery than a Sci-Fi/ Horror i thought. Alien is deifinitely a classic in the making, Don't miss Ridley Scott's masterpiece Alien!"
BlueRLilys,"May 24, 2015",10/10,"What can be said that hasn't already been said, nothing that's what. One of the best in the genre to be made and best effects for it's time. They simply don't make films like this anymore Hollywood won't risk it or this generation won't appreciate it. One of the great strengths of ""Alien"" is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences.Today's slasher movies, in the sci-fi genre and elsewhere, are all pay-off and no buildup.The result is a film that absorbs us in a mission before it involves us in an adventure, and that consistently engages the alien with curiosity and logic, instead of simply firing at it.We have now descended into a bog of Gotcha! movies in which various horrible beings spring on a series of victims, usually teenagers. The ultimate extension of the genre is the Geek Movie, illustrated by the remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" which essentially sets the audience the same test as an old-time carnival geek show: Now that you've paid your money, can you keep your eyes open while we disgust you? A few more ambitious and serious sci-fi films have also followed in the footsteps of ""Alien,"" notably the well-made ""Aliens"" (1986) and ""Dark City"" (1998). But the original still vibrates with a dark and frightening intensity."
RM851222,"Oct 22, 2014",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Alien"" (1979) is a masterpiece, pure and simple. If there is still anyone who somehow haven't seen it (i can't imagine how could that be even possible), do your self a favor a watch it, not with your friends on Friday evening, but alone and let this movie blow you away.I saw this picture for many times in my life: on VHS, TV, DVD, Blu Ray and finally on 4K UHD disk, as well as on my 2m x 2m screen projector with all sound system ready to roll.This is timeless film because of many things. The atmosphere, the rising tension, the craftsmanship of the scenes, acting - it all works here because they are not overplayed, and build on seemingly simple approach. 15 minutes into this movie again i caught myself that i forgot everything and i was in there, with them. Thats because of the script, directing, acting - it's all in the first place here, not settings, which still looks great - a bit dated, maybe, but it's not Star Wars type movie were visuals have to be sharp - ""Alien"" shows things in shadows, moody style to create feeling of uncertainty, and it does it brilliantly - that is why this movie is never going to age.Please don't ever compare it to even superior (in my opinion) ""Aliens"" - ""Alien"" is different kind of a movie, it's purpose was to scare people with deadly and very claustrophobic atmosphere, settings and the creature itself, to feel people uncomfortable (in a good way) knowing that no one is safe here and around every corner there could be your end - just look at the close ups near the end of the movie, or shoots where camera is showing person and a deep dark space behind him, thats were imagination starts to fill the darkness.Overall, 10/10 for one of the greatest achievements in the art of movie making."
blissey_s,"Sep 21, 2024",7/10,"Impressive for its time, no doubt, but the pace verges on slow at the beginning. It takes a good 45-50 minutes into the film before anything actually happens, so if you are an impatient viewer like myself you may find this a dealbreaker. Once things get going, however, Alien is a really imaginative take on Alien life. It is no doubt impressive how a film of this technical ability was created in the 70s. The eyes of a millenial such as myself were quick to write off this movie as ""another sci-fi thriller in space"" but as it is one of the first of its kind it scores major points for being that reference point for so many films that came after. With the headstrong Sigourney Weaver in the lead role there is a rootable character who has tenacity and a commanding presence that dominates the screen. The alien lifeforms are rightfully grotesque and space does look like space, or what we might imagine it to look like. It's the combination of a strong lead character, the creative impetus of the director, and the production value that make this a classic. Nonetheless, it is far from a perfect film. It drags in many parts. There verges on too much gore versus intelligent thoughtful scenes. It would have been interesting to see the aliens communicate with the humans, or some explanation of what their purpose is. Instead, the movie opts to depict the aliens as bloodthirsty predators hellbent on killing. This paints a rather bleak portrait of aliens to the masses. Aliens, if they exist, are not necessarily violent, and do not necessarily take on the forms depicted in this movie."
jcazes-676-576237,"Sep 8, 2024",4/10,"I can't recall being more disappointed in a movie than I was after watching Alien. I imagine this movie was ahead of its time in 1979, but I didn't enjoy it one bit in 2024 and would never watch it again. The characters are undeveloped and constantly do dumb things. Wandering into an alien ship. Leaving doors open. Not closing doors when a literal alien escapes. Going on solo missions after it's escaped. The plot is so silly and predictable I found myself rooting for all of the characters to die. The set design was the only redeeming quality of this movie, but even that was over dramatized. Tons of silly light strobes, random steam, etc. That seemed purely theatrical.I'm selling my blu ray after this."
secondtake,"Jul 7, 2009",8/10,"Alien (1979)The First of a New Sci-Fi Horror BreedIt's hard to believe how fresh and scary this movie was at the time, but it's also a relief to see it still holds up as a well made movie even now. Is it a classic great movie? Almost, almost. But not quite, in the end--mostly because of some clichés and goofs in the acting and dialog--although it has really great moments. And it's a great way to discover director Ridley Scott's unique style.Certainly now that H. R. Giger the artist has gotten famous in his own right, the alien itself deserve special mention. And the sets are impressively otherworldly and familiar at the same time--not only the huge and hugely baroque ship, but the interior scenes on the planet toward the beginning. These are marvels whether or not your style (and for my money, the alien is a really improbable type of extraterrestrial, more at home in a comic book Hades than actual space). Another novelty to note, probably a product of the shift in movies in general since the 1960s, is the director's intention to keep things real and everyday. Things are dirty, people worry about their paychecks, and so on.This is a long way from the sterility of 2001 though head to head the earlier Kubrick film is on another level of art. I know a lot of people would rather be entertained, though, and Alien is entertaining. It's fast, it's scary, it's gory, it's messy. It's surprising. It's beautiful. And it spawned a whole series of follow-ups, the next one confusingly called Aliens (1986), also a very good take on the new genre.I first saw this when it came out in Colorado and it was on a huge, curving screen that wrapped around the audience, and I was really, truly scared. Now, thirty years later, the scary parts are still really scary, and it's edited so quickly you won't spend more than a minute on any one scene that doesn't quite click. Horror sci-fi has never been the same since."
ryanskywalker-87402,"May 20, 2017",10/10,"One of the most original, suspenseful & terrifying films you're ever going to come across, Ridley Scott's breakthrough feature is a masterful blend of imagination, art direction, set design, special effects, unsettling score, perfect cast, terrific performances & quality narration, and is an extraordinary achievement in the genre of both horror & science-fiction which today is universally hailed as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time.Alien follows a seven members crew en-route to Earth on board a huge commercial ship when their journey is interrupted by what appears to be a distress signal from a desolate planet. The crew lands to investigate but discovers a deadly life form which breeds within a human host. And so begins the horror... the horror of a highly aggressive extra-terrestrial creature which begins to stalk & kill them one by one.Ingeniously directed by Ridley Scott, it's his brilliant use of atmospheric visuals & breathtaking details plus strong emphasis on realism over movie heroics that provides Alien an ageless appeal. Cleverly penned down by Dan O'Bannon, his vision of the monster and the futuristic world he sets the plot in is nothing short of breathtaking. Also, H.R. Giger's design of the monster is an exceptional feat in itself, for it is truly a unique & original fusion of insect, man & machine.Cinematography & editing is carried out amazingly well and integrates effortlessly with other aspects of this film. The cast works together as a team with great maturity and it was pleasing to see each & every character getting equal importance as it provided viewers a bunch of very believable & convincing individuals. And in a cast that comprises of Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm & John Hurt, it is Weaver who ends up leaving the most lasting impression on the canvas.But the most remarkable thing about Alien is its persistent attention on suspense over mindless gore & graphic kills and of course, its smart pacing as well that separates it from typical slasher films. Alien actually takes its time & waits until the viewers are fully immersed into its world and is at its scariest when nothing is happening as Scott allows plenty of space for our imaginations to run wild and, with little help from Jerry Goldsmith's tense score, turns almost every frame into a potential nightmare scenario.On an overall scale, by bringing together the silence of 2001: A Space Odyssey to create suspense and the horror of Jaws by not showing but not ruling out the presence of the creature either, Alien succeeds in creating a very dark, moody & unique atmosphere that constantly provides a feeling of uneasiness throughout its runtime. A genre-defining masterpiece, a genuine fright classic, and an unprecedented fusion of art, science & horror, Alien is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies. One hundred percent recommended"

The pacing of the film although slow by todays standards really enables the audience to get embroiled in the atmosphere and claustrophobia of the Nostromo and allows us to get to know its crew. Sigourney Weaver of course made her name with this film, but Ian Holm as Ash is fantastic, the subtle body language responses he does throughout as the horror escalates enable us to realise he knows more than he is letting on about the creature. There is not a single weak performance in the film and each character leaves an impression in there own way. The special effects are also outstanding and hold up to today's viewing, it was certainly a masterstroke by Ridley Scott to show as little of the Alien as possible as this escalates the dread and horror. A minor gripe would be there is perhaps slightly too much of the Alien shown right at the end of the film but thankfully that is just for a few seconds. The Matt paintings look fantastic for the planet the Nostromo lands on and the eggs and face hugger are suitably horrific. Alien is a film i have watched lots of times over the years and never got fed up with it, always enjoying the visuals and viewing experience. The word Classic was created for a film like this."
rmax304823,"Jul 12, 2003",N/A,"""Alien"" follows the general conventions established by John Ford's ""The Lost Patrol,"" his highly influential 1934 work.  It's been redone any number of times as a war movie or a Western.  Now it's in outer space.  The sub-genre looks something like this.  A small contingent of people -- a mixed group -- in an isolated situation are confronted with a rarely seen enemy who strikes out of the darkness.  There is no way to fight back effectively.  One by one, the group members are picked off, beginning with the leader.  This shifts the responsibility to the next in command, who turns out to be the lone survivor or, sometimes, the last to sacrifice himself or herself for the sake of the mission.But it's hard to recognize the basic plot under all the gloss.  This movie was something of a shocker on its release, and introduced a lot of innovations into SF movies.  For instance, in all earlier movies in which a team lands on an alien astronomical body there is no wind.  Here, there is a howling gale.  This may not seem like much, stated so baldly, but no one had thought of it before, although it's long been known that planets like Jupiter have atmospheres that are in a state of constant turbulence.The monster was also a vehicle for a new, slimier conception of raw evil. This one is no Gill Man or furry pet with teeth.  This thing is positively reptilian in its detestability.  And it doesn't just ""do away"" with its victims.  It begins by incorporating every revolting image from our worst nightmares -- a scaly muscular skate-like creature that plasters itself to John Hurt's face and embeds itself in his innards in order to plant a seed of some sort, which later develops into a juvenile that, in a famous scene, bursts out of Hurt's chest during a shipboard dinner that didn't look very appetizing anyway.  This was the first movie that could really turn one's stomach, what with jelly-like substances and gooey sounds.  Everything connected with the alien looks as if it belongs under a rock in a jungle. The f/x are outstanding.  If they look a little tired today it's only because they've been so often imitated.The performances are professional all the way down the line.  Sigourney Weaver has a strangely boney face and tiny mouth, but she's believable and turns in a good performance, especially for a Stanford graduate.  Her first name was plucked by her father from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, ""The Great Gatsby,"" one of my faves.  Tom Skerrit isn't around that long, but he is so likably easy-going that we hate to see him disappear from the plot early on. John Hurt is a fine actor.  He was my supporting player in the art-theater classic, ""From the Hip.""  He's never done less than a first-rate job. Whatever happened to him?  Veronica Cartwright exudes vulnerability.  She needs protection as an adult as much as she did when she was a child in ""The Birds.""  In an interview she revealed that when the juvenile creature first appeared everyone laughed at it because it looked so much like a penis. Ian Holm as the robot is suitably cold.  He's a good Shakespearian too. Yaphet Koto is an earthy comforting presence -- while he lasts.  The alien itself doesn't have much screen time but makes the most of it, dripping all over with what looks like saliva.  It reminded me of a boatswain's mate I once had the misfortune to serve under.There are a couple of curious things that shouldn't get more than footnotes. The music is almost all taken from Howard Hanson, a moody and underrated composer, and effectively evokes distance, darkness, and the mystery associated with them.  There are also a couple of references to Joseph Conrad thrown in (eg., the name of the ship is the Nostromo) for reasons I can't figure out.  Maybe the writers or the director just happened to like Conrad.  It should also be noted that Sigourney Weaver's figure, while not bursting with femininity, is sleek and smooth and looks designed for underwater swimming.If you haven't seen this, you should probably try to.  The gross factor isn't very high, viewed from today's perspective, so if that's what you're looking for, rent Carpenter's regurgitative newer version of ""The Thing"" or something."
mossgrymk,"Dec 20, 2021",10/10,"As the sixteenth hundred and forty first IMDB reviewer of this flawless sci fi action adventure classic I have little to add to my sixteen hundred and forty IMDB colleagues' opinions except to say that the more times I watch this film the more it strikes me how it looks both backward and forward...back to the edgy, realistic 1960s as a quiet repudiation of the dumbed down Hollywood 1980s to come (are you listening, Mr. Lucas?) and forward to the less sexist Hollywood of the 2000s by having far and away the smartest and most competent of the Nostromo's crew be a woman.And of course there's Jonesy."
johanfedward,"Mar 15, 2025",7/10,"It feels like the film has taken inspiration from two of the most important films ever: 2001 and Star Wars. I am deeply impressed by Tom Skerrit's (Dalls) natural portrayal, some of his lines feel so natural and unfiltered. Ian Holm's (Ash) character is more fascinating than the space monster itself. Something I don't really understand is where the cat comes from? Was it sedated with the crew? The film stands out as a style-setting and defining one for various films made afterwards. Cigarette smoking occurs completely carefree. Sigourney Weaver's character (Ellen Ripley) is brilliant and perhaps the greatest female action hero in film history. The depiction of life aboard the ship feels unfiltered and believable. My favorite part of the film is the introduction with the slow camera movements that create a sense of isolation and anxiety. A less good part of the film is the depiction of the visit to the planet. This part could have been developed more."
invisibleunicornninja,"Oct 27, 2018",4/10,"Before I continue this review, I just want to give a warning to everyone with photosensitive epilepsy. The entire third act of this movie is filtered by strobe lights. If you're sensitive to that kind of thing, then don't watch.Plot and ""Characters"" - I honestly don't mind slow movies, but this is taking it too far. I'm not asking for nonstop action, all I really wanted was some kind of a plot, tension, maybe some world building, and possibly some character development. Just the bare bones that you'd want out of a movie. Unfortunately, this mess contains none of that. The ""plot"" can be summed up in one sentence - ""dumb people find alien, do dumb things then die."" One of the people on the ship turns out to be a robot and it doesn't even have anything to do with anything, it just happens. I've heard people say that these characters are incredibly well-developed, but they aren't. Calling them ""characters"" is an insult to the very word. There is next to nothing that differentiates them from one another. Instead of dull scenes without dialogue or anyone doing anything, this movie really could've used some scenes where the characters interact, express individual motivations, and maybe get some backstory. The start has a vague plot about getting away from the aliens, but but the time one person is left alive, the editor gave up and nothing makes sense. Even the movie knows its being boring too because Ripley strips for no reason and from then on the movie is filmed in a bit of a sexual manner.Sights and Sounds - The visual quality and the effects and the sound design in this movie are all fine. Nothing great, but not bad. Its actually pretty good, considering its age.This movie isn't scary or interesting. Really it commits the biggest crime that a movie can commit - its boring. It does almost nothing that a movie is supposed to do. Even my dad, who was blinded by nostalgia goggles prior to rewatching, realized how bad it is after watching it with me. Anyone who says that this movie is great clearly needs to rewatch it. I don't care that this movie doesn't have nonstop action - there are a lot of movies with lots of action that are boring. Honestly, I have no idea why people hold this trash in such high regard. Maybe it was good at the time, and sure it had some influence on future movies, but it doesn't really have anything else going for it."
Foxy-4,"Aug 4, 1998",9/10,"Alien may be looking a bit dated nowadays, what with it's chugging computers and hilariuosly outdated monitor screens, but it still captures you with its suspence. The long periods searching the ship for the Alien slows your heartbeat to the rate of the ship's whirring thuds. Despite the fact that a couple of girls i am unfortunately aquainted with ruined it for me forever (calling the alien cute as it bursts from John H's body as well as continually giggleing at the insult ""you look dead"" and line ""I'm going down too"") i still believe it is a modern (or not so) classic."
omegaenvych,"Oct 31, 2019",9/10,"This is a very good movie. Like SUPER GOOD.
It has a few flaws and here they are:Movie is relatively slow.
Ash's head in that one scene is obviously fake.And that's it. I don't have issues with slow burning movies and I appreciate quality of special effects.
My biggest complaint is that movie isn't scary anymore. Because I watched it like 30 times and can almost tell it scene by scene. Of course it's no longer creepy, disgusting or scary to me. And that's fine. I still can get a lot of fun from this movie. It's good. REALLY GOOD. If you haven't watched it, go and do so. Just keep in mind that it's not a fast-paced action movie, but a slow and methodical horror."
mrbarooee,"Dec 11, 2015",9/10,"This suspenseful, spine-tingling movie keeps you on the edge of your seat right up to the time it's finished. When you watch this one, you feel like a good friend (by good I mean shrewd in picking movies) has brought it to your house to have a great movie night. In other words, it seems like director had seen it several times before he made it. He is that friend of yours by the way. A huge spacecraft has finished its mission and is heading back to Earth. We the crew members get up from their sleeping pods, they realize the spaceship is out of its course. Apparently it has received a signal from another planet, indicating some alien life form and set off to accomplish it secondary mission: investigating life in space. The extra- terrestrial life they find is by no mean friendly and brings horror into the ship.It's more of a horror film than a science fiction one. I am sure you have seen those horror films in which some people are stuck in a hut in jungle and there is some nasty creature lurking to hunt them one by one. Well, now make the hut full of small rooms and send it to space. This, has provided director with a lot of close-ups which sends a shiver to your spine. It keeps you guessing when something is going to jump into the frame from an angle and kill people on board. But the brilliance of the movie is in what it doesn't show. By this, I mean unlike other horror movies you don't see people running around, crying or screaming ( not that much anyway). Also, when the astronauts find the organism, they do not celebrate nor freak out. They act vary nonchalant like they come across these things all the time. And this, has saved a lot of time and helped the director and audience focus on the story.A lot of unnecessary scenes have been cut out. And there's your good friend Ridely, selflessly sparing you from all the fake screams and tears. At times you guess you are going to see some sentimental crying or other reactions, but it never happens. Well, crew members are scientists and not some clueless teenagers. Sometimes in comedies, actors act normally in funny situations which makes it even funnier. This technique has been applied here and if you ask me it has worked like a dream; a scary one too.Right at the beginning of the movie, the camera is roaming in the spacecraft which seems horrifyingly deserted. While we are curious to see some people or aliens, we reach a room in which astronauts are sleeping in their pods. And when the camera approaches the room, the automatic door goes up. This, throws the audience right to the spaceship. There is another scene in which the senior commander, frustrated to find a way to kill the monster, tries to get some answer form the computer brain of the craft called Mother( discover the irony yourself). He keeps asking about the creature but the computer has insufficient knowledge. Then with all his hope gone he types: 'What are my chances?'"
alindsayal,"Aug 20, 2024",7/10,"I am off to see Alien: Romulus tomorrow, so I thought it was about time to rewatch the film that started the franchise and the film that takes place before Alien: Romulus chronologically in Alien. So I watched it today and here is my review for a film considered a classic. The premise of the film sees a crew answer a distress call which ends up with them encountering a deadly lifeform.Main Character
Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley and she is great in this film. She is a strong character and is one of the most famous female lead characters of all time and this film introduces us to the awesome performance. She gets plenty of time to shine in this film and she was a great lead character.Supporting Characters
A young Ian Holm plays Ash and for me he is the most interesting member of the Nostromo crew and Holm absolutely nails it in the role. He is the science officer of the crew and there is just a lot of intrigue about his character and Holm really excels here.The rest of the crew are good and involve some big actors such as Tom Skerritt as Dallas & John Hurt as Kane. They are decent but their characters are never really fleshed out but they fill the roles well and do well with what they are given.The Alien itself is such an interesting design and I love how this film conveyed The Alien as a true threat to the crew and its lack of screen time actually added to that effect and made every time it does appear feel special.Story
The story does a really great job of showcasing a predator hunting down its prey and these humans really struggling to deal with it. There is another interesting story that comes into play in the film which is pretty interesting but isn't particularly the focus here. The issue is that the film doesn't really make you care too much about the majority of the characters and spends a bit too long building atmosphere and tone instead of a plot.Script
The script is fine, there are one or two scenes that are pretty memorable and have some good dramatic dialogue. But I never really felt the relationship between the characters and as I mentioned above I never really cared about anyone and the lack of interesting dialogue plays its part.Style
The film does a really great job of building tension and atmosphere. You have no idea when The Alien is going to strike next and the film really delves into its horror vibe in order to keep the viewer on edge. But, I have to be honest this film is really slow, especially for the first act. It takes way too long to get going and doesn't do enough in that build up to add to the complexity of the majority of the characters.Overall
Overall, Alien is a good film that nails its atmosphere and the objective that it wanted. I know it is probably a controversial opinion to say this film is a bit overrated but I kind of feel like it is, but it is still a good watch especially if you are a fan of horror.Rating - 7/10."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jan 10, 2006",9/10,"Usually I don't care for films that have nothing but unlikable characters and a lot of verbal blasphemy, but this was so well done that I just had to have this on a good DVD because I'll always watch this film every few years. It's just too interesting to ignore.The attractions are the incredible suspense; excellent photography and set design and memorable horror scenes. They didn't overdo the action scenes, either, as is so often the case with modern-day films. In fact, some of this might be too slow-moving for today's audience.The suspense, as crew members search for the killer alien, is almost unbearable at times and helps make up for the profane cast, all of whom are low-life people who would never be astronauts in real life. I personally applauded when Veronica Cartwright, who had one of the nastiest faces and mouths on screen, met her demise. The rest of the crew wasn't much classier. Since this movie came out, in fact, the sequels to this plus many other science fiction films seem to portray astronauts as trashy people which is the opposite of reality and just plain ludicrous.Anyway, Alien a memorable movie to anyone who has seen it. Who can ever forget the alien emerging from John Hurt's chest? That's a scene that stays with you forever. Others have tried to imitate the horror of that scene, but never quite been as successful.The restored DVD gives this 25-year-old film a new appearance. It looks fabulous and really highlights the great cinematography and superb direction by Ridley Scott. This is just great entertainment if you want to spend a night on the edge of your seat."
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Nov 27, 2023",7/10,"I wasn't crazy about Alien the first time I watched it, way back in high school. I've given it another shot on two occasions - including at a cinema tonight, done as part one of a double feature with 1986's Aliens - and though I'm able to appreciate Alien more now than when I was younger, I still don't love it.There is something missing for me, and I used to think it was just that I found the film slow, but I'm not sure that's it anymore. I know 2001: A Space Odyssey is even slower, and Blade Runner - another Ridley Scott sci-fi film - is also pretty patiently paced in parts, but I've come around to really love those ones.Something's just missing for me, with Alien. I can appreciate how simple it is, and how atmospheric it manages to be, and acknowledge its approach to very grounded characters who all have a believable dynamic (no romances or friendships or filmmaking 101 character arcs; they really do just feel like co-workers), but outside its most striking moments and scenes (those that do unfortunately get ruined by pop culture references, though that's not the film's fault), I do find myself thinking ""that's it?"" every time Alien ends.Hey, it's still good though. It's probably even great and I'm the crazy one who just can't get on its level. But it is one of those acclaimed and beloved classics that I can't really sink my teeth into, and it can be frustrating to feel left out of the club. I definitely like elements and scenes here, and the stuff I'm not crazy about, I can appreciate, but it just doesn't get to me on a level where I find it scary, intense, or particularly involving.But yeah, Alien is probably still the Emperor, and very much clothed, and I'm the delusional peasant who's unclothed, but still has just enough sense not to go and march into the town square and begin raving about how Alien has no clothes."

ddfcmp8,"Jun 7, 2006",10/10,"Now THIS is a horror movie, this is a Sci-Fi, this is a total action film with completely terrifying instances and unnerving happenings that plague one's thought for days, months, and even years before ever seeing it again. What else is there to say? I was so scared when viewing this film for the first time, and I screamed the whole way through it. The art design is so beautiful, and dark, but not dark as in black, it is dark toned, with all light colors such as yellow and green, casting a shadow over what we know as space. Something else that this film has, is the unpredictability of the unknown. I was shaky about it all with every moment, resulting in my screams. They weren't kidding when they said this was the scariest film ever, it is, but some people might have to see it to believe it."

scriptsprintcontect,"Sep 16, 2024",10/10,"A Sci-Fi Thriller Classic with intense moments!Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) stands as a towering achievement in the sci-fi horror genre, masterfully blending elements of both genres to deliver an experience that remains unparalleled. This film is not just a classic; it's a meticulously crafted, heart-pounding thriller that has influenced countless films and directors in its wake.The plot is deceptively simple yet incredibly effective: the crew of the commercial spaceship Nostromo, en route home, encounters an alien life form that systematically picks them off one by one. The film excels in its ability to create an atmosphere of dread and suspense, which is, in no small part, thanks to its brilliant screenplay and Scott's precise direction. The narrative's pacing is perfectly tuned, gradually building tension while keeping the audience on edge throughout its runtime.Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ellen Ripley is nothing short of iconic. Ripley is not your typical action hero; she's a character of depth, resilience, and intelligence, breaking away from the often one-dimensional roles afforded to women in genre films of the time. Weaver's performance, along with her strong screen presence, makes Ripley a character who endures long after the credits roll. The supporting cast, including Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, and Ian Holm, deliver strong performances that add to the film's depth and realism.The film's design elements are where Alien truly shines. H. R. Giger's design for the alien creature is both haunting and awe-inspiring. The alien's biomechanical aesthetics contribute to a palpable sense of otherworldly menace that is both disturbing and fascinating. The ship itself, with its claustrophobic, industrial look, adds to the tension and makes every scene feel like a confined battleground. Giger's work, combined with the film's atmospheric lighting and sound design, creates a setting where the fear of the unknown is as palpable as the fear of the alien.One of Alien's most significant achievements is its ability to maintain a gripping tension without relying heavily on overt violence or gore. The film's horror derives from the unknown, the unseen, and the slow, inevitable sense of dread that permeates every scene. This restraint in showing the monster directly enhances the impact of its reveal and reinforces the psychological terror that drives the narrative. The creature's few on-screen appearances are used sparingly but effectively, each moment intensifying the suspense.Additionally, Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score is integral to the film's atmosphere. The music complements the visual and narrative elements, amplifying the sense of isolation and impending doom. The score's minimalistic yet powerful composition enhances the film's chilling ambiance and keeps the viewer in a state of unease.While Alien is a masterpiece in many respects, it's not without its minor flaws. The film's slow pacing, particularly in the first half, might not cater to all viewers, especially those accustomed to faster-paced modern films. However, this deliberate pacing is part of what makes the film so effective, allowing the suspense to build naturally and the characters to be fleshed out before the horror unfolds.In conclusion, Alien remains a landmark in the sci-fi horror genre, offering a perfect blend of tension, atmosphere, and memorable performances. Ridley Scott's direction, combined with the contributions of a talented cast and crew, ensures that the film continues to be a compelling and influential work. It's a film that rewards patience and attention, making every moment of suspense and horror count. For those who appreciate the art of filmmaking and storytelling, Alien is a must-see, and its place in cinematic history is well-earned.Pros: Masterful direction, iconic creature design, strong performances, haunting score, atmospheric tension.Cons: Slow pacing may not suit all tastes."
eibon09,"Nov 16, 2001",N/A,"One of ten important science fiction films ever made with a gripping story, suspenseful situtations, sympathetic performances, and excellent artitect. Changed the way filmmakers in Hollywood and around the world saw at how Science Fiction films should be done.  Alien(1979), 2001:A Space Odyssey(1968), and Metropolis(1926) are the three most copied science fiction films since film was born.  Alien(1979) relies on the psychological reactions of the main people of Captain Dallas, Ripley, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash, and Parker.  In the order of what is the best to worst I would go with 1.Aliens(1986), 2.Alien(1979), 3.Alien3(1991), and 4.Alien 4(1998).The first film is a gothic thriller transported to space.  The designs by HR Giger are a marvel to look at.  Atmosphere and dread are two areas that are the film's strongest points.  Introduced the most famous female figure in a Scifi flick to the person of Ripley.  Early concepts in making the film had Ripley being a man but was changed to make the character a strong but vurnable woman.Inspiration for Alien(1979) is a combination of three films(It!The Terror from Beyond Space[1958], Planet of the Vampires[1966], and Shivers[1975]) which played an important role in the look, feel, mood, and situations of the film.  British flavored Scifi feature for obvious reasons.  Utilizes the music of Mozart to convey the sense of suspense and terror in the story. Mozart's ""Eline Kleine Nachtmusik"" enforces the cold, expecting, and unknown fear felt in the halls of the Nostromo ship.  There are scenes of chilling horror and anticipating terror within the plot.Written with a flair for the imagination by Dan O' Bannon.  Filled with brilliant moments like the alien popping out of the chest of Kane, the death of Brett, and the search in the alien ship where one of the crew members discovers piles of eggs.  In the original script there was a sex scene between Captain Dallas and Ripley that ended up not being filmed.  Its too bad such a scene wasn't done because it would have tighten the tension felt in the triangular relationship of Captain Dallas, Ripley, and Lambert. Also, this scene would explain why Lambert has some resentments towards Ripley.Sigourney Weaver plays the role that made her into a minor star and jump started her career as a serious female acting performer.  Before she became known as the female Rambo in her performance for the sequel, Aliens(1986). Alien(1979), Blade Runner(1982), and Legend(1984) are Ridley Scott's three film masterpieces of his film life.  Certainly a way superior film than Gladiator(2000).  One film that would be excellent in blending Science Fiction with Horror besides and after Alien(1979) is John Carpenter's The Thing(1982) except with a different appoarch."
Alessandro999,"Sep 20, 2025",7/10,"Even after years, in 2025, I never tire of rewatching this horror gem. Even though it's an ""old"" film, the jump scares are not lacking and the anxiety is high. By now this saga between TV series etc... This It takes you back to the best horror films of the century. By the way if you watch the latest movies this is many times better."

bluhmfamily,"Dec 18, 2010",7/10,"If you try to see how Sci-fi and a Horror movie would look like if they were mixed together, you would get Alien, everything about this movie kicks butt with no way to explain it whatsoever. This movie also shows that it takes place in 2037, the world probably just changed a little bit though.So the movie starts out with a space-mining crew waking up from years of rest, their ages have stayed the same. The crew find an unknown planet; they go there in hopes of finding iron ore. One of the men finds a room filled with mysterious eggs, he looks into one and suddenly a creature called a Facehugger clamps onto him. The crew studies the guy and cut one of the Facehugger's legs as it's acid blood drips down the decks. Later the Facehugger is off of the guy's face.Later, the guy goes in pain as an Alien Chestburster comes out of him and runs to the lower levels of the ship. Later when a guy finds the member Ripley's cat, the fully-grown alien comes up behind him and strikes him with it's inner-jaw. Ripley and the crew decide to hunt the alien down and kill it. The alien eventually kills the other crew members leaving only Ripley left.Ripley, thinking that the alien is still on the self-destructing ship, get's into a smaller ship and flies into space as the main ship explodes in the distance. Ripley prepares for another long sleep period until she finds out that the alien is on the ship.Ripley acts fast as she puts a astronaut suit on so the alien does not get D.N.A in her. She blows the alien out into space and burns it with the thrusters. Ripley then prepares for another years of sleep."
Alleycat77,"May 3, 2024",9/10,"Went tonight to see the 45th anniversary re-release of Alien in theaters tonight and it was quite a treat. It had a cool little interview before the movie with Ridley Scott and Fede Alvarez (the director of the upcoming Alien: Romulus) which I'm looking forward to seeing. I liked that Ridley Scott referred to the movie as a horror film a few times. Many people on the Internet classify it as sci-fi action, but I definitely think it's more of a horror film. I had never experienced Alien in the theater before and there were more than a few times that I was genuinely scared and totally creeped out with the atmosphere. And the jump scares actually worked (unlike many horror movies made these days). Had a great time and was pleasantly surprised to have the theater mostly full at about 85%. At least I wasn't the only one screaming out during those jump scares. So glad I got to see it on the big screen."
JohnJClements7,"Apr 18, 2021",10/10,"Ridley Scott gave us this terrifying piece of horror with few ingredients. A great and diverse cast, a scary monster and a menacing atmosphere. The film invokes fear of being trapped with little to no hope of escape and no one can forget the outstanding performance by Sigourney Weaver that was only leading to a better one. Best watched at midnight in the dark in silence..."
LanceHenriksenIsBAE,"Nov 26, 2021",10/10,"Thank God they gave it to her though. She was stunningly brilliant in this role, and there's a reason they can't stop making these things even all these years later. Alien set off a chain of so many sci-fi adventure/horror films that it truly did revolutionize the industry. The costumes are absolutely amazing too. Also, I feel like part of the reason Weaver's Ellen Ripley stands the test of time is because it wasn't originally written as some '70s stereotype of a woman by a man, and so when watching it today, it feels far more modern than maybe it otherwise would have."
sfarrelardan,"Oct 22, 2019",8/10,"This movie was definitely above your average sci-fi horror movie. It's not just a horror film where the crew of Nostromo is being hunted by an alien just because it just happens to be there. The introduction of the Alien feels organic and serves a reason.Alien delivers its scare through thoughtfully crafted environments, that are not just beautiful but sometimes nightmarish, and shots that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The Alien not just some scary being because it is strong, but because it is smart and menacing. Although the movie does employ some cheap jumpscares from time to time, it was definitely not overused. Additionally, some of its gore scenes are shot at odd angles making it quite difficult to see what goes on in the screen, although I believe this is mostly due to constraints for relying on mostly practical effects.Characters in the movie are well written and doesn't treat the audience as stupid. The actions they take make sense. Rather than their fate being tied to how stupid they are, their life depends on how they can outsmart or be outsmarted by the Alien.Nonetheless, the movie serves a provoking and thoughtful take on horror, something that many horror directors of the current age should take in to account. Definitely deserves to be a classic."
Berry55,"Aug 20, 2025",10/10,Alien is a classic horror which is iconic. The set design and cinematography was ahead of its time.The ship looked good even tho this was made in 1970. There is a sense of horror that you will feel in the final act.The story telling is great in the first two acts. The cast has done a great job.Even tho I am not from that generation but this movie is still a masterpiece to me.
