Proud_Canadian,"Sep 15, 2004",9/10,"I was fortunate to see it at the Toronto International Film Festival.Hotel Rwanda starred Don Cheadle and was directed by Terry George. It's based on a true event, about Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu who worked at four star hotel in Kigali. When the war broke out he thought of only saving his immediate family but as he saw what was happening he opened the hotel to Tutsi and Hutus seeking refuge from the killing. He used all the favours he had stored as manager of the hotel and basically saved over a thousand lives. This will be the next Schindler's list. When the film was over, there was a standing ovation. Don Cheadle was excellent as an ordinary man forced to do extra-ordinary things. Paul Rusesabagina and his family attended the screening and he received a five minute standing ovation. Even Michael Moore came to see this movie. I highly recommend it. 9/10."
anhedonia,"Feb 16, 2005",8/10,"At one point in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" our hero Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) asks an American TV reporter (Joaquin Phoenix) how the western world could not intervene after seeing scenes of women and children being hacked by machete-wielding Hutu militia.How could they not, indeed! As we all know, the west didn't intervene. Not surprising, really. After all, this was Africa and Rwanda had no oil reserves. The people being killed were innocent men, women and children, but they were poor and black.A few years ago, former President Bill Clinton apologized to Rwandans for not intervening during the 100-day massacre that saw about one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in the most barbaric manner. It was gracious of Clinton, but a fat lot of good his apology did to the people who were killed and their families.The Rwandan genocide - that's what it was, though western leaders split hairs over the meaning of genocide  also was a black mark on western nations, which simply got their citizens out of Rwanda and then remained indifferent to the senseless killings.Terry George's film gives us one story about the Rwandan genocide, of one hero, Paul, a savvy, clever and cunning manager of a swank, four-star Belgian hotel in the capital, Kigali. When the massacres began, Paul, a Hutu, sheltered more than 1,200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the hotel and saved them from the wrath of the bloodthirsty mobs.Working from a smart script by Keir Pearson and George, ""Hotel Rwanda"" contains gutwrenching and emotionally trying moments not seen on the big screen since ""Schindler's List"" (1993). But whereas Spielberg's masterpiece was more arty and artistic - and I don't mean that pejoratively - George's film seems more immediate. Maybe it's because we now see a similar slaughter of poor, downtrodden people in the Darfur region of Sudan and, again, western nations aren't doing much other than threatening to rap the knuckles of the bad guys like angry teachers. This crisis gives ""Hotel Rwanda"" a sense of urgency.As visceral as this film is at times, George handles everything in muted fashion. We never see the horrors firsthand. There's brief news footage of people being killed and one particularly searing scene when Paul and his bellhop Gregoire (Tony Kgoroge) find themselves on a bumpy road. The moment's made more horrifying because George unveils it quite matter-of-factly.Making a PG-13 film about genocide requires numerous compromises. Putting most, if not all, of the violence off-camera is one such bargain George made. True, a closer look at the massacre would have rightly tortured us. But the film, nevertheless, works without gruesome moments. Pearson and George set out to make a story of heroism, survival, love and compassion amid the madness. And they succeeded.Cheadle carries the entire film. There isn't a false note in his performance. For years, he's turned in one superb performance after another. He's one of those actors who never hits it wrong and whose performances always stand out even if the films themselves aren't all that memorable. Here, he's in equal measure the smooth manager, man with a conscience and frightened husband and father. You can sense Paul's frustration, though Cheadle rarely displays any vulnerability.He gets great support from Sophie Okonedo as Paul's Tutsi wife, Tatiana, and Nick Nolte doing his best work in years as a Canadian United Nations officer, Colonel Oliver. Okonedo and Cheadle are utterly believable as a couple. They have one traumatic scene on the hotel roof, a quietly powerful moment that tugs at our heartstrings as we watch two people who love each other try to deal with what could happen. Okonedo conveys anger, fear and pain without ever turning the moment sentimental or needlessly overwrought. That's why the moment's shattering.""Hotel Rwanda"" isn't flawless. George doesn't harshly indict the west for its indifference. Also, some scenes, especially one near the film's end, seem staged for obvious dramatic effect, to play with our sense of sympathy and dread. But minor faults can easily be forgiven because the rest of the film works so well, never sensationalizing any moment. The film's straightforward approach gives it more power, makes it more trenchant and meaningful.I would like to believe that we learn from history and the more powerful western nations will always come to the aid of oppressed people everywhere. But we're doing little in Darfur and although President George W. Bush openly touts his vision to spread liberty and democracy to oppressed peoples everywhere, I doubt he actually means it. After all, this freedom doctrine was something he created only after his initial justification for waging an unjust war - Iraq's supposed stockpiles of WMD - proved to be wholly without merit or fact. I doubt he actually considers bringing liberty to places like Zimbabwe or Burma. He speaks of the need for people to be free, conveniently ignoring some dictatorial nations - Pakistan and Turkmenistan, for instance - because they happen to be our allies. And so the dumb foreign policy continues.I can only hope the success of ""Hotel Rwanda"" will prompt other gutsy screenwriters and filmmakers to tell us more stories about the horrors that took place and the complacency of industrialized nations that could have helped and chose not to."

Paul gets to protect his family and unfortunate refugees at the hotel but others hapless people by the hundred are coming to ask for help. Meanwhile, the refugees Tutsis flee toward Congo to find shelter .The film has an acid critic to the indolence of United Nations (exception for Colonel incarnated by Nick Nolte) and international community and specially , the abandon of the European foreign policy .An interesting and thought-provoking film depicting terrible happenings and based on historical facts . Thus, a character tells that origin conflict is due to Belgians whom in colonization time differentiated the Tutsi as highest and more white complexion and co-governed united the country, now the Hutu are taking the vengeance. It's calculated in the indiscriminate massacre were cruelly killed by militia Interhamwe approximately one million people and in only three month. The bloody conflict finished in 1994 when the Tutsi throw out the Hutu army and militia through the frontier Congo. Leader of Interhamwe was condemned to maxim penalty. Don Cheadle's interpretation is magnificent , he was nominated to Academy Award , although wrongly didn't obtain it . The motion picture well directed by Terry George. Rating : Awesome and above average . Indispensable and essential watching."
larajane,"Dec 19, 2004",10/10,"Anything I say in this review is probably redundant, because there isn't a single negative review in all the comments so far here, and I agree wholeheartedly with what has been said by other reviewers.Nevertheless Hotel Rwanda is that rare kind of movie experience that doesn't easily relinquish its hold on the audience just because the credits have rolled. Watching with a friend, after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in Rwanda were. So to my shame, we had to read on the internet about what really happened, before we could continue. I say shame because we should have known, both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.The film is beautifully understated, eschewing sentimentality in favour of raw emotion and letting the story tell itself. The acting was flawless - Don Cheadle's breathtaking performance being a particular standout - and the direction didn't falter, despite all the potential pitfalls of dramatising a recent and horrific conflict. The scenes which were hardest to watch in terms of tension and violence were often suffused with humour and hope.It's difficult sometimes to separate the significance of the true story, from the artistry of the product, and often I get impatient with 'worthy' movies scoring big at Oscar time because it seems as though important stories ought to be rewarded, whether or not they make good films. However, I can't recall being so profoundly moved by a film since I saw The Grey Zone, and I hope Hotel Rwanda gets all the plaudits it deserves."
schicky,"Jan 6, 2005",N/A,"The only comment I can give about this movie is - SEE IT. It's one of the most heart wrenching, yet beautiful movies I've ever seen. I really hope Don Cheadle and the movie receive Oscars! The acting is superb and the fact this is based upon a true story only makes it better. You may need some Kleenex as I was overwhelmed for a large part of this movie.I had the honor of seeing this movie at a preview screening with the real ""Paul"" and his wife attending - what an absolute amazing experience to be in their presence. This movie will make you rethink everything about what it means to be human and how much we need to think about all our neighbours in this world.Don't miss it!"
Julia-Gefter,"Dec 9, 2004",10/10,"I have never been so touched by a movie. It was the hardest movie I have ever sat through but also the best. it's so easy to ignore human rights abuses if they are not happening to you or your family, but just because you ignore it, they are still happening. i hope this movie receives the praise it deserves. i am frustrated because nothing i can type can represent how powerful this movie is or how much it moved me. i can't comment on the amazing acting or cinematography or directing because the movie transported me. i did not think about the making of the movie but rather sat shocked and horrified and nauseated and inspired. there was the red cross agent. there were heroes and while human nature perverts and the thin veil of culture unravels, there is still good. i have to look at the good of the heroes in the movie and of the people that wrote the movie, and realize that going to the movies doesn't have to be about escapism. it can be about reality. this is a must-see, not because it will make you laugh but because it will make you think and feel."
Surecure,"Nov 9, 2004",10/10,"I was fortunate to see this film at the Toronto Film Festival. I had heard nothing about this film before I read up on it in the Fest guide and originally was going to see something else. But, the subway happened to shut down and I was not going to be able to see the film I originally intended. So, I decided to give this a try.And I am so very glad I did.This film is by far the best drama I have seen all year, and indeed was the best film of the 11 I saw at the festival. It is gripping, heart-wrenching, and opens your eyes to so many things. Don Cheadle -- who I am a long time admirer of his work -- is phenomenal in the lead role, and I hope that he is nominated for Best Actor this year, because he certainly deserves it.I am recommending this film to everybody I know and I hope that it gets a wide distribution because it certainly is a film that needs to be seen. While comparisons can be made to Schindler's List, I think that this film goes further to show that events like the Holocaust can happen any time -- even now -- so long as people look away, just as the UN did in Rwanda. It certainly makes one think about how easy it is for us to forget our history and allow it to be repeated, because (as one character says) we will watch it on TV, say that it is terrible, and go right on eating our dinner. 10/10"
celicaricky,"Dec 9, 2004",10/10,"Just saw the San Francisco premier last night and it isn't a dramatization - it's much more of a documentary -- Hotel is extremely factual. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS FILM! INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE!The Director and the story's protagonist were at the screening to answer questions. We ovated him for almost 10 minutes. Near the end of the q&a, an older man stood up and was called on. Slowly he commented that as a Tutsi, the movie gave him a lot to think about and that it may now be possible to find peace in his heart. The audience was stunned. And believe me, it takes a lot to silence a San Francisco audience.One last comment, the film is indpendently made and distributed - no Hollywood involvement at all (Terry George is British). There will be no machine pumping out ads and radio anouncements about this one. Help get the word out - great film!"
Bambikilled,"Jun 6, 2012",6/10,"This is a good movie. That can't be denied. But it is also the polished PG-13 version of one of the most horrifying events in modern history. Every little bit of information about the Rwandan genocide, that can find its way to the knowledge of people, is of course precious, and for that I am happy that this movie was made and brought lights to the topic in a way that regrettably not even the actual genocide could do. BUT... (And this is a big BUT.)This movie, has IMO never been able to fully depict the absolute horror of the genocide in Rwanda. It is not about the amounts of blood on the screen, nor the number of bodies in piles in the frames. It's about how you close up to the subject. And nothing in this movie makes me relive the anguish and emotional trauma which I felt when I was in Rwanda, some 8 yrs after the genocide. I have seen the scarred remains of a country trying to build itself up from the ashes. I've seen the mass graves, the Gacaca courts, the thousands and yet thousands of convicted perpetrators in their pink uniforms, working the fields. I have been to the survivors center and I have seen the thousands of skulls lying in N'tarama Church. What does ""Hotel Rwanda"" make me feel? Not very much. (As a note - I have also been to ""Mille Collines"". Which was a rather bizarre feeling, that luxury in the midst of poor Kigali.) This movie is just a little bit too detached from the reality as it was, to get to you in the way that the story of the genocide really does, if told in another way. Sure, I can see that people who have not known much about the Rwandan genocide, can get very emotionally affected by the movie, and I do too, of course. But, I still think that this movie makes a quite a shallow impression compared with other movies on the topic. Of course, I wasn't there when it actually happened, but when you have seen the mayhem after it with your own eyes, it's still different to when you haven't.AND ALSO - the thing that bugs me the most is the fact that Paul Rusesabagina really isn't quite the hero the world seems to think him to be. Did you know that the man ""sold"" shelter to the refugees coming to Mille Collines? The ones with money got in, the ones without, didn't. So the people who survived thanks to Rusesabagina were mainly very rich. Of course it's good that they survived, but what about the ones with no money. Rusesabagina did good, yes. But is he a hero? No. The heroes were the families who hid their neighbors, the UN-soldiers who desperately tried to get word out to the the rest of the world and get military task forces in, but were ignored and left to see the slaughter with tied hands. The people who risked their own lives to try to save others. The soldiers of the RPF, who were the ones who stopped this madness. Never believe everything you see in a movie without trying to get the full picture.No... if you are interested in this horrific but engaging chapter of modern history, and wish to know more about the shameful way in which the UN and the rest of the world handled the whole thing, I strongly recommend you to watch some other stuff. Like the best movie made about the Rwandan genocide: ""Shooting dogs"", which is much more likely to get you to understand the event in a more broad way, as well as give a much more deep emotional experience. ""Shake hands with the devil"" is a very well made TV-production about one of the true heroes from Rwanda 1994 - Roméo Dallaire. (On which Nolte's character in ""Hotel Rwanda"" was loosely based). There is also a very good documentary with the same name - ""Shake hands with the devil - the journey of Roméo Dallaire"". Also, there are some other movies on the topic - of which ""Sometimes in April"" is the best. I recently saw ""Kinyarwanda"", which was very good from some aspects."
RickyThind,"Dec 16, 2004",10/10,"I have just seen this film and have to say I am deeply moved by it. The premise of the film is about one mans struggle to do the right thing at when everything around him is going wrong.Don Cheadle is the best African American actor out there. His passion and heart was so strong that moved me almost to tears. There is a definite wish here to let this story to be known to the world.Its powerful and provocative in its indirect and subtle jabs at the west for not intervening into such a horror that took place in Rwanda.Very well made and directed. Please see this and let it inspire you as it did me - to try cultivate selfless actions.Thanks, Ricky Thind"
planktonrules,"Jan 20, 2014",10/10,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is an incredibly sad sort of film. After all, during 1994 between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were murdered--mostly Tutsis hacked to death due to an insane tribal rivalry with the more numerous Hutus. Genocide is not pleasant viewing. However, the film is a bit easier to watch than it could be, as most of the scenes of the slaughter are pretty tame. This isn't really a complaint--it doesn't deny the killings but it also doesn't show a lot of hacked off limbs and bodies (though there are quite a few of the latter). I appreciate how the MPAA changed their minds and re-rated the film PG-13 instead of R, as R would seem to imply that it's not a film for a wide audience. Folks should see this film.Instead of ""Hotel Rwanda"" showing the violence in a general fashion, it focuses on a very brave man. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) was the man who ran the swank Hotel Rwanda around the time of the genocide. In a very brave move, he opened the hotel to the Tutsi (who were being massacred) and created a tenuous safe haven. However, when the UN pulled out (as the UN did what it usually does in these situations...NOTHING!), Rusesabinga had to learn on the fly to work with the ruling powers, the mobs and the few remaining UN troops (though most had left). Rusesabinga managed to not only save his family (his wife was Tutsi and children half-Tutsi) but 1200 people through his heroics. The film shows the way he connived and begged and worked to make this possible in the midst of Hell.The film is a high quality and well made product. Not surprisingly it's on the IMDb Top 250 list and it also was nominated for three Oscars (including one for Cheadle who sure sounded African to my untrained ears). And, not surprisingly, it's an awfully tough film to watch. I don't recommend it for very young audiences but folks need to see this film and realize we have not come that far as a world. And, it's sad the film and other films about Rwanda during this period didn't come out until a decade after the massacres. It also makes you realize just how far from its original charter the UN has gone--it SHOULD have been able to take a stand against such evil."
hrdefender,"Sep 17, 2005",7/10,"The historical errors in the film Hotel Rwanda will unfortunately go unnoticed by the average viewer. While the film is not billed as a documentary, the director has neglected to provide any disclaimers for the cinematic manipulation of factual events--a manipulation which is all too obvious to those who know the history of the country well.One of the most glaring errors in the film seems to be due to the cinematic compression of time, which is often unavoidable when attempting to simplify complex events for a general audience. The General portrayed in the film, Augustin Bizimungu, did not in fact hold that position (as Army Chief of Staff) until 3 weeks after the genocide. The actual Chief of Staff at the time, Deogratias Nsabimana, was aboard the President's plane that was mysteriously downed on April 6 (no one has claimed responsibility for this crash since, although evidence points increasingly toward the country's current President, Paul Kagame, as the man who gave the order to fire the 2 missiles that brought it down). There were, in fact, 10 people on the plane, including 2 French pilots. In addition, the airplane was a gift from Francois Mitterand. Both of these facts truly call in to question the current Rwandan government's suggestions that the French military is the entity responsible for downing the plane (which in essence, qualifies as an act of terrorism under many international legal instruments).This last statement should not, however, be interpreted as an attempt to excuse the grave mistakes that the French did make in its Operation Turquoise.Immediately after the plane crash, which is commonly referred to as the 'trigger' that touched off the genocide, a man named Marcel Gatsinzi was named to replace Nsabimana. 3 weeks later, A. Bizimungu was named to take over the post. (Before the plane crash, Bizimungu even lacked the credentials necessary to become a general, which makes the film's portrayal of him as such even more inaccurate.) Gatsinzi, a Hutu, is now employed in the current government of Rwanda, which is dominated by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (the army that is credited with stopping the genocide).The film further neglects to mention--not even by providing a paragraph of text that could enlighten the audience further--that the Rwandan Patriotic Front was responsible for targeted killing of tens of thousands of Hutu civilians (especially those from the North of the country) during its invasion into Rwanda in October 1990 (which instigated the civil war that preceded the genocide), as well as ""after"" the genocide and in the years immediately following (particularly 1997-98). The RPF currently enjoys considerable impunity for its war crimes and the crimes against humanity it has committed, and acknowledges only selected crimes.Despite the film's compression of time, and the ahistorical consequences that arise from this, the film does provide a powerful, well-acted glimpse into an isolated part of the horror that engulfed Rwanda in 1994.For more information about the economic roots of the genocide, read Chapter 10 ('Malthus in Africa') of Jared Diamond's best-selling book ""Collapse."" For more information about the genocide in practical and political terms, read ""Leave None to Tell the Story"" by Alison Des Forges (Human Rights Watch publication): http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/ Finally, if you are really serious about understanding the full context of the 1994 genocide and its international political dimensions, familiarize yourself with the research of scholars Rene Lemarchand and Filip Reyntjens (available in English)."
mcdublin,"Feb 24, 2006",5/10,"The only possible explanation I can think of for the high regard and score for this film is that people are reviewing the theme, or the intentions, rather than the movie itself.I found the script incredibly puerile. I felt embarrassed for the actors having to say lines like ""How can people be so cruel?"" or Joaquin Phoenix exclaiming ""I feel so ashamed"" because a porter holds an umbrella over his head.It was no surprise to learn that the writer, an editor, wrote it in his spare time, and had not written anything before. There are no rounded characters, only mouthpieces for the humanitarian message that the writers are trying to convey.The story is decent enough, and there are some effective scenes such as a convoy of vehicles driving into an ambush, but all of these play better with the sound down. The dialog was more suited to a Steven Seagal action movie than a fact-based movie with serious pretensions. The director resorted too easily to slushy music to tell the audience how to feel. And the characters were paper-thin: the hero who loves children and animals, the angelic aid worker, the cowardly bad guys.Given the subject matter, this review will probably come across as mealy-mouthed and uncharitable. But this is a site for reviewing movies, not causes."
wl323,"Jan 4, 2005",N/A,"I have no doubt that this is the only movie for the past year that can get me totally, if not 101%, emotionally involved. For other movies, I might be interacting with the story a lot , say associating my personal experiences with the characters, making judgment on them, criticizing the development of the story, ways of expression, the cinematography, acting, etc. BUT, Hotel Rwanda simply took me over as I was watching it. My emotion was going along with Paul ( Don Cheadle) all the time. The director did a great great job in capturing the feelings of people facing uncertainty, horror, ridicules, anger, death, waning faith... Family, life and dignity/integrity become the largest things in the situation. What's more is that it squarely shows the realist thinking in international politics.It honestly shows the weakness or helplessness of the UN and the non-governmental organizations. It truthfully tells how indifferent most of the international community (or individuals, which may or may not include you and me) are towards the deprivation of social justice taking place in other parts of the world. It makes you question to what extent that it is true to say what we see ( the sufferings in the world) is what we tolerate. It shows you how monstrous human being can be. It scares you how sanity would fail. At the same time, the uglier the people become, the more beautiful you find those who have managed to keep brave and maintain humanity. The movie fully succeeds in showing me the spirit, faith, and compassion that the world is dreaming for."
lee_eisenberg,"Jul 21, 2005",10/10,"""Hotel Rwanda"" recreates the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in the same way that ""Schindler's List"" recreated the genocide against the Jews. The movie shows not only the massacre, but also how the international community did nothing to stop it. Hotel owner Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) sheltered several Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the Mille Collines hotel, saving them from getting murdered.Right after I saw the movie, I attended a speech by the real Paul Rusesabagina at Lewis & Clark College. He explained how the Belgian colonization of Rwanda set the stage for the 1994 genocide (the Belgians put the minority Tutsis in power, completely disenfranchising the majority Hutus), and what it was like for him experiencing it. As for why specifically the international community did nothing to stop the massacre, Rusesabagina said (as a mild joke): ""Maybe it's because Rwanda doesn't have oil."" Anyway, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a very powerful movie that reminds us not only of this specific event, but about what can happen if we forget the past. I recommend it to everyone."
RosalindChick,"Feb 8, 2005",10/10,"I'm a college freshman at a small school in New York taking a class on the individuals role and responsibility in community. We read the book ""We'd like to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families"" about the Rwandan genocide and then went to see this movie. It is very accurate about what happened but reading it is just not the same as seeing it, it seemed horrendous always but when I actually saw the movie it was just... Jesus... it's so hard to believe that this happened and that this could. The film was excellent in both execution and portrayal. Everyone must see this movie and know we are all human beings and it is our responsibility to be there for each other. Jesus Christ... this can not happen."
rooprect,"Aug 18, 2013",8/10,"What were you doing in 1994? I was probably rockin to Soundgarden's latest album on my portable CD player, waiting for Seinfeld to come on while pondering the OJ Simpson murder case, the ""news of the century.""Meanwhile, as many as one million people were being butchered with machetes, raped and tortured by their fellow humans, as an entire nation collectively lost its mind.Suddenly Seinfeld ain't so funny.This film is epic, if for the sole reason that it brings to light a horrific chapter of human history that many of us would otherwise know nothing of. Let me repeat: as many as 1 million people (the population of North Dakota and Wyoming combined) were slaughtered, and the politicians of the western world did nothing to stop it, and the media never gave it 1/1000th as much air time as OJ. Yes, it is a disturbing film, but it focuses on the brave struggle of one individual in his efforts to save as many lives as possible. So it is also a very inspiring film.To be honest I was too engrossed in the story to be able to review this movie on technical merits such as acting, cinematography, musical score, etc. I believe that is the way to watch this film; it is not a film, it is an experience. A lesson. A reminder that, while we live our comfortable lives in 1080p HD Blu-Ray comfort, we have no clue what is going on with ""the other half"".I will say that every performance was very convincing, and several scenes could be called poetic if they weren't so disturbing (I'm referring to the river road in the fog... but you'll see what I mean). I was instantly pulled in by Don Cheadle as the ""everyman"" hero of the story, and I was equally intent on supporting cast members such as Nick Nolte whose character was based on Canadian general Dallaire (even though the real Dallaire was never consulted about this film).It's crazy, but you'll have to keep reminding yourself that this story is real, even though its plot is as preposterous as the craziest Hollywood fiction you've seen.This is a film I highly recommend to people who like to get involved. Whether you're a political activist, whether you volunteer walking dogs at your local animal shelter, or whether you blog about life in general, this is a film for you. Yes, it will upset you. But I think in the end it will get you stoked to get out there and change this damaged world."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jul 8, 2011",10/10,"Hotel Rwanda was one of those films I initially put off seeing for reasons I don't really know, but after seeing it that decision is one of those decisions that I've regretted as it turned out to be one of the better films I've seen in a while now. Hotel Rwanda is beautifully shot and the scenery is striking while still being authentic without being too clean. The story is always compelling and powerful, with plenty of gut-wrenching and poignant moments while never feeling preachy. The film is excellently directed and scripted too, while Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Pheonix and particularly Don Cheadle give superb acting performances. Overall, a truly fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
moviemanMA,"Jul 9, 2005",9/10,"For a while now, there have been uprisings in Africa, most of the time, it is quite violent. In Tears of the Sun starring Bruce Willis, the problem in Nigeria was put into perspective. It was shown through the eyes of the US military trying to rescue a couple of select people but end up bringing back refugees. Hotel Rwanda takes a different path, shown through the eyes of those under attack.Hotel Rwanda is based on a true story out of Rwanda, Africa. It is a country gripped by war and oppression. When a four-star hotel is now thrown right into the mix of things, manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) has to make a very important decision. He must decide whether or not to let Tutsi's live in his hotel to take refuge from the Hutu soldiers.The problem is that the Hutu's, a tribe of Africans in Rwanda, are taking control and want to exterminate the Tutsis, a rival tribe. This hostile take over is one that spreads all over Paul's town. One night over a radio broadcast, the Hutu militia's leader told all of his soldiers to find and eliminate the Tutsis. Now, Paul, his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi, and their children must stay in the hotel and watch over all of the ""new guests"". With Paul paying off the leader of the Hutu militia, General Bizimungu, he tries to keep his hotel out of harms way.When he runs out of ideas and aid from the General and from the United Nations, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), and the media, he must defend his hotel by finding a way to get those refugees out of there and keep his family safe at the same time. Paul is faced with heart breaking decisions and must stay strong so he doesn't show weakness or give up the Tutsis.Cheadle's performance is breathtaking. When everything seems to be coming apart and he might lose it, he has to hold it together. Cheadle's character sees things that shouldn't be seen by anyone. So much death and destruction in one area can have an impact on a man. With scenes that are similar to Schindler's List, this movie is powerful and really shows how little people have known about the crisis in Rwanda.Hotel Rwanda was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Actor (Cheadle), Best Supporting Actress (Okonedo), and Best Original Screenplay. Although it didn't win, the movies message was carried across and brought attention to the devastation in Africa.Hotel Rwanda is a masterpiece and is one of the most moving films of all time. It leaves nothing behind and shows you everything. It will be looked at for years to come. Hotel Rwanda opens will open your eyes."
The_Void,"Mar 14, 2005",6/10,"Sentimental dramas are not my thing, but after the good reviews that Hotel Rwanda has been winning itself; I figured it has to be worth a go, and it was; but that's all it's worth. For a film that's supposed to 'stay with you' and 'leave an impact'; Hotel Rwanda is a huge disappointment. There isn't much in this film that wouldn't be able to be took from a documentary on the subject of the plight of Rwanda; but it has to be said, in spite of this, that Hotel Rwanda balances it's story with the human drama rather well, as not too much time is ever spent on either. The film can easily be likened to a disaster movie, as it gives two sides of a story - one being a terrible happening and the other being the effect on the people involved. This likeness continues when you come to realise that the protagonists are totally uninvolving characters and the only reason that the film gives you for feeling for them is the fact that they're the leads. Hotel Rwanda will get praise from some people because it's based on a true story, but this film fan isn't as easily impressed as many evidently are.The film is very well put together, with the acting, direction and production values all being very classy examples of how good each can be. The story takes in themes of the futility of war, love for your fellow man and, of course, the race divide (another reason for the good critical reaction), and it has to be said that all of these things are done well, and even quite potent at times. The film is also notable for avoiding many of the pitfalls that befall most dramas of this nature - things such as over the top sentiment or long, heartfelt speeches. While the film definitely has an underbelly of sentiment, it never sees fit to fully expose it; and that is always a good thing in my opinion. The film is keen to give glimpses of it at it at times, however, and these moments tend to be cringe-worthy. The ending is a prime example of that; and despite the fact that this is based on a true story and that's simply 'how it ends'; the film could have handled it better, and then I wouldn't have left the cinema feeling like I'd just been slapped in the face after spending two hours of my time on the film.On the whole, Hotel Rwanda is a long shot away from being a 'bad' film; but it's not a great film either, and the lack of sympathy for the characters will make some people feel like they should have watched a straight documentary instead. Many have, and will continue to be seduced by the racism theme and the fact that it's based on a true story; but not me, and hopefully not you either, as there's more to a great film than just that."
jotix100,"Mar 19, 2005",10/10,"The madness one sees in this brilliant film is hard to imagine, yet it occurred in Rwanda. Terry George, the director, captures those terrible days in Rwanda in his film ""Hotel Rwanda"". Mr. George has to be commended for bringing to the screen a detailed account of a country in chaos. Working with Keir Pearson on the screen play, the director presents us with the horrors of what the country lived during the holocaust that befell Rwanda.At the center of the story is Paul Rusesabagina, a courageous man who witnessed first hand the worst days of the Hutu rebellion and its bloody aftermath. This man alone was able to protect and to save more than a thousand Rwandans that clearly would not be around today, had it not been for his tremendous stand against people that showed no mercy, or wouldn't reason about what they were doing to their fellow citizens.The performance of Don Cheadle, as Paul Rusesabagina, is worth the price of admission! This wonderful actor projects such an intelligence that it's hard to find in any American film released in 2004. Mr. Cheadle was right to portray this man; it was a role he was born to play. Mr. Cheadle got under the skin of the hotel manager and runs away with the film. It's hard to keep ones eyes from this commanding performance.The rest of the mostly black cast is excellent. One must single out Sophie Okoneko, who plays Paul's wife with such dignity that she perfectly matches Mr. Cheadle's performance. Nick Nolte is fine as the UN Colonel trying to keep peace in a place gone mad.Congratulations to Mr. George. With this film he touches us in more ways than we imagined. The unfortunate tragedy could well have been avoided if the international community would have intervened sooner, but obviously, it didn't even try until it was too late."
doug1984,"Jul 13, 2005",7/10,"I finally saw Hotel Rwanda and I thought it was good, not great, and not terrible. I agree that you didn't get the FULL horror of the genocide but I think there certainly was a sufficient amount of brutality to get what occurred across; scenes like the one on the foggy road were very disturbing.What annoyed me more than any problems I had with the movie was the level of pretension in some comments I read (this one not excluded). Where are the, ""the scene where Don Cheadle is shirtless was hot"" posts? Instead, I just see people writing ""I am better than everyone because I know what REALLY happened"" under the veil of a leading questions like, ""I liked the movie a lot BUT I would like people to share their thoughts on if the film's distortion of reality was justifiable in that it led to the ends of greater mass appeal?"" Hmmmm."
davidjparris,"Mar 31, 2022",1/10,"This movie is an utter disgrace, falsely based on the antics of a supposedly ''hero'' of the Rwanda Genocide. As a film it does have a feel good thing going but as history it is a self serving, tissue of lies. In fact this Hutu ''hero'' was responsible for the death and blackmail of many Tutsis. He is now living in the US, a very rich man, making a fortune as a speaker by retelling these lies. If I could I would give this film no stars ."
neverwasastar,"Feb 15, 2005",10/10,"This movie is so brilliant and powerful. I think this movie will make viewers want to do something and take action where it is needed, locally or globally. It makes the viewers question, ""Where were we about eleven years ago (I was about five or six years old) and why didn't we help?"" and ""How can people be so cruel?"" I can believe people are that cruel but at the same time I can't believe it. It is very touching and very moving and hopefully it will open eyes to the trouble around the world. The message of this movie needed to be delivered to America and this movie delivers it excellently. This movie deserves to win ""Best Picture"" of the year. This movie will make you think. I don't think anyone could walk away from this movie unchanged."
blueskybird16,"Feb 26, 2005",10/10,The movie was brilliant I had to see it for history class and I learned a lot. I wanted to see the movie Don Chedle is brilliant and is great at this particular role. His wife was great as well. This is a Must see movie. It will take you back to when Rwanda was in trouble and no one came to help except one guy who sheltered 1000 Tutsis and is a hero of Rwanda. It was sad though because it was a war and a lot of people died. Very educational and a good lesson to learn about peace and war. The movie was so great but very sad I cried and I am writing an essay on the movie. I also want to see it again. It was so good and there is a lesson to be learned about helping and keeping peace between people. I felt very sorry for the people of Rwanda who lost family members.
Red-125,"Feb 5, 2005",10/10,"Hotel Rwanda (2004) Directed by Terry George, is the great film of 2004.Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, an African who has bought into the European ideal of the perfect life. He's the manager of a four-star hotel in Rwanda. He has a beautiful wife (played by Sophie Okonedo), handsome and healthy young children, a new vehicle, and a fine suburban home.All this changes when civil strife erupts in Rwanda. When this happens the former colonial powers wash their hands of the problems, and the Rwandans are left to fend for themselves in an atmosphere of increasing violence and anarchy.The acting is excellent and the story is emotionally gripping. Like Schindler's List, the film follows one man's attempt to save as many people as he can. Schindler and Rusesabagina were heroic, resourceful, and amazingly effective. However, as individuals, they could accomplish only so much. Outside intervention could have saved a million lives in Rwanda, but it was never forthcoming. The Rwandan genocide is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century. Hotel Rwanda brings this horror onto the screen and into our lives.Addendum: Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, the U.N. commander in Rwanda. This role is obviously based on Lieutenant General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian officer who commanded the ridiculously small force of 400 U.N. soldiers. These troops were unable to do anything more than watch the genocide taking place before their eyes. General Dellaire's story is told in Steven Silver's film ""The Last Just Man."""
FilmOtaku,"Feb 28, 2005",8/10,"""Hotel Rwanda"" gives a first-hand account of the genocide that occurred between the two main tribes in Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is the manager of a luxury hotel in the area that caters to the wealthy and to government figures. Outside of the gates of the resort, Tutsis are being killed by the Hutu militia, and though Paul (a Hutu) is married to Tatiana (Okonedo) (a Tutsi) for the sake of his family, he turns a blind eye until his in-laws disappear and the militia literally come to his doorstep demanding his cooperation and the surrender of his wife, children and neighbors. With the diplomacy that he has learned in his job he is able to barter with them, basically paying a great deal of money for the lives of his family and neighbors. Meanwhile, Col. Oliver (Nolte), who is with the United Nations, is trying to help the refugees and keep some semblance of order, but is forced to evacuate only the Caucasian residents of the hotel, leaving all of the Rwandans (both Tutsi and Hutus that are Tutsi sympathizers) to fend for themselves, which leads Paul to open the hotel to over 1,000 Tutsi refugees. There they try desperately to get out of the country, and ultimately, survive since the Hutu militia is now targeting any sympathizers as well.From about fifteen minutes into ""Hotel Rwanda"", I was pretty upset, and that feeling didn't go away once. Don Cheadle is incredibly good as a conflicted hero. Many comparisons have been made between this film and ""Schindler's List"", but if there is a way to rate levels of heroship, Paul Rusesabagina as portrayed in the film is pretty high up there. He is repeatedly given the chance to escape unharmed, but never gives in, a big turnaround from the beginning of the film when he first turned a blind eye, then became a reluctant hero. Cheadle captures this complicated figure brilliantly. It's not just the superficial coups that he achieves (flawless accent, etc.) it is the subtle strength he gives the character. His character may not be a beloved singer or a good impersonation of someone, but the strength of his performance should have given him an Oscar, not just a nomination. (Though I am glad that he at least got that much.) This is the first film that I have seen Sophie Okonedo act in, and she also extremely good. She quickly shows that she is more than a pretty face, and her strength and mettle are admirable, while experiencing the worst atrocities first hand.As a film, ""Hotel Rwanda"" was not manipulative emotional. Under Terry George's direction, it felt at times like a documentary because it was truly an unblinking look at a terrible and shameful time in history. Though I had heard about the genocide, I was not fully aware of the ""reasons"" for the war, and as completely ridiculous as they were, the film is excellent at providing us a lesson in recent history without commentary. As far as I can tell, this is a pretty level look at the conflict and while it was incredibly emotional, it was not preachy. While I mention that it had an almost documentary feel to it, which is not to say that there were dramatic moments. One moment in particular where I literally felt like I was going to be sick was when Paul (in what was probably his defining moment) encounters literally hundreds of dead bodies on a road that he and one of his hotel employees are traveling. Having said that, however, even a moment like this one was managed with care and subtlety by George.I was telling some co-workers about the film and its emotional impact and a couple of them who hadn't seen it went, ""Gee  that sounds too depressing for me"". ""Hotel Rwanda"" is certainly not a cheerful film, it is a film about a conflict that ended the lives of one million people in a matter of months while most of the world turned a blind eye. But it amazingly ends on a note that did not make me want to find the nearest closed garage and turn on the car, and left me with a newly found understanding of something I had only heard about and until Saturday night, knew nothing about. ""Hotel Rwanda"" is not an easy film to watch, but it is really and truly an excellent film that should be seen, both for its impactful storytelling and for its command performances. 8/10 --Shelly"
liston15,"Dec 6, 2005",6/10,"Hotel Rwanda is all right, but it is only all right and certainly does not merit the praise that has been heaped on it. It is true that is it has given a new audience to the terrible atrocities of 1994, but this does not get away from the fact that it is only a slightly above average film. If anything, it should have been easier to make a great film because of the power of the story, but instead of letting the events speak for themselves they end up Hollywood-izing it. The most glaring pandering to the Western audience is the fact that everyone speaks English, which reminded me of the awful portrayals of the German soldiers in all the old war films, where they speak English in a German accent. But this is only the tip of the iceberg and there are plenty of changes with how things really happened. Again, what did happen what so ghastly that there was no need to do this, and there seems a lack of understanding that something can be emotionally powerful without intrusive music that cheaply pulls at the heart strings. And why, oh why, did they not use more of the Rwandan countryside. It's certainly one of the most beautiful places I have ever been and the film missed a trick in this respect. The Constant Gardener's cinematography is much better, even though the lush greens of Rwanda would be much more conducive. But despite everything I hate about this film, I still like it. It is exciting in some parts, and with other parts is successful in making you angry about how the West left all these people to be brutally murdered. But it's not in the same league as Shaking Hands With the Devil, a far superior film on the Genocide."
WildCherryBear24,"Feb 6, 2005",10/10,"I heard this movie was good but that really isn't true. It is a masterpiece! I have never been so moved by a movie. This movie is just so sad and moving. I can't even imagine what the real thing must have been like. Please see this movie. I think it is important for the world to know what happened and to remember what happened to the Tootsie people. I really hope this movie wins an Acadamy Award all in the movie were amazing and did an amazing job portraying the seemingly hopeless situation they were in. The part that bothers me is how no one tried to help. I'd like to believe we didn't know but that's not true. What Jaquin Phonix's character said is true ""They'll say 'that's terrible' and then they'll go back to eating their dinner."" and it'also true what the UN officer said. People just didn't care enough. I hope this film teaches us that people of all races and countries are important."
Gundersonm,"Feb 13, 2005",10/10,"This is a terrific movie. The performances are spectacular, particularly Don Cheadle. He deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the hotel manager. The movie itself is much more important than just entertainment value. Most people aren't familiar with the horrific events in Rwanda in the 1990's, but they should be. We tend to think that genocide is something from the past that just doesn't happen in today's ""civil"" modern world. The true story behind this movie proves just the opposite. With all the focus on the Holocaust in World War II and all the talk about ""never letting it happen again,"" the world as a whole failed the people of Rwanda miserably just a few years ago. Everyone should see this movie, and learn a thing or two."
JiaQiLi,"Jan 8, 2007",6/10,"The Rwanda genocide is certainly one of the most atrocious crime in the 1990s. Rivalry between the Hutus and the Tutsis led to the death of over a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a span of three months.""Hotel Rwanda"" is a true story based on this massacre. Unfortunately, I do not feel any pain watching it. The entire film focuses too much on people inside the hotel that the film fails to portray the horror of the massacre. ""Hotel Rwanda"" spends too much time inside the hotel. It does not show the events outside the hotel and how they connect one another. I notice the hotel but I do not witness Kigali and Rwanda.I do not demand a feast of bloodshed, shootings, and corpses. However, I would also like to see how the terror moves Paul. I only notice several brief scenes where Paul actually witnesses many corpses and cries. The film needs to present more connections between the genocide and Paul's family.This film has some shadows of ""Schindler's List"" but it is nowhere near the calibre of ""Schindler's List."" When Hutu soldiers started the massacre, I doubt that Paul's hotel can keep getting away from the bloodshed by means of personal relationships and bribes. I cannot believe that this is true.""Hotel Rwanda"" has its positive elements in spite of its weaknesses. I am impressed that they vividly portray the world's negligence. Foreign nations care more about pulling out its citizens than stopping the bloody massacre. This was the case in 1994 and ""Hotel Rwanda"" makes this point. In another scene, Paul tries to send his family away and determines to stay with others in the hotel. This scene touches me because it deeply illustrates Paul's sentiment and humanity. He is not a selfish individual caring only for him and his family.""Hotel Rwanda"" is not a bad film. Its subject is serious and worth us to reflect. However, it can do a better job portraying how atrocious the genocide was and how Paul and others survived."
jmankoff,"Nov 24, 2004",N/A,"I attended the United States premier of Hotel Rwanda on November 3rd, 2004 in Philadelphia. I have never written a review for a movie before, but this movie was excellent and I am urging everyone I know that they should see it as well.I lived in Rwanda in the summer of '04. I have read several books on the history of Rwanda and talked about the '94 genocide with locals in Rwanda and also with Rwandans living in the US. I am by no means an expert on the history or the country, but I do know a fair amount about it, which is part of why I am writing this review.The movie was an excellent reproduction of what Rwanda is like and it tells the true story of one of the many heroes during that time. While it is a sad movie, it is also a story of hope. The portrayal of the violence was subtle and powerful, but not overly graphic. The movie focuses on the efforts of the manager of an upscale hotel in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda to protect the guests/refugees streaming into his hotel to escape the killing. The writer/directory (who spoke after the premier) said that he made an effort to get a PG13 rating rather than an R rating to ensure that students would be able to see this movie.It is an important movie to see because it brings to life the hope and triumph in Rwanda. It also shows what the media did not show in '94 and is not showing in Darfur: The suffering of ordinary people who need help from the rest of the world. While governments repeat the phrase 'never again' yet do nothing, it is up to us to ordinary people to learn about these events and do something or make our governments do something about them. Please see this movie-it does not have the budget to launch everywhere and relies on word of mouth to generate enough interest to make it into every city."
rbverhoef,"Oct 26, 2005",8/10,"'Hotel Rwanda' tells the story of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who used his skills to save over a thousand people during the terrible events that happened in Rwanda in the early nineties. Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutus simply because they were Tutsi, while the rest of the world was looking away. The way the United Nations acted here is portrayed by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the only fictional person in the movie.First we learn about the way Paul, a Hutu, handles things in the hotel; he is a good manager, keeping the important customers happy with little gifts. They may come in handy later in his life. We meet Paul's wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi. Then the massacre starts and slowly more and more people try to hide in the hotel, protected by just a few UN soldiers who are not allowed to use their weapons.In more than one way I was reminded of 'Schindler's List'. Schindler started to save people only to make money, but ended up caring for all of them. Paul's reasons are less selfish than making money, although at first he only wants to save his own family with the power he has. Paul also ends up caring for every single soul he can save. Both men stood up against a greater power with the risk of being killed. 'Schindler's List' is the better movie, mostly because it was amazing how it told a story about one man but gave us a strong impression of the Holocaust surrounding him. 'Hotel Rwanda' has some scenes that have that effect as well, but overall it feels more of a movie that plays on a smaller scale. Of course Steven Spielberg is also a better director than Terry George.Still, the movie is very powerful and moving. Like I said, there are scenes that are close to unbelievable, showing once again what mankind is able to. Performances are helpful here, especially Cheadle does a superb job showing a smart man slowly losing hope. There is one complaint (one that also counts for 'Schindler's List') I have here. The people in Rwanda were not speaking English as their main language, but they were definitely not speaking English with accents. Maybe it makes it more realistic for an English speaking audience, it does not for most others. Just let them speak their original language or normal English. You didn't see the people from 'Gladiator' speak English with a Latin accent either and it worked just fine."
magicalmouse,"Feb 6, 2005",10/10,"I had wanted to see this film from the moment I saw a snippet about it on BBC America. It was so powerful. It is difficult to talk about a film like this and use terms like what a great movie etc.. since it is about such a horrific event and a movie is a form of entertainment. I was caught up in the film right from the start, Don Cheadle made this role his own, every scene that he was in showed another angle another side of a man torn by so many things from what he knew to be right to what he knew in order to survive. It was his eyes that riveted me, each and every thought that he had as Paul was mirrored there - he was a man torn between so many things whether to just concern himself with his family or include his neighbors or the plight of strangers as well. I was so impressed also with the way he carried himself with such quiet dignity even while you knew that inside he must have been seething. He moved with such grace like a ballet dancer, even his fingers as they moved carried expression. I have always liked Mr. Cheadle in movies from his crazy turn in Devil in a Blue Dress to his great Brit part in Ocean's 11 and 12 but here he showed that he is by no means a lightweight. I can only hope that he has the opportunity to bring more of this talent to the screen. The rest of the cast was also superb, poor Nick Nolte always so powerful and breaking the rules and yet here unable to be a total rebel. You won't be disappointed with this film but you may walk out wondering how you could have helped, I know I did."
achint_the_lucky,"May 13, 2006",9/10,"What do you feel about riots and mass killing? What did you do when you saw these things on news channels? Did you do anything to stop them? All that most of us would do is feel bad about it. And then we would turn off the TV sets, take dinner and go to sleep. The movie shows the attitude of the world when mass killing is being done in Africa in the communal riots between Hutus and Tutsis. The protagonist, ""Paul"", who is a Hutu himself, is just like one of us for whom his family (which is Tutsi) is the most important. In the beginning he would do anything to save his family and would not even bother about his good neighbour. But slowly as he sees what is going around him he starts to realize. He takes up the responsibility of giving shelter to thousands of refugees in his hotel. He keeps giving bribes to the Tutsis leader. He even speaks to so many influential people around the world. And although he had a lot of difficulties convincing the world powers that they should interrupt, he ends up saving lives of about 1200 people. It is not a feel good movie or anything like that. It is a true story about Survival and Will Power. If you liked Schindler's List, the this may be a notch above but not less. Buy it! http://www.schoolofsymphony.com"
joker_C2000,"Jan 3, 2006",9/10,"""Never have so many owed so much to so few"" - Winston Churchill.I think this quote best describes the atmosphere highlighted in this magnificent film. What Paul Rusesebagina did to help the helpless Tutsis families by sheltering them in his hotel was proof that everyone of us can make a change for the better. The story is simply amazing and shocking at the same time - the feeling of regret and compassion was amplified by the fact that this movie was based on a true story.Don Cheadle delivers an outstanding performance.His acting is flawless - he manages to actually bring the viewer into the harsh Rwandian environment of the 1994 events. He skillfully points out the torment which Paul Rusesebagina faced! Sophie Okonedo also plays very well in this movie, masterfully playing the role of the determined and loving mother willing to do anything to save her children. Nick Nolte is superb in playing remorse haunted Colonel Oliver of the UN forces and Joaquin Phoenix does a great job on playing the character of Jack Daglish, the cameraman in charge to bring footage of the massacre.What strikes me at this movie is the remarkable resemblance between Paul Rusesebagina and Oskar Schindler, two men who risked their lives to save other people and who, against all odds, succeeded in achieving this.Through their actions, they saved the entire world, saved it from forgetting the fact that we are all humans and a right to live on this planet!All in all, this movie is superb and greatly deserves a spot in the Top 250! 9/10"
=G=,"Apr 14, 2005",7/10,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is a docudrama which tells the true story of a hotel manager (Cheadle) who, at his own peril, provided safe haven and protection for about 1000 refugees fleeing the Rwandan genocide of 1994 when 800,000 people were killed in a three month civil war. As is often the case with films which are built around compelling subjects such as holocausts, the import of the subject rubs off on the film elevating it's importance. Such is the case with ""Hotel Rwanda"", which is well crafted though it offers nothing new, conforms to the Hollywood playbook, and is probably slightly over-touted. The film spares the audience much of the bloody horror of the genocide with its PG-13 rating while doing a good job of building suspense and imparting a sense of the magnitude of the slaughter of innocents. Didactics are worked into the story so it is not difficult to follow even though the good and bad people are all black Rwandans. Those interested in the 1994 Rwandan genocide might also want to check out ""Sometimes in April"", a 2005 TV drama about the genocide which offers a somewhat broader perspective. (B)"
stamper,"Mar 16, 2005",8/10,"As one can probably imagine, a film with an 8,5 out of 10 (with 4.356 votes) ranking at number 130 of the IMDb's top 250 has few naysayers. There are some there however and I've taken the trouble to read them. What I think is sort of funny, is that many of the critique that is placed is utterly stupid. One person actually goes so far as to say that the film:""doesn't manage to escape the formulaic Hollywood feel-good story of the hero who wins out in the end. This typical treatment may be fine for other topics, but Rwanda was a real genocide, and this tragedy should not be treated as the playground of 'based on a true story' movies.""This is I feel a very feeble critique. This is not a film about the Rwandan genocide as is was, but a film about the events Paul Rusesabagina witnessed. He cannot help the fact that he didn't get to see much of the genocide and that he and his family survived in the end. Or maybe flat6 (the writer) thinks they should have just killed Rusesabagina off in the film, which certainly would have been more dramatic, but much less true. Also, doesn't this criticism mean that Schindler's List is a bad film as well?Another writer, imdb-45 states that:""The film gives no treatment as to the reason for the hatred between the two sects of African black people and concentrates virtually on a man's heroic attempt to save people in a hotel, many of which are would-be victims of the genocide.""If I'm not mistaken, the reason for the hatred is actually clearly outline in a conversation between Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), Jack (Joaquin Phoenix) and a local African journalist. I mean I am no expert on the subject, but it seemed pretty clear to me (if that was the whole of it). Basically it was just like WW 2, based on race, an African holocaust so to speak (although less organized and without the concentration camps as far as I know).The same author states that:""there is an awkward product plug for Volkswagon that ruins a genuinely amusing moment. There are product plugs for several different alcohol beverages that don't quite feel right.""Well, sorry but in reality people use product and brand names on a daily basis. So why not in a film? Because than it is advertising? If you recommend a brand of beer to your friends it is also advertising in a way, although on a much smaller scale.Someone else, fooltank77, states that the film doesn't say what happened after the genocide. While that is true, it isn't a flaw. This is the story of Paul Rusesabagina and his family and what happened tot hem during the genocide. The rest is nothing of the films concern. Also, everybody who watches the news occasionally or reads the paper knows that it is far from peaceful down there even now. Do you need to have everything presented to you? Personally I felt that this was a very impressing and good film. The performances and the directing were great and despite the fact that the film didn't show much of the slaughter, it was emotionally unsettling enough. I was especially astounded by the fact that the UN did so little to help. I knew that there wasn't much interference, but the fact that there was virtually no help at all just goes to show that Africa is just too far away for the rich and distant countries to worry. I daresay that the events in the film made me almost ashamed to be living in one of those rich UN countries.I feel that if you actually go to see this film and expect it to be an individual tale within a massive cultural slaughter, you will come to accept that this film has it's boundaries and doesn't show everything that happened before , during or after the genocide. Demanding that and claiming the film is bad because it doesn't give you everything there is, would be like saying Schindler's list is bad, because it didn't show the political situation in Germany in the beginning of the 1930's, how Hitler gained his power, what happened in Stalingrad, what Dr.Mengele did during medical experiments on Jews or the killing of the moffen-hoeren (women who had sex with Germans during WW 2) in the Netherlands after the war. My point here is that a film like Schindler's list doesn't actually have as much background info as is demanded of this film by some viewers. It is just that we (in the western world) now much more about WW 2 than we do of a distant African genocide. Also there is so much suffering when something like this occurs and one film can not show it all. All it can do is show us parts of the tragedy and maybe inspire viewers to try and find out more about it. Giving a complete picture of such a tragedy is like completing a puzzle.

verb80,"May 8, 2005",7/10,"Hotel Rwanda is an excellent story, and the movie certainly deserves perfect scores on it's message and the topic at hand. The problem with this movie is a bit on how it's done. I understand the direction the movie was going with light on the gore and rather on the story but I felt it just left a bit too much out, as we know close to a million people where killed, although we really never get that feeling watching the movie. The great movie ""passion of the Christ"" uses extreme gore to drive home a point, and perhaps tell a story like it really is not so that we don't turn off some viewers. I think this is exactly the point, Mel Gibson figures if you can't watch this movie (Understand how awful it is) but yet refuse to accept it you refuse to really accept the truth, the same could be said with Rwanda and the current tragic events we have currently in Africa.The acting here is top notch, and I can see the nod for best actor nomination but the movie is a bit too ""Hollywood"", there's too much music matching the moment and it feel's unrealistic & typical, any experienced movie watcher will get upset with this style. In conclusion, I wish this was done again.. to think of it, we will have another chance, someone will show the horrors in Dufur in a Hollywood production I just hope next time there won't be music playing when the main actor is running to his family, lets get it done right."
vertigo_14,"Mar 5, 2005",10/10,"As governments around the world ignore the atrocities against the Sudanese in Darfur, this movie should have you screaming for something to be done to save them! 'The Hotel Rwanda' should be seen by all, and forgotten by none.'The Hotel Rwanda' is a familiar favorite among Best Picture contenders, more than humbling an audience with biographical tales of heroic struggles against disgusting atrocities. 'The Pianist' and 'Schindler's List' are more recent examples of this. But, with 'The Hotel Rwanda,' the intensity delivered by director Terry George and the powerful performance by Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, this film was able to put the shock into people in a much more disturbing and intense way than I had ever seen any other movie do and leaves you silent and just as helpless long after you've left the theater.The Hotel Rwanda refers to the Belgium hotel that, under Rusesabagina's unexpected direction, served as a refugee camp for the Tutsi people who were being wiped out by Hutsi rebels in Rwanda. On the one hand, this movie shows you the kind of atrocities that could result if one faction controlled the media (the Hutsi's here controlled the radio waves and incited their violence and recruited their followers through a propaganda radio program). On the other hand, Rusesabagina is such an extraordinary heroic figure where he tried desperately to save people from the slaughter when it seems that every government that could help denied assistance to the Rwandas. Even where journalists were able to enter the country before the worst fighting began and report the massacre. We ought to be made aware of these things, and we should never ignore them, and never forget them.I am still amazed by the powerful emotion that this movie is able to invoke, to nearly lose your mind in desperation when it seems like there is going to be no hope left for Paul, his family, or the Rwandan refugees. To become nearly violent when anger when you their holocaust, but the other countries refuse to help.And, actress Sophie Okonedo, who plays Tatiana Rusesabagina, likewise gives an incredible performance as Paul's wife.This IS the Best Picture of 2004."
rps-2,"Apr 15, 2005",7/10,"It's difficult to imagine the inhumanity and horror of the Rwandan genocide. Yet this film does a good job of conveying it without resorting to excess gore. It also leavens the horror with well timed moments of humour or tenderness. From all accounts it is factually correct. Why then did they not portray Gen. Romeo Dallaire as himself instead of inserting some trumped up fictional character played most unsuitably by Nick Nolte wearing a Canadian flag on his shirt? This detracts from the film and angers Canadians. Most of us regard Dalaire as a compassionate, highly principled hero who was betrayed by the UN. (Read his book, ""Shake Hands With The Devil."") The movie tells a terrible story very well. But eliminating Gen. Dalaire is a little like eliminating Eisenhower from ""The Longest Day"" (Dalaire, incidentally, just recently was appointed to the Canadian Senate.)"
stackbill,"Oct 1, 2021",1/10,"This movie pretends to be factual but in truth, the main protagonist was an opportunist and villain ,almost nothing in this movie is accurate. Further info is available elsewhere."
harry_tk_yung,"Mar 27, 2005",N/A,"The basic hurdle for the world to have more empathy with the macro issue of the horrendous massacre is the fact that the world is uninformed. Unlike the situation of Nazis and Jews, Irish Catholics and British Protestants or Crusade and Islam, the issue of Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda has not generally been heard of by an average citizen of the world. In the movie, the reporter asks two women at the bar in Hotel Rwanda what tribe they belong to. ""Hutu"" says one, and ""Tutsi"", the other. The reported turns around and comments to his companion ""They look like twins to me"". That says a lot.The film does educate us on the brief background of the local history, on how the Belgians used the Tutsi's to rule the Hutu and so since they left, the Hutu had been waiting for their chance to revenge. That is however just the bare backbone of the history, but we have not been brought to a deeper understanding of the bitter hatred that drove the Hutus to a diabolical genocide of a million Tutsi in 1994 as the world turned its back: ""the nations are united in their indifference towards Rwanda"" as Mr. Ebert aptly puts it.Rather than being an epic on macro scale, Hotel Rwanda is a personal story (albeit a true one) on micro scale, about hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina's heroic efforts which saved twelve hundred hotel ""guests"" of Tutsi descent, including his own wife. This is a story told with high quality filming and yet one cannot help but come away feeling that it leans slightly towards looking like a Hollywood thriller. It would be gross injustice to say it's crafted and yet, the climax after climax of narrow escape and cliffhanging suspense does feel a tad Hollywood. It would be gross injustice to say that it's a tearjerker and yet one cannot help feeling traces of familiarity in the Hollywood style emotional pull. And there is considerable predictability, such as the sudden bumpy ride of the jeep in the fog would be easily discerned by a regular moviegoer as the signal for the next scene: a road strewn with bodies of massacred victims.Oscar nominee Don Cheadle's performance as the circumstance-driven hero is deservedly recognized by the nomination. Nick Notle, who was wonderful in ""Clean"", puts in another great performance here as a similarly circumstance-driven hero in the U.N. peace keeping force Col. Oliver. The rest of the cast contributing to making this film a solid success includes Sophie Okonedo who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Pauls's wife Tatiana and Joaquin Phoenix as the reporter whose videotape of the massacre made the world pay attention. All told, Hotel Rwanda is a high-quality movie, but I can't agree with many comments hailing Hotel Rwanda as another Schindler's List."
Chris_Docker,"Mar 2, 2005",8/10,"I usually say my criteria for assessing a film are asking myself if it inspired, educated or entertained me. I somehow don't seem to have a category for 'it totally devastated me'.Nearly all the main characters are based on real life people  very real. One of the problems we have in coming to terms with the ethnic destruction of a peoples we have no knowledge of, have little culturally in common with, have little to identify them as 'people' other than a biological acknowledgement is that, for us, they are not very 'real'. So is the point of a film about the Rwandan genocide that left a million dead that they become more real? Does that make any difference? One of the results of going to see this very powerful, very harrowing (and in terms of the personal integrity and bravery of some central characters, very beautiful) film is that part of the proceeds go towards helping the people who are left. Another, perhaps, is that by becoming more aware of suffering our desire to find a way to avoid or alleviate it increases. The film shows a divide between - on one hand - the Rwandan people who, rich or poor, had sensibilities much like you or I, - and on the other hand - the troglodytes that wanted to kill each other and (with a logic reminiscent of President Bush's ""if you're not with us you're against us"" simplistic attitude) anyone who didn't join them. The inclusiveness of the carnage and the inability (or unwillingness) of the West to help meant there was no get out along the lines of 'if they want to kill each other let them'.The performances are so spellbinding that it is hard to watch the film without feeling the suffering of those involved. Although it points the finger at a reluctance of the West to get involved, we also have to ask ourselves that, even if the powerful governments or the UN were willing to get involved, could the carnage have been prevented? The lack of any well-structured hint at a potential solution is perhaps one of the (very few) flaws of the film. Similarly, the swiftness of some of the events makes historic sense but there is not always enough detail to explain why things happened the way they did. But it seems clear that some intervention could have at least reduced a large amount of the carnage, so in a way Hotel Rwanda is a protest against international apathy.The official website of the movie provides much in the way of reference material, links and analysis. This helped to confirm my view while watching the film that those involved felt that there was something more at stake than being film stars. In doing so they have become true stars, irrespective of what awards were won or not."
bk753,"Nov 15, 2023",8/10,"I'm aware that there are substantial claims that the depiction of Paul Rusesabagina is potentially flawed in this film and that he may not be the hero the movie makes him out to be. I can't know for sure which version of the story is factual and can only ""review"" the film as presented.The movie is powerful and heartbreaking and shows the 1994 genocide of Tutsis by rival Hutus as part of the Rwandan Civil War. The horrifying brutality of this unimaginable slaughter of up to 800,000 people is the backdrop for the valiant efforts of a resort hotel manager to shelter and save as many innocents as possible, especially children. I CAN say that Don Cheadle is outstanding in the film, that the movie accurately and dramatically gives an eye-opening look at the savagery of war, and is absolutely worth watching as presented. I would also urge people (if interested) to read further on the subject to decide for themselves whether they believe this story, as told, to be mostly factual or a slanted and unfair view of history.The film itself deserves a ""9"" or maybe even a ""10"" on merit. I've given it an ""8"" because the controversy over its veracity troubles me. I still highly recommend."
howard.schumann,"Apr 18, 2005",9/10,"Just over ten years ago, Rwanda, a former Belgian colony the size of Vermont, became a horrific killing field, the result of ethnic, social, and political hatred between the majority Hutus and the rival Tutsis, the former ruling elite who ran the country for the Belgians and treated the Hutu as second class citizens. The Washington Post reported ""how the heads and limbs of victims were sorted and piled neatly, a bone-chilling order in the midst of chaos that harked back to the Holocaust."" The massacre that claimed over one million lives was triggered by the still unsolved assassination of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose plane was gunned down by missiles on his return from a conference in Dar-es Salam. Senior Hutu leaders used the downing of the plane as an excuse to exterminate Tutsis and moderate Hutus. While the UN maintained a peacekeeping presence they did not intervene, nor did the U.S., France, Belgium or other Western powers who had the power to stop it.In the Oscar-nominated film Hotel Rwanda, the atrocity is dramatized through the story of the determination of one man who sheltered over 1000 Tutsis including his wife (Sophie Okenado), a Tutsi woman, and his children. Don Cheadle portrays hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina in a towering performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Rusesabagina, who served as an adviser to the film, managed the Belgian-owned Hotel Mille Collines in the city of Kigali, a luxury hotel where UN dignitaries socialized with Western diplomats and media. As homes are invaded and bodies pile up, people are forced to leave their homes and seek shelter in churches, schools, and in this case the luxury hotel.As the sounds of fighting outside increase, the White guests are forced to leave and the remaining Africans are left to defend themselves with the token aid of the UN peacekeeping force, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), who is faced with an insurmountable task. With supplies of food and water diminishing and the violence increasing, Paul pleads with his guests to telephone the outside world in a plea for help but with scant results. The comment by an American journalist about the value of airing a segment explicitly showing Hutus hacking Tutsi civilians puts it into perspective: ""They will go  'O God, that's horrible!' and then go back to eating their dinner.""Hotel Rwanda allows us to see the conflict in human rather than political terms and Paul's loving relationship with his family is believable and deeply affecting. Though scenes of gory violence are kept to a minimum earning the film a PG-13 rating, the scene showing Paul and his assistant Gregoire driving through fog and discovering hundreds of bodies of slaughtered innocents lying on the road, stands out for its understated horror. Though not justifying the massacre, more historical background would have been helpful such as knowing the role of the Belgian colonial authority in fomenting ethnic division in the country, and the 1990 invasion of Rwanda by the exiled Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front with the support of the Americans and the British. While Hotel Rwanda may fall short of greatness, it is nonetheless a moving and powerful film, an unflinching indictment of the political extremism that fed the turmoil, the indifference of self-satisfied Western nations, and the courage and tenacity of one man who made a difference."
K-nightt,"Jul 26, 2010",6/10,"Films like this remind me why life is just one big ball of tragedy. It is very difficult to live life happily unless all these horrible facts of reality are summarily swept under the proverbial rug in our minds. Don Cheadle does a reasonably OK job in his role as the messianic hero, although his face is usually stamped with helpless despair most of the time, a lot of time the fact that he is acting oozes through the lens a little too intensely. The film tap-dances around the horrific violence going on in the periphery, there is minimal on-screen violence shown. I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop and there be an actual depiction of the massacre going on. But, in the end, it was an attempt to shed some light on the Western world's indifference to the suffering of a split-off continent that is kept in captivity by the superpowers, kind of reminds me of the film ""Martyrs"", except in geographic terms, and applied to about 1 billion people in 54 countries. Now, the ridiculous thing about this movie, in my opinion, is how the main actor does this ""heroic"" thing for all the refugees, and yet ends up leaving his country and moving to Belgium, where it's all white and safe; again, the racial and economic split is created, but people swallow it easier since the actor is black, but the egregious disregard for human life is eternally stamped on the final message of this film... after all, who cares if 700,000 people lost their lives in this atrocious genocide, as long as the charismatic wealthy hero who knew all the right white guys comes out unscathed?"
druss44121-1,"Feb 12, 2005",8/10,"Based on the 1994 genocide between the African ""tribes"" of the Hutu's and the Tutsi's, Hotel Rwanda has gotten decidedly mixed reviews. Before seeing the film, I was a little surprised since such subject matter alone is usually powerful enough to lead a film to critical acclaim. After seeing the film, though, I was incredibly surprised, as this is one of the most powerful and harrowing films I've seen in a year. It moved me in a way most films fail to do.Documenting a sadly little known event from just a mere decade ago, when nearly a million Rwandans were killed brutally with machetes and other weapons in the short time span of two months, everything within the film works. It never becomes manipulative or sentimental, always letting the emotions flow naturally. It also never becomes a blood fest, instead letting the majority of the violence be seen in small glimpses. It is an effective strategy that actually shocks more than any amount of hacked limbs and bloodied faces could.However, the film does become a wagging finger at those around the world that did not do enough, or anything. Yet, it does not blame without a purpose. This is a film that urges it's viewer not only to look back at history and have a reaction, but to look at today and forward into the future and to seek out the injustices that occur now so that perhaps those in need will not become abandoned again. For example, in Somalia the 'G' word has been brought up for atrocities occurring to this very day.Then there is Paul Rusesabagina, played by Don Cheadle. Simply put, Cheadle becomes his character, never going for the showy theatrical bits that will look good in a 30-second clip. Rather, he embodies the spirit of a true honest-to-God hero. The actual Rusesabagina helped on the set of Hotel Rwanda, and the touch of honesty that would have come from the real Paul is evident on screen and in Cheadle's presentation. Ultimately, Rusesabagina is a name as worthy as Oskar Schindler.Ignoring the built in power of the subject matter, though, Hotel Rwanda is a work of cinema and art on its own merits too. I first began to realize I was in for more than a Discovery channel special in an early scene before the genocide, as lightening brightens the sky at intermittent points. It is a brilliant way to foreshadow the coming storm Rwanda is about to face. Rusesabagina himself is a Hutu, but his wife and many of his friends are Tutsi, and as Rusesabagina and some friends are talking about the looming danger on the horizon as Tutsi members have become verbal targets thanks to a local radio station's spreading of propaganda, the brilliant touch of the lightening that is not overused but rather subtly inserted into the background helps create a sense of unease.Ultimately, this is a film that needs to be seen. The Oscar nominations come out tomorrow, January 25th, and I hope this film picks up several nods partly to help it gain more attention in a way the actual event never really did. The film is as powerful as Schindler's List but still unique in its own right, helping to illuminate a terrifying but little known event. Hotel Rwanda is testament that there is always a reason to stand up against humanity's greatest flaws, and that those who turn their backs can be just as dangerous as the ones who carry the bloody machetes down into their local neighborhoods."
ampiah01,"Sep 18, 2014",7/10,"In 1993, ethnic tensions heightened in Rwanda due to the Melchior Ndadaye (ones popular Hutu President of Burundi) assassination, it was a common knowledge as to who could be responsible. The conflict between the Tutsi's and Hutu's takes a down turn after when Rwandan President Habyalimana and Burundi's new President, Cyprien Ntaryamira's are also assassinated when returning from meetings with Tutsi rebels despite hopes and efforts by United Nations to preserve a very fragile peaceful political climate. The death of these two presidents became the catalyst for a genocidal onslaught that killed an estimated one million of Tutsi civilians and some Hutu civilian who were considered as moderates or as ""cockroaches"" by the Hutu rebels. During this chaotic killings by militiamen wilding guns, grenades, machetes and clubs does one man's extraordinary courage and love for his fellow human being takes stage in perhaps the most heart pounding ""must see"" movies of all time."
AJ4F,"Oct 11, 2006",6/10,"It's rare to complain about such things, but Hotel Rwanda wasn't violent enough to get the full point across. Someone like Spielberg with his knack for ultra-realistic violence could have done a better job. When you feel like you're watching something real it hits you on a deeper level. There's a lot more to it than gratuitous bloodshed. The unnerving chaos of Africa was displayed much better in ""Blackhawk Down.""This was a case where filtered gore robbed the movie of the outrage one should feel. There were only a few serious cringe-inducing scenes and I expected the whole movie to stay at that level. There was definite unease throughout, but it wasn't quite edgy enough.I think some rave reviews describe what the move could have been and the importance of its theme, not what it actually was. I disagree with those who say the reason for the conflict wasn't explained well enough. It was just a type of gang vengeance and us vs. them, like so many other wars."
spludwig26,"Apr 19, 2005",9/10,"Some films hold importance because they shed light on a world that most of us will never know or comprehend fully. ""Hotel Rwanda,"" the true story of a hotel manager who saved the lives of 1,268 men, women and children in Kigali, Rwanda in April of 1994, is the most important film of 2004.A decade ago, the African nation of Rwanda became a place of mass genocide. The two dominant tribes, the darker skinned Hutus and lighter skinned Tutsis, began a civil war. After 100 days of fighting and over a million casualties, the U.N. finally interceded.We follow the story of Paul Rusesabagina, portrayed by the excellent Don Cheadle, who has never troubled himself with the affairs of the people. He is a businessman and manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, the most luxurious hotel in Rwanda. Over the years, he has become friends with important people by providing cigars and expensive Scotch in meetings with them.However, Paul's world goes from heaven to hell when the civil war begins. The Hutu militia walks the streets killing any Tutsi they can find, including helpless children. The militia wants to kill every Tutsi to wipe the slate clean of their kind.Paul himself is a Hutu, but his wife is a Tutsi and his three children are mixed. The welfare of his family is his priority throughout the film. In addition, Paul helps other refugees by housing them in the hotel and bribing the Rwandan army (who has sided with the Hutu militia) with money, beer and other items to protect the hotel.Some have hailed the film as an African ""Schindler's List."" This is right in the aspect of a heroic businessman protecting innocent people from their death. However, ""Schindler's List"" is better-made film because of the unflinching portrayal of the Holocaust and Steven Spielberg's powerful direction.""Hotel Rwanda's"" only major flaw is toning down the violence to make this a family oriented piece. Director Terry George cleaned the image of war up so the film could receive a more commercial PG-13 rating.Still, even though the violence is not accurately portrayed, the film is simultaneously haunting and heartbreaking. In one scene, Paul and an associate drive down a foggy and unusually bumpy road, only to stop the car and realize they are actually running over hundreds of dead bodies. It's a scene that will stay with you for weeks.One key factor that makes the film work is Cheadle's performance. It has been nominated for an Academy Award because it is flawless and Cheadle has never been better. We really believe Paul's plight because of Cheadle's perfect Rwandan accent and ability to convey conflicted emotions.Also worth noting is Sophie Okenedo who plays Paul's wife Tatiana. Okenedo has been doing small television roles for most of her career, but after this film, it wouldn't be surprising to see her more often on the big screen.Although ""Hotel Rwanda"" sometimes has an overly sentimental feel to it, it still succeeds in commemorating Paul Rusesabagina and shaming the world for not helping stop man's inhumanity toward man."
aliksandrdaisuke,"Jan 24, 2005",10/10,"A modern day Schildler's List, a spectacular human rights film with an outstanding cast. You're doing yourself a favor by going to this movie and witnessing just how much one man gave up to save lives, while oppressing forces were almost inhumanly vile. Truly Oscar-worthy performances by Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, and Nick Nolte; with probably several more nominations in other fields besides just acting. Based on the true story of the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, it has its powerful, almost hard-to-stomach violence in idea only, there isn't a whole lot in the way of on-screen gore, just the idea of it. With special focus given to both international generosity and apathy regarding these real-life events, it really does reach valuable points most movies forget about."
kergillian,"Mar 27, 2005",10/10,"Somalia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Congo, Sudan, Algeria, Nigeria, Tunisia - and Rwanda...what do all of these African counties have in common? They're countries torn apart by civil war, where millions have been slaughtered and millions more have been maimed, raped, beaten, tortured, threatened, displaced, and, most importantly, ignored by the rest of the world. And the main reason for the nightmare that Africa has become? Europe colonized Africa and divided it along new territorial lines, splitting tribes and clans into pieces, and forcing rivals and foreigners into the same territories. The entire Rwandan genocide is namely due to the Belgians, who basically handpicked certain Rwandans and called them Hutus, and called the others Tutsis, all arbitrarily, then left the country and power to the Hutus, creating a power struggle between two 'tribes' who were really the SAME PEOPLE.In the end you have Hutus and Tutsis at war, even though there is absolutely no difference between them save a name granted by their Belgian 'lords', and power unilaterally granted by uncaring and abandoning colonizers. I just watched the Shake Hands With The Devil documentary on Radio-Canada tonight, and one thing that astounded me was the footage, at the 10th anniversary conference on the Rwandan genocide, of a personal attack by the Belgian senatorial representative, on Dallaire, because of Belgian casualties within the UN peacekeeping corps. I think that this is the perfect example of where the Western priorities lie.Everyone in North America and Western Europe needs to see Hotel Rwanda. Only through this kind of film can we actually learn about and feel the sort of terror that exists in a land where death can come to someone simply because they're unfortunate enough to be branded with a colonial name that divides them from the Powers That Be. 10/10."
jessie-39,"Jan 23, 2005",10/10,"As one who feels that there is ""no best performance"" for the Oscars but rather, everyone who is nominated is a ""best performance"". How can you possibly compare any one performance against another when the movies and stories are totally different. We loved many movies this year and feel they are worthy of nominations. We have already been rewarded by seeing that Natalie Portman and Clive Owens were honored by the foreign Press for a movie that we loved, but understood some would find it abhorrent. The line is drawn in the sand by Don Cheadle who we have always liked in every role he has played. He has been relegated the usual stereotypical roles for Black actors and it must be frustrating for him and the handful of very talented black actors and actresses who just don't get the great roles. Don Cheadle sets himself apart from every single actor in any movie of 2004. It is done by simply providing the best acting role in a movie about ""real events"". It makes us all ashamed of the fact that we were frozen to the TV watching OJ Simpson at the time that all of this took place. What a disgrace to us. As usual the world stood still and did nothing as in the Holocaust and the few other cases of genocide. The French true to their colors did nothing when they could have and should been first on the site. The English and Americans turned their backs as did the UN. Cheadle brings us to tears and cheers in this fascinating story of ""one man"" who defies the odds against genocide of his own people. He is an outstanding actor and he surely deserves not only the nomination but the win as well. True, Leo was great as Hughes, Sideways is still something I cannot understand as to what the hub bub is about, Clint and Morgan were superb in Million Dollar baby, but none come close to Cheadle in this spectacular role of a lifetime. Bravo to Cheadle and those who had the guts to make this movie. Everyone from 8 to 108 should be required to see this movie as much if not equal to Schindlers List."
jmverville,"Jan 18, 2005",7/10,"Hotel Rwanda is quite a strong story due to the uniqueness of location and topic, as well as the emotionality that is penned into it. I found though, that although the story is very strong and so is Don Cheadle, the rest of the film is not all that it is cracked up to be. Many people like to focus on the good parts of this film (of which there are many), but one must not be so quick to overrate it.Don Cheadle's performance is very convincing and engaging, and as in most of Don Cheadle's roles, he is able to acquire an accent and a whole different method of acting for each role that he takes. He is truly a diverse actor that deserves much credit (and awards) for this performance. However, Nick Nolte plays an aging military man and throughout the film you cannot help but note that the Colonel is weakly portrayed and Nolte acts quite poorly. I have never seen the portrayal of such a military man being so unintentionally weak and sheepish, yet at the same time the attempt to make him seem soldierly. Either Nick Nolte's acting is bad, or Terry George doesn't know what he wants out of the Colonel.Which leads me to elaborate that the film was poorly directed. George, for whatever reason, focuses away from the action of the film (the riots and war in Kingali) to the hectic scene at the Hotel, when it is quite obvious that any viewer after hearing all these reports about warfare on the streets would like to see more than is shown. One could say George is tantalizing us with action, but I am afraid that the action seemingly doesn't exist as it should in this film. The film had endless potential to show the depravity of genocide and war in an active and engaging way, but in the end George focuses on a passive portrayal -- with which I would have had no problems by itself, but it becomes quite unsavory.Furthermore, George also throws inappropriate scenes at inappropriate times, and sometimes the vocal narratives on the radio which are meant to be threatening and scary seem to be comical due to the selection of words. Scenes that bring you in one direction (towards something riveting and compelling) often leave you unfulfilled. George also does not drive home the messages as hard as he could have, and by the end of the film, one can scarcely remember many of the messages that George wanted to drive home, being that one is quite exhausted with the puzzle of plot that George assembles.Overall, it was a good film, but certainly not without flaw. It could have been a much better film had there been a different style of directing (or, in short, a different director)."
judywalker2,"Jan 26, 2005",10/10,"I almost didn't go see this movie. It's so hard for me to sit through things like this. It is very, very good, but you can only see it once if you have a heart or a soul. You can only go through the experience one time because you can't do it again, at least I can't. Don Cheadle was exceptional. Nick Nolte and Jaoquin Phoenix had very difficult roles. I was also happy to see Jean Reno has the hotel president. The good people anguished and the bad people schemed. The woman who played Don Cheadle's wife was also very good I really felt her fear. I agree with the critics that this movie had a message without being preachy. It should teach us a lesson, but I know the world won't listen."
megawimp,"Mar 25, 2005",7/10,"To keep it short: What really turned me down was that the makers of this movie or maybe rather the writer of the script didn't have the courage to focus on the events of the genocide in rwanda as such. Why couldn't they just try and show the mere barbarism of what really happened. Like the catholic church of rwanda got involved in massacres, like last days neighbors became murders over night - and the dimensions of the genocide itself which were unseen of since the shoa. 800'000 to 1 million people slaughtered within 3 months, for the greater part with machetes and other tools - very little of this does shine through the almost romantic story of a brave and pure man. Sometimes I think that such stories rather use events like the rwanda genocide for a historical background only: The main story seems to be this of heroism where in fact a mass killing among neighbours was going on in rwanda. what fits this picture is the way the rebels of the rlf are glorified in the end of the film. in fact, after they had kicked out parts of the hutu murder gangs, they started intense killing based on racist projections too. it is still unknown among historians how many the killed then, but figures may go up very, very high. But as I said - maybe the actual events aren't that important for hero-movies like this. What I liked about the film was the role of the u.n. and the post-colonialist governments as portrayed in ""hotel rwanda"": in fact the international community witnessed over months the mass murder."

This simple hotel manager of a four stars hotel sheltered 1268 Tutsis and Hutus refugees in the Milles Collines Hotel of Kigali, and with his common sense and courage, saved the life of these people. When the genocide finished in July 1994, there were a million dead bodies left in Rwanda. The Tutsi rebels forced the Hutu army and the Interhamwe militia to move to Congo.It is amazing that it has taken ten years to see this powerful contemporary drama on the big screen, when we see dozens of Holocaust movies as if this has been the unique slaughter of a race in the recent history. As far as I remember, this is the first movie that I see showing, in a sensitive and full of love and hope way, the misery of this people, which the world turned back maybe because they do not have oil, gold or diamonds in their poor country. I really would like to register my congratulation to director Terry George and Don Cheadle for this movie, and Paul Rusesabagina for his example to mankind. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Hotel Ruanda"" (""Hotel Rwanda"")"
stensson,"Mar 19, 2005",7/10,"The conflict in Rwanda didn't matter much to most Westerners, although one million people might have been killed. That is mostly because those who were killed where black Africans. There is still lots of deep going racism in Western societies. Not only towards Africans but also concerning Asians. There have been much more bad feelings about white people killed in the tsunami, when about the locals.""Hotel Rwanda"" definitely makes you think about that. You also come to think about the fact that this country and these people didn't have much business interest to offer West. Why should we give away our tax money to our armies to protect them, if we don't get anything out of it? Don Cheadle is really good in his part as the hotel manager, risking both his own life and the life of his family to save people of another ""race"". Nick Nolte makes another ""Nick Nolte"". The story is strong, but the best thing about it, is that you come to think about certain mechanisms, which seems to be stronger than the compassion you might find in yourself."
ricfal,"May 18, 2007",1/10,"One can rate movies according to what they bring of ""newness"" to our horizons. For me this movie hasn't added anything and i can only say that to the people this movie was a ""widening"" of some sort, then you must have been asleep before you saw it. The first objective criticism i have to make is that once you have visited Africa you cannot relate to the images in Hotel Rwanda. We see the movie as if we are in a western suburban area and that, i might say, as nothing to do with the feel of Africa. Throughout the film we seem to be taken through a somewhat digestible version of scenarios for western bourgeois audience.Sure enough that the film is talking about a sensitive issue and how the circumstances enforce heroic acts on the part of the main character. But if we go a bit deeper into the portrayal of Rwanda's reality then we find this film has no specific content other than the poor commercialization of conflict, and i would say that's mediatic malady. I'm sure Tutsi survivors may have praised the film as something important. But talking in cinematic terms this film is a hoax. The horror of Rwanda is much more darker on the whole of humanity than this film can show. One would have to film constant panic to get a bit closer.It's not Hollywood made but it is still the same formula. In my opinion: don't watch it! It has the stink of culpabilization on it. I'm sorry for writing such a bad review but i'm just being honest."
rogerdarlington,"Mar 6, 2005",N/A,"Like most ethnic conflicts around the world, the divisions in Rwanda between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis have long antecedents, in this case the invasion of the Rwanda highlands by the Tutsis from Ethiopia in the 15th century. However, it was Belgium - who ruled the country under a UN mandate from 1918 to 1961 - who institutionalised the discrimination by favouring Tutsis and introducing identity cards which specified the holders ethnic group. The spark which lit the tinder was the shooting down of the aircraft carrying the Hutu President on 6 April 1994. In the next 100 days, there was a ferocious outbreak of genocide orchestrated by the Interahamwe militia and sanctioned by the Hutu government in which around 800,000 mostly Tutsis were massacred while the world community failed to intervene. A decade later, a kind of collective guilt sees the release of no less than four films about these events, the most high profile being ""Hotel Rwanda"" which garnered three Academy Award nominations.Portraying death on this scale in a work of 'entertainment' almost demands that we observe the savagery through the prism of selected individuals and, in this case, Irish writer and director Terry George has chosen to use the real-life experience of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina and his family. Rwanda is often called 'Le pays des Milles Collines' (the Land of a Thousand Hills) and Paul worked at the Sabena-owned Hotel des Mille Collines, a four-star establishment in the capital of Kigali. A well-educated Hutu, he was married to a Tutsi and had three young children, so he was geographically and ethnically at the heart of the madness. Like a kind of Oskar Schindler, he used a mixture of simple bribery and his sharp wits, together with charm and even obsequiousness, to create a haven in the horror that enabled 1,268 mainly Tutsis to survive.America actor Don Cheadle, who played a cockney fool in ""Ocean's Eleven"" & ""Ocean's Twelve"", gives a powerful and textured performance here which marks him out as someone who is going to become an A-list star, while able British actress Sophie Okonedo is his wife Tatiana (Tutsis are lighter-skinned and finer-featured), and it is such a change to see the leading roles in a movie taken by black actors. The fear and powerlessness of the hotel occupants - over a thousand men, women and children crammed into a 113-room establishment - is well created and sustained. The settings are very realistic, being largely shot in Johannesburg, and most of the technical and support crew were African. The focus of the action is the hotel itself and the violence is deliberately understated and left largely to the imagination.While one does not wish to see killing portrayed gratuitously, this artistic decision runs the risk that a largely ignorant western audience fails to appreciate the true nature and scale of this machete-fuelled rampage of rape and murder but, this reservation aside, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is an important and worthy work that should serve as a political warning of the price of international inaction in the face of ethnic conflict. Paul Rusesabagina, now lives in Belgium with his family, and recently told the US ""People"" magazine: ""What happened in Rwanada is now happening in Darfur, in the Congo, in all of these places they are butchering innocent civilians. It is high time we know that a human life in Africa is as important as a human life in the west."""
Ric-7,"Mar 1, 2005",10/10,"I did not see this film before the Academy Awards ceremony. I wonder how many members of the Academy also did not see this film before the ceremony. Cheadle should have won the Oscar. Though fine work was turned in by the other nominees, Cheadle's performance was breathtaking. And heartbreaking.The very few negative reviews I have read will compare this film to Schindler's List, which also deals with genocide. However, the analogy fails because: (1) Oscar Schindler was not a member of the targeted group; (2) The distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was completely arbitrary and artificial; and (3) The West had ""intervened"" in WWII.That distinguishing feature--the West's intervention or lack of it--is doubly ironic: first, it was the West's meddling which had created the problem in Rwanda, both the colonial aspirations and later arming the factions it created. And second, the people we were saving from Hitler were mostly white. No truer words were ever spoken than the line delivered by Nick Nolte's character as an explanation for the lack of concern by the West: ""You're African."" This film was horrifying without being unduly grisly--a remarkable and commendable restraint for a film about a war fought mostly with machetes. And without further explanation (in case you haven't seen the film), I point out there is one particular road trip in this film as chilling as anything in horror films.After about ten minutes into this film, I was thinking, maybe 8/10. By the end, it was a definite 10."
wdashton43,"Feb 11, 2005",10/10,"This was an amazing film to say the least. Don Cheadle definitely deserves an Oscar nod. He is one of the best actors in the film business by far yet he is never mentioned with the other top names. I really couldn't take my eyes of Cheadle when I watched this. The emotion and presence he carries on the screen is phenomenal. I saw this film in theaters and loved it. This was an incredibly moving film that really opens your eyes to whats going on in places outside the US. What was done to the people in Rwanda is horrifying and deserves to be shared with the rest of the world. Thats the beautiful thing about movies: they help everyday people to get a glimpse of hardships people face in other places that we will never experience or fully understand. Its hard to completely explain how good this film was, but its one of those films that makes you want to study the history taking place in the film and then go back and watch it again and again. 10/10!!"
MovieAddict2016,"Aug 22, 2005",8/10,"Ten years ago in the country of Rwanda, one million people were brutally murdered in less than three months by opposing forces, and much of the world passed over the events giving them little notice. However one brave man (played in the film by Don Cheadle) granted over 1,000 refugees access to his hotel and helped save their lives.I had heard very mixed reviews on this film. On a UK talk show when it came out overseas one critic called it the next ""Schindler's List,"" and another said it was too tame and ""not scary enough"" to be a great movie.Personally I felt that although the movie was very good, and extremely well acted by Don Cheadle, the PG-13 rating does indeed restrict some of the atrocities that were actually performed. It kind of seems redundant to make such a daring, un-Hollywood film and then rate it PG-13 so more people can go see it and it can bring in more money.At the time, I thought the critic who said it ""wasn't scary enough"" was off her nut, but now I can understand what she was getting at - ""Schindler's List"" really immersed you into the Jews' struggle through its brutal depictions of senseless violence. It hurt to watch.""Hotel Rwanda"" is tamer. It still deals with hundreds of thousands of lost lives, but PG-13 is still PG-13 and it does give the film a lighter edge - an R-rating would have allowed them more freedom to really examine the full extent of the atrocities in Rwanda.Nevertheless, for being restricted to a PG-13 rating it manages to translate its message rather well, and thanks to the lead performance by Don Cheadle it really does have moments of near-greatness. I wouldn't put it on the same level as ""Schindler's List,"" but it's still a haunting reminder of what happened in Rwanda."
thutton-2,"Apr 30, 2005",9/10,"I just finished watching Hotel Rwanda moments ago. It certainly didn't bore me. And I suppose I should say it was a good movie. But it's really just all part of that greater genre, the misery revolutions do to regular folks. It's something of a Doctor Zhivago in black skin.Still, it had it's contemporary twists. Like when the main character, an hotelier, informs the Hutu five-star general that although the Americans and Europeans may have left for now, they certainly have his name on their list as a war criminal for judgment later. ""That's how these people operate,"" he says. True enough.You should probably give it a squint. But I don't get the premise that the whites are somehow responsible for not stopping the bloodshed. Didn't colonization end a long time ago? Aren't these people responsible for managing their own fate now? And if not, then are we obligated morally to renew occupation? These questions, of course, are not explored.But the end titles do tell us that the hotelier is now happilly living with his extended family in Brussells. When the colonizers leave the colonized want to go with them. And who could blame them. Sub-Saharan Africa, as ever it has, sucks."
dhaufrect-1,"Jan 16, 2005",7/10,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is an historical drama with good merit. Terry George has directed this film independently, and therefore the budget constraints peek through. There is a very intense performance by Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina who does his best to save lives in a tragic situation in Africa. His wive, Tatiana Rusesabagina played by Sophie Okonedo is equally as inspiring in her empathic portrayal. Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, a United Nations Colonel, who is practically impotent in his ability to give aid to an impossible situation. Nolte is a drawback for he seems to read lines without any regard for believability. He fails to convince the audience that he is really a young United Nations military person. This movie is worth seeing for it's historical importance. An epic portrayal is lacking, but the essence remains. It is not a film of entertainment, but it is one for education."
old_prof,"Mar 11, 2005",10/10,"I live in Boise, Idaho, where the U.N. isn't the most popular organization around. (What is? Why, the N.R.A. of course. One of our U.S. Senators, re-elected w/o a Dem opponent last Nov., is actually on the national board of the N.R.A., but doesn't see this as a conflict of interest. My, wouldn't the N.R.A. have had a ball in Rwanda in the 1990's? But I digress.) Every Oct. 23 (U.N.

So far we have been ignored, but I hope if a few more Boiseans see this movie, where the U.N. is the only force for peace, progress & stability in a scene of total physical & moral chaos, it will convince them that the U.N. is indeed doing the job that no other organization will do. Along w/ the U.N. colonel, who is a hero of the movie, a young Red Cross worker (refreshingly portrayed as not dazzlingly pretty & not at all made-up) is a heroine. So let's hear it also for the International Red Cross!

jlangbert,"May 27, 2005",6/10,"Hotel Rwanda does a good job of glorifying the good in an African hotelier under terrible circumstances - kind of a black man's version of Schindler's List. It's all very believable, but I was left wanting to know a bit more about the background hatred of the Hutus and Tutsis. All that slaughter deserves a bit more than just calling the opposing tribes ""cockroaches."" At first, I thought of Cheadle as miscast for the role - too stoic and businesslike to be a savior, but he did grow on me a bit as the film ran on. By the end, I actually believed him. (Unlike Nick Nolte, who was miscast for his role. Oh admit it, he's miscast for every role he's ever had -- he just can't act.) I'm giving this one a 6: you probably won't regret renting it, but you won't want to see it a second time."
stu9003,"Mar 28, 2005",10/10,"Simply outstanding. This movie should have won Best Picture. It's an incredibly moving film that can inspire you, horrify you, bring you to tears and also make you ashamed that you didn't do anything about it. Don Cheadle gives an incredible performance as Paul Rusesabagina, the hero of the story, a man who risked his own life to save the lives of over a thousand refugees. Paul was an incredible negotiator who always seemed to be able to negotiate his way out of any situation. That he risked his own life for so many others is inspirational.The scene where all the whites left Rwanda was one of the most emotional scenes I've ever watched. 10/10"
Prismark10,"Nov 23, 2014",6/10,"Making a film of the genocide that took place in Rwanda in 1994 is not an easy thing to do as you need to find a hook to grab the viewers and keep them interested. I have already seen Shooting Dogs which was released at a similar time and also dealt with the events of the Rwandan conflict.Hotel Rwanda sees Don Cheadle playing a luxury hotel manager Paul, a Hutu who spends his time charming people of influence. His wife is Tutsi and the he is respected by the corporate owners of the hotel based in Belgium.As the conflict escalates and using bribes in terms of money and booze to some sympathetic Hutu bigwigs to tune a blind eye he brings over some Tutsi neighbours and his family to the hotel.Once the UN decide that the country is too dangerous and decide to leave and leave the Tutsis to their deaths, Paul opens up the hotel to the Tutsis and then figure out how to get everyone to safety as the Hutu militia are sensing blood.The film is based on true events and has a docu-drama feel to it by director Terry George. The film has strong performances from Cheadle, Nick Nolte and Sophie Okonedo.Maybe because I saw Shtting Dogs first there was an element of seen it all before. The film could had done with more spikiness as to why UN forces left people to such a fate when they were supposed to be protecting them."
green_faeries,"Mar 26, 2005",N/A,"Hotel Rwanda The true story of a man who saved over 1000 people (many of them very young children) from slaughter. Close to a million Tutsis died because the west didn't want to risk the lives of 300 of their own - these 300 people who have histories, families, loved ones, blah blah who were so much more important and valuable apparently. Instead of sending in the requested urgent intervention to protect over a million people marked for death, the west washed their hands of these people.Based on the footage I have seen from various documentaries on the genocide, I believe that this film is an entirely accurate portrayal of what happened (except, of course, the language would have been French, not English). Filmed on site in Kigali, the painstaking attention to detail in the film made you realise exactly what it would have felt like to witness the situation unfold right before your eyes. I feel I can understand how it's possible to not see (or believe) something like that is imminent until too late. We all ""have"" these reassurances in the back of our minds that this sort of thing can't happen, that humanity won't let it happen, that someone in power somewhere will make sure this kind of thing won't happen. That surely it's someone's job somewhere to ensure this can't happen.I watched this film with my friend Lucy, who was in Rwanda as an aid worker shortly after the genocide - she's even been to the hotel itself.But what you realise is that, in reality, you really can be abandoned by the world, even if they know FULL WELL what's going to happen to you, even if they know FULL WELL that they'll regret not helping when they should have and be so very ashamed of themselves later. Humans seem to sometimes prefer to be ashamed later than to risk their necks in the now.You forget you're sitting in a cinema - you are in Rwanda for those 2 hours. I felt a whole spectrum of emotions - I was scared, sad, horrified, angry, I felt the tension and relief for the characters at every turn, etc as the scenes unfolded.Lucy said it best - we were both shell-shocked when we came out. I had my tissue in my hand."

rebbardoux,"Oct 13, 2005",10/10,"Quite simply a brilliant movie. It has a great balance between style and theme. It is refined, artly, but at the same time it has that rare quality of a work of art that talks about something essential. It is simply a must-see movie, a lesson for all other movie-makers that thought that a horror-reality is enough to provide a quality end-product. Extremely well-played and directed, this is a movie that goes far beyond its context and will perhaps become a point of reference for several reasons at least: its treatment of image, pictural and subtle; the screenplay, concise and balanced, the whole product which offers the impression of something complete to which you cannot add or take anything from."
mtwalsh81,"Feb 18, 2005",10/10,"I'm going to put it this way - movies do not usually get to me. Even if I cry, laugh, scream, etc...I'm not usually bothered on a deeper level. ""Hotel Rwanda"" actually hurt to watch, but in a positive way. I was completely drawn into the movie, and the fact that I knew it was based on actual events made it that much more compelling. The only other movie I can possibly think of to compare it to is ""Schindler's List."" This movie reminded me of why I go see movies. Not only did I enjoy the film and the acting (Don Cheadle is amazing), but it made me want to learn more about the actual events in Rwanda which I am ashamed to admit I don't know that much about. I don't know if this comment will actually make anyone want to go see the movie, but I had to voice a comment for this movie. Best movie I have seen in years."

I simply don't understand why not having Nick Nolte as the real Canadian Colonel, Mrs Romeo Dallaire. Was that because the film producer were scare to face the controversy, which in my opinion is totally false, Romeo Dallaire is a decent human being, a hero, thank god he did survive to tell the true. I feel so sorry for all the people involve in this event, this massacre, and I feel a shame to be Canadian and WHITE. We could have done something, this is what our voting right is for, this is what freedom is suppose to be against, if not then why are we electing politician and trying so hard to show a good image of how Canadian are. We are no longer peace keepers, the world has never been much different, this is just to pretend to be the good guys. Before you are able to preserve peace you must be able to implement peace.

ferguson-6,"Jan 29, 2005",9/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Don Cheadle's Academy Award nomination for Hotel Rwanda is a well deserved and a wonderful thing. Hopefully it will encourage even more to see director Terry George's incredibly moving tale of the 1994 Rwanda crisis between the Tutsis and the Hutu. As with Schindler's List, nothing is more powerful than a real life hero. Paul Rusesabagina is a real life hero. With the slaughter of nearly a million right outside his front gate, Paul R gave refuge to nearly 1000 who surely would have died. The tour de force by Cheadle is with his divergent performance from the elegant Hotel manager to the smooth negotiator to the passionate husband, parent and humanist. This man cares about people and what is right. Although, Nick Nolte's performance was slightly askew, the movie is well paced and heartfelt and should be seen by many. Very powerful."
richard-basye,"May 26, 2006",10/10,"One of the better movies I've seen in a long time. This movie and ""Lord of War"" make nice bookends on the some crises in Africa that are ignored by the West. Although one would think that it would have something of a documentary or ""victim's movie"" feel it is also very entertaining, and you can take your eyes off of the screen once you start. This is one movie that Hollywood and the filmmakers of the world do deserve applause for, the main character, who is a real person- Paul Rusesabagina, who is a real world who is hero without weapons. The movie also did a good job in showing the plight of the UN Soldiers, who are often painted as unfeeling robots when in fact they do very much care about the refugees they are trying to protect and save. More movies like this need to be made."
KineticSeoul,"Apr 16, 2010",7/10,"Some people say that this is like the African version of ""Schindler's List"" now I wouldn't go that far, but it still is a fantastic and powerful film. The movie is basically about the Rwandan Genocide that took place in 1994, where many Tutsi are killed by the Hutu extremists. Probably hardly any one cared about this atrocity that didn't have to go through it and I enjoyed the aspects of it showing why. Don Cheadle really was perfect for this role, and he put on a great performance here and it's one of those films he most definitely was worth being in. There is also a deep message, although it isn't a movie I would see multiple times or anything, but it was most definitely worth the time to see it at least once. If I can name one flaws is that you don't really care about the people that are trying to survive from the genocide, but maybe that is just the realistic aspect of it and why the message behind this film is deep.7.9/10"
george.schmidt,"Dec 27, 2004",N/A,"HOTEL RWANDA (2004) **** Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix. (Dir: Terry George)""Schindler's List"" meets ""The Killing Fields"" by way of ""Casablanca"" ; Cheadle's triumphant career bestWhat would you do if suddenly you found yourself in the oncoming path of a genocide? That is the question that South African Paul Rusesabagina faced ten years ago when the Hutu militia hunted down its Tutsi citizens determined to wipe out these 'cockroaches'.Rusesabagina (played beautifully by Cheadle who deserves an Oscar nomination) is a mild-mannered yet savvy businessman who works as a hotel manager in Rwanda in 1994 who has put on blinders to the unrest in his nation that suddenly sets its all-too-true reality in his neighborhood one night when he witnesses one of his neighbors being dragged bodily from his home by a jeep of Army soldiers and then beaten when he resists. Life as he knows it is now over as this is the tip of iceberg to what events lay in wait.Determined to save his small neighborhood and his family l Rusesabagina maneuvers one of the hotel's van shuttles crammed with his friends and family to the Hotel Demille where he works as a refugee site. Shortly thereafter the hotel is inundated with scores of fleeing Tutsis seeking solace and Paul must then decide what can be done to keep the bloodshed at bay.On hand is the UN soldiers led by Canadian Col. Oliver (a world-weary Nolte doing some fine supporting work) who informs Paul that things are only getting worse for the most part and as predicted the black South Africans will not be rescued leaving the ingenuity and quick thinking of Paul to keep things on track until they manage a form of escape.Director Terry George racks up the suspense and dread without resorting to any truly graphic images of the war at hand and the uprisings depict the machete brandishing hordes at a safe distance yet there is no doubt of just how horrific the proceedings at hand are in some truly unnerving moments including Paul's decision to get supplies in the dead of night when he encounters what he fears the most  that things in fact are only worse than he could have ever imagined.Cheadle, one of our finest and most versatile actors working today, gives his portrayal of a decent, ordinary and extraordinary man that many of us would only aspire to be in the face of death and the threat of violence so thick in the air it would more than likely only cause paralysis to contemplate a next move in a morbid game of chess  a dignity that encompasses the entire film and spread to his co-stars, namely the stoic Okonedo as Paul's wife Tatiana who also provides some soul and tenderness yet a stern anger fueled turn.Inevitably there are comparisons to ""Schindler's List"", ""The Killing Fields"" and even ""Casablanca"" yet the film stands alone in its defiance to what mob mentality is about and how prejudice is much deeper than what is on the surface. This is one of the most inspiring, harrowing journeys into fear and is one of the year's very best."
esteban1747,"May 1, 2005",8/10,"Although I visited Rwanda shortly before the war I do not remember 1000 colins hotel in Kigali. Certainly there was a tragedy in this tiny African country where brothers- I do not make any differentiation between tall Tutsi minority and somewhat small Hutu majority - were fighting each other. Probably all this hate started at the time of colonialism when the Tutsi were more favored by the Belgians, and once the country got the independence, a Tutsi kingdom was established with discrimation over Hutu population, which lasted not for long. The Hutu defeated the Tutsi and came to power with a Republic that continued the discrimination this time against Tutsi. In that country was compulsory for everyone to have the ethnic indication in the identity card. The film is only touching the final phase of the war between Tutsi guerrilla who was coming from the North of the country and the Hutu extremists, who were able to kill its own president, as it is shown in the film, just because he signed in Nairobi a peace agreement. In the film one can see how Hutus were killing innocent Tutsi population, and how international community was weakly reacting to this mass assassination. Unfortunately, it did not show how many Hutu families were coming from the North to Kigali. The film finished with the victory of Tutsi, but was it the end of this war? Not at all, Hutu escaped to Goma in the neighboring Congo, and many of them died again in war established between both groups, but no in their land. So if Hollywood makes several sequels of non sense films as ""Terminator"", ""Die Hard"" and others, it would be wise to prepare a sequel of ""Rwanda Hotel"" showing what happened after the Tutsi conquered Kigali, and how this confrontation finished, or perhaps to prepare a similar film of the tragedy in neighboring Burundi, where the same groups are still fighting. Don Cheadle acted very well but somewhat different to the role he played in the film ""Rosewood"". In ""Hotel Rwanda"" he was a Hutu but married to a Tutsi lady and with several children, always looking for peace and understanding."
MichaelMargetis,"Apr 15, 2005",9/10,"I remember viewing many powerful and great movies last year, but something about 'Hotel Rwanda' stuck with me more than a lot of the others. 'Hotel Rwanda' is about the unbelievably sad and horrible incident that shook Rwanda to it's very foundations eleven years ago. It was April 1994 and almost no one could predict how nasty things would turn in a matter of days, and how many lives would be shattered. 'Hotel Rwanda' is the incredibly haunting and mesmerizing true story about one man who saved the life's of many of his fellow men during this period of Genocide and conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi citizens in Rwanda.The story revolves around Paul Russesabegina (played expertly by Don Cheadle), a hotel manager of a four-star resort in Rwanda. Paul's an extremely generous and chivalrous person who gets caught up in a very unsettling situation. Tragedy strikes Rwanda when the Hutu leader of the nation is assassinated by a band of rebel Tutsi forces. The Hutu citizens and government go absolutely crazy and start trying to annihilate all of the Tutsi citizens. After this starts happening all the Americans get rushed out of Rwanda (especially all the non-African hotel managers) and Paul is left to fend for himself and his family and friends in Brutal Rwanda. Paul turns out to be like an African version of Oskar Schindler, and turns his hotel into a refugee camp for the prosecuted Tutsis, including his wife and children who are also Tutsi. Paul is able to accomplish this by his cunningness to trick the Hutu government by not only paying them off, but telling them the American government is watching them through satellites and will charge them as war criminals if they do anything to them. Paul also has the help of a peace officer (played by Nick Nolte), who helps him bribe the Hutu government and try to rush the Tutsi citizens out of Rwanda.Despite a few of the films shortcomings, it's a little overlong and drags during it's third act, it's still an excellent production and showcases some wonderful performances. Don Cheadle gives the best performance of his career as the title character. He gives a powerhouse character embodiment that's riveting all the way through the film. You can tell he really poured his heart into this very crucial role, and he should have won the Oscar over Jamie Foxx (in my opinion). Sophie Okonedo is very impressive as Paul's strong, independent and caring wife. She definitely deserved her Oscar nomination, and Nick Nolte gives us some of the finest work we've seen in fifteen years. Joaquin Phoenix does a nice job in the role of a photo journalist in Rwanda during this time, and Jean Reno is pretty good as the owner of the hotel Paul manages. The cinematography is interesting, and the screenplay is especially compelling. The directing has it's few flaws, but the musical score is always effective in stirring up emotion.All in all, 'Hotel Rwanda' is definitely worth renting and/or buying on DVD. You can count on me having it in my DVD collection in the not-so-distant future. I think all the U.N. members elected during this time should be forced to watch it and confront their decision not to help out these poor people, especially Bill Clinton.

alioncaci,"Jul 18, 2021",7/10,"The problem starts when you give third world stories to first world directors and writer. As much as they can try, they will never understand what it feels like. And it's not their fault because they've been way too far from the things that happen in this movie.There is nothing romantic about the war. You don't seat in a terrace having a romantic dinner with your wife while listening to rocket and gun shots half a mile away. That's confusing for the public but I guess that's how Hollywood works. They don't care to explain the story and tell that to the world as closer as they can. They are like UN in this movie: they just don't care about Rwandan people.I hadn't seen this movie before but I was told it would be good because I just saw ""Quo Vadis, Aida?"" which is a new movie about the Serbian genocide in Srebenica (Bosnie). Please watch also this to really understand the term ""powerful film."
charlie5-1,"May 11, 2006",10/10,"I am watching this film right now. It is truly amazing. Earlier I watched 'Sometimes In April', also about Rwanda. Horrific. The western world, including the USA, the French and the Belgians ought to be ashamed forever. What in the world were the superpowers and the UNO thinking of in the 1990s when they allowed Rwanda, Bosnia etc to slaughter hundreds and thousands guilty only of being born to a certain ethnicity. Shame..........shame...shame...on us all is my opinion. This film, this story is a warning to us of the dangers of hatred towards those who are only different to us.The acting was superb, the portrayal of the story and the characterisation of the players in Rwanda was equally superb."
The_Triad,"Jun 22, 2006",7/10,"Hotel Rwanda is an important film, it's subject matter is of an extremely serious nature, in a similar to the likes of Schindler's List. It depicts the events of a genocide in Rwanda in 1994, during which Hutu man Paul Rusesabagina shelters the endangered Tutsi civilians from the angry machete-armed Hutus. The film handles it's subject matter very well, telling precisely why these two ""types"" of people, (they are really only different in name, which was given to them by Belgian imperialists based on vague classifications) are not getting along, without being too simple. The film than follows the Schindler's List formula, with Paul trying to shelter as many of the Tutsis that come his way, and hold off the Hutus for as long as possible. The acting, script, score, cinematography etc. are all of a good standard, though nothing really stood out for me (which in this case is a good thing as it enhances the realism). The film should also be praised for challenging the viewers watching, in a line that Jack Daglish's character (the cameraman) says. The film is difficult to watch at times, and works as it's own film very well. It's only major failing is that it may seem a bit samey for those who have seen Schindler's List, or even Lord of War, or any other film with genocide as the subject matter."
peter_hyde,"Apr 25, 2010",7/10,"I just saw Hotel Rwanda on PBS, and after reading other reviews here, I must admit I felt let down. It was admittedly well made, but didn't leave any lasting impression. Probably because it was basically an excellent solo show by Don Cheadle. Sophie Okonedo was badly miscast; whoever saw a Tutsi that light-complexioned? Nick Nolte just wasn't believable as a General. Some may criticise me for being too bloodthirsty, but apart from the episode when Cheadle was driving over the bodies in the road, the depiction of the treatment of Tutsi was too long-range and detached. It seemed like a news report viewed from a distance, without any real involvement. This is the story of an horrific episode, but fails to press its point."
nigreco451,"Dec 4, 2020",1/10,"In the true story Paul Rusesabagina charged large sums of money from those who sought refuge in his hotel. The Ibuka group of Tutsi survivors has stated multiple times that this film is completely false, and that in reality Paul is a mobster who has already been arrested with international endorsement for financing subversive and terrorist groups (search him on Google). Please, don't let the Hollywood lobby take us for idiots."
earlkaplan,"Feb 7, 2005",N/A,"Although I am not sure it was intended as such, this movie shows what George W. was thinking about when he decided to go it alone (so to speak) in Iraq. The UN is a toothless warrior. Its teeth have been removed by France and other nations that make money selling weapons to the people who commit the atrocities.Yes, I know we have been among those nations. That does not make it right.The West gave black nations technology and material goods. They never bothered teaching ethics or morality. Now these black nations are struggling to find a way to adapt to the world they have been dumped into without the benefit of an evolutionary educational process.A good movie."
OriginalMovieBuff21,"Apr 16, 2005",8/10,"I rented Hotel Rwanda, with great expectations for this film. Getting an 8.5 on IMDb and with 3 nominations, who who wouldn't want to see it? After I watched the film, I was pleased with what I saw. Don Cheadle played a wonderful performance as Paul Rusesabagina which earned Cheadle an Oscar nomination. The whole film actually reminded me of Schindler's List. The film is almost an identical twin of Schindler's List. Paul Rusesabagina is an Oskar Schindler type person. There the same people. The only thing different them is that there from different countries and are a different race. That's it. Overall, I liked Hotel Rwanda and I wasn't disappointed with the movie at all. There was a few slow parts to the film and some disturbing images that some viewers shouldn't see, but still an extremely powerful and great delivered performances that keeps this movie on it's heels. I recommend Hotel Rwanda.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B"
ruttanun_w,"Jun 19, 2007",9/10,"It's amazing. This is one of the best movies I ever seen.Actually,I had some background about the genocide of the country before watching it so I thought it made me feel like I was really in the movie and it was so touchy.I wanna recommend any who wants to explore the movie to get some little info about this genocide beforehand. Then you will have clearer picture when you see the movie and with the fact you will understand how much terrible situation happened there. As a human being, you would never thought about this violence to be occur in our real world and it had just happened not more than 20 years ago. I cried and and due to unexpected scene I had my mouth opened many times."
kcollis1985,"Dec 11, 2009",7/10,"The story is inspiring, and the film deserves praise for shining a spotlight on issues that the west chooses to ignore. So, whilst it may seem uncharitable to criticise, it would be patronising to overlook the glaring faults. Even though the film isn't that bad, it is disappointing. The problem is that the film-making is second rate - you can't help but be distracted by the mechanics of the film.The film is overscored. Barely a line of dialogue passes without music telling the audience what they ought to be feeling. This device demeans and patronises the viewer. The blatant product placement throughout the film destroys any attempt at nuance or subtlety. You can't help but pity the actors who have to perform awful dialogue about beer brands or car manufacturers. Even when they are not forced to read dialogue that might as well have come from an infomercial, the dialogue is clunky - and at times woeful. The result is a stack of poorly developed, two- dimensional characters.Social/ political/ historical complexities are either ignored our disposed of in one line. The Hutus are largely portrayed as soulless killing machines pitted against our 'western-friendly' bourgeois hero (the only good Hutu), his family, and periphery characters. The result is that scenes start to feel more like a horror movie than a serious drama. Inexplicably, the filmmakers deliberately chose to omit actual events (possibly to ensure a PG-13 certificate), which would have given the film a greater sense of jeopardy for main characters.It's a credit to the actors involved that some of them manage to feel in any way human. Particular credit is due to Sophie Okonedo who is required to make ridiculous mood swings feel believable. Joaquin Phoenix also does well.Not terrible, but certainly not great."
roberte14,"Feb 27, 2005",9/10,"When referring to ""genocide"", the average American would automatically correlate the word to the Holocaust. However, it's amazing to think that the Western nations allowed another genocide to occur that could have been so easily prevented. I would find it hard to believe if 5% of the American population knew that a million Africans died in Rwanda. However, it's that fact that makes the desperation and isolation of the primary characters in this film seem so terrifying and heart-wrenching to the viewer. If for no other reason, but to awaken Westerners to the genocide in Africa this film would have served great purpose.However, the brave story within the story is what separates the film form simply a tragic historical piece into one of the best films of the year. Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo provide depth and believability to rich characters wrought with unconceivable choices and bravery. It is a great story of survival and you should leave the film feeling guilty why you didn't know why you know this was happening and why Western leaders didn't stop it."
fastmike,"Apr 25, 2005",7/10,"I do not intend to sound sarcastic by my above 'one-line-summary'; for if the real life Paul Rusesabagina, a 'Hutu', did the things he was portrayed to do, to save hundreds of 'Tutsi', then indeed there is a comparison with great people of conscience like Oscar Schindler.The story is that of the infamous 'ethnic cleansing' of minority Tutsi's by their nationalist rivals, the Hutu's. The film also cleverly weaves in the reasons for the deep ethnic hatred between these peoples, by ordinary conversations between locals and European visitors.The violence is not nearly as bad as one might expect. In fact, the actual news reel footage that the world 'witnessed' at the time of this genocide was far, far worse than the movie portrays.The film will rivet you to the screen, as you follow 'Paul' beg, borrow, steal and bribe to save the lives of the 'hotel guests' Well worth seeing, a little bit 'over' on the acting but smartly sensitive to the brutal violence that Hollywood so often turns out, (even in its' jests) just a wee bit to long but,still, a story that need to be told, and more importantly needs to be heard."
Miroslav-27,"Nov 15, 2021",7/10,"Watched in 2021. Despite knowing more about Paul Rusesabagina now than we did when this movie came out in 2004, I could still appreciate the film. The content alone tells a powerful (albeit sad) story. Rusesabagina may have gone from hero to zero in some people's eyes since then, but the fact remains that the genocide in Rwanda left roughly a million corpses in its wake and people need to learn about what happened.Poignant and heart-wrenching at times, Hotel Rwanda paints a very raw picture of those tragic times. I watched the movie with a broken heart and dose of white guilt which makes me think the producers and director accomplished their goals.There were a few flaws that kept me from scoring the movie in the upper echelon of 8-10 though. The film rushes into the conflict without enough explanation to set the stage for the viewer. There was a slightly convoluted character spread which could have used more distinction. Plus, I would have liked to learn more about what happened to some of the other characters after the movie ended. All-in-all though, Cheadle puts in a memorable performance and there are some powerful moments that make you hold your breath (and your loved ones) which create this grim, but cinematically satisfactory, look into a dark time in history.Verdict: Watch."
skycloudtree,"Sep 14, 2005",3/10,"I saw this movie with high expectations-- the media and classmates all gushed about how wonderful and powerful and moving it was. Well, it wasn't. I felt guilty the whole time I was watching it, because I didn't ""feel"" anything. In fact I found it to be a pretty boring/sterile film save for the moment in the middle where the hotel owner walks in the foggy cloud among dead bodies. I can't believe that this was supposed to be about the real, devastating events that actually happened in Rwanda. I bet most of people who gave this movie rave reviews are just compensating for their previous ignorance and apathy. It's a mediocre, shallow movie parading itself as a powerful film about the great feat of a man standing up for humanity and protecting refugees during a time of ethnic genocide. Instead of wasting your time with this pathetic attempt, look up the subject and read the literature instead.

seaview1,"Jan 26, 2005",N/A,"A decade ago, the country of Rwanda underwent a costly civil war which claimed countless lives while a whole world stood by. In the true story of Hotel Rwanda, one ordinary man took it upon himself to save as many people as he could even risking his own life and the lives of his family.This hotel is a luxurious venue for travelers (mostly white) to spend a pleasant trip while attended to by the staff and its manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle). Ominous signs in the news and rumors point to growing hostilities between two ethnic groups, the minority and former ruling group of Tutsis and the majority group of Hutus. A militaristic movement among the Hutus begins to form even as an impending peace treaty is brokered. When one leader is assassinated, all hell breaks loose. This is civil war at its worst as the Hutus begins to attack and kill the Tutsis en masse. It is the beginning of a genocide that will claim close to a million lives as the United Nations does relatively little to intervene.As the white guests are escorted to safety by United Nations troops, things grow desperate for those left behind. Paul starts to shelter a few people including his own family and then more refugees until over 1200 fearful souls seek safety in the hotel. In some instances, it is out of necessity that he take in people who have nowhere to go. Pretty soon he realizes that he must do all he can to save his people and himself. This means calling on favors and relationships with any and all who can help, and frequently it means the difference between life and death. There are numerous occasions where the military is ready to take the refugees away or execute them and Paul on the spot. There is stark evidence of the increasing atrocities as homes are burned and bodies litter the roads. Bribes and supplies begin to run short, and as the outnumbered UN forces return to escort only a limited number to safety, the rebels begin to descend on them and the hotel.As a shameful, cautionary tale of what happened when the world ignored its most needy, Hotel Rwanda serves its purpose, but the main thrust of the story is the love Paul has for his wife and children and the determination to save them. The important thing is how he responds to the horrific events and how he must think his way out of seemingly impossible situations. It is truly remarkable how resourceful the real Paul Rusesabagina was in staving off doom.As portrayed by Don Cheadle, we understand his thought processes and feel his pain. He never loses his humanity and compassion for his fellow man. It is a splendid job of acting. Ironically, Cheadle (who was not considered box office leading material by the studios) has leaped into the forefront of leading men for good after having spent most of his career in strong supporting parts (Bulworth, Oceans 11, Out of Sight). Sophie Okonedo is quite good as the wife who must fight for her family and support her beleaguered husband. Nick Nolte plays a recurring part as a UN officer whose units of soldiers are virtually powerless to help. Joaquin Phoenix has a small role as a news cameraman witnessing the beginning slaughter and Jean Reno has a good cameo as a hotel executive in France who proves to be a valuable ally.Although, there was initial difficulty in securing financing for this project, director Terry George (who also wrote the screenplay with Keir Pearson) does not seem to have skimped on his visuals. The massive crowd scenes and evidence of mass execution are thorough and impressive. It is as if we are living a real life documentary about war. He does a nice job of contrasting the chaos in the countryside with the peaceful, relative calm inside the hotel. He also manages to balance the tension and terror with a few effective moments of honest humor especially with Paul's family-quite a feat.While there are obvious similarities in theme to Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda's protagonist is not only the benefactor, but he becomes a potential victim, thus raising the stakes. Even with a PG-13 rating compared to Schindler's R rating, this is no less compelling history and the events no less despicable. George does not have the directorial flourishes of Spielberg, but his film succeeds on an emotional level.Although the subject matter may cause potential audiences to pause, those who want an intelligent, honest depiction of one man's remarkable acts of heroism amid an unthinkable tragedy will not be disappointed. It is a courageous film that teaches the audience about individual responsibility and choice. It is about one man making a difference for over a thousand of his countrymen amid the horror and chaos even as the world turned its back.**** out of **** (every bit as good as the five Oscar nominated Best Pictures of 2004)"
stnowhere001,"Jan 29, 2005",10/10,"Ever since seeing a program on television about the circumstances of the Rwandan genocide, I have become somewhat of a student of the issue. And sure, the Interahamwe didn't kill as many people as the Nazis, or even Pol Pot, but the brutality of slaughtering nearly a million people, most by machete, more than makes up for the numbers. And the abandonment, the sheer disregard for anything African that the West perpetrated on Rwanda, that should make all of us ashamed of our governments.You should see this movie. Everyone should see this movie. Exquisite performances by Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo bring to life the desperation of simply holding on to life with the proverbial barbarians at the gate (right at the gate, as it was), and all while Cheadle's Rusesabagina clings tenaciously to the image and prestige of his hotel, giving his best when everything else falls apart. How the real life Paukl managed to keep it all together, bribe the army, keep the militia at bay is nothing short of a miracle, and the cast brings that to you in such sharp detail that you can't feel anything but the utmost admiration and astonishment for everyone who kept it together.Rusesabagina, General Dallaire, and many others are the true measure of hero. They gave everything they had to make sure that 800,000 didn't turn into millions."
aubreysparrow,"Mar 30, 2005",10/10,"Don Cheadle stars in this emotionally heartrending depiction of when the world turned its back on Rwanda when its innocent civilians cried out for help. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is the manager of the five-star Hotel Milles Collines in Kigali. In 1994, Hutu extremists took over the country wanting to terminate all of the Tutsi people. With most of the world unconcerned and unsympathetic, and U.N. peace-keepers ineffective, the Hutu's had a green-light to slaughter more than one-million Tutsi's.Paul is married to a Tutsi (played by Actress Sophie Okonedo) and decided to allow Tutsi refugees to live in the hotel; holding off the soldiers with bribes such as wine. But bribery only works for some time as his wine reserves begin to run dry and he is forced to make hard decisions and take a stand to save not only the Tutsi people, but also his half-Tutsi family.Hotel Rwanda is a very important movie that shows how senseless religious and cultural hatred could result in the decimation of so many innocent lives. It also demonstrates how little the world truly cared about this little country and it's Cival War, as one character put it: ""If people see this footage, they'll go, 'Oh my God! Thats horrible!"" then go on eating their dinner."" During some scenes, the movie is raw and violent, but it's true eminence and heart comes from the emotional struggle Paul has to endure to save the people he loves and the people he has developed bonds with. Hotel Rwanda is a powerful movie with a throat-clenching, underlying message of what happens when humanity is lost in the harshness of war, and reclaimed in one person's quest to ask why.-Rawan Aqil"
ksapmorgan,"Apr 13, 2005",10/10,"After watching this movie last night in the privacy of my own home, I was left sorry and embarrassed. Embarrassed by the fact that in 1994 I was well old enough to have paid more attention to events going on in the world around me. I keep hearing the comment uttered by (Joaquin Phoenix's character)as they were leaving...I'm so ashamed! I had no idea! I am so glad I saw this movie so that now I personally can be more aware of similar tragedies going on in the world around me today! Thank you to the writers, directors, producers, actors, and everyone else involved with making this film. Without people like you, people like me would have never known."
mOVIemAN56,"Apr 12, 2005",10/10,"Rwanda. A small country in the heart of Africa. Normal government, normal people, normal country. Until the day everything changed. the year is 1994 and Rwanda has fallen into civil war between the Tutsi and Hutu parties of the country. Caught in the middle is a hotel manager named Paul Rosesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his family.At first Paul tries to help only his family but soon finds himself housing over a thousand Tutsi and Hutu refugees in his luxurious hotel. With the help of camera operator Jack Daglish (Joaquin Phoenix) and U.N. officer Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte)he is able to save the people from the rebel army waiting at the gates. But soon Paul along with the refugees must fend for themselves as the foreign troops are evacuated from the capital.The movie is a powerhouse of emotions with accounts of people telling what they witnessed in the town. As the world turned its back, Paul Rosesabagina was able to save 1295 refugees through bribery, blackmail, and favors. Based on the true-life story of the man, the film gives you a sense of civil war and what is currently happening in the Sudan to millions.At some points you truly feel like breaking down and crying as you watch people being hit with machetes in the street and children lying dead on the road side.In my opinion, this is the best film of 2004 and Don Cheadle deserved Best Actor over Jamie Foxx (Ray, 2004) but that's my opinion.Hotel Rwanda. Starring: Don Cheadle, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Cara Seymour,and Sophie Okonedo.5 out of 5 Stars."
Ysman,"Nov 4, 2005",7/10,"So I finally get around to seeing Hotel Rwanda. A friend and I had a long standing engagement to get out and see this film however the forces that control these things conspired against that happening and as all movies eventually do, even good ones starring Don Cheadle, Hotel Rwanda left the theater. My friend and I would have to view something else.As luck and fate would have it, Hollywood studios like to make as much money as they can on any given film and so they released Hotel Rwanda to DVD which allows viewing movies outside of the theater in your own home or place of convenience (forgive me if I am going to fast.) As I have a Netflix account and in that account I have a queue of movies, Hotel Rwanda was sent to me without me having to do anymore than point and/or click. Since it was sent, I felt obligated to watch - a fact that my wife hates by the way - while she has no problem stopping watching films already in progress, I, by some freak genetic mutation, must watch them to their painful end regardless of how long or asinine - much like the South Park episode where Cartman had to finish singing Come Sail Away whenever he heard the beginning of the song . . . but I digress.For those not familiar: Hotel Rwanda stars Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who housed over a thousand Tutsis refugees during their struggle against the Hutu militia in Rwanda. The audience watches Paul's transformation from a man with style to a man with substance. (see the film - the quote makes more sense then.) So I watched IT - and here you are, dear reader, wondering how IT was. How do you think it was? Of course it was good, fine, Oscar nominated and all that. The story was heartfelt, Cheadle was stellar, impeccably shot. Heck, even the sound was good. And therein lies my problem - the film was all that I expected it to be and thus as I sit here thinking about it, I am terribly bored by it.How horrible! I am an unfeeling boob! He should be gutted and hung in a public square to remind little children on how not to live their lives! And to all of these things I would say yes, yes, and yes again. But that doesn't make Hotel Rwanda any better at entertaining me (a funny side note, the aforementioned friend, myself, and my wife all went to see Amistad one evening and were so bored by the slave trade film that we fell asleep which incensed our more social conscious audience members.) The problem is that Hotel Rwanda is so paint-by-the-numbers Oscar caliber that I wanted terribly for some Sofia Coppola-esquire Godfather 3 performance or some random death to shake me from my stupor. I took to the Internet to see if I was alone in my thoughts. Here are some quotes from the IMDb:larajane says: Watching with a friend, after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in Rwanda were. So to my shame, we had to read on the internet about what really happened, before we could continue. I say shame because we should have known, both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.and this from Julie-Gefter: i am frustrated because nothing i can type can represent how powerful this movie is or how much it moved me. i can't comment on the amazing acting or cinematography or directing because the movie transported me.and celiaricky loved the movie so much she ""ovated"" the director for 10 minutes - the lucky scoundrel: Just saw the San Francisco premier last night and it isn't a dramatization - it's much more of a documentary -- Hotel is extremely factual. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS FILM! INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE! The Director and the story's protagonist were at the screening to answer questions. We ovated him for almost 10 minutes.So there you have it - Hotel Rwanda was a good movie - a great movie by most accounts - that, I'd be willing to say if 'tweren't based on true facts would have been a nice little HBO original film. Cheadle is greatness - but watch Boogie Nights or Devil in a Blue Dress for a more impressive performance. And to all IMDb readers - I'm sorry I suck.Movie notes: Hotel Rwanda is 121 minutes long and rated PG-13 for brief strong language, Oscar worthy depictions of human atrocities, and disturbing images. Directed by Terry George who has brought you other true life moving experiences such as A Bright Shinning Lie and the second episode of season one of the District. It stars Don Cheadle who is good in everything he does, on and off camera."
iohefy-2,"Feb 16, 2005",8/10,"This film is a documentary of man's inhumanity to man and is a very disturbing film. Don Cheadle is very good in his part and is certainly worthy of nomination for an Academy Award, although I do not think his performance is as good as Leonard DeCaprio in the Aviator or Jamie Foxx who was Ray in the movie of the same name. The rest of the cast was very good in their parts, but I was disappointed in the bit part that Nick Nolte had in this fine picture. It is a shame to see some one so talented have his career go down the tubes because of a drinking problem. You have to have a strong stomach to watch this film but if you do you will be richly rewarded. We need more of the fine writing that is done in this film Hotel Rwanda. Go see this one you will be richly rewarded."
chrisgomez_01,"Sep 20, 2011",7/10,"A fascinating story, and a subject that I'm pleased to have learned slightly more (ie. something) about: the Rwandan civil war and genocide of the mid-nineties, and how it was played down and ignored by the West.The central performance by Don Cheadle is strong and his character likable and understandable. However, most of the characters were barely developed at all. An awful lot of story is crammed in, and most of it is only lightly brushed over - I think it would have worked better if some elements were left out and the remaining ones covered in more depth. Worse, the tone of the film started very well, but became increasingly syrupy as it went on. However, the story-telling is very efficient, especially at the beginning; it wasn't difficult to follow a fairly complex plot and it maintained my interest all the way through.Well worth a watch, but I won't be buying it."
TheAngryBanana,"Feb 25, 2005",10/10,"For me, Terry George's Hotel Rwanda was easily the best and most memorable movie of 2004. It's difficult to call a movie about a terrible tragedy such as the Rwandan genocide of 1994, but in every aspect, this movie is excellent. Yes, the movie is one of the most upsetting pieces I have ever seen, but this is only an indication of the greatness of the Hotel Rwanda. The actors (especially Cheadle) are so believable in each of their roles, that it does not take long for the audience to take an interest in the main figures, their lives, and the lives of their friends and neighbors. This fact makes the suffering of those who witnessed and fell during the Rwandan massacre both on film and in actuality so much more real.Also, much credit must be given to the director, Terry George. In a film revolving around an incidence of genocide (in which many victims were hacked to death with machetes no less) it would be easy for the story and tragedy to be lost amidst a depiction of the excessive violence that occurred. However, while there is obviously a good share of violence in Hotel Rwanda, George avoids excessive gore and instead relies more on fear to express the suffering of the refugees at Rusesabagina's hotel. George instead shows the aftermath of violence (hundreds of corpses covering a road), the threat of violence, and especially, feelings of alienation and separation (the abandonment of Rwandan refugees by the western world). All these elements really draw the audience in and force the viewers to feel the pain and suffering felt by the refugees.The excellence of Hotel Rwanda also makes it a very humbling movie. It forces those who live in the western world to acknowledge the atrocities that resulted from their countries pretending a massive problem did not exist. Possibly the most depressing fact that Hotel Rwanda asserts is in the last image of the entire movie, where simple white words on a black background remind the audience that nearly a million people died during this period of genocide, a toll that may have been dramatically lessened had the world not turned its back. Thus, in its greatness, the movie is also very shaming, a fitting feeling given the words of Rusesabagina in the movie, ""we must shame them into acting."" More than once I was reduced to tears watching this movie, as were many other members of the (unfortunately) slim audience present in the theater. Truly, this is a movie that all should see."

I had heard a lot about it, and was expecting (as many people said) a new 'Schindler's List'.I am sorry to say that a theme, even when so important and shamefully unspoken as the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, doesn't necessary make a masterpiece.The cinematography was as ugly, televisionized and cake-like as possible; the characters weren't well developed. the movie was fairly acted, nothing more. (except for Sophie Okonedo, she was a real revelation).But most of all, that terrible genocide is barely shown. And it is extremely cleaned up. Bodies here and there. Almost no blood. But the images that came out of that event in 1994 were way different and shocking. There were so many butchered corpses in the rivers that you almost couldn't see the water. They really used machetes to slaughter them. Children did it, under the use of drugs. This movie shows a sugary version of it all, and doesn't make you feel the terror and the horror of these days. By filming it so, this genocide seems almost accepted and closed. It has happened, that's it.It probably made a lot of people feel shame for their ignorance, that is already something. Many probably documented themselves, thank god. Maybe some learned some more about Africa today. But this doesn't make it a good movie.What a disappointment. What a missed occasion. I wish Kevin MacDonald (The Last King of Scotland) or Fernando Meirelles (Cidade de Deus) or someone of that level directed it. Not this TV-movie director."
ggiacoman,"Feb 13, 2005",N/A,"I thought it was great and it did make me cry and that's saying something.I don't want to repeat what others have said, but I do love the fact that movies like this one help raise awareness of the terrible consequences our actions can have so that hopefully we may make wiser decisions in the future.Another movie that I would recommend for everyone who has watched this one would be Voces Inocentes from Luis Mandoki. This is another recent release and though I believe there is no distributor yet for the US, you should try to see it if you can. I left the theatre feeling many of the same things I felt when I saw Hotel Rwanda, but I was more sympathetic towards Voces because it portrayed war through the eyes of an innocent boy like I had never seen done before. The comic relief was also well-performed and timely.Two great movies that deserve our praise and to be watched by as many people as possible. Frankly, it seems that the people who should be watching it the most, aren't."
christopherletourneau,"Feb 24, 2005",10/10,"10/10 Best way to describe this movie is a cross between Schindler's List and The Pianist - two of the most powerful films I've ever seen. While Paul's (Don Cheadle) situation continues to get worse as the movie progresses just like Adrien Brody, he does whatever he can to help the Tutsi and Hutu refugees at his hotel. Cheadle is gripping - this from a man who has played a wide range of roles from a porn star with an identity crisis in Boogie Nights to Sammy Davis Jr. in the Rat Pack - and he supplements the troubling story of the country's civil war and genocide with a flawless performance. I immediately wanted to research the Rwanda situation after I saw the movie to learn more than the little I already knew - it truly was a war fought for outrageous reasons, and the ignorance of the rest of the world (something the movie did well to convey) at that time is hard to imagine. I would give Cheadle the nod for Best Actor, and the movie is a must-see for people of all backgrounds. An amazing film."
sidunrau,"Feb 5, 2005",9/10,"Every time I hear someone say there is no real ""good"" or ""evil"" in the world I think of things like Schindler's List, The Killing Fields, The Power of One and similar movies. Hotel Rwanda is now added to my list.This movie stirs the soul with a true story that is engaging, interesting, unspeakably sad, funny at times, and ultimately (for the lead focal family) triumphant. ButI kept asking myself while watching: Am I not related to all these people? Could I ever treat my fellow humans as cockroaches and vermin? How can people think of other people that way? If such a condition can exist in others, can it exist in me? If I saw human depravity around me, how much would I tolerate and wink at before I did something about it? And what WOULD I do about such things? Would I throw my hands up in hopelessness or would I find a way to alleviate pain and suffering? This movie is difficult to watch, yet it is important to watch. After watching it I felt closer to my family, friends, neighbors and others. Excellently portrayed. Not overly dramatic, yet poignant."
kramachandran,"Jun 26, 2007",10/10,"This movie is poetry in motion. Creative movie making at it's best. You cannot fault even the minutest aspect of this movie. So perfect is this movie in all respects. Don Cheadle does full justice to his role and his acting is superb. Every frame of this movie is gripping with suspense and thrill as to what fate awaits the helpless victims of the mindless genocide. Once you begin watching this movie it is hard to stop it halfway , and throughout the movie the edge of the seat suspense is maintained.But above all this movie is a triumph of the indefatigable human spirit, a triumph of good over evil, and a triumph of sanity in an atmosphere of madness. All of this is represented in that one man , Paul Rusesabagina. Throughout this movie this man grips our attention. When he cries we cry with him, when he laughs we laugh with him when he worries we worry too. In my opinion, very few movies can lay claim to this rare distinction. There are quite a few very violent and disturbing scenes but when the truth is stranger than fiction, there is no other alternative but to bare that. This movie is based on truth and the truth is quite shocking. It is enough to jolt a man from his nonchalance and stupor. In this context , it is shocking to see how the entire world watched this gruesome drama without lifting a finger to help. The helplessness of the UN , the shocking cowardice of the super powers and above all the failure of entire humanity itself is very movingly shown.But again in this depressing backdrop, the courage of this one man Paul Rusesabagina , his cleverness, his resourcefulness and above all his humaneness contrasts sharply and shouts aloud the message : That the whole world is one , that what a difference a few good men can make. And this voice of sanity will ring loud and clear and cannot be drowned out in the din and stench of the voices of madness.I can write an entire book of praises for this movie and all its aspects and still that wont be enough. I don't want to dissect this movie and kill its charms. But just one line will suffice : A thoroughly watchable movie!!"
Cube_TX,"Mar 1, 2005",9/10,"This movie was outright fantastic. Having seen both this film and Ray I felt that Don Cheadle deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture over Jamie Foxx (and, mind you, I think Jamie Foxx did an EXCELLENT job himself). The fact that this film wasn't nominated for Best Picture is outright ridiculous. This important film is very emotional and will leave you wondering what you were doing while all of this was going on. Most of us were watching OJ Simpson's trial.Don Cheadle's emotional performance deserves high praise. The scene where he is arguing with the general in the office of the Hotel Diplomat is his best work overall. I couldn't believe the outright emotion this man put into his strong performance. The death scenes are tear-jerking while abstaining from graphic violence. Death is never glorified in this film. You'll also be amazed by the driving scene by the river.I especially liked the mise-en-scene (did I spell it correctly?) that showed issues of Time Magazine in the background with Bill Clinton's face featured prominently. I don't feel this film bashes Clinton or the United States specifically -- instead it makes us all feel guilty for being blissfully unaware the entire time. The media coverage here in the United States was centered around OJ and 2 deaths while 800,000 were dying elsewhere. While the film never states this, it becomes obvious when one finally realizes what they were watching on TV during this time.This film is a must-see for anyone who was an adult in 1994. While it is not a ""feelgood"" film it is powerful and emotional. Easily the best film I've seen in quite some time."
Cineanalyst,"Sep 23, 2020",6/10,"I finally saw ""Hotel Rwanda"" after reading recent news of the arrest of Paul Rusesabagina, who is portrayed in the movie as an Oskar Schindler-esque hero by the Oscar-nominated Don Cheadle. As with many based-on-a-true-story features, I did some internet reading to see what others said of its historical accuracy or lack thereof, but that rabbit hole only led to more confusing controversy. Ultimately, it's not my place to weight in on such matters, anyways, as surely I don't know enough about the Rwandan genocide, let alone Rusesabagina's part in events, to comment informatively. I bring this up because, ultimately, in any such narrative cinema, we are not only watching a limited perspective of someone's story (in this case, that of Rusesabagina), but we're also seeing it as filtered by the cinematics brought by the filmmakers. A sort of cinematic colonization of history is troublesome enough, but the screen representation only becomes more dubious in the manufacturing of that history for mainstream, Western appeal. Given that the real-life narrative was neglected in the rest of the world, it becomes all the more disheartening that this becomes the primary way many of us come to learn or care about such tragedy.It's not only because the story involves a man from the other tribe leaning on his connections with the powers that be to save over a thousand people from a holocaust that Terry George's ""Hotel Rwanda"" resembles a limited variation on Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" (1993). There's a system of cinematic conventions and audience appeals to mold the narrative around. With the focus on Rusesabagina, larger context is provided by radio and TV reports he witnesses and, as in Spielberg's film, by his relationship with military men and mass murderers. Instead of Schindler on horseback witnessing the massacre at the Plaszów concentration camp, there's Rusesabagina falling over a mass of corpses dotting a road in Kigali. We see both pay to save the lives of others and continue their businesses as a facade to conceal their makeshift refugee camps. It's emotionally effective dramatization, to be sure, and Cheadle is fine--certainly by comparison to Nick Nolte's overacting and Joaquin Phoenix's white-guilt pathos--but when the racism is reduced to an arbitrary artifact of colonial categorization and the ethnic cleansing deriving from no more apparent reason than a presidential assassination and that the radio stirred up racist parades and when scenes such as that of the concluding refugee camp are already admittedly sanitized, it doesn't help one to put faith in the rest of the history depicted on screen. One moment, a Hutu woman and a Tutsi woman are friends being hit on at a bar by Phoenix and the next neighbors are slaughtering neighbors with machetes. Yet, regardless of hagiography, Westernization and cinematic obfuscation, ""Hotel Rwanda"" at least brought attention to one of the world's most recent genocides."
DiSchuch,"Apr 5, 2006",10/10,"Do you know what the United States led all it's major news casts with that day?""Kurt Colbain died"" followed by story after story of him, his wife's rock and roll group and drug usage and of course his drugs and lunacy. Rwanda was a byline and remained that way. A VERY SMALL byline.It bugged me as I watched ""Hotel Rwanda"", like DeJaVu that I had seen this somewhere before. And then I remembered the words April being in the title and sure enough I found the movie I was thinking about right here on IMDb Called ""Sometimes in April""It was in that movie that I saw America's role and how cavalier we were about it. If is wasn't for one of our politicians, Prudence Bushnell, our role would have been worse, if possible.Although Hotel Rwanda"" is everything and more than I heard about it, it closely resembles ""sometimes in April"".Sometimes in April which is every bit as good and because of cast etc., it did not get the recognition. It was based on the Radio Hutu DJ that riled the masses and his brother, who was opposed to his brother's actions. The brother who was not a DJ and was also married to a Tutsi was very upset with his antagonistic brother. I do not want to blow this for anyone so I will say no more about that.I was wondering if the director and producers of this movie took any of the history from that movie?"
atwarwiththebarmyarmy,"Aug 5, 2006",6/10,"I hate to criticise this film. It's one of those movies you feel you ought to like, because of the subject - Paul Rusesabagina's story needed to be told, a tragic, desperate story, but also a story of remarkable strength.Sadly, it seems that Terry George felt that the story would carry the film on its own. It doesn't. The screenplay is far too earnest - as if Messrs. Keirson and George believed we'd all be incapable of understanding what was going on. The direction is unimaginative (George does not have much experience as a director, and it shows). And both the character and performance of Nick Nolte are dismal.There is a lot of scope for a genuinely vital film here, and it has its moments, but on the whole it comes out as a substantial disappointment. Comparisons with Schindler's List are obvious - and unfortunately, they show this film up for what it is. None of the energy, none of the inspiration, and thus, none of the power of Spielberg's film.If you've been completely unaware of what happened in 1994, Hotel Rwanda is an honest introduction. But otherwise, it's a let down. There must be better studies of the horrific tragedy than this."
Glickman83,"Jul 27, 2006",3/10,"The film itself has great acting and a ""true story"" plot line. The problem with the film is the story's failure to give any insight and truth to the actual problems in Rwanda.Besides the fact that the problems are still rancid today, viewers love to sit back and find comfort that there was at least one good man in that time or turmoil, which still occurs on a violent and deadly basis.I imagine those who typically watch the film find it sad, inspirational and patriotic on some level. Though the film does nothing but deliver a false ""reality"" and applied ideology of a region and its people.The following is a""A truly ""investigative"" journalist might hack through the propaganda of Hotel Rwanda to get to United Artists parent company Metro Goldwyn Meyer, whose directors, not surprisingly, given what the film does not tell you about the U.S.-sponsored invasion of Rwanda (19901994), include current United Technologies director and U.S. General (Ret.)

clm-8,"Feb 5, 2005",N/A,"Hotel Rwanda is a very powerful movie which is not easy to watch. The genocide which occurred in 1994 was one of the most horrifying events to happen in recent years and it went virtually unnoticed by most of the world. Paul Rusesabagina was an ordinary man who didn't really want to get involved, but was forced by the events to make impossible decisions. Don Cheadle's performance is amazing as he demonstrates Paul's extraordinary courage and compassion. You do not watch this movie without feeling incredible sadness for the people of Rwanda (both Hutu and Tutsi) and you leave hoping that by putting this difficult story on film, the producers may encourage us learn how to prevent any type of genocide again."
MichPallada,"Feb 11, 2005",10/10,"I just saw Hotel Rwanda. I don't know what to say... actually i do.But it's so much that i want to say it would take me several pages to write it all down. A quick summary then: Don Cheadle should get the Oscar (and if he doesn't then Jamie Foxx will), the story is magnificent, the acting overall superb, it was brought in a moving, awakening way. But not much in a 'Hollywood-style', Thank God.That's what I have to say about the movie, now for the story behind the movie.... I'm ashamed to be someone from Western World when I see this movie, something like this should never happen again, i would advice as many people to see this and become aware of what was and is happening in this world gone crazy...One more thing, anyone who doesn't even have one tear in is eye at some point in this movie has a heart of stone."

I really think that Don deserves the best actor and this movie should have been nominated, seriously people, when did a movie last do this to you. but it did end on a freeze frame which was a little ""breakfast club""-esquire....you know,...oh well. All in all I was really impressed with this movie and the soundtrack! If you haven't listened to it then you should check it out. Wyclef Jean finally has something with million voices. Anywho, you should most definitely check out this flick, lotsa great acting and a lot of great scenes just in general.-George"
ridesisapis,"Mar 27, 2005",10/10,"A fantastic film depicting the untold story about what the UN did not do about the genocide that killed nearly 1 million people in Rwanda in 1994. An outstanding performance by Don Cheadle playing a Rwandese international hotel manager, who bought into the story that the UN would not abandon them. As Cheadle comes to understand that he was duped by the rhetoric Joaquin Phoenix, who plays a reporter assigned to cover Rwanda, suggests that the most likely reaction of the western world after watching the horrible footage on the news would be: ""They will say how horrible, and will go on eating their dinner."" The lack of an international intervention force, in a situation when it was truly needed, is one of the main points of this movie. Along the similar lines, I would recommend ""No Man's Land"", about the Balkans war. Food for thought."
djdjd04,"Jan 28, 2005",10/10,"I can't even understand how this movie was not nominated for best picture in this year's Oscars. I can't say for sure until I see The Aviator, but Leonardo DiCaprio's performance better be SPECTACULAR to have beaten Don Cheadle for the Golden Globe (drama). I haven't seen a performance like that in a very long time. He and Sophie Okonedo were both incredible. It was very moving. It's hard to not feel like something is wrong with a world where we can live peacefully in America and people are living that way in Rwanda... still to this day. But as they say in the movie, people will see pictures of the genocide, say, ""how horrible"", and go back to eating dinner.... I recommend all people go see this movie!"
WWJDWITHCA,"Oct 14, 2006",7/10,"This was a decent movie, with a really good story that people need to be aware of, but the screenplay and the technical quality of the movie is quite average, maybe below average.This movie is a joke really, to be considered for awards when you consider it's terrible blue- screen scenes that are nearly Saturday Night Live quality, sets that are so low quality you can almost swear it's the same set that Let's Make a Deal was shot-on earlier in the day. Then there's how the plot is so painfully obvious after the first 10 minutes of blue-screen work. Like the ill-fated UN caravan ""saving"" a list of people that was carrying Don Cheadles family; obviously this was doomed from the beginning! Then you couldn't have the ""Family Jumping off the Roof"" scene that was so ineptly setup.Cheadle, as usual does a terrific job, so what's new? Does this a great movie make? GIVE ME A BREAK. This movie borders on the verge of being a ""B"" movie it has so many problems, but because it's about an important topic everyone is SCARED of giving it a proper review. On a level of topical importance the movie is off-the-charts, but I'm sorry people, that's what documentaries are made for. I give the movie a 7 and not a six because it did do a good job of providing a personal and a national story at the same time, which is usually not done very well with most movies that try to achieve telling a story of such magnitude. But let's get this straight, this film is no ""Welcome to Sarajevo"", ""No Man's Land"", or ""The Killing Fields."""
uclabruin98,"Oct 20, 2024",9/10,"Powerful movie. 'Hotel Rwanda' tells the story of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who used his skills to save over a thousand people during the terrible events that happened in Rwanda in the early nineties. Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutus simply because they were Tutsi, while the rest of the world was looking away. The way the United Nations acted here is portrayed by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the only fictional person in the movie. First we learn about the way Paul, a Hutu, handles things in the hotel; he is a good manager, keeping the important customers happy with little gifts. They may come in handy later in his life. We meet Paul's wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi. Then the massacre starts and slowly more and more people try to hide in the hotel, protected by just a few UN soldiers who are not allowed to use their weapons. In more than one way I was reminded of 'Schindler's List'. Schindler started to save people only to make money, but ended up caring for all of them. Paul's reasons are less selfish than making money, although at first he only wants to save his own family with the power he has. Paul also ends up caring for every single soul he can save. Both men stood up against a greater power with the risk of being killed. 'Schindler's List' is the better movie, mostly because it was amazing how it told a story about one man but gave us a strong impression of the Holocaust surrounding him. 'Hotel Rwanda' has some scenes that have that effect as well, but overall it feels more of a movie that plays on a smaller scale. Of course Steven Spielberg is also a better director than Terry George. Still, the movie is very powerful and moving. Like I said, there are scenes that are close to unbelievable, showing once again what mankind is able to. Performances are helpful here, especially Cheadle does a superb job showing a smart man slowly losing hope.9/10."
rosaishere,"Mar 6, 2005",7/10,"Just home from seeing this film and I am overwhelmed. A very powerful performance from Don Cheadle and a great support from the rest of the cast.I hoped this film would be as powerful as it looked... it didn't let me down. This film was superbly directed, and shot- without having an overlong run time. I would be tempted to name this film a modern Schindler's List.You genuinely feel attached to the whole hotel people, and you feel their pain as you are watching their struggle to survive.Worth a look most definitely."

Did you miss that this is a true story? Secondly, for the few who found that their compassion was barely stirred, if at all. You have no soul. I pray for you....Watch this movie and get everyone you know to do the same. Racism is a sin that has caused so much suffering. Do your part to end it forever."
kevin_robbins,"Aug 24, 2025",9/10,"I recently rewatched Hotel Rwanda (2004) on Tubi. The story follows a hotel manager who shelters United Nations employees during the outbreak of civil war in Rwanda. With his staff, he struggles to keep the hotel running amidst the chaos, and in doing so manages to protect his family, friends, and countless others seeking refuge.The film is directed by Terry George (Reservation Road) and stars Don Cheadle (Crash), Joaquin Phoenix (Walk the Line), Sophie Okonedo (After Earth), and Nick Nolte (Warrior).This is a deeply tragic and moving tale-one that captures a unique race-driven conflict while also highlighting perseverance, hope, and humanity in the face of madness. The acting is outstanding, the settings feel authentic, and the violence is portrayed with unflinching realism. Cheadle delivers a powerful, nuanced performance, embodying the courage and resourcefulness required to survive such dire circumstances. The risks his character takes and the strategies he employs keep the film gripping from start to finish.In conclusion, Hotel Rwanda is a harrowing yet essential period piece that showcases both the unimaginable horrors of genocide and the resilience of those who resisted it. I would rate it a strong 9/10."
chera_khalid,"May 10, 2025",8/10,"Hotel Rwanda is a powerful, emotionally charged film that tells the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who risked his life to save over a thousand refugees during the Rwandan Genocide. Directed by Terry George, the film delves into the horrors of this dark chapter in history, capturing the deep human suffering, the resilience of the human spirit, and the courage of one man who became an unlikely hero in the face of unimaginable atrocities.Don Cheadle's performance as Paul Rusesabagina is nothing short of remarkable. His portrayal of a man torn between his desire to protect his family and the overwhelming responsibility of saving others is poignant and deeply moving. Cheadle brings a quiet strength to the role, expertly conveying Paul's inner conflict, his growing sense of moral obligation, and his ultimate transformation into a leader during a time of crisis. Cheadle's nuanced performance anchors the film, giving it a deep emotional resonance that stays with the viewer long after the film ends.The supporting cast, including Sophie Okonedo as Paul's wife Tatiana and Nick Nolte as a morally conflicted UN officer, also delivers strong performances. Okonedo's portrayal of a woman caught between fear and hope is powerful, and she brings a sense of tenderness and strength to the film. Nolte, while playing a relatively minor role, adds to the complexity of the narrative by representing the limitations and failures of the international community during the genocide.Visually, Hotel Rwanda is a stark contrast between the beauty of Rwanda's landscapes and the devastating horrors that unfold within them. The cinematography is often intimate, focusing on the characters' faces to capture the full range of their emotions-fear, grief, determination, and hope. The film's realistic approach to the depiction of the genocide allows the viewer to feel the tension and terror of the moment, without sensationalizing the violence. The contrast between the peacefulness of the hotel and the brutality of the outside world heightens the sense of claustrophobia and urgency that Paul and the refugees experience.The sound design is impactful, with a score that complements the film's somber tone. The music is subtle yet effective in its ability to heighten emotional moments, particularly during scenes of intense danger or loss. The sound of gunfire, cries of the victims, and the haunting silence of the outside world add to the tension, making the viewer feel the constant threat surrounding the hotel.Terry George's direction is focused and restrained, ensuring that the story never loses its emotional power or sense of realism. The pacing is tight, with each scene carefully constructed to evoke a sense of helplessness, courage, and humanity. There's a stark sense of moral urgency in the narrative, as the international community's failure to intervene is juxtaposed with the heroic actions of Paul, whose leadership and compassion shine through in the darkest of circumstances.While Hotel Rwanda is a deeply affecting and thought-provoking film, it is not without its emotional weight. The horrors of the genocide are undeniably disturbing, and the film does not shy away from showing the brutal realities of human cruelty. However, at its core, Hotel Rwanda is a story of hope, of ordinary people doing extraordinary things in the face of overwhelming adversity.In conclusion, Hotel Rwanda is a deeply moving and important film that not only shines a light on the Rwandan Genocide but also celebrates the courage, compassion, and resilience of the human spirit. It's a sobering reminder of the atrocities that can occur when the international community turns a blind eye to injustice, while also highlighting the power of individual actions in times of unimaginable crisis."
johnsontim-39150,"Oct 15, 2019",9/10,This movie moved me to tears because the way it depicted the ordinary lives of several African citizens caught in a local war zone and the chaos that ensues. Brilliant acting and performers all around but especially from Don Cheadle's lead character who must make horrifying decisions. An absolute MUST SEE!
sol-,"Jun 16, 2017",7/10,"Based on the true story of a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered over a thousand refugees during the 1994 genocide, 'Hotel Rwanda' offers a glimpse at a sad chapter of modern history seldom told. Often mentioned is the blind eye turned by the outside world to what is happening in Rwanda with a key piece of dialogue coming from lead actor Don Cheadle saying that they need to shame the world into helping out. The film is supported by strong performances from not only Cheadle but also Sophie Okonedo as his strong-willed wife who truly rises above stereotype: she is never once fragile, passive or helpless. Upon initial release, the film attained comparisons to 'Schindler's List' with a similar story of a brave man sheltering others in war, however, such comparisons actually reveal some of 'Hotel Rwanda''s shortfalls. Most notably, Cheadle's Paul is honorable and generous from the get-go compared to Oskar Schindler's who gradually progresses from greedy to selfless. Spielberg's inclusion of seemingly random subplots (like the gun that does not go off) also paint a fuller picture of the Holocaust, whereas 'Hotel Rwanda' offers a far more contained portrait of the genocide. And yet, if not the out-and-out masterpiece that some claim it to be, 'Hotel Rwanda' remains quite an accomplished motion picture with tension frequently felt in the air."
Peterswell,"Nov 26, 2004",10/10,"Hotel Rwanda engages the viewer in a catastrophe of epic proportions while emphasizing the resilience of human dignity and the tenacity of love. Don Cheadle excels as Paul Rusesabagina, highest-ranking African official at a Belgian-owned luxury hotel in Rwanda, who is left to run the place himself when European staff are recalled amid growing social violence. Paul's first concerns are to protect his family and to maintain a high level of service in the hotel. As the killing frenzy grows around him, so do his compassion and pragmatism, and he gradually opens his heart and the hotel's doors, converting luxurious quarters into a refugee camp. Nothing is overdone, and there is no preaching. But as the chaos spreads, turning neighbor against neighbor, the movie develops moral and artistic power. Private scenes are beautiful and convincing. Crowd scenes are authentic and riveting. Early on, as approaching guns explode and children huddle in fear, a small boy flinches in the crowd. You flinch with him. That's it. You're there. It's all real now. What a movie."
johnnyboyz,"Apr 13, 2009",7/10,"One of the more common reactions to have in regards to a tragic, real life event played out on screen is one of great sadness – it's just a reactionary thing that something so horrible is even capable of happening to people who just don't deserve it. Hotel Rwanda is a film that is able to produce these sorts of reactions, but also feelings on a level of suspense and horror as certain scenes and situations play out involving people we have come to be quite fond of. The film is more of a re-telling of certain events than it is a study of anything in particular, although the protagonist of the hour does possess characteristics of great honour and courage at a time of need. In truth, Hotel Rwanda does feel a little bit stagey at times while at others, feels made for television. You do, also, feel as if you're being chastised as a Westerner – that something as horrific as this happened and you let it happen; but the film mostly offers positive vibes.The hotel in Rwanda of which the title refers to is one owned by a certain Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), a harmless but rich and quite successful Rwandan living with his harmless and equally rich family. He has a wife named Tatiana (Okonedo) and a few children. He runs a hotel and takes care of his employees as well as his family in good measure. Importing goods and taking care of those that need taking care of are the run of the norm and these things are the most he has to concern himself with. But that is about to change. The film breaks away from this supposedly 'idyillac' set up for a turf-war of sorts between rival tribes, named the Hutu and Tutsi, that goes back many years; although by the mid point, you feel the tribesmen are unconcerned with whatever legacy they're fighting for and just enjoy chopping up some other people, such is the manner in which the history and details of the rivalry is developed.No matter, we're not here for a history lesson from yonder-century; we're here for a history lesson from yonder-decade, 1994 in fact. One thing leads to another and Rusesabagina's hotel quickly becomes Schindler's factory when push, not so much turns to shove, as it does cold-blooded execution by way of machete. Most of the locals not interested in the bloodshed want in, and it's Paul's duty to save as many as possible as the 'guest' list totes up. But can he save all these people and take care of his family? What about supplies? What happens if/when the U.N. pull out? All this occurs as the rest of the world look on, and Canadian U.N. higher-up Colonel Oliver (Nolte) pauses for thought now and again as well as pulling his gun from his holster and waving it around at times of supposed urgency.Paul himself is a Tutsi and the early warning signs occur when he, in the passenger seat of a harmless van transporting him to his home, has a run in with a Hutu before the bulk of the bloodshed has begun. The warning and the hatred is planted in a fairly well done manner and it's all fine because later on, things will get really hairy. Like I said, the film is a re-telling of events more than it is a true study of anything. Paul is established to be this above-ordinary Rwandan living a life that 95% of Rwandans don't have the luxury of living; he has a wife and child and there's a lot of grief before the nice, clean hero is put through a grinder and we're all supposed to go 'Oh No! I hope no harm comes to him!' It's fine, but it's unspectacular and it doesn't really matter if the backdrop is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide; the Holocaust or some made up event a hundred years in the future when aliens come to Earth and enslave us.What the film does do, in some retrospect, is demonstrate what people are willing to do in times of great distress. If Paul is willing to allow people into his hotel for safety and stay behind with the others deemed doomed when certain people have to pull out, then that is that but on the flip side there's a lot of greed in the film; a sense that 'sure, we'll help you out' but always for a price – a sort of 'what's in it for us?' mentality that the film sort of captures. But Hotel Rwanda is a very respectful and, on the broader sense of things, important film that will remind many people in the West of the situation that happened; a Western world that, as the film so very clearly points out, contributed hardly anything to, bar pull their own people out thus saving their own skins. If the film's overall goal was to recount the event that happened at that time then it succeeds and that is worthy enough of certain praise."
digsmash,"Sep 25, 2017",9/10,"I had it seen it long ago on the big screen. Then about five minutes of the film on TV last night and it got me again. In the rain, the bus departing, the children singing. Don Cheadle is a man of many faces. This was one of his most remarkable. The quiet dignity in the face of the unspeakable in order to provide safety for others. It was very different from some of his other roles, yet he inhabits this one a hundred percent. The Academy still owes his an award."
kinyondoabel,"Jan 21, 2007",1/10,"This is the worst movie that I have ever watched. Certainly it is meant to portray a message that Hutus are nothing but murderers something which is stupid. Someone use your brain and know that the killings were two-way traffic.I suggest that this propaganda movies must be scrapped out of the market because it doesn't help to peace and stability process in Rwanda and indeed Burundi. Imagine a Hutu whose parents and relatives were killed watching this movie that suggests that only Tutsi were the victims. A STUPID AND DANGEROUS MOVIE OF ALL TIME THIS CRAP IS.Oh Yes, I am of Tutsi descendants and not Hutu. All we need is peace and not this political craps by Kagame's RPF."
P4thFiendR,"Dec 26, 2022",8/10,"Review in short: This is a must watch because of (1) it tells a story every one must know. War, genocide & murder are never too far behind & one must not forget what helping his/her fellow man means (2) the movie is greatly acted & Don Cheadle carries the film with strength.However, the movies falls short in two significant ways:
(1) The pacing. Each semi-feel good moment is interrupted by an instant attack. This movie could have delved deeper into the analysis & not focus on the showing (which it doesn't do much to).(2) The ending. It's just bad. I don't see how having a good ending works. The movie should keep a sour taste in your mouth - not uplift you."
CaressofSteel75,"Oct 7, 2017",8/10,"While America was transfixed by O.J. Simpson and his low-speed chase in a white Ford Bronco, the worst humanitarian tragedy since WWII was taking place in Rwanda.Don Cheadle excels as the Hutu manager of a Belgian luxury hotel who does whatever is necessary to save as many people as possible while a Hutu militia, largely incited by government radio, engage in an unrelenting slaughter of Rwanda's Tutsi minority.Cheadle and the people he is trying to protect hold out in the hotel protected only by a small contingent of UN troops led by Nick Nolte, whose number one order is to avoid a firefight with the locals. Cheadle effectively balances diplomacy and bribery to keep the Hutu warlords out of the hotel and to buy precious time for him and his people to ride out the massacre. The film accurately portrays the total failure of the ""world community"" to take action that could have prevented the massacre of hundreds of thousands.The UN and other organizations have detailed files and reports of this occurrence that can be read on line by anyone who is interested in this. In those files you will learn there was a similar incident there in 1970 that claimed 100,000 lives. They're real good at writing up reports after the fact, but they were useless in preventing or limiting this tragedy. That's essentially what this movie tells us as well."
JayPatton88,"Jan 12, 2017",10/10,"Don Cheadle perhaps did the best job of his acting career. With Joaquin Phonex playing a minor role and Gary Busse playing a supporting actor. Based on a true story, and a great film to watch. It has moments of regularity , combined with terror and a bit of comedy to have a film based on true events directed and acting gave the viewer a real sense of what went Down in Rawanda, during the countries genocide & civil war. If you like films based on real people and real events this movie is a must see.The movie does a great job of portraying a real man in Rawanda who helped both Hutu and Tutsi's alike, often putting his own life on the line for others. A very heroic man, portrayed by Cheadle who did the best acting job of his career! I give it 9 stars! Check it out if you have not seen it! The movie is a must see for those interested in movies inspired by real events and the people's actions during a real event!"
jb_campo,"Jun 18, 2017",8/10,"In the face of true human evil, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) stood up and said Not on my Watch. Cheadle plays the real-life role of hotel manager during the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi sect people by the Hutu sect majority. At the beginning of the film, before the killing starts, you learn that people were arbitrarily assigned to one of the two sects based on physical characteristics, which makes the killing even more unbelievable.Hotel Des Milles Collines is the one place of refuge in the middle of mayhem once the genocide starts. Cheadle uses guile, tactics, stalling, bargaining, bribing, begging, every tool in his toolkit to try to save as many as he can. Reminiscent of Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda shows what one compassionate man can mean to so many others' lives when he's the only one that can do anything.Rusesabagina loves his family, and that is portrayed over and over again, especially in many heart-wrenching scenes with his wife when he tells her what she must do if death comes near them.Tension, plot, great acting, despair. Nick Nolte is terrific as the UN peacekeeper leader who has guns but no mandate or authority to use them. Excellent acting by the evil General and the evil supplier. The way the Director Terry George portrays the carnage, especially the river road scene, will stay with you for a long time.Genocide never makes sense, is never understandable to the sane person, but never has it been so palpably seen as in Hotel Rwanda. thankfully the Hollywood ending is actually true. If you have time, watch some of the special features where the real Paul Rusesabagina talks about the reality of that time. This movie will restore your faith in good people doing amazing things when faced with evil.Enjoy."

lougadou,"Jul 8, 2017",10/10,"Grim subject matter aside, this is a jewel of a movie which I hope with every fiber of my being you will watch. Compassion, corruption, fear, violence, hate, love, integrity and honor are the highlights of this film. The world stands by while terrible things happen all the time. We have no choice sometimes. We're far away, politically disconnected, we feel powerless. The cognitive dissonance pounds our hearts at times.What chimes in my heart the most about this movie is that this is actually the sole theme of the movie. It is not overpowered by moral preaching, it does coerce you into feeling anything specific, it's purpose is simply to allow you to feel SOMETHING about what is happening; whether it be yesterday, 1994 Rwanda, or today with Syria. It gives you a road map and empowers you. It's incredibly inspiring. Words cannot explain.Sometimes, feeling something is the best you can do. Reflect, learn and try to be one of the good ones. Be a hero in your own little world. You do what you can do be good, at the cost of witnessing certain atrocities and being restricted in what you can do about it. Just do what you can, when you can. (I speak of the protagonist's role and not the world, in this particular situation, the world was most certainly not heroic) And sometimes, when you can do that, you may not know it at the time, but you become something bigger; a real hero. This is a movie about the dignity of fear, of monsters at every turn and above all else, it is a movie to help you define what it is to be a hero, a true real life hero. Not the MARVEL superhero kind, but those kind of people with hearts so big that they make you feel grateful to be human.In the very midst of hell happening on earth, the protagonist, brilliantly brought to life by Don Cheadle, feels the events and makes small decisions. That is all. And you watch him. This movie makes the world feel it. The moment of it. The smallness he feels and the enormity of the world at the same time. You feel it. It's a pure sentiment distilled down to its purest form and that is the very premise of the movie.Bad things happen, we try to be good, we try to be strong, we do what we can and keep our chins up. The beauty of being human is that you decide how to react to the world, in all its contrasting colors and beautiful madness, you too can find honor, valor, humility, integrity -- MEANING -- PURPOSE.What a brilliant shining beacon of light this movie was.... despite being at the same time a grimmest saddest and most harrowing foray into the darkness of the human spirit. All at the same time. A true masterpiece.I must note that the powerlessness I feel after watching this movie is a bit overwhelming, but it has sparked something in me. I am not very political, but my views have now been changed. I suspect the director and writer and actors would be pleased that I feel restless to go out into the world and do something good now."
zhyarTheChosen,"Oct 12, 2019",7/10,Well for me I seen much better movies but for who didn't think it's a best movie
jallen2005,"Jan 27, 2005",9/10,"Hotel Rwanda is one of the best movies of 2004! This story recounts the true story of a Hotel manager who harbors several hundred refugees from a rival tribe during an intense Civil War in Central Africa. Marred by the compelling events, Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle) is forced to risk not only his own life, but the lives of family, friends and co workers in his attempt to save the lives of the helpless refugees. Director Terry George does a great job of capturing the gruesome details of this horrific, yet heroic event. Just as splendid is Don Cheadle's portrayal and masterful command of the African dialect.This movie is a recommend for anyone who has a heart, mind or soul."
siglo_xx,"Jul 23, 2005",6/10,"Not a bad movie, but you know, I didn't really feel much for the characters in this film. While the story is reasonably compelling, you see the leads sipping wine by candle light after all the tension occurs and they're left in the hotel to manage the chaos. I mean, come on. What's that all about?Way too Hollywood to actually produce compassion for the true story at hand. Everyone seems to go nuts over this film, both at IMDb and other sites (such as rental), and it's yet another film I feel is overrated by at least 2 out of 10 stars. I gave it a 6. It doesn't suck, but it's not all that great either.I didn't find the acting all that supreme to be honest, and while the story was important to be told, it wasn't told in a way that provides one with feeling for the actors or whom they''re portraying. I didn't feel as sorry for the characters as I did in many other movies, such as Salvador, The Killing Fields, etc. They were far better films, in my humble opinion.While this movie had its moments of sadness, it would often spoil the true story with these displays of 'wine by candle light', which I found to be complete nonsense and totally unrealistic given the circumstances. Tantamount to drivel. I didn't really think the movie got going till around 50 minutes into the film. Sorry, but I'm a huge movie person and I simply can't agree with the majority here."
Yevinphone,"Mar 10, 2005",N/A,"as a longtime resident of East Africa, I feel an apology is due to Rwandans for this movie.. an insulting perversion of history coupled with the unfascinating interactions of unidimensional characters. where is the information about the president's plane shot down? about the faxes back and forth from Kofi and co and u.n. headquarters in NYC, prohibiting the peacekeeping forces from confiscating the order of machetes? instead we are bludgeoned with one contrivance after another. shame on you, Terry George. please, please, please.. everyone needs to see Steven Silver's documentary ""the last just man"", which will clarify most of this jumbled melodramatic mess. u.n. peacekeeping forces Romeo Dellaire is the real hero behind this horrifying event."
view_and_review,"Feb 28, 2006",10/10,"The events in Rwanda between the Tutsis and the Hutus happened when I was in high school. I didn't know much about it then except that it was a horrific event. ""Hotel Rwanda"" did an incredible job telling the story to the audience and showing the ruthless and gruesome nature in which the Hutus treated the Tutsis. No person with a pulse could help but be moved by this movie. As a human being first and as a Black person second, I was grief stricken to see how people from the same country and of the same color could relentlessly kill based upon a stamp on an I.D. card. This movie showed how hate can drive humans to behave like animals and it showed how kind and merciful people can be as well. In this movie there was bravery, cowardice, honor, humiliation, kindness, and ruthlessness. I'm no film critic, but I could not find anything I disliked about the movie, just things I disliked about the event."
philip_vanderveken,"Aug 2, 2005",8/10,"I guess there is no-one who can say that he or she doesn't know what has happened during the genocide in 1994 in Rwanda. The images of all the massacres, often committed with nothing more than machetes, were absolutely horrifying. But on us Belgians this event has perhaps had an even bigger impact than on other Europeans and on Americans. Not only has Rwanda, after Germany's defeat in World War I, long been a Belgian protectorate (no, just as Burundi it has never been a colony. We only had one and that was Kongo), making that we still have some kind of historical connection to the country. Our government has always helped the Rwandese with military assistance and training (except during the genocide). But we were also personally affected by the genocide when 10 of our UN peace-keepers were brutally murdered in a military camp because they tried to protect one of the Rwandese ministers. Three of them were shot, the others were hacked open with machetes. The images of the paratroopers who cut their blue berets into pieces with their bayonets, once their returned home, will never be forgotten by all those who saw it back then.""Hotel Rwanda"" doesn't show anything about that particular event, but it does give a good idea of what the rest of the entire genocide, and the reaction of the international community towards it, was like. This movie tells everything from the perspective of Paul Rusesabagina, an ordinary hotel-manager from Hutu origin who saved the lives of many Tutsi's. While the rest of the Hutu's brutally murdered every Tutsi around him, he not only protected his Tutsi wife and his children, but helped many of her relatives and friends to escape the horror by opening the hotel doors for them. Despite the fact that he didn't get much help from the UN or from the French, he was able to save over a thousand helpless refugees...I would like to say that this is a wonderful movie, but not without adding that I'm not talking about all the murders. What I like so much about this movie is that it shows how a seemingly ordinary and unarmed man was able to stand up against all those militia men, not only protecting the lives of thousand people, who would otherwise have faced a certain death, but risked his own life by doing so and didn't care. If this hadn't been based on a true story, many would have said that it was impossible, but it isn't. All this actually happened, the good things as well as the bad. The makers of this movie have recreated it all very well and certainly have done some great research about the reasons and the attitude of the international community.The acting in this movie was also outstanding. Don Cheadle did a perfect job in his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina and Nick Nolte was excellent in his role as the Canadian Colonel Oliver, but that doesn't mean that the other, less known actors, weren't at least as good as them. They all did a wonderful job, lifting this movie far above average. If there is one thing that I could have a remark about, than it must be the fact that they speak English, instead of French. But that's such a little detail, that I'm very willing to forget about it. It didn't really bother me and it certainly didn't spoil the rest of the movie for me.Overall this is a movie that should be seen by all. Not only because we should never forget what has happened over there in 1994, but also because we should hope this is a lesson for those who are planning on doing it and for those who never did anything about it. I give this movie a well-deserved 8.5/10."
mjw2305,"Jan 13, 2007",9/10,"Hotel Rwanda is the true story of a real life hero, who risked everything he had, too save as many as he could; while the governments of the world that could have helped, stood by and did nothing. Obvious comparisons have been made between this and Schindler's list, and the harrowing truths in both films do stir the emotions and enlighten the blind to the real tragedies in the world, but the films and the stories within them are very different.Just over ten years ago some of the worst atrocities in the history of mankind took place in the country of Rwanda, and yet in the media driven world in which we live; these events went almost unnoticed by the general public and were ignored by the powers that may have helped.Even without the production quality of Schindler's list, this film still proves to be equally as powerful; so much so, that i felt ashamed that such things had really happened during my adult life, and i'm sure anyone who sees this movie will feel the same way.Don Cheadle excellently portrays the hero, a ordinary man named Paul Rusesabagina, who offered shelter to over a thousand people at great risk to himself and his own family. Over a period of just three months; one million people were brutally murdered, and if one man managed to save over one thousand others, imagine how many could and should have been spared their terrible fate.The story simply has to move you, even if the film itself may appear a little cheap looking, but to me it isn't, it's realistic and shocking.9/10 Well done"
ueiy,"Oct 30, 2006",9/10,"The most impressed movie that I ever saw was ""Hotel Rwanda.""I saw many kinds of movie before, but watching this movie, I cried for the first time. Hotel Rwanda is a true story. It is about a fight of a race between Hutu and Tutsi in 1994. At first, Tutsi was stronger than Hutu but the position changed. A man, who ran a famous hotel had a family. Three children and a wife. They were living happily. However, the war was getting more severe and many people were killed or forced, especially Tutsi. The man was Hutu and his rest of his family was Tutsi so they were in danger. He desperately tries to protect his family but what will happen at the end.I like this movie for many reasons. First, their acting was really great. I think Japanese can't do this kind of acting. Second, the song which sung after the movie impressed me deeply. I can't forget that song. Third, The violence scene was so grotesque that it was like a real one.If you watch this movie, nobody will say ""I didn't cry."""
dbborroughs,"Aug 7, 2005",7/10,"This is the true and inspiring tale of one man who tried to do something when his country descended into madness and genocide. Don Cheadle is masterful as our hero and he was deserving of an Oscar and not just a nomination. Its is thanks to him and most of the rest of the cast that we have as good a movie as we do. The problem, for me, with Hotel Rwanda is the casting of Nick Nolte as a UN peace keeper. Every time that Nolte appears on screen I'm pulled out of the movie. No longer am I in Rwanda but on a Hollywood set and big name actors are trying to act. Its distracting and it almost ruins the movie since it takes several minutes after each of his appearances to calm down enough to once again get lost in the story. Nolte aside, this is a great movie and should be seen , not only because its a record of what transpired, but also because its a damn good movie."
clancyfancy,"Sep 18, 2004",10/10,"I saw Hotel Rwanda in Toronto before all the incredible reviews came out and it was awesome to not know you are in for one of the best movies of your life. I can't forget a single second of it! Easily the best Hollywood film in ten years. It's a tense, political thriller that is actually redemptive not to mention incredibly beautiful. Don Cheadle just made me feel how it would be to find yourself the only sane person in a world devoured by hate and insanity. His performancewas mesmerizing. Just heartbreaking without being sentimental or depressing,he is totally amazing. I had enjoyed Mr. George's ""In the Name of the Father"" but nobody could have expected this film to be so monumental. And it was nice tosee a film about war that wasn't gory violence or cheap sentimentality for once. Highest recommendations, it is a classic, all-time great movie."
Luigi Di Pilla,"Nov 6, 2005",6/10,I saw an interesting true story without much suspense or action but the genocide itself is dramatic enough. I discovered HOTEL RWANDA because its high votes and the good critics on IMDb. Don Cheadle delivered a respectable performance here. Cameos for Joaquin Phoenix and Jean Reno. The picture was okay but the film minutes could have been reduced. I don't like movies that are running more than two hours because I don't have much time. Anyway if you are looking for a true story don't miss it. It's a shame that on this massacre the UNO was helpless and all the Western countries too. I'm asking which kind of sun is shining on this UNO. There were many facts that let me without words. I was also impressed how the hotel manager Paul bought lives with money. Standing ovations to Paul Rusesabagina the great hero that saved so many innocent lives. We all should take an example from him. My final vote is 6/10 but please don't get me wrong.If you liked it I highly recommend TEARS OF THE SUN.
sachinjain50,"Jun 10, 2012",10/10,"Never ever have I seen a single person show brilliance in every single act that he performs in the entire course of the movie. Don Cheadle has done exactly this. The plot, the direction, the performances.. they are so real that u feel a part of the struggle. Though every single performance is worth admiring but Don stands out with his.A struggle that most probably persists in so many countries around the world, which we are not even aware of sitting in the air conditioning of our drawing rooms watching cable changing channels and cribbing of not having anything worthwhile on it to watch. This one makes u do some retrospection. This one makes you feel being a part of their struggle...So real are the performances that it makes u feel pain, relief, happiness, felling of rebel and wanting to do something for the people suffering.Full marks on the direction, choice of cast, performances, and the movie. Watch this one if you are hungry for good performances and a brilliant movie.Have a great 2 hour fun watching brilliance!"
merterdin,"Jun 16, 2019",4/10,"The only good thing about this movie is to remind the west once again that how they created conflicts in a country and how they let 800000+ people get killed without taking any serious action. However, the story of the hotel manager (main character) is completely changed and doesn't reflect the reality. For more information please check out the Guardian news!"
PWNYCNY,"Feb 15, 2006",10/10,"From time to time one can come across a movie that transcends the ordinary or commonplace and rises to the level of being special. This is one of those movies. The story here is not only about a man who rises above his circumstances to become truly heroic, nor only about the seemingly pointless conflict between two groups of people, but primarily is about the human condition in general. This movie challenges one to ask: Is there any hope for humanity? This movie can generate feelings of deep despair, yet it does not, and for one reason: the main character, Paul, magnificently portrayed by the excellent actor Don Cheedle. Paul convinces us that in tumultuous times when people are being cruelly mistreated and uncertainty abounds, men like Paul are there to lead, to inspire and to serve. What a wonderful, marvelous, inspirational movie."
alrenney,"Aug 21, 2005",9/10,"To say I was sceptical and ignorant about this film before I watched it is a true understatement. I chose the film at my local store because of a lack of alternatives, and knew very little about the Rwandan Genocides that it is based around. In fact, between myself and the three University Students that watched the film with me our combined knowledge on anything relating to the Genocides was minimal to say the least. The film certainly changed our perspectives.Well shot and emotional, the film based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a Western-owned hotel in the middle of the conflict captured the terror faced by the genocide victims extremely well. Top class acting from Don Cheadle and Sophie Okenado further added to the powerful story lines impact on the viewers senses. Oscar nominated acting should have been Oscar winning acting. At the end of the film the consensus shared by my fellow viewers was displayed by a long silence followed by ""wow's"" and stunned looks.A modern masterpiece of directing by Terry George, what a film!!!"
Mr_Sensitive,"Mar 19, 2007",7/10,"I'm not a movie basher but this movie was very mediocre. I don't really mind about it being PG-13 and not showing much of genocide and brutal killing (the movie only intention was to show about survival) but the story and the movie itself is very unemotional and flat. I feel so detach to it.Synopsis: A hotel manager Paul was force to housed over thousands refugees as there were genocidal and unrest outside of the hotel.The good part of this movie got to be it was quite entertaining to watch and there is something happen all the time. Plus I get to know the country Rwanda existed and thus have this entire problem. The sad part is when executed into the screenplay it wasn't that good and combine with really bad cinematography make this not such a good movie one hope to be. I guess if you watch it for fact it was fine but movie for movie sake it wasn't that good.I got to say the whole film is very flat, though there are like two scenes that are quite moving but the rest was very ordinary and forgettable. The casting of Don Cheadle was a smart moves (otherwise this wouldn't close to be this famous), though he was the best in the movie his acting is barely average and the rest turn out quite bad specially Nick Nolte and Sophie Okonedo. The direction is average and nothing special and could have been much better. The score was all right too.It was just an all right movie and that is all. I have the concept just because it was a true story and it is a drama people subconsciously think it is a good movie or saying that it was a good movie to make their taste look good on other people.Recommendation: Yes, It Was Quite Entertaining. Worth Rental At The Most.Reason To Watch: For The Facts.Reason Not To: Bad Cinematography, Didn't Managed to Bring Out Enough Emotion As It Suppose To.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: D).Please rate Y/N After read, Thanks!!"
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Aug 20, 2005",9/10,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsIn 1994, the UN, in a rare act of competence, have managed to broker a peace agreement between the warring hutus and tutsis in Rwanda, Africa. But all this is thrown into disarray when the African president is murdered and tutsi rebels are suspected. The local militia begin a nasty campaign of genocide against them and those suspected of working with them. One such person ends up being Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) a hotel owner who witnesses the horrific carnage for himself and is forced into action when his own family get caught up in the slaughter campaign.He ends up saving thousands of lives. Hotel Rwanda serves best as a modern Schindler's List, a Schindler's List with colour, although that doesn't make the story it is telling any less bleak or harrowing. It's a few notches away from the quality of that film though.In the lead role, Cheadle plays it stern and serious all the way, with a real conviction for his passion to the project. He has a heavy supporting cast too, from Nick Nolte, Joaquim Phoenix and Jean Reno, who only marginally manage to capture his sincerity.I was expecting the film to be a bit longer, actually, but it manages to wrap it all up perfectly as it goes.Hotel Rwanda is a startling film, depicting things that I know go on everyday in foreign countries but don't watch the news very often and, like many others, sort of pretend isn't happening to an extent. Although everything in this film happened when I was a child, things like this probably are still going on and it's good that there are films like this about to kick people into reality a bit. ****"
oscarvibes,"Dec 4, 2024",7/10,"This isn't just another action-packed crime thriller-it's a story with real heart. The action is raw and visceral, with every scene feeling like it carries real stakes. But what sets this movie apart is its emotional core. The characters feel like real people, with struggles and motivations that make sense. Their choices aren't easy, and that tension keeps you invested. The pacing is excellent, weaving high-octane moments with quieter, reflective scenes that give the story room to breathe. Even when the action slows down, the tension doesn't-it's always building toward the next big moment. Visually, it's gritty and grounded, with no unnecessary gloss to take away from the authenticity. It's the kind of movie that keeps you on edge and thinking long after it's over. If you're looking for a crime-action film that's as emotional as it is intense, this one is a must-watch."
gavin6942,"Aug 30, 2006",8/10,"Hotel Rwanda tells the true story of one man's determination to hide over 1000 people during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Watch as his country, his family and everything around him falls apart.This film was destined for greatness. The subject matter is so grave, so serious, that only a really bad film could have lessened the impact. And this is not a bad film, but rather a very good one: solid directing, great music, great acting and imagery.Don Cheadle is the main character. The only bad thing I can say is that he bears a striking resemblance to Tim Meadows, but that's not Cheadle's fault. Every tear, every cry of anguish and each loving embrace seemed real to me. And he definitely came across as someone who is African at heart. (I have no idea if Cheadle is African, American or European, but he could have been Rwandan.) I was confused by the appearance of Nick Nolte and Joaquin Phoenix. They could have been distracting from the overall film, as they were the only mainstream actors in this otherwise sea of unknowns. They weren't, though. Phoenix had a small role, yet quite powerful. And Nick Nolte was the shining star, playing a Canadian military man who was the only person who cared about the Rwandans. (His speech in the bar about the difference between Africans and n*****s rings very true, and sadly will for some time.) Jean Reno was Jean Reno, I could have used more of him, but I'm happy just knowing I was able to glance upon his droopy eyes and somber face.Now, the imagery is where this film shines the most: the violence, the corpses, the scenery... all so shockingly real. The film was rated R before petitioning for a PG-13. And I'm so glad they did, because the message inherent in this film should not be missed out because someone is ""too young"" to understand. Hatred is universal.Watch this film, and if you have the heart, make the extra step: speak out against the genocides in Rwanda and other war-torn African nations."
saffronsong-1,"Jan 16, 2006",6/10,"A powerful subject. Real people. Real events. Seems like a formula for success, right? Well yes, but almost not quite. For those unaware of the 1994 Rwanda genocide or its details, it's an amazing chance to look from the inside out instead of the outside in. Unfortunately, save for a few scenes and the panic in people's faces, we don't really feel the full impact of the slaughter. Over the course of several months, approximately 800,000 men, women, and children were butchered simply because of their fictionalized ethnicity provided by the Belgian colonialists. That's a lot of zeros. And yet, from the movie, it feels as if a few of those zeros are missing.Still, it does not detract from the seriousness of the subject or the quality of the film. Hotel Rwanda is, by far, one of the better movies out there. The acting is good, despite the fact that I can't stand watching the fellow who plays Romeo Dallaire, the UN general, as he clops about like a plow horse. This film has the ability to open eyes and bring attention to the genocide, which is the most important thing about it. If we are aware of such atrocities, we have the ability to learn from the past and prevent history from repeating itself.Powerful? Yes. Real? Yes. Good? Definitely."
darek-jedzok,"Jan 14, 2006",5/10,"I was pretty disappointed. I read a lot about Rwanda genocide and was really curious, how did the show it in this film. The story of one, brave man, that saved hundreds of people is really strong and breathtaking. All the actors are pretty good in it. And well done screenplay. Unfortunately, the film itself was hard to watch for me, because the music is just terrible (MIDI keyboard orchestrations and irritating melodic motives), the work of camera and generally visual work is boring and amateurish. If they gave such strong story based on such dramatic political situation to better director and crew, they could have made second ""Schindler's List"" out of it. Watch it anyway just to get some informations about that ethnic conflict. 10 points for the story and actors. 0 for all the rest."
Bob Pr.,"Mar 2, 2005",N/A,"This film is almost beyond words.It's obviously a docudrama of the genocide in Rwanda -- and the response (and lack of response) of the rest of the world to the ""people who are not me."" (It's obviously also a wakeup call to be aware of other parallel situations.)This film garnered many awards from many groups, including top picture at the Toronto Film Festival. (That's made me highly value the TFF over the Academy Awards.)If you'll GOOGLE the name of the central character, ""Paul R____""(?), you'll find many stories that expand and elaborate on the film and ALL of which confirm ALL the premises of the film. I found http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/574/574554p1.html to be one of the best although all carried the same central message -- adherence to the central truth of the story.This film does two things.It clearly faces us with the worldwide responsibility we all face with the consequences of ignoring ""man's inhumanity to man"" wherever and to whomever it occurs. "".... Therefore, never send to ask for whom the bell doth toll; it tolls for thee.""It also confronts each of us with what -- as individuals -- we could do, would do, when faced with moral situations.Excellent film. IMPORTANT film. Very well done. Superb acting. Faithful story telling.11 of 10."
tigger_68,"Jun 3, 2005",9/10,"I can't really say more than what everyone already has.It's an epic drama, with wonderful writing, acting and an amazing job of cinematography.This is a powerful film and an indictment of the uselessness of the UN and other supposedly protective organizations.They talk about how terrible things are but they do little or nothing to stop genocide in Rwanda, Sudan, etc.Organizations like the UN need to actually do something about this horror or they need to be replaced with one that can.See this film and see just how bad things can get and then get up and do something about it."
caitlinhullett,"May 7, 2024",8/10,This movie was definitely one that can evoke strong emotions from an audience. The situation in the movie only seemed to get bleaker and bleaker with each passing minuet. The amount of people that died not only in the movie but in real life brings the question of why are people like that. How can real people be so crule based on things out of their control? So in a way this movie is a philosophical thought provoker along with it being emotional. This movie honestly was really hard to watch but it should be watched because things like this still happen today and are ignored. If we do not learn from the past people will only continue to repeat the same mistakes.
asalem182,"Dec 18, 2005",9/10,"Hotel Rwanda was a touching, shocking, and very powerful film. I was surprised filmmakers waited a whole 10 years to make a movie about one of the biggest massacres of all time.Hotel Rwanda tells the story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle, in a career best performance), a hotel manager who is forced to turn his hotel into a refugee camp to save his family and the refugees from the massacre that took place in Rwanda in 1994.The first question that will come across your mind while watching HR is ""why have we become so cruel?"", and no wonder one character asked the exact same question during the movie. You'll see roads covered with corpses, the males of the dominant tribe, The Hutus, raping females of the other tribe, The Tutsis, and Hutus slaughtering Tutsis on the streets. And then the United Nations, in one of their biggest failures of all time, decided to rescue only the Westerners (by making them leave the country) and leave the people of Rwanda to die alone. And Hotel Rwanda isn't afraid to show everything. I wonder how they could get away with a PG-13 rating.After that, I think you'll feel ashamed. In the best scene of the movie, an American cameraman (Joaquin Phoenix, in a great cameo), had to leave the country after the infamous UN decision. When his Ruandan friend begs him to take her with him, he says with teary eyes ""I've never felt so ashamed"". And frankly, I was ashamed too. I didn't try to donate money, or protest, or do anything for that country, and that's why I felt I (along with millions of people around the world) was responsible for what happened. I even think your average Joe will never know this massacre happened in the first place. And that's another great thing about Hotel Rwanda: It reminded us of that horrible event.And I have to disagree with the people that said the somewhat uplifting ending ruined the movie for them. In fact, I can't find a better ending for the movie. That ending happened in real life, and it shows that despite all the cruelness in the world, there's still some hope left.So, I'd definitely recommend Hotel Rwanda. Being a true story, it will hit you harder and touch you more than the majority of the movies you've seen."
afdiazr,"Aug 15, 2005",9/10,"What is it that makes a story worth telling? Yeah, what happened in Rwanda was one of the most horrible (and unnoticed) things in recent history, but how would you tell that story without focusing just on the horror? Hotel Rwanda delivers the task so mercilessly it will leave you breathless. This is a story about priorities, about survival in the most horrific circumstances, about pride and intelligence. Paul (Don Cheadle) is an amazing character. He makes you feel ashamed of yourself. Could you face this sort of thing in the same fashion as he did? I kept asking myself that question the whole time. To be reminded of this atrocities is one thing, but to confront them and still keep a straight and gentle face is another thing. Paul is such an amazing character he's beyond human, and Don Cheadle portrayed this man with such dignity and charisma it left me biting my nails every moment. I also loved Joaquin Phoenix's character. You always wonder what the feelings of journalists would be given the chance to cover a story like this, and I think he hits the mark very close. This is not an entertainment movie, it's a wake-up call for mankind."
paulclaassen,"Apr 25, 2024",6/10,"'Hotel Rwanda' is based on the Rwandan genocide which - according to Rwanda - killed around one million people during the 100-day war in 1994. Most of the victims were from the Tutsi ethnic group.Don Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of the four-star Hôtel des Mille Collines in Rwanda. He is of the Hutu ethnic group, while is wife Tatiana is Tutsi. When the President - being Huto - was killed by Tutsi extremists, this resulted in the start of the genocide the very next day. In an instant, Paul's life was turned into a nightmare. With Tutsis being killed, Paul had to do everything in his power to save his family.With the hotel guests having been evacuated, Paul soon had his hands full with Tutsi civilians looking for refuge at the hotel. The rest of the film sees Paul pleading for help from the United Nations, the Red Cross, and military officials. Fearing time is running out before all hell breaks out at the hotel, the film also becomes a nail-biting race against time.Don Cheadle delivered a fantastic performance as Paul. 'Hotel Rwanda' is a very well made film, but it can be depressing - even more depressing because this is based on fact, and so many innocent people lost their lives in such a short space of time."
macutey,"Jan 4, 2025",10/10,"The only comment I can give about this movie is - SEE IT. It's one of the most heart wrenching, yet beautiful movies I've ever seen. I really hope Don Cheadle and the movie receive Oscars! The acting is superb and the fact this is based upon a true story only makes it better. You may need some Kleenex as I was overwhelmed for a large part of this movie.I had the honor of seeing this movie at a preview screening with the real ""Paul"" and his wife attending - what an absolute amazing experience to be in their presence. This movie will make you rethink everything about what it means to be human and how much we need to think about all our neighbours in this world."

james-forrest,"Jun 22, 2007",7/10,"With reviews hailing this title as an African ""Schindler's List"", i gave this movie a go, expecting it to be very good.It was good, but not very good, and not excellent. Perhaps it was too hard comparing a movie like this to Schindler's List. Either way, do not get me wrong. It is still a compelling tale as one man struggles to save some 1300 refugees during the Rwandan genocide. I was impressed with Don Cheadle's portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina, which demonstrated his versatility of an actor, having recently seen him in movies such as Crash and Traffic. Worth seeing to gain a perspective? Yes. Just not that well of a movie made as it could have been in my opinion.7/10"
Adpag,"Jun 22, 2005",5/10,"It seems that the more shocking and tragic the events that a film is based on, the easier it is to go completely gaga and convince yourself that the film is good.This film isn't bad. The events it portrays truly are a black mark in the history books, and it does well in not sensationalising what happened. On the minus side though, I thought it did seem to gloss over the whole thing. There just did not seem to be any sense of outrage. To get the point across there should have been more on-screen atrocity - not with a view to satisfying gore hounds, but to emphasise why the world should be ashamed of what happened. Consequently there was virtually no dramatic impact in it for me. As I said, it wasn't bad - neither was it particularly good. The script and acting were acceptable, but I wouldn't give it any more praise than that."
jamielee60s,"Apr 7, 2005",N/A,"I have seen the movie and being a undergrad who has spent a year working on the Rwandan Genocide I have to say that I was disappointed with this movie. I like that it is trying to bring some light on a subject that we have all seemed to forgotten or never really knew anything about in the first place. However, this movie never seemed to show the brutality or show the reality of the horrors that were occurring in this county at the time. Most of this film takes place in this hotel where they are drinking wine and one of their biggest problems is having to boil their drinking water out of the hotel's swimming pool. There are very few scenes where you are given the opportunity to see a glimpse of what the real horror of the genocide must have been like. I understand that the movie was trying to keep its PG 13 rating but I think that the rating of this film is not as important as the message. All that said this was a still a good movie and did a much better job with the historical facts then I had expected."
rainbow_popcorn,"Mar 15, 2005",9/10,"As I was only seven years old at the time of the Rwanda genocide, I had no background on the subject. I was worried that I would not fully comprehend the plot of the movie. However, the film-makers did an excellent job explaining the history of the Tutsi and the Hutu groups. Pheonix and Cheadle's conversation in the hotel quickly and simply explain the history without boring the audience. This info brings the entire audience up to speed and ensures that everyone can enjoy the movie and be moved by the real-life story. Whether you vividly remember the horrors of the Rwanda, or were living under a rock in 1994 (or in my case, watching Sesame Street) this film will be memorable and is well worth the cost of a movie ticket."
Roma73,"Apr 18, 2022",10/10,"I saw this years ago, and then once or twice again. Excruciating must see. One of the best (anti) war films I've seen. Like others have said, you will need Kleenex nearby."
debbysayre79,"Aug 26, 2005",10/10,"This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. I can actually say that I walked away with a different outlook on foreign politics. It was obvious that the actors in this film cared deeply about the meaning of the film and what it really stood for. After watching a documentary on the true events that took place, I truly believe that the movie was as close to what really happened as they could possibly get. This was one of those films that you can't stop thinking about for days. The kind that really get to you, making you glad that you watched it, but sad at the same time. It is too bad that it was only nominated for an Oscar."
Xina143,"Jul 26, 2005",10/10,"I can't say enough about this movie.I would like to say that Don Cheadle is not simply the best African American actor out there, but is one of the best actors out there period.I would even venture to say he was robbed of the Oscar this year.His performance was subtle, and yet had so many different layers, it is impossible to describe. What Paul Rusesabagina did was simply amazing, and speaks to what one person can do, how one person can make a true difference in the world. This man and Don Cheadle with his amazing performance, truly touched my heart.Kudos also go out to Sophie Okonedo as Paul's unwaveringly supportive and loving wife, and the the children in this movie were also wonderful.This is a movie that speaks to the human spirit and should NOT be missed."

udayp_00,"Dec 11, 2006",10/10,"It is a hard hitting civil war(between the rebelling Tutsis and the ruling Hutus) movie based on true incidents during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It depicts how the central character Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu, manager of a four-star Hotel uses his diplomatic skills and political contacts tries to save hordes of Tutsis while he himself is in grave danger of being hunted down by the Hutus for harboring Tutsis. It depicts wonderfully how gruesome ethnic hatred is induced by the State to maintain its political clout. A wonderful melange of politics at various hierarchies. It depicts how regional politics for control instigates mob mentality and gruesome genocide, how international politics keeps UN from taking any affirmative action, how individual politics played by Paul Rusesabagina helps save lives. It skillfully presents the contrast between how common people torn by ethnic strife and witness to thousands of killings, many of them near and dear, accept their fate while some others in power try to extract every single ounce they can to fulfill their personal greed. A must watch movie for its brilliant portrayal of varied human personalities.PS: A brief perspective on the Rwanda genocide can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide . The book by UN general Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire ""Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda"" and the documentary film with the same name are definitely worth a watch. While watching the movie I could not stop thinking about how history teaches us nothing. After the Rwandan genocide, every one went about condemning the genocide, the world body has setup a war crimes tribunal, Bill Clinton has termed the genocide the biggest failure of his administration and still today we have Iraq burning on the same ethnic conflict, Darfur in Sudan enduring a killing of 400,000 people(and that's just the official figure). Hope history teaches us something. Still I'm sure, in future, politics will be played and men in power(or the others seeking it) will try to instigate petty differences among people to fulfill their own ambitions. But, let's hope this is not done at the cost of millions and millions of lives for human life is too precious to be lost on the basis of some caste or creed. Obviously the change won't come from the preperators of these heinous crimes as they have high stakes in the game. But the sufferers are just puppets in the show. They should be aware of the fact that they remain the ones who bore the brunt of the conflict no matter which ""side"" belonged and no matter which ever side ""wins"". They should abandon the mob mentality. Only then will there be hope and only then may be history won't repeat itself."
mossgrymk,"Feb 16, 2022",6/10,"Cheadle's study in pure, unvarnished decency (obviously a little too pure for some IMDB skeptics) is skillful in its avoidance of the twin pillars of sentimentality and sanctimony but otherwise this film is your typical pat yourself on your liberal back/ Oscar bait that, while aiming for ""Killing Fields"", scores at best a glancing blow at ""Exodus"". Give it a generous C plus for Don and Fana Mokoena who plays a Hutu tyrant with a love for all things Scottish. Were that there were more such quirky characters in this very self important film."
crazyforcanucks,"May 22, 2006",10/10,this has to be in my opinion 1 of the top ten movies of all time this movie features great acting! and sucks you in the entire time. you feel like your there in Africa watching there population suffer and you cant do anything about it i totally fell in love with Paul and all the other characters and i think IMDb has this to low at number 49 because this movie is defiantly better than pulp fiction and one flew over the cuckoos nest and maybe better than Schindler's list this is an absolute must see! you wont be disappointed. this is what acting is all about acting is about being the character and in this movie for 2 hours you couldn't tell that it was Don Cheadle PLAYING Paul Rauseabigina Don Cheadle WAS Paul Rauseabigina.Its amazing how hotel Rwanda does not win best picture best actor and best actor it ridiculous just because ray was all about a really famous person does not mean they should win best picture this is just like 1994 when shaw shank redemption got robbed
rlange-3,"Apr 19, 2005",2/10,"First, the good. It was an inspirational film both in demonstrating the personal heroism and humanity of the reluctant heroes and the deep and abiding love between the hotel manager and his family.Unfortunately the film was apparently intended as a piece of political propaganda. Anyone familiar with the issues involved will find some of the points put forth by the film ridiculous and an insult to their intelligence.The horror of war was, if anything, thoroughly sanitized. Over a million people were killed in the real war, and Kigali as the largest city was the center of much of the violence. Yet we see a few hundred corpses scattered about with no closeups, and few if any people actually being killed. This is not to demand a gore-fest, but if thousands were hacked to death by machete wielding tribesmen, why not grudgingly give into the reality and show how cruelly disgusting it was?While the violence was clearly and overwhelmingly African on African, much of the moral outrage expressed in the movie is directed at the Europeans. And, of course, the Americans. As if it were our responsibility to save the Africans from themselves. Kipling would have been in full accord with the ""white man's burden"" concept underlying the moral themes of the movie.This is furthered by an interesting piece of history presented on the origin of the Hutus and Tutsi. Guess who's fault all this is? Why, the Belgians of course. Never mind the fact that the area was originally held by the Twa who were conquered by the Hutus a thousand years ago and then taken over by the Tutsis probably 500 years ago, long before there were any Belgians around to muck things up. The film delivers the preposterous concept that all was love and Kumbaya until the Evil Europeans showed their faces and separated them intro tribes. Utter balderdash.Then we have the UN. Forget the fact that UN peacekeeping forces on this planet have been found to be regularly engaged in the sex trade for children and common bribery. The UN troops in the movie are all Sir Galahad's from another planet, riding here and there to the rescue who's sole problem is that they are hopelessly outnumbered. I practically expected a ""Donate the the UN Support Group"" phone bank number to flash on the screen every time Nolte appeared.While there is plenty of moral bashing against Europe and America there is no attempt whatsoever to ask the counterpoint -- why should it have been the responsibility of Europe and America to intervene in the middle of a massive tribal war? One can debate the point, and certainly good people can draw conclusions on either side of this issue. But the issue is simply never raised. It's all about how cowardly America and the French are for not sending in the Marines. And now that you mention it, why America and not China, Egypt, South Africa, Japan, Russia, or Germany? Belgium may have had historic interests there by certainly the US never had African colonies. How did we somehow become part of the select group of the guilty?Overall, it was worth seeing, but only if you open your eyes and see the baloney sandwich you are being served, and hold your nose when you smell it. A major disappointment."
monkeeking,"Feb 27, 2005",N/A,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is the heart-wrenching story of Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered over 1,200 Tutsi refugees from the Hutu militia and their 'purification' crusade in 1994. The movie begins by giving a thorough explanation of the political situation in Rwanda at the time. The nation is divided by two factions, the Hutu and the Tutsi. Rwanda, being freed from its Belgian colonizers, forms its own national government and attracts the attention of the international media and wealthy tourists. However the Hutu population, the majority, still resents the Tutsis for their alleged cooperation with the Belgian colonizers. By the early nineties both factions have organized their own militias and the official government is leaning toward the corrupt Hutu cause of exterminating the Tutsi people. The UN is caught in the middle trying to act as a peacekeeping force.Paul (Don Cheadle) is a Hutu that must use various diplomatic skills as a hotel manager, a job bringing him in contact with various entities. When violence does break out, Paul goes against his instincts and decides upon protecting his endangered Tutsi neighbors. As they escape to the refuge of the hotel more refugees come under Paul's care and he realizes that the UN and the media, the only ones who can protect him, are fleeing the country. Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) is a UN commander that has befriended Paul and, being one of the few westerners who cares about the genocides, does his best to protect Paul's hotel.I must say that the entire cast is outstanding. Don Cheadle becomes Paul right before our eyes and amazes us in virtually every scene. Sophie Okonedo plays Paul's courageous Tutsi wife, Tatiana Rusesabagina, who encourages her husband every step of the way. This character reminds me of the old adage: behind every strong man is a stronger woman. Nick Nolte has one of the greatest and most convincing scenes in the movie when he (as Col. Oliver) explains to Paul why the West doesn't care about his plight.The director and producer, Terry George, pulls the picture together in such a way that it is an outrage was not nominated for an Oscar. The dialogue is realistic and human in every sense. Finally, the cinematography tells the story in such a straightforward manner that with the very appropriate (and sometimes eerie) music we as an audience feel transported into Paul's terrifying world.""Hotel Rwanda"" is an excellent tale of survival."
MLDinTN,"Feb 15, 2006",9/10,"but not the best movie of the year. I've seen other movies about the conflict between Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda. All were good. It would be hard to make a really bad film about such a powerful subject. The film focuses of Paul, a hotel manager at a swank hotel. It's where all the white people vacation and journalists gather. The genocide of the Tutsi breaks out and they seek refuge at the hotel. Paul is Hutu but his wife is not. He does business with other Hutus who help keep the hotel safe for a while. Paul tries to buy time by bribing soldiers with money and beer. He knows they all will be killed if forced to leave the hotel. The only thing keeping them safe is the hotel is not considered a refuge camp. But the Hutus who are committing murder on the streets know Tutsis are in the hotel. Paul is offered a chance to turn some over in order to get his family out but will not do it.Don Cheadle was very good. He uses a convincing accent. He must play a man who appears strong and in charge but really breaks down behind closed doors because he knows their chance of surviving is low.FINAL VERDICT: Good, compelling, but any movie about this subject would be. Good acting, Cheadle definitely deserved all the award nominations."
diva_k13,"Mar 18, 2005",10/10,"I just got back from seeing Hotel Rwanda and in attempting to write a review, I find that all my words are lacking and are inadequate as well. I cannot fully describe the extent into which I was drawn into and moved by this film.I cried and laughed and rejoiced-the full gamut of emotions. Don Cheadle should have won the Oscar for this performance. I do not care what the Academy voters think-HE deserved it for his performance of a man, simply trying to keep not only his family, but innocent people from harm.The woman who played his wife, (sorry, I cannot remember her name) was just as excellent as Cheadle. I also commend the thousands of extras who composed this film-especially the children.Heart-wrenching, inspiring, enlightening, everyone should see this film. You will not regret it."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Mar 31, 2006",10/10,"Ten years after the atrocities and genocide in Rwanda, Africa, a movie is made about the man who helped lessen the loss. The man who gave everything he had in order to save complete strangers. Who put his life on the line for his fellow human beings. I couldn't possibly put to words how hard it was for me to hold back the tears for almost all of this movie(which I had to, due to the crowd I saw it with). Some of these tears weren't ones of sadness... they were at the beauty inherent in this person. This humanitarian. With everything to lose and nothing to gain, he selflessly helped people who had nothing to offer him in return. This movie reminded me of Schindler's List. However, as one of the other viewers pointed out to me, it's far easier to distance yourself from that... with all possible respect to any and all victims of it, World War 2 ended over 60 years ago. What this movie depicts is just over a decade ago. Genocide. Which took place while us in the West sat far away, comfortable and not affected by it... and we did nothing. No UN, no US forces, nothing. This film is incredibly touching. I can't see anyone watching and not being emotionally involved. The plot is well-written and intriguing. The pace is perfect. It never moved too slow or too fast. It started adequately slow, but moved intensely later on. The acting is all spot-on. The writing is excellent. A great film that everyone should see. I recommend this to everyone who can sit through. Watch it if you get the chance and you're hardened enough to take it. 10/10"
KaJin,"Oct 25, 2005",6/10,"Regarding the fact that most people don't know that much about the massacres in Rwanda, this movie was necessary to show the shocking things that happened and the rejection of help by the western countries. However, I don't think people bring the critical acclaim the motion picture - not the documentary - needs: Many actors and actresses did a rather poor job, especially Nick Nolte was really disappointing in my opinion. I appreciate the directors job for delivering a movie with tension and the information every viewer needed, but after the parts couldn't make me believe they really happened because of the in some scenes crappy performances by the UN-Guy and Paul's wife which just let me realize that even if these things happened, they don't seem as real as they could if the actors would do a better job. That sucked the special quality out of a masterpiece: Great shocking film with information everybody needs to get, some errors in the performance that this story does not deserve."
gradyharp,"Apr 17, 2005",10/10,"With these words written on a visitors' log in a memorial site in Rwanda, the reason for making this stunning film is posed. HOTEL RWANDA is not only a well written (Keir Pearson), well directed (Terry George), well acted (entire cast) work of cinematic history, it serves as a thunderingly loud announcement of how the world ignored the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, Africa - a country whose only exports are tea and coffee and therefore not high on the agendas of importance of the other nations of the world. HOTEL RWANDA brings us the realization that there are many unreported acts of inhumanity that never reach our television or radio or newspapers. How many of us knew about this incident before now? But this well-crafted film is all the more poignant because it focuses on the quiet heroism of one elegant, enlightened hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his response to the Tutsi rebel uprising that resulted in the slaughter of over a million people, and for what reason? Going back to the time when Belgium 'owned' the country they divided the people into the Tutsi and Hutu categories based on skin color, nasal width and other absurd parameters. With Belgium's exit the two parties were placed in delicate balance and long years of struggle for control resulted in the 1994 disaster.The senselessness of the genocide is shown by the selection of victims for which the Tutsi rebels depended on registration cards to identify Tutsis from Hutus: in reality the people had intermarried - even Hutu Paul was married to Tutsi Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) - so that the killings were wholly irrational. Given this madness, Paul struggles with the insurgency and gives shelter to as many people as he can squeeze into his hotel, refugees including orphan Tutsis, hotel staff, and friends and fellow countrymen in need of a Gilead. All of this is happening while the United Nations contingency led by Col. Oliver (Nick Nolte) is impotent and the outside reporters such as Jack Daglich (Joaquin Phoenix) grab footage of the slaughter and flee to safety. Only a Red Cross nurse Pat Archer (Cara Seymour) remains to assist in any way she can. Paul attempts to contact the outside world through his employer Mr. Tillens (Jean Reno) of the Belgian Sabena Airlines, but the world refuses to recognize the reality of Paul's plight in saving his countrymen.The cast is exceptional: Don Cheadle and Sophie Okoneda are brilliant in their roles and the supporting cast is superb. The DVD opens with a statement from Don Cheadle the actor, the movie unfolds, and the remainder of the CD includes 'the making of' sequences and historical segments that for once are not self-serving aggrandizement, but sensitively informing pleas for understanding and digestion of a genocide that was ignored. This is a powerful film that deals with an atrocity without electing to lambaste the viewer with gore: the message is more powerful for its understatement."
noilie,"Aug 12, 2005",7/10,"I really wish people would stop gushing about how GREAT this film is, how it made you CRY, MOAN, WEAP, GENUFLECT, etc. YES, I agree that the film is brilliant. It GETS one's attention. IT is a story powerfully told. Unfortunately, it also inspires a general sense (to my mind, and after reading some of the posts here) of armchair philanthropy. Stasis. Inactivity. It is great that there is a film that takes Africa and individualized Africans figures, seriously as its primary Subject, tells the story from an African point of view. This is the first mainstream film (to my mind, that has done this). Africa, as a concept, is most often seen as a massive, dirty, backwards ""Heart of Darkness"", unexplored unless by prying, objectifying news cameras (starving children with snot running out of their noses etc.) The fault doesn't lie with the film (it is quite firm about its contempt for the ""West's"" strategic lack of agency). The problem lies with people like YOU, quite happy to sing the film praises, but not much else. There is a post further down that (flippantly) refers to this film as ""This year's Schindler's List"". What a cheek! Yes, this may be one of those ""never forget what happened film's"", but while the Holocaust recedes ever further into history, atrocities of similar proportions still happen on this continent (I am a South-African). The speed and force with which the ""Rwanda"" happened forced the West (retrospectively) to sit up and listen. Although slower, other protracted battles/hotspots(a misnomer no doubt coined by that beast CNN) continue to shock the mind out of comprehension. Angola, for example only recently (three years ago) ended an over twenty year civil war (see, in Africa its ""on again: and ""off again: so no-one really knows how long these things last and whether or not they ever truly end, case in point: Sudan. The list goes on. To list ""issues"", rant-style, here would be counter-intuitive, to my mind. Go find out.Hopefully there will be more films about African SUBJECTS in the future.Most of the major supporting actors are South-African (and they all give performances as good as Cheadle's). It was mainly filmed in and around Soweto (in Johannesburg, where I live).Calling this film ""this years Schindler's LIst"" is, to put it lightly, unconscionable. Think ""historically specific"" next time, hey? Rant Over.Do something from your end. Find out how. Avoid condescension."

orourkec-292-269155,"May 29, 2014",7/10,"Summary: HOTEL RWANDA stars Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a real lifetime hotel manager who became a courageous hero in Kigali when he witnessed the horrifying massacre of the Tutsis by the Hutu extremists in Rwanda, while the rest of the world looked on and did nothing about it. The massacre was part of one of the few of the worst atrocities in humankind history and it really occurred in April 1994, now twenty years ago. This is a story that really happened and it isn't fictional. 4 or maybe 5 parts of the true reality were changed in the film, but overall the movie mostly shows what really happened, I think. This is the kind of dramatic motion picture which completely catches your attention and drives you through the minds and emotions experienced by the leading characters. This is a story that I believe everyone should pay careful attention because Hotel Rwanda is truly sobering and heartfelt, and I'm really not kidding about it. In my opinion, everyone should like this movie and pay close attention to the way characters behave, because that's mainly what captured my mind and made me like the film. My comments are that the actors who had the main lead in the story all played well and were believable inside the skin of their characters they were interpreting. Don Cheadle and Sophie Kurlenko had an excellent performance and I won't ever forget it. Their performance was well done, because the magnitude of their performance was so high and that really shows the power of the human struggle and how much they care about the problems taking place around them. Plus, the film has feel-good warmth, is constantly filled with one problem after another, has a sparklingly original, well written screenplay and that's all great. This isn't a movie about action, but about the human heart and don't already think in advance that the movie will be boring with not enough action. JUST go watch it and see it for yourself. Enjoy!"
arcbonita,"Nov 24, 2006",2/10,"http://www.waynemadsenreport.com/See above for what a piece of fiction this ""true"" story is. How did Don Cheadle get tricked into making this movie? The French are bringing out the truth about this affair. This is another example of Hollywood history. The BBC debunked Spielberg's ""Munich"" with a brief but effective documentary of important information that Spielberg conveniently left out. They have done the same thing with the just released movie on Robert F. Kennedy, ""Bobby."" Let's see who will do a documentary, now that the truth is out about what really happened in Rwanda, on how Hollywood perpetuated this fraud."
WalterFrith,"Feb 26, 2005",N/A,"The genocide in Rwanda in 1994 was overlooked by the world who have no excuses this time to do something about the genocide in Sudan that is currently taking place as this review is being written. We need a constant reminder that the world's genocide does nothing to solve anyone's problems and 'Hotel Rwanda' casts a positive light on one citizen of Rwanda.....a man named Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a hotel manger in Rwanda who saved over 1200 people from the genocide by sheltering them in his hotel. Aided by his wife (Sophie Okonedo) a UN general (Nick Nolte), and his staff, Rusesabagina became an important hero that has rightly been characterized in this film by director Terry George and one hopes this film will be remembered as importantly as 1984's 'The Killing Fields'."
rych9009,"May 27, 2005",10/10,"In 1994 a mass genocide took place in an African country called Rwanda. Have you not heard of this tragedy or have you CHOSEN to turn the other cheek? Now, let us break down the word genocide, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines genocide as ""the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group."" Does Hitler pop into your mind? Well, less then ten years ago (in your lifetime) this event happened. The movie Hotel Rwanda is an excellent portrayal of the absolute devastation that took place. Millions of Rwanda natives were killed in this mass genocide. Don Cheadle gives an astonishing portrayal of Paul Rusesagagina a savior for over a thousand caught up in the madness occurring right outside the gates of the Hotel Mille Collines. ""When the world closed its eyes, he opened his arms,"" a tagline that fits oh so well into the heartfelt movie that puts you right into the conflict. Perhaps you did not care to pay attention in 1994 when the conflict fully unraveled, but see this movie and you may change your thoughts about looking at the horrors occurring abroad within our own small world."
gjerjoy,"Jun 20, 2005",10/10,Unbelievable account of events that happened in Rwanda. The atrocities that took place will take your breath away. One man's courage and desperation helped him save the lives of over a thousand people. Don Cheadle's performance is brilliant. Nick Nolte's performance is flat and dreary. Sophie Okonedo as the loving mother and wife is perfect. The scene where all the white people are boarding buses and leaving the Tutsis for sure massacre is compelling. When the Tutsis get on the phone to anyone they know that might help and manage to obtain exit visas hope prevails only to be thwarted when the UN trucks are surrounded by the rebels and must turn back and return to the hotel.This is a must see movie.
wisewebwoman,"Feb 16, 2005",9/10,"The action in this film takes place in 1994, when war exploded between two tribes in Rwanda - the Hutus and the Tutsis. This film tells the story of what happened, focussing on Paul Rusesabagina, (played by Don Cheadle) the manager of a four-star hotel in the capital city owned by Belgians (who caused the tribal problems to begin with but that is another story). He and his friend, the UN commander Oliver played by Nick Nolte, assisted over a thousand Tutsi refugees by first of all hiding them in the hotel and then through mounting tension and bloodshed whisking them outside the war area to safety.The film reminded me of Schindler's List and had the same powerful effect. Much like the book on which it was based (I believe)- Romeo Dallaire's ""Shake Hands with the Devil."" The character of Oliver is loosely based on Colonel Dallaire - and a film should be made about him too, he is given short shrift in this movie.It is about the nobility of the human character when faced with incredible acts of evil and horror. Particularly when the world turns its back, as it is still doing on Africa. Some horrors are just too huge (the Holocaust, the Irish famine, Rwanda) to be comprehended. The tsunami is about all we can manage. The rest we know in hindsight, as in this movie and others like it.This nobility of character is never more exemplified than by Don Cheadle in this movie. His acting has to be seen, he just nails the character of Paul, the hotel manager who knows all the tricks of diplomacy, graft and bribery in the book.The depiction of the actual horror in Rwanda is fairly discreet and leaves much to the imagination it is rendered through radio broadcasts and one haunting scene of a road fading into the horizon covered in the hacked bodies of women and children. There were many heroes in Rwanda, the orphanage managers, the nuns, the UN peacekeepers defying orders not to shoot, but we observe it all through the eyes of Paul, his day to day wrestling with the sheer challenge of feeding and hiding over 1000 people in his hotel.The movie ends on an uplifting note, a surprise, much like ""Schindler's List"". It is still with me, which is always the sign of a great movie. Don Cheadle should get the Oscar. He is simply stunning.The one word that strikes me about the Pauls and the Oskars of this world is that they were noble, an old-fashioned word. We cannot apply that word to too many but it is something to which we should all aspire. 9 out of 10."

SnoopyStyle,"Dec 31, 2015",6/10,"It's 1994 Kigali. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is a hotel manager who knows the right people and gets things done. He's Hutu but is apolitical. He sees signs of upheaval. His wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) is Tutsi but he expects his connections to pull his family through. Canadian Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) from the UN is at the hotel touting the new peace agreement. Reporter David (David O'Hara) and cameraman Jack Daglish (Joaquin Phoenix) arrive to cover the story. When the massacres start, his home and then his hotel are inundated with refugees.This is a sincere telling of a harrowing historical story. Don Cheadle delivers a sincere performance. It's all very sincere. There is an inevitability to the story. It is a bit heavy-handed but the history demands some heavy-handedness. However, the lines coming out of Colonel Oliver is too much. There are a couple of instances of overly sincere lines when the simple images are more than enough. I'm almost glad that the white people left the hotel. The movie points the camera at one horrifying scene after another."

I just saw this movie last night and I didn't have a clue what the movie was actually about. All I had heard was that this movie was such a awesome movie and that I should see it.OK this movie is based on historical events. The movie is about two different kinds of people, the Tutis and the Hutu. How can you tell the difference, this is exactly what I thought. This is how it was explained to me was the Tutis have lighter color skin than the Hutu do, they are the darker color. This movie is based on what happened in Rwanda in 1994. Where these two different kinds of people were at war. The exact thing that happened back in 1994 in Rwanda, is now currently happening in the Congo right now.Wow, what a excellent performance from Don Cheadle. Don Cheadle did an excellent job in playing Paul Rusesabagina. I am really glad that he received a Best Actor Nomination for this movie as in the way he portrays his character, was so excellent. Plus all the supporting actors/actress did a phenomenon job in those roles, they played.This movie should have received a ton of Oscar Nominations as it was such an excellent movie, one of the Best Dramas of the year.

But besides it being a great ""movie"", it's a great story... The happenings in Rwanda really needed to get out to the public, and a documentary was not the way to go about getting attention. This did it, this really did. The decision to take what happened in Rwanda and personalize it to a single individual was a great one. The connection you feel for Paul and his family in this movie is far greater than any other movie you'll find yourself watching. You'll notice subtle little things about his character, his personality... It has some of the most influential scenes I have ever seen. I will admit, I find myself ""downloading"" movies a lot more than going to them. But my family rented this movie, and now I've made it a point to purchase it... and show it to everyone I know.

pedrofjmk,"Apr 26, 2005",8/10,"It's no secret that this film caused a lot of controversy, stirred many lakes, revolted many people and moved many more. All of us will have different interpretations of it. The one undeniable fact, however, is that what we see on the screen happened. As is. No law and peace-abiding Nation did a thing to prevent it. All those who could flee, fled. The rest is history.Don Cheadle has a break-through role in his career. The role of a man who, saving the distances, reminds me of other brave people such as Schindler or Aristides de Sousa Mendes, whom in extreme circumstances, and going beyond their very human fears and flaws, did the right thing. Nick Nolte doesn't have a brilliant role. Actually, as flimsy as the helplessness the poor Canadian Colonel felt in real life, probably.Hotel Rwanda is a real eye-opener. It reminds everyone that the news have a human face. What happened there in the 90s is nowadays happening in Sudan (and has been for years!) as in other places: people are simply getting killed for nothing. That's the bottom line. Some will say that's the way the world is. Those are the cynical. That is not the way the world should be. We screamed never again. Yet, here it is again, asking for a new script in 2015: Hotel Khartum. The acting is not superb. The script aims at telling a story, but also at making the movie a real tear-jerker.But if one thinks about all those that survived the Genocide and are perhaps thankful for the story, then it had to be worth making it. Despite the lack of help, no one will now be able to forget.Any human being must feel ashamed of himself while watching it. It's a civil offense in most democracies to see someone in need of help and doing nothing. There isn't a more extreme example. We all shoved it under the carpet and pretended it wasn't there. Hotel Rwanda stands as a memory. To face us with our passiveness, it should be mandatory."
LeFreak-5,"Jun 2, 2005",9/10,"I loved the film, and have absolutely nothing new to say that hasn't been already covered in the many positive reviews here.But I am a bit obsessive around the issue of authenticity and accuracy in something that is supposed to convey factual events, and there was one thing that drove my just bugged eyed throughout the film. As a Canadian, a former member of our military, and a huge admirer of General Dallaire, I had some difficulties warming up to Nick Nolte's character. I can't quite put my finger on it, but Nolte seemed almost unfocused, sloppy, and unconvincing in the part. On top of this, the inaccuracies in his uniform drove me absolutely around the bend--the little ""CANADA"" bar that is supposed to sit just beyond the four ""colonel"" stripes on the shoulders is a standard feature of the uniform, and its absence on an officer that was obviously supposed to be Canadian really discombobulated me in every scene Nolte was in.But I know the typical IMDb reviewer doesn't fret about such things and will likely advise me to lighten up. So in closing, I will--the movie was moving, engaging, engrossing, impeccably acted, beautifully photographed and uncomfortably informative. I loved it."
benihana83,"Apr 19, 2005",10/10,"With all due respect to Jamie Foxx, Don Cheadle gave the best performance of 2004 in Hotel Rwanda. The real-life tale of the Rwandan genocide that took place in 1994 might not have been seen by the majority of the American public this winter, but it should have been. As Rwandan hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, Cheadle commands every scene and puts himself into the upper echelon of today's American actors.The story of Hotel Rwanda may not be familiar to many. In over 100 days in 1994, nearly one million people died as a result of a war between two Rwandan tribes, the Hutus and the Tutsis. This tragedy was completely overlooked the world over, especially here in America.During this civil war, Rusesabagina housed thousands of Rwandan refugees in his hotel, the Mille de Colline. As hotel manager, he bargained, pled and bribed for the lives of friends, family members and those he didn't even know.After numerous, but memorable, supporting roles in movies like Swordfish, Bulworth, Ocean's Eleven, Boogie Nights and Traffic, it was refreshing to see Cheadle get his chance at being a leading man.While Cheadle was the heart and soul of Hotel Rwanda, he wasn't the only bright spot. In addition to the aforementioned writing and direction from Terry George, relative newcomer Sophie Okonedo turns in a brilliant, Oscar-nominated performance as Rusesabagina's wife, Tatiana. Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte also nail their supporting roles, Phoenix as an ashamed American journalist and Nolte as a struggling UN Colonel trying to keep the peace.Though Phoenix appears in just a few scenes, he delivers the most memorable and perhaps the most accurate line depicting the Rwandan conflict. ""If people see this,"" he says, referring to Americans watching the news at home, ""they'll say, 'Oh my God, that's horrible,' and then go on eating their dinners."" Maybe, if more people get a chance to see Hotel Rwanda, that sentiment could change. This isn't just a movie; it's a film that can change lives, policy and the way we think about our actions."

If you accept this premise, then you'll probably find the film moving and meaningful; if you don't, then you may find it manipulative and rather shallow. Don Cheadle's performance is very good, and there are several moments of real tension, but I couldn't stop feeling that almost everything in the movie was designed to bludgeon the viewer and provoke guilt. As for me, I don't think France should be the policeman for the world, and neither should the United States.

diane-34,"Feb 20, 2005",N/A,"My wife and I watched this movie in Fremantle yesterday afternoon and although I had a rough idea about what I was about to watch, the actual movie was far stronger than I had anticipated. The producer, director and writer, Terry George, must be congratulated for bringing to the screen such a horrendous story and yet making that story palatable to the extent that it is nominated for Academy Awards in a number of categories. Beyond that I was struck by the deftness with which he handled the unthinkable through elucidating the reasons the civil war massacres were taking place-the anger that motivated the participants. So often writers leave the audience in complete dark as to these motivations for some terrible event-the perpetrators are: simply fill in the words-mad, evil, stupid, directed, etc. We disagree with the bloodletting but we have no reasons to account for it.Georges decision to cast Dan Cheadle in the lead role was inspirational-Cheadle handled a demanding role so well that I thought I was watching TV footage or a documentary. All the actors were superb and all contributed to this total feeling of ""realness."" I could talk about every person on the screen but perhaps my favourite was Fano Mokoena who played the Huto general who maintained the hotel sanctuary. Beyond Mokoena was Nick Nolte's portrayal of a Canadian Peace Keeper-I love Nolte's work but this small role was one of his best.Please see the movie-it's one of those rare movies that has so much light to shed on a piece of history people would rather not see."
zabokrugby8,"Mar 28, 2012",9/10,"Although dwarfed by the national scope of the actual events, 'Hotel Rwanda' did capture succinctly sometimes even in vivid detail the horrors that were inflicted by the Hutu and Tutsi tribal factions on each other. Some say the scale of Hutu slaughter of the minority Tutsis reached genocide proportions.And as we learned from the film the Hutus did just that. One major Hutu henchmen character, George, stated it this way.'""We're half way there.""The screen play is a compelling story. Paul, (reprised masterfully by Don Cheadle) is a front-line manager at the 4 Star Des Milles Collines hotel in Kigali, Rwanda's capitol. His colonial employers, the Sabena Corporation, are headquartered in Europe, Belgium to be specific.No doubt the former colonial rulers of this land still take pride in their African possession. Their resort hotel is an oasis in the hot sun not only to tourists but to foreign diplomats, international press, and domestic government officials.One of the Rwandan Army's top generals (later convicted for his role in the genocide) in the region is a frequent visitor. Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) head of the U.N. Peacekeeping force (sparse) also is an honored guest. We learn soon that the U.N. Colonel Oliver and the good Hutu general share a common trait. The both enjoy the elixir that the staff serves: imported single malt Scotch whiskey.Paul made sure the bar was always well stocked with good spirits. For certain, life at the hotel was like that of any other African resort: relaxed and far from the maddening crowd and wild animals. Both locals and hotel guests alike enjoy their stays.Paul sees to it, sometimes personally. In his presence, people are treated royally. His and the hotel's reputation depend on it.And who wouldn't want to kick up their heels in the hotel's air conditioned bar after a hot day in the Central African sun? For about 30-40 minutes I too succumbed to the hotel's luxurious ambiance and decadent pleasures. Yes, even Cohibas, the finest Cuban cigars were offered to select guests.Then the dogs of war are let loose. Rumors abound that the Hutu President was assassinated. The head of state was bound for Tanzania to sign a peace agreement with the rebel Tutsi opposition group. Later we learn from the Hutu dominated press (radio) the earlier terrible reports indeed are true.The Hutu media is quick to add their bias: the traitor Tutsi rebels performed the dastardly deed. Paul disagreed. So did I.However, the confirmed news and later evacuation of all foreign nationals from Rwanda (only if you're white or the holder of a foreign passport) places Paul, in a serious bind. He and he alone must now fend for and protect those 'guests' forced to stay.Many of the refugees are Tutsis. Knowing that fact, the Hutu machete wielding militia await outside the gates. With the grounds left unguarded, the Hutus no doubt will invade. Then the feeding (killing) frenzy starts.Their mission: kill all the traitor 'cockroaches'. That meant the Tutsis were to be singled out. Even the U.N. blinked. They laid an egg but not before Col. Nick announced that the pretty blue helmeted U.N. Armed Force was ordered to pull out of the hotel guarding business, permanently. No surprise there...Now the their situation looks hopeless. Surrounded all around by bloodthirsty Hutu militia, their supplies cut off, even the water, Paul prepares for the inevitable. He asks each guest to call a friend.In his own words, Paul knows exactly what to do: play the guilt card. He also instructs his guests on how to say 'Goodbye'.""Make them (friends) feel ashamed.""Now knowing the true aftermath of the slaughter (almost 1 million), I couldn't find fault with his tack."

You will know that reason once you have seen it.Don Cheadle was great and I was surprised that he didn't won the Oscar. The performances really are great. Especially in the scene when all the foreign tourists are leaving the hotel and Paul watches them, standing in the rain, as they go away safely from the riots leaving the Rwandans... the emotions run deep. You even see a lady holding a dog in the bus. Now that's creativity!I would recommend this to everyone. It's a unique movie with a very different style of film-making. And surprisingly, it's entertaining too. Hats off to Hotel Rwanda and 10/10."
antoniotierno,"Jan 17, 2006",8/10,"What I expected and longed to see the most in this film, based on facts that should hit everyone's consciences, was a strong emotional impact. Well, the director has been successful in that, managing to tell a heartfelt tale. Don Cheadle's performance is simply outstanding, deep and convincing and I found strong also the peace keeper Nick Nolte and the American photographer Joaquin Phoenix. Hotel Rwanda is one of the best movies I've ever seen and its lesson should be carved in everybody's soul. It is obviously very disturbing for the quantity of violence and blood shown but its authenticity and emotional complexity make it a masterpiece."
zutterjp48,"Dec 27, 2019",7/10,"Many years ago I saw ""Hotel Rwanda"" and I enjoyed this film, because I knew the story of the civil war and of the genocide in Rwanda (also because I have lived in Rwanda some years in the seventies).This film is well known (over 300.000 ratings in imdb) !! There are other very good films about the civil war and the Rwandan genocide: ""Un dimanche à Kigali, Sometimes in April, Kinyarwanda, Shooting dogs !! Taking one some distance ""Hotel Rwanda"" looks then like the story of an Rwandan Schindler !!
The performance of Don Cheadle is very good.
Finally all these films about Rwanda are complementary: several points of view about the same tragedy !!"
raina_bee87,"Jul 24, 2006",10/10,"Grade: ATerry George's sober-sided and ham-fisted Hotel Rwanda is a caustic indictment of Western indifference to atrocities committed in the world's rawer precincts. It reminds us that we have short memories and shorter attention spans and most newspapers these days cede coverage of foreign events to the various cable news networks. We pay little attention to the internecine tribulations of savage foreigners so long as only brown or yellow people are involved.And so, a decade after the slaughter of nearly a million Rwandan Tutsi by their Hutu countrymen, many Americans may be surprised to learn that such atrocities took place -- that the powder blue helmets of United Nations peacekeepers could virtually stand aside for genocide. Even the division of the Rwandans into Hutus and Tutsi can be laid at the feet of the West -- it was Belgian colonists who decided the slender, lighter-skinned Tutsis were superior to their Hutu brothers and required that all citizens carry identity cards that identified them by their ethnicity. For decades, the Belgians encouraged the belief that the Tutsi minority was superior to the Hutus. Tutsi were favored with better educational opportunities and jobs than the Hutu, with predictable results: In 1959, 20,000 Tutsis were killed in a series of riots. When Belgium relinquished control of Rwanda in 1962, the Hutu majority adopted the Tutsi as an all-purpose scapegoat. Some Tutsis fled to Uganda and -- along with some moderate Hutus -- formed an opposition group called the Rwandan Patriotic Front.In the midst of this maelstrom, Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu hotel manager with European manners and training, was able to save more than 1,200 endangered Rwandans by passing them off as ""guests"" at the Belgian-owned Milles Collines resort in Kigali. Rusesabagina has so often been compared to Oskar Schindler, the Czech industrialist who saved the lives of thousands of Polish Jews during World War II, that the comparison feels easy and reflexive, but the truth is Rusesabagina performed a miracle in Kigali. As played by the ever-efficient Don Cheadle, Rusesabagina is the ultimate concierge. He knows his clients and uses a brutal general's taste for single-malt Scotch and Cohiba cigars to buy time and protection for his charges. A walking argument for decency, we see sublimated anger flashing in his civilized eyes as he deals with all sides to maintain his makeshift sanctuary. A product of European grooming, Rusesabagina can't quite believe that he -- and his people -- have been abandoned by those he'd considered his friends. Cheadle admits a trace of hubris to his character; Rusesabagina's horror at being abandoned mingles with disgruntlement at being not quite a full-fledged member of the corporate family.Director George isn't as subtle as Cheadle. He's an old Irish Republican who tends to see the world in strident shades, but he has got hold of a subject worthy of his righteous anger. And he has cast it with fine actors -- Nick Nolte quakes with self-disgust as a Canadian colonel ashamed of the orders he has to follow. Sophie Okonedo is brilliant as Rusesabagina's Tutsi wife, Tatiana."
sharan-ramesh,"Dec 11, 2005",8/10,"this movie represents so much what what Africa is made of. we talk of globalization and helping the needy. this is a true life incident when all the super powers of the world, took much longer than they should have to help Rwanda. i guess the reason for it was probably they all had no personal gains. when it comes to the central Asia and the oil rich gulf, the superpowers really stop at nothing to go all out to help them and use all their resources.its a shame that the world knows so little about Africa and how much we criticise their backwardness, i think this movie is a must see for all, in terms of true life incident, world history, acting, music, drama and finally HUMANITY."
flanders14,"Aug 15, 2005",3/10,"I'm extremely surprised to find that this film is currently #51 in the best 250 films. People don't seem to understand that it is BASED on a true story. Just because it is about something terrible that happened, people instantly change their criteria for what makes a good film. At the end of the day, this film is still poorly directed; has poorly delivered, cringe-worthy dialogue; some kind of product placement in every other scene; two dimensional characters; glosses over the genocide by only referring to it and never actually showing anyone getting killed; has gaping plot holes; and for some reason tries to put the blame of what happened on the Europe and America. Surely, that should be enough to make anyone think a movie is terrible..."
aw8975,"Feb 19, 2005",N/A,"I'm so glad I went to see Hotel Rwanda. At first I avoided it because I was afraid it would be too violent or political. But the film handled this brilliantly. The emotion and violence of the events are evident but you don't see the worst directly.The movie reminded me of other political films. But this one is so much more uplifting and entertaining. It's truly a human story that's so much more effective because it's true. You see the events mainly through one man's eyes. It really is a hero film that shows how tragedy can bring out the best in people not just for caring about others, but for being strong, calm and setting an example."
Josephrmazzara,"May 26, 2005",10/10,"In my sophomore year of college, I write a paper for my English class about the Rwandan genocide. I was well versed and knowledgeable about the atrocities that went on in April of 1994. I was, however, not prepared for the wide array of emotions felt by watching this film. The human cost of watching this film is astounding. As a member of the audience you will be terrified and enraged at the lack of concern given to the Rwandan people by the world community. But over and above the all, it is a story that needed to be told. Don Cheadle gives a performance which is only matched by the film greats. The story itself is the cinematic portrayal of humanity, both the ugly and the beautiful. As a member of the human race, you are obligated to see this film, if for no other reason then to know what happened so we can prevent it in the future. SEE THIS FILM!!!"
zachto-1,"Feb 1, 2005",10/10,"Remember when you saw Schindler's List and at the very end the movie switched to color and they showed some of the real survivors walking across the screen with the actors who played them? And you were like ""Oh, wow. This monstrosity wasn't so long ago. How could people still alive today allowed this to happen?"" Well, this movie gives you the same feeling...from the opening shot to the closing credits. It's all in color because this all happened just ten years ago. I was in college. And I didn't give it a moments notice. In other words, I was one of those people who let this happen, and didn't even bother to notice. Cheadle deserves the Oscar, in a walk. The story is not perfect, but it's heart wrenching and honest and frank. It has moments of sentimentality but I don't think it ever crosses the line into mawkish. Highly recommended."
icelandreliant,"Feb 1, 2005",10/10,"Hotel Rwanda is a an amazing movie and a story that needs to be told. The Rwandan genocide, lasting just a few months, was one of the greatest tragedies among many in the twentieth century. The US, Europe and the UN stood by and watched and this leaves us lessons for current conflicts in Sudan and other parts of Africa. As a movie, Hotel Rwanda is wonderful. Don Cheadle is perfect as Paul, tough and determined but full of doubt and fear. Any of us could be Paul but few would have the guts and strength. Some reviewers have claimed the movie is too Hollywood or does not show the true violence, but the use of sound, facial emotions and scenery forces the viewer to put themselves in the place of a Rwandan, not an American viewer. The movie is almost a documentary of what happened but is also very moving and an appropriate length. All in our theater were choked up with emotion at the end. I spent time in Tanzania in 2003, next door to Rwanda. East Africa is still dealing with the repercussions of the Rwandan genocide and so should the world. We all need to do what we can to prevent such conflicts."
nocturnallucidity,"Jul 16, 2005",6/10,"Worth Watching Once - Disappointing. After hearing so much about how fantastic this was supposed to be, it was just so mediocre. Absolutely everything is stereotypical ""drama movie"" setup, drilling into our heads how ""sad"" we should be. Secondly, Paul (the main character) is not a hero. He does the absolute least he can all through the movie unless his wife yells at him to do more. He is a coward and I felt completely unsympathetic to him. The only good parts about the movie are the pure truth moments (usually when Paul isn't talking) informing us of the horrors of the actual situation. That alone makes it worth watching, just be warned of the other clutter."
gazkrsa,"Jun 14, 2006",10/10,"""I think if people see this footage, they'll say Oh, my God, that's horrible. And then they'll go on eating their dinners.""Hotel Rwanda is not just about the conflict in Rwanda a few years ago, and its not just about one man's quest to save people. It is about the continuation of Africa's plight in their everlasting mission to live in peace.It is about the ruthlessness of people, and how corrupt society actually is in Africa, portrayed by the brilliant story of Paul Rusesabagina, a Hotel manager who housed over a thousand refugees during the conflict that killed over a million people.Yes, this has shocking scenes of bloodshed, horror and violence. But the contrasts of this horrible nature are balanced by the fantastic overwhelming calm of Paul Rusesabagina, played fantastically well by Don Cheadle.When i saw this movie i was shocked by what i saw, and moved by the sheer ignorance of myself as to what actually happened in Rwanda. Everyone should see this movie, if not for its power, but for the knowledge that you will gain from it.The question i ask of you is, will you carry on eating your dinner, or will you want to do something about it?"
HAMMERFIST11,"Feb 23, 2022",6/10,"It's an enjoyable movie, but its extremely toned down with barely any violence... and some of the dialogue is extremely cheesy.It is a bit disrespectful to the real events to not show the extent of the violence and to leave out the violent and gorey details just to get a PG-13 rating. It can't be understated how heavily the movie is brought down by this. It's a shame since the cast and set is put together pretty well and the writing is good."
SmithWrite,"Feb 26, 2005",N/A,"In a less competitive year, this film would have received its due as an Oscar contender. In addition to the top notch lead acting performances (which did receive nods), the movie tells a compelling story in a manner that perfectly balances horror with humanity. Mel Gibson could use lessons from this director in how much more effective suffering can be conveyed when it is done with more subtlety and restraint so the audience is never numbed by tragedy, but rather is kept constantly feeling with the characters so as to even laugh with them at the occasional light moment.The script may not be conventionally catchy in terms of original dialogue, but it allows the film to move well while presenting many of the characters (even some of the villains) as three-dimensional human beings. When people do things -- even those that may seem unwise -- we understand why they made that choice, which avoids the ""why would anyone do that"" problems that so annoy me in other movies.All in all, the film that should have had the ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Ray"" slot on Oscar night."
LeRoyMarko,"Jan 16, 2005",9/10,"Everybody should see this movie and even more our leaders. And they should feel ashame that they didn't act when the genocide was going on in 1994. And 10 years later, it's sad to say that lessons haven't been learned, even if a lot of good words have been said. Just look at what's going on in Darfur.Contrary to most people, I don't think Don Cheadle gave an Oscar winning performance. It's sometimes uneven. But Sophie Okonedo was just great. As for Nick Nolte, it was hard for me to really like him, because I was just thinking of General Roméo Dallaire, the true hero who was leading the incapacitated U.N. team. But forget about the acting, the story is too important to pay too much attention to performances. It's a heart wrenching film, with some rays of hope. There's some very moving scenes like the one where all the foreigners are leaving the hotel by bus.SEE IT! What more can I say?Seen at the Varsity, in Toronto, on January 15th, 2004.86/100 (***½)"
Archer1127,"May 31, 2005",10/10,"When the movie first came out i was skeptical of seeing it so i didn't. But last week I decided while scanning the video shelves at blockbuster to rent it and when i did... I was glad i had. I cant believe for one minute i was about to let myself not see this movie. Hotel Rwanda is purely amazing, without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life And i have seen quite a few movies, i guess you could say i'm a semi movie-buff. The movie represents a compelling story full of truth, around every turn. AS well as its representation of the truth it is suspenseful with a small amount of comedy built into a scene or to. My suggestion is ... Go See Hotel Rwanda!!!"
emma_salt,"Dec 3, 2006",10/10,"I watched this film only recently, and what an eye opener, as a westerner i only heard about the genocide through the the news but since reading certain reviews and commentaries, it bought a tear to my eyes. The parts played by all were heart felt and even though i cannot begin to understand what it was like. I give this film a 10 out of 10 i know this world is full of hatred and barbarians but................. never have i been moved by a scene such as the misty road scene. The struggles and trials and tribulations of Don Cheadle playing Paul a man ""playing both sides"" and his ""cockroach"" family and staff make me wonder exactly what the character and indeed the actor went through to achieve the tension the success and the horror to what the people of Rwanda must and did go through. The scenes were beautifully shot and even the ""chopping"" were to add a sense of reality to the situation for want of a better word. It can be compared to ""Schindlers List"" and even ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the ""Reality"" of the world today that it brings. The atrocities of the police chief and the warehouse people taking ""Paul"" as a dedicated Hutu but not quite understanding him as a man with morals and beliefs was easy to see but then again hard to understand. What makes this world react like this apart from religion, beliefs and politics."
Barky44,"Jul 31, 2005",9/10,"Hotel Rwanda is a great film. Yes, it has direct ties to a very heart-wrenching part of history, but what makes it powerful is the strong performance by Don Cheadle, an excellent supporting cast, great direction and storytelling.I love movies like this. I very much enjoy movies with historical settings, even if their not always accurate (not a problem with this film). But anyone can make a drama based on historical events. What matters to film is the event gets the proper focus and circles around a handful of important characters. ""Hotel Rwanda"" does just that: it shows the Rwandan genocide as it occurs within a few square kilometers with the hotel as a focal point. More importantly it shows the tragedy through the eyes of a handful of people (if you focus solely on Cheadle and miss the viewpoint of the main character's wife and children you miss a great deal). This is how great historical dramas are made. Look at ""Patton"", one of the best WWII films ever made, not because it showed the action any better than any other WWII movie, but it focuses on a single, strong character brilliantly played. ""Hotel Rwanda"" is such a movie.A great film, great performances (Cheadle was robbed of an Oscar on this one), and a powerful story. ""Hotel Rwanda"" should be shown in high schools across the country come fall.9 out of 10. Sometimes it was hard to figure out which side characters were which (perhaps that was the point based on the whole Hutu-Tutsi past), but that is only a small nit. Otherwise the film is excellent.Barky"
juicy8429,"Feb 28, 2008",7/10,"This movie was based on a true story about how the Hutu killing the Tutsi. It was originally called the Rwandan genocide. The Hero in real life was Paul Rusesabagina, but in the movie was Don Cheadle. The genocide lasted for over 100 days. This was not mentioned in the movie, but people were also dying of Aid's. This all happened on April 7th, 1994. Over 800,000 Tutsi's died. The Hutu called the Tutsi's cockroaches. In the movie they took pictures of kids and put them on a wall to let the parents or guardians know that they either have your child or your child is missing. This movie was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and Don Cheadle won best actor for 2004.By. Isaiah McCarter"
DICK STEEL,"Jan 22, 2005",10/10,"This is a powerful drama. In 1993, there was ethnic war between the Tutsis and the Hutus in Rwanda. The film highlights the horrors of war, and also brings forth that a man must do, in all his ability, to always protect his family first in times of crisis. It's sad, but true, that there is always a limit to the number of people you can help.Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager whose hotel was used by the UN and world media as a base for covering the supposed peace treaty between the 2 ethnic groups, and later used as a place of safe refuge when Hutus start to ethnic cleanse the ""cockroaches"" Tutsis - it's amazing how easily hatred is bred through endless radio broadcasts.Being a Hutu himself, and married to a Tutsi, this brings forth danger to Paul himself. However, with his street smarts, and network connections, he manages to stay one step ahead of the situation, and brings hope to his family, employees, and refugees, when all seems bleak.While the West has abandoned Paul and Rwanda, Paul has shown courage and hope in turning things around, during times of violence and rampant corruption. You're as good as what you can offer to those in power - once you have nothing, you're as good as a goner. This doesn't only apply to Paul and the generals, but also, on a bigger picture, between the West and Rwanda as well.I haven't watched a lot of movies starring Don Cheadle, except for the Ocean11/12 movies. Given these shows tend to root for strong leading man types, probably Denzel Washington, Cheadle does an excellent job here.No doubt the lack of A-stars, the supporting cast gave commendable performances, see if you can spot Joaquin Phoenix underneath his bearded face! I shan't preach here, but I must state that genocide is evil, and the world cannot turn a blind eye when it happens, no matter where.Watch this film, and understand."
martinsall,"Apr 30, 2005",7/10,In the Movie Hotel Rowanda a man Fights for himself and many other African Americans to be protected from the Hutu warriors. this movie had a good plot good acting and a good screenplay. though it had many good parts to it it still could have had more. the Geniside was a very bloody and breathtaking time. in this movie all i saw was safe non-bloody stuff and there were no breathtaking events. when I say that there was no blood I mean that that was really what happened and I didn't feel like they captured that violent time. it was a safe and boaring movie. I watched in the special features that they didn't want people to be scared to come see it because of the gore. On the contrary I think It would have made more people come see it.
ErikOD,"Jul 29, 2007",3/10,"I was disappointed in every aspect of this movie. The events that were supposedly depicted, including the background of genocide in Rwanda, were insipidly portrayed, pure Hollywoood hokum. The casting was mediocre, especially Nick Nolte, but also including most of the smaller parts, although Don Cheadle and his wife were portrayed competently. It was an obvious attempt to take a single series of events--the actions of this hotel manager--and parlay them into a typical movie format, when the Rwandan genocide deserved, indeed deserves, much more significant treatment. The one redeeming feature of the film was its portrayal of the cowardly and bigoted manner in which the West dealt with the tragedy, but even that was done without impact. Not a major motion picture at all. A major disappointment."
peaceout386,"Feb 27, 2005",N/A,"wow...this movie is absolutely incredible. Words cannot describe the feelings that came over me while I watched this movie....it wasn't even like watching a movie I felt like the outcome of this story would be the outcome of the world. As I watched it the gravity of what happened hit me and it was impossible to even consider the making of the film. Even so now thinking back on it, the portrayal of such an event with so much compassion is so smooth that the desired affect is reached. It drew me in so much that all I have words for is that this is the closest I have ever come to so much sadness and so much determination to survive. At the same time that it is completely depressing and eyeopening it is motivational. I don't want to be one of those people that goes back to eating their dinner after remarking on the misfortune of others."
MichMovieCritic,"Mar 7, 2005",9/10,"1) Cheadle was amazing...I believe that any other year he would have won the Oscar.2) The film did a very good job of interpreting the situation. It explained the intricacy of the foreign policy that was going on at the time in a way that most people should have been able to understand (i.e. that UN peace keeping officers cannot fire guns, the UN charter does not allow unilateral interventions by countries who want to help) The only thing that would have made this film more powerful was if it had shown some of the more gruesome atrocities...I believe that is one of the key elements that made Schindler's List a perfect film.Finally, I am so glad this film was made because I thought that, for sure, the Rwandan crisis was never going to be felt by western society. The filmmakers should be commended by the international community for their work, and by the motion picture industry for the masterpiece."
RECB3,"Jul 19, 2023",8/10,This is a well-crafted and powerful film. The history of what occurred is difficult. This film clearly displays the true nature of reality.

shirley12vineyard,"Aug 26, 2005",10/10,"I have read many of the responses and have no more to add other than to share how sobering it is to realise that, as we're in midst of general elections in this country, how our preoccupation with utter trivia (like how many extra discretionary $$'s we'll be better off if we give our vote to this or that party) pales into shameful embarrassment that our preoccupations are so trivial to a degree that's cringe-making.I offer an addition to the many perceptive observations made, as there is one that stays with me above all, after sitting still gripped by the impact, through all of the credits with that wonderful singing, and it is this...Darwinism has much to answer for, the 'ism' not Charles. The judgement made by the colonial powers, that one grouping was 'finer', more dignified, 'superior' - because of perceived 'fine points' of looks or body shape.....fine nose, taller stature ... whatever, let alone skin colour. The Belgians decided that the Tutsi's were 'the finest', and set that in privilege and in history. Other Euro colonials did no better, and if we're truthful we who should know better in the white West still hold these shameful stereotypes.When gifted with the opportunity to observe how a relatively non-attention seeking individual met the challenge to do inspirational good, it give me pause for thought and perhaps a re-arranging of my priorities as a citizen of this planet.Thankyou to the wonderful team who brought this masterpiece to the world.

jonbg,"Dec 10, 2005",7/10,"I was a little suspicious of this subject in George's hands given how some of the facts of his previous wok had been distorted for dramatic effect. I'm not sure if he has indulged himself again here, but I would not question the power or message the film conveys.But I wonder how many in the current anti-war movement ask themselves what exactly they would have had the west do in this, or any similar, situation given their shameful queasiness when confronted with uncontrollable atrocity and human rights abuses, such as in Iraq, Afghanistan and, in this case, Rwanda.It seems when faced with corrupt, insane murderous extremism such as practised by the likes of the Interehamwe, the Taliban, the Baathists - and currently the Janjaweed in Sudan - only force will do, and complicity in the status quo to preserve self interest is unacceptable.This thinking is, of course, a neo-conservative cornerstone and underpins much of its foreign policy theory - to its credit. In 1994 Clinton stood idly by and history shamefully glosses over this when it comes his presidency. Indeed he would have done the same in Bosnia had the British among others persuaded him not to.It is to our shame that while the west intervened in the Balkans Rwanda was left to implode, and equally depressing that the current (Tutsi) Rwandan leader, Paul Kagame, shows all the signs of playing to type as another despotic, militant for whom power is a means to an end, and something to be abused, as he conducts similar excursions into neighbouring DRC.Ultimately, though, this film should make audiences think and not forget the words of Dalliaire when Paul proposes a toast when the troops arrive."
thomvic,"Oct 12, 2010",10/10,"I didn't know much of the genocide that happened at Rwanda though I had heard brief talkings of it so this film was very intriguing for me to watch. What starts out as a man called Paul (played magnificently by Don Cheadle) who has the unfortunate burden of being the protector of hundreds of people who will surely be killed by the opposing party during a civil war. What we see is the conflicts of these characters who are trying to stay alive as the world abandons them.This film is truly gripping from start to finish. It is a very powerful film that makes you care about the characters so much and makes you marvel at the cruelty of humanity. What you see is a man who does not want to get involved in the corrupt politics of his surroundings and just wants to run a nice hotel, but then ultimately becomes the hero to many people in order to save them. You also learn of the selfishness of powerful countries such as America an the UK in how they simply do not see countries such as Rwanda as of any significance for them.The film has terrific performances from everyone, the violence is not as bloody as what I thought it would be but it has a high degree of realism that it becomes violent in your mind and through what you can only imagine is happening in the slaughter. A movie like this can only bring out the compassion in you, and I would find it hard to believe that you would not be moved by this film.Essentially, this is a story that is really nothing new, as it is a movie that you probably can predict it going in a certain way, but you really don't care. You just get swept up in this magnificent tale of a man simply aiming to protect the people of a nation that has gone into turmoil. This is a masterpiece!"
brett-76260,"Dec 23, 2019",7/10,"Even though the movie is filled with holes, it is solid with great acting. I think the editing killed the flow of the entire movie. Had the editing been better, my review would probably be a nine. Even with that is is Worth a few hours of your time."
PersianPlaya408,"Aug 14, 2005",9/10,"This is probably one of the most touching stories i have seen in film in the past year. Hotel Rwanda tells the story of a courageous man who is a manager of a five-star hotel in the genocide period. The screenplay is superb, great character that we can all relate to. The direction was quite beautiful and equipped with a suitable and graceful score. The acting was great as well, Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo and Jean Reno all gave great performances. Joaquin Phoenix didn't have many scenes but was great as well. I didn't particularly like Nolte's performance too much, seemed a bit wooden in this one to me. The film however is great, great storytelling, definitely one of the best film of this kind of genre. Style of film-making sort of reminded me of great Iranian film-makers like Kiarostami and even Ghobadi and Majidi, those who have seen these films from international cinema will know what i mean. 9/10"
Red-Barracuda,"Aug 19, 2014",7/10,"The Rwandan genocide of 1994 remains one of the worst atrocities in recent history. Maybe even the very worst. After all, has there been a situation since where 800,000 people were murdered in a three month period? Not only that but they were primarily killed by being hacked to death by machetes; women, children, babies – everyone. The massacres were a result of the Hutu tribe taking vengeance on their Tutsi counterparts. The problem between the tribes had its roots in colonialism, where the Belgians had installed the Tutsis in positions of power due to them looking more 'European'. This ties in with more recent events in the Middle East where Western intervention has caused many more problems than it has resolved. Unfortunately, history has a tendency of repeating itself. But the biggest disgrace of the Rwandan situation was that the world actually did not intervene when the people of the country really needed them to. They did nothing aside from save their own citizens. The United Nations came out of it looking especially bad and completely ineffective, basically withdrawing when ten of their men were killed. The fallout was an unchecked murder spree of unbelievable proportions.The film tells the story of this horror via a true life story with a positive narrative. It focuses on a Hutu called Paul Rusesabagina who is the manager of the Les Milles Collines hotel in Kigali. He used his connections to save over a thousand people by giving them shelter in his hotel and by doing so putting himself in considerable danger. The narrative has some very obvious similarities to Schindler's List (1993). It's kind of a story that seems too unbelievable to be true but true it is though. It does sanitise the story somewhat though, in that it resists showing violence or too graphic results of the carnage. I think this pulling of its punches was a bad move though as this was such a dreadfully violent situation that the film would have been better served being more explicit to hammer home the true horror. The similar film Shooting Dogs (2005) presented the carnage more harshly and in some respects had more of an overall emotional impact as a result. What Hotel Rwanda does have though is Don Cheadle. Rusesabagina is played by this excellent actor in a performance of perfection. The on location shooting also contributes a lot to the overall impact. And even though the music was too forcefully Hollywood obvious at times, the drama overall was very effective in giving its message out clearly without being too contrived. All-in-all, an impressive film about a bit of history that shames the Western world."
Soroush_Vahidi,"Jul 14, 2022",4/10,It was not really a good movie. This happening has been much worse than the movie presented. There had been a lot of rapes that the movie did not even point to them. It was more similar to a romantic film than a historical movie.
eaglemike31352,"Feb 10, 2005",N/A,"For any human with a social conscious this movie is an absolute imperative. Powerful, beautiful, heart-wrenching and tearful. I took my four daughters ages 18 to 29, none of whom were familiar with this historical situation. None of them, including myself, had a dry eye. The inhumanity that humans direct towards each other continues to perplex and amaze me. Yet, in the midst of this genocide someone like Paul Rusesabagina steps forward and exhibits the true spirit of human compassion and love for each other. Paying attention to situations like this, occurring right now, all over our globe, helps us to become more aware that we are all in this life together. All humans truly desire the same things, health, food, shelter, education and peace. Why can't we just look at each other as one big family? GO SEE THIS MOVIE...NOW !"
tingleeting,"Feb 14, 2005",10/10,"This movie is amazing... I'm not too sure how else to describe it. There are no words for how powerful the movie is. I cried three separate times during the movie... and would pay for EVERYONE to see this movie if I could.It is the most tragic, romantic, deeply moving, saddening, educational, awe-inspiring, courageous movie that I have seen.I left this movie with a new sense in life. Hotel Rwanda put everything into perspective to me. Most importantly, it proved that one man CAN make a difference. If we could all be a little more like Paul Rusesabagina. This man was willing to risk his life for others, when he could have save himself.I have bought the soundtrack as well, and it is just as touching as the images on the screen were. If I were only allowed to watch one movie for the rest of my life -- I WOULD CHOOSE HOTEL RWANDA."
sithsa,"May 2, 2006",8/10,"I found this movie to be very thought provoking, informative and most of all moving. This movie highlights the events which took place in Rwanda, during 1994, from the point of view of those who experienced the tragedy firsthand. Thanks to superb performances by the cast we are given an insight as to how truly horrific it was for each person involved. We are shown that mankind is capable of acts of unimaginable horrors but also of incredible bravery and selflessness. The movie demonstrates how a hand-full of people can make a huge difference to so many lives, how racial hatred can drive the masses to extreme acts and how politics and procedure can hinder rather than help. My thanks to the cast and crew for producing such a great film."
mansoor_lodi,"Mar 12, 2005",10/10,"This was a great film and it was well acted. The best performance in this film was given by don cheadle in my opinion. This movie was based on a true story and is very entertaining, interesting and for those who did not know in detail the situation in Rwanda it was informative.This movie brings home the reality of the situation that people faced during the crisis in Rwanda, and it makes you care about the people of Rwanda.The film was brilliant, it was well done, well acted and did not feel long (well at least to me). In my opinion this film deserves at least 10 out of 10 for an all round good effort by cast and crew to bring this good story to film."
CinemaSerf,"Sep 4, 2023",7/10,"Don Cheadle is super as Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a Belgian-owned hotel in Kigali in 1994 during the civil strife that saw Hutus relentlessly and ruthlessly persecute the minority Tutsis in Rwanda. Once he is directly touched by one such incident, he decides that he must do something to help and so turns his luxury accommodation into a refuge for hundreds of dispossessed and terrified people. With the help the Red Cross and some foreign press he walks a delicate tightrope trying to keep everyone safe, fed and watered. This is a brave and compelling story of the unimaginable brutality and ultimately compassion that stays with you long after you've finished watching."
chewablesarcasm,"Feb 4, 2005",10/10,"I think anyone for anyone to take this movie as just a piece of art on film is a mistake. The fact is, this movie is not for our entertainment, but it is to help us see what has happened and may happen again. The world vowed never to let what took place during the Holocaust happen again, but it did. Genocide is rearing its ugly head in different corners of the earth far more often than we'd like to believe. This film is intended to show us the horrors that went on in Rwanda. It also shows that nothing was done to stop it. It's a brilliant piece of film, yes, much in the same way that ""Schindler's List"" is a brilliant piece of film. But please, everyone must take something important out of this film."
K3nzit,"Aug 12, 2022",7/10,A well made film with important story and good acting. Lacks a distinct visual style. More handheld footage would have helped to add a more documentary-style atmosphere which would have benefited the film.
WriterDave,"Feb 14, 2005",8/10,"When the world (specifically the UN) turned its back on the genocidal tribal warfare in Rwanda in the early 1990's, a true story emerged of a hotel manager who risked his life and his family to help refugees survive the massacre and escape to safety. The straightforward and by-the-numbers direction of Terry George service this tale very well, as it allows the fact based and ultimately uplifting story to speak for itself and allows the actors (most notably Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo-both rightfully honored with Oscar nods) to shine. There's a lot of heartbreaking stuff here both of a personal and political nature. It's a sobering and timely tale that highlights the grotesque flaws of current geopolitics while reminding us that even in the most dire of situations the human will to survive and help others survive will emerge triumphant."
mbrcf,"Dec 22, 2020",7/10,"At the second viewing upon this film maybe five or six years after the first, it loses some of its effect and power, and some issues pop up here and there, namely the film's lack of exploring the cultural and national conflicts and tenstions between Hutus and Tutsis that eventually lead to the catastrophe or the script's overused and exhausted love-scenes regarding the main character and his wife.I think this film is best tailored for someone who isn't really familiar with the Rwanda genocide so the film can be of use introducing potential viewers with one of the most hideous events of the 20th century and encourage them to delve deeper into the subject. However, if you are familiar enough with the horrors and fears of the above-mentioned, then the film manifests and talks in a rather subtle, almost ignorant tone one could argue as opposed to.Still, I do think this is a good film that finds its place and reason and serves a purpose I'd wish more films deem."
aripin-1,"May 29, 2005",4/10,"Having viewed the HBO production, ""Sometimes In April"" with a very similar story-line, etc, I was extremely disappointed with the overall presentation of ""Hotel Rwanda"" on most comparative levels including acting, continuity, and length. On the other hand, I thoroughly respected HBO's handling of this most sensitive and disgraceful Rwandan situation which was effectively portrayed by a virtually unknown cast of extremely talented actors. This is not to say that Don Cheadle and his supporting cast did not perform admirably, but I feel that the caliber of overall acting certainly did not warrant Academy Award consideration."
kimboley21,"Feb 6, 2005",N/A,"I just saw this movie earlier today and I remember the headlines at the time of the crisis and never understood afterwards how so much slid by the public on information. Boy I have learned so much from this film and truly hope everyone will go see it. What a wonderful man to have taken up the burden of the crisis he was living amongst and to bear it when so many of the countries in the world turned their backs on him. I am ashamed of our world that we did not help in time and do hope that we as people can not grow cold to third world countries as well as the rest of the world. We are all in this world together period and we need to show love and compassion to all no matter what creed, nationality or even color of skin! God bless you and go see the film it is worth it Kim"
exeter86,"Mar 13, 2005",9/10,"I have never felt so much shame after seeing a movie - this film can only be construed as the most bitter indictment of US and Western foreign policy during the 1990s. Maybe a bit too emotionally manipulative but powerful and unforgettable nonetheless. Exceptional performances and a look at a continent I had never seen presented in this way before. You may not be in the mood to emerge from a movie ashamed, depressed, and emotionally exhausted, but from a humanist perspective, this movie asks what I think is a fundamental question, that is, ""Why are people so cruel?"" There are no easy answers to be found here, only a politically charged slap in the face."
SeriousJest,"Nov 10, 2012",8/10,"I put off seeing this film for the longest time because I knew it would strike a chordmake me angrykick me right in the heart. And it delivered.As a Marine who served in Iraq, I'd have no problem being deployed to stop atrocities like this, even if there's ""nothing in it"" for the U.S., in terms of financial gain or resources. I'd like to think many Americans would feel the same way, as long as these policies were applied consistently.It makes me angry that these events happened. It saddens me that the West didn't do more earlier. Nick Nolte really nailed his monologue about how the West views Africans.I'm also impressed with Rusesabagina (as portrayed in this film, anyway I haven't researched how much of the story is true). I'd like to think that I could react with the courage and strategic intelligence that he displayed in such a crisis.Finally, no better actor could have been cast for this role than Cheadle. He brings such a fire to every one of his performances.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com"
