Xstal,"Mar 21, 2023",9/10,"There's a man who had the world within his grip, he was the captain and director of his ship, built an empire through the news, no one challenged or refused, but such ego is quite blind to slips and trips. It all began when a young child was pulled away, from normality, from sanity, from his play; to become manipulator, fabricator, a dictator; and every day, people would pay, for what he'd spray. Without distractions he may well have been crowned king, taking everything and more that he could win, but the heart can override, lead to diatribe, broadside, and a palace becomes a prison, and he's locked in."
WriterDave,"May 5, 2008",8/10,"On the Criterion Collection DVD of Orson Welles' classic ""Citizen Kane"" there is an original theatrical trailer where Welles cleverly advertises the film by introducing us to the cast including the chorus girls, whom he refers to as some nice ballyhoo. That pretty much sums up my opinion of the often over analyzed film that always shows up at the top of the list of greatest films ever made. Even though this was the first time I sat down to watch the film as a whole, I knew everything about it from studying it in film class and from the countless number of essays, homages, and parodies that have come down the pike over the years. It seems impossible now to judge the film against a blank slate, but with great ballyhoo comes great scrutiny.Released in 1941 by RKO as a Mercury Theater Production, ""Citizen Kane"" is the tale of an influential and shockingly wealthy newspaper tycoon (Welles) inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst. The story follows the investigation into the origins of ""Rosebud""-the mysterious word Kane utters on his deathbed. Following newsreel footage announcing Kane's death, we are then thrust into a series of flashbacks through interviews with various people who knew Kane that reveal the nature of his character.From a technical standpoint, Welles' film is as innovative and engrossing today as it was yesterday. Every single piece of cinematic trickery, every dissolve, every long tracking shot, every seamless edit, every play with chronology, every special effect is perfect. Welles was audacious and inventive with his art, and it is for these technical aspects that ""Citizen Kane"" will always stand the test of time.However, the story of ""Citizen Kane"" remains cold and distant. I didn't instantly connect with the characters and the plot the way I did with other classics from the period like ""Casablanca"" or ""The Third Man"" or even more recently, ""There Will Be Blood."" Often, the supporting players over-act, and the flashbacks are tedious (especially the one detailing Kane's second marriage) or emotionless (like the scene showing Kane's snow covered childhood). There's a certain smug arrogance to the whole production that makes it seem like perhaps Welles was secretly making a comedy. It leaves one wondering how it would've come across had Welles actually been allowed to do a straight up biopic of Hearst.Is it any wonder that so many critics today hail this as THE all time great? Much of today's cinema is geared towards style and technique over substance, and way back in 1941, Welles was the first to author this very modern brand of cinema where the art is not in the story but how it is told and shown to the audience. His ""Citizen Kane"" is technically rich, layered, and enthralling but narratively vapid. Did I ever really care about Kane or Rosebud? No, but it was fascinating to watch. It's some very nice ballyhoo indeed."
eagandersongil,"Aug 1, 2016",10/10,"Citizen Kane is a film with epic characteristics, and was at least 30 years ahead of his time, let's start by spectacular Gregg Toland photography, which for me is one of the top 5 best film photography, all the camera angles, metaphors, editing, close-ups, the use of natural and artificial light, mounts scenarios are something inexplicable (Remember Kane's speech), J. Mankiewicz script is great, using flashbacks (something new in time) and the timeline in your favor, I really can not say if this film was the first film to use these narrative resources, I think not, but it sure was one of the first to use a magnificent way, the soundtrack it is accurate, and the performances are very good, especially the Orson Welles doing a magnificent job, as director and actor, worth a reference scenes ""Post credit"" which explains that all the actors are new, cool also speak the name the cinematographer Gregg Toland is credited alongside Orson, Citizen Kane marked the history of cinema as we know it, so you go to see the movie today will notice that most of the ""things"" are very common nowadays and did not understand why the film is so prestigious, but remember that citizen kane invented this pile of ""things."""
elleglw,"Aug 31, 2006",10/10,"Well as a media student myself , i have come across this question many times in books and during lectures. There are simply 3 reasons the film, which was considered as the ""Mona Lisa of all films"" , created such a legendary appeal upon release in 1941: 1) This was Orson Welles first cinematic debut , even though he had been a huge star in theater , he was given an opportunity few first time directors were permitted to having. He had full artistic freedom and above all power, to direct , produce, write and even star in his own picture. Therefore the film industry and RKO pictures had absolutely no influence in the making of the film and were not to know what was happening on set .Of course this was bound to generate a number of problems as businessmen were curious about the nature and plot of the film , which takes us to the second reason the film caused controversy.2)One of the main reasons the film posed contentions was because the main character , Charles Foster Kane(Orson Welles), featured a range of similarities with real media mogul and newspaper journalist William Randolph Hurst . Therefore the film was seen as depicting the life , problems and personal relationships of a real person thus fictionalizing his life. Some of the similarities between the two persona's are:KANE: newspaper tycoon , worked for New York Inquirer , known as the Kubla Khan of Xanadu ,married talentless singer Susan Alexander Kane, he was a political aspirant to presidency by campaigning for governor, bought his wife the Municipal Opera House, Financier Thatcher, and threat Getty's. Hurst: yellow journalist , worked for New York Journal, political aspirant to presidency by becoming governor, married acress Marion Davies, bought his wife Cosmopolitan Pictures, financier JP Morgan , and threat Tammany Hall.-differences: Susan Alexander Kane( Dorothy Comingdore) leaves Kane later in their life however there was no marriage breakdown for Hurst and Marion.3) The last reason and most pivotal of all to why the film was regarded the way it was , was due to its technical and stylistic innovations . The film upon its release was misunderstood and unappreciated by critics as they couldn't comprehend many of its elements and were too concerned with its dark and mysterious nature which is one of Welles's characteristics in his films. The film after all was 20 years ahead of its time and was only regarded as a triumphant success upon its second release after the American Film Noir era in the 1950's. His most prominent artistic inventions were: -the low angled camera movements -extreme facial closeups -long uninterrupted shots -chiaroscuro lighting -overlapping dialogue , giving a realistic effect to conversations -subjective camera angles -deep focus shots and depth of field -flashbacks that make up most of the film All the above and more constitute to why the film is so influential to all would be film directors and for why many people regard it as the best film of all time. Lastly we musnt forget the exceptional score by Bernard Herrmann who had collaborated also with the best known director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock , and made him the chillin sounds of strings in Psycho and Vertigo to name a few . In addition the superb photography of Gregg Toland in regards to Welles's unique eye on details. After all he wanted to put in each shot everything the human eye can see if they were present.There are many areas of the film which are crucial , these are some of the most important , and as you can see there is never too little or too much that you can add to this masterpiece ."
Cineanalyst,"Dec 6, 2020",10/10,"The most frequently acclaimed ""greatest film ever,"" idiosyncratic in its day yet massively influential, a cultural staple, a narrative and technical tour de force, and there's the whole thing of the wunderkind granted carte blanche for his debut to the machinery of classical Hollywood at its peak--the expectations for ""Citizen Kane,"" to say the least, are high. Indeed, it's a marvel of cinematography and plot. In both senses, there's a deep focus from various angles. The plot is a jigsaw puzzle of flashbacks from multiple sources--the ""News on the March"" film-within-the-film, the dead man's memoir, a reporter interviewing characters for the meaning of ""Rosebud""--linked by an also-layered sound design and framed by a curious camera violating the ""No Trespassing"" sign in entering and exiting the Xanadu estate. Moreover, the story is about a powerful storyteller notoriously based on William Randolph Hearst (and other famous rich guys, if not also a bit of Orson Welles)--a newspaper man, populist politician, overseer of his lover's career, and who even dictates the story beyond his grave with his final word. The picture constantly exploits a deep depth of field, with figures in the foreground and background in focus, to show it off. Much of this was accomplished by composite photographic effects. While ""Kane"" is famous as an arty old black-and-white film, which it is, it belies that it was genre-mixing popular entertainment and a special-effects extravaganza of its day: the virtuosity of the editing and sound design in addition to the matte paintings, miniatures, multiple-exposure photography, rear projection, and the most significant use of the optical printer in between ""King Kong"" (1933) and ""Star Wars"" (1977). The difference is that the effects here are realistic as opposed to fantastic.Outside of co-writer Herman Mankiewicz, cinematographer Gregg Toland and Welles, arguably the most important contributions to the production came from Linwood Dunn and his optical printer, and that's not even to mention a score by Bernard Herrmann, editing from Robert Wise, and contributions from a host of less well-known technicians doing career-best work, including lead matte painter Mario Larrinaga, the special-effects team's boss Vernon Walker, and art director Perry Ferguson. More than half the picture has been guessed to be effects shots. According to Dunn, ""Once Orson Welles learned about the optical printer he just went hog-wild with it.""From the start, there's a miniature for the gate with the matte paintings of Xanadu in the background, and dissolves--lots of long dissolves in this one (and wipes and a few more dazzling effects)--transition between ever-closer views of the lit window, always matching the same frame position, until a reverse angle shot inside followed by an extreme close-up of Kane's lips, with the added snow effects, as he mutters the dying word. The reflection of the nurse in the broken snow globe was created with Dunn's printer. There are many such marvelous compositions throughout. In the ""News on the March"" reel, a terrific film-within-film newsreel parody overall (including intentional scratches and, reportedly, edited by RKO's newsreel department, to make it look authentic), a shot of construction of Xanadu is cobbled together from an actor in the foreground, stop-motion trucks in the middle plane, and the matte painting of the mansion atop the hill. There's also the pre-""Forrest Gump"" (1994), pre-""Zelig"" (1983) insertion of Kane into archival footage. Other treated shots include the camera moving through the window of the El Rancho nightclub for Susan Alexander Kane's scenes, the downward tilting shot from the miniature statue of the Thatcher library, the tilt upwards to the rafters of the workers reacting to Susan's singing, and rear projection and multiple-exposure compositions being employed where the deep, or pan, focus was otherwise impractical, such as when there were figures extremely close to the camera and in the extreme background with another plane for the middle action--the shot of young Kane through the window playing in the snow, the three-tier composite of Boss Getty observing Kane's campaign rally, Leland's firing, Susan's suicide attempt, the shot with the parrot, e.g. Of course, these effects were in service to what was already a uniquely-photographed picture.With good reason, Welles shared the final screen credit with his cinematographer. According to Toland, the demands of deep focus and stagings and camera angles that included ceilings necessitated some unusual lighting setups, and the film has also been credited for the first extensive use of coated lenses and a new film stock. Kane walking back to the windows before sitting down in one scene is a standout that plays with perspective while also underscoring Kane's metaphorical position in the world (i.e. he feels small or distant and is literally so in the image). Similar setups are repeated for when Charles walks up to Susan practicing or in their distant exchanges of reverberating dialogue in the large mansion as she puts puzzles together. Shadows act the same way, such as when she's figuratively and literally in his shadow when he insists she continue her career. The effect is a staggeringly unique picture--not only in a showy manner, although there's an undeniable bravado to it all, but also in a way to explore figures in space in the same way as the narrative investigates characters and their perspectives.The long takes in deep focus to keep all the figures staged in depth in sharp relief--pan focus--as assisted by the optical printer when wide-angle lenses weren't enough, in addition to the unusual angles--especially the low ones featuring ceilings--function to visually depict a plot that is also all about focusing on every character and from every angle, while much still remains in the dark. The visuals are as ambiguous and complex as the narrative: multiple perspectives, with some scenes repeated but appearing differently depending on the narrator, pan focus with figures often obscured, or just turned into silhouettes, by the harsh shadows of the chiaroscuro lighting. We never quite get a good view of the reporter Thompson, e.g., his back usually to the camera and his face in shadows when not, such as in the screening-room scene, which is apt given that he's our surrogate, the unseen spectator within the film. He even wears glasses; he sees through lenses, as we do through the camera. And, in this case, that camera is even more curious than and as much a character as Thompson and isn't slowed down by closed doors or windows and goes through a desk during one point at Kane's childhood home.Besides Toland, Welles shared credit with co-writer Mankiewicz. The non-linear, kaleidoscopic, sometimes restricted narration and sometimes not, flashback-structured plot, with events repeated from different points of view, including a newsreel overview that mirrors the film proper, remains one of the most wonderfully convoluted film narratives. One may get overly caught up in the story and characters, but as with the imagery, it's the structure of the thing that's brilliant. The Rosebud mystery is merely a device to drive the plot. Kane isn't a character trapped in a snow globe by a single word. Everything here is multifaceted. ""You're talking to two people,"" as he says at one point. He has two wives, two friends, two sleds, scenes are doubled and framed and reflected in visual motifs--glass, windows, doorways and mirrors. Near the end, we get the iconic hall-of-mirrors shot: the film in a nutshell.Rosebud is also part of but one or two genres in ""Kane."" It's a detective mystery, but as investigated by wisecracking newsreel reporters, like those who work at Kane's newspaper, it's an entry in the journalism films of the era--""His Girl Friday"" (1940) meets noir. It's a fictional biopic, as well as part musical (Susan's opera, the dance number at the newspaper's party), political thriller, Shakespearean tragedy and lighthearted comedy. Welles and the rest of the Mercury Players' background in radio was surely instructive, as it's the sound design that underscores these tonal shifts, equal measure playful and ominous and continually serving as transitions between scenes. The score fits seamlessly, and the editing is often inspired (e.g. the table sequence for the first marriage, or some nice match cuts throughout, as well as managing the mixture of long takes and quick montages), but there's also techniques such as overlapping dialogue and sound bridges used extensively and informed by radio practices. The shocks cuts where shot transitions are accompanied by sudden changes in sound and score may be the best, and there's a visual equivalent with the reveal of background by the sudden removal of foreground objects, such as with the newspaper in Welles' first scene.Welles and company were already famous for the ""The War of the Worlds"" radio drama, as well as theatrical productions, so it's no wonder the makeup-enhanced acting from actors new to film was already better than the acting in most films. Like ""The War of the Worlds,"" made infamous as a catalyst of mass hysteria, its reputation only enhanced by fabricated newspaper reporting and inflated mythology, ""Kane"" demonstrates the power of storytelling, effects, genre and plot--the radio adaptation was so effective, after all, because the fictional news interrupted additional staged programming, not unlike the ""News on the March"" and other narrative tricks in the film. With the control and freedom granted from the radio-based RKO, Welles and company were able to do something even greater with the recruitment of some of the best talents in Hollywood for the primarily visual art form of cinema. There are reasons it's remained in the conversation as such, whether or not one considers it the greatest film of all time."
bkoganbing,"Apr 25, 2007",10/10,"The problem with writing about a film like Citizen Kane is that with 809 previous comments on the boards here, there is little that hasn't been said already. The best you can do is not look at any others and express your own thoughts your own way.I've always felt the real reason that William Randolph Hearst so bitterly resented Orson Welles's masterpiece is that it got really too close to his own soul for him to be easy. Most folks who talk about Citizen Kane go for the obvious target, Welles's depiction of Marion Davies (Susan Alexander) as a no talent gold digger. In fact Welles himself in later years said he thought he was unfair to Davies then in Dorothy Comingore's performance.What Welles showed in Charles Foster Kane was the insincerity of his beliefs. The key line in Citizen Kane I've always thought was what Joseph Cotten said that his friend Charlie Kane had a lot of opinions, but didn't believe any of them. To this day serious biographers of Hearst still wonder exactly what he did believe when the day was done.Citizen Kane came up with a host of Oscar nominations, but only took home one award for original screenplay for Welles and Herman Mankiewicz. Original it certainly was in concept and execution.The role that was written by Welles and Mankiewicz and directed by Welles for Welles is one of the greatest roles ever written for any film actor. The technique of Citizen Kane is always discussed, the flashbacks told from many points of view for the audience to get a grasp of what the title character was all about. What's not discussed is Welles himself.What he does in fact is give several performances of the same man in one film. Welles reinterprets Kane five or six times depending on whose flashback we're seeing. He's a scared child being taken from his parents, he's a rich frat boy and incorrigible scamp as seen by George Couloris the J.P. Morgan like banker, he's an idealist and crusader as seen by his business manager Everette Sloane, a man with no core set of beliefs who will do anything to bend the public to approval by his closest and maybe his only real friend Joseph Cotten, a lonely man with a compulsion for real love by Dorothy Comingore, and as an aging tyrant by butler Paul Stewart. Welles makes every one of these Kanes come alive and each relates to the other.The names of all those I've mentioned in the cast before were from Welles's Mercury Theater Company, nearly all went on to substantial movie careers. Others from the cast who did are Ray Collins, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, and Erskine Sanford. I don't think any other film comes close to introducing so many talented players to the screen.The film begins with the aged Kane's death and that single word 'Rosebud' which sends everyone scrambling to find out just what he had on his mind in his final moments on earth. Those searching never do find out, but you the audience does and the unveiling of Charles Foster Kane's inner soul is something once seen and never forgotten."
ilpohirvonen,"Oct 31, 2015",10/10,"Anyone who sees ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) for the first time today does so because he or she has heard that it is the greatest film ever made. One simply doesn't come across the film by accident on TV, watching it ""for what it is,"" so to speak. The common approach of seeing it to believe it can be at best exhilarating and at worst hostile. Unfortunately, the latter is usually, although quite understandably, the case. For how can one do anything but look down at a film that elitist snobs have praised for years and years? One simply must prove oneself right by falsifying the critics' claims, leaving the theater or the living room with a shrug and a condescending comment: ""it was okay."" This will not do. It is a great tragedy if ""Citizen Kane"" suffers from these kinds of incidents since it ought to be treated with the same kind of respect as Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" or Beethoven's ""9th Symphony"". In order to make this happen, or perhaps enhance someone's viewing experience, I would like to try and explain not why ""Citizen Kane"" necessarily is the best film, but rather why people have considered it to be. There are over a thousand reviews of the film on this site, and mine will probably drown in the vast sea with them, but hey what can I lose, and who doesn't love talking about Welles and ""Citizen Kane""?One might begin with the basic fact that ""Citizen Kane"" wasn't immediately praised and considered the best film that has blessed the silver screen. It was a financial risk for the RKO studios to give free hands to the novice prodigy Orson Welles, who had gained quite a reputation with the radio show of H. G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds"", and not surprisingly it didn't pay off. Despite the praises of a few critics, ""Citizen Kane"" was soon forgotten, and the film wasn't, for example, screened at American cinemas during the late 1940's and early 50's. In France, however, the film was just discovered after the war, and the leading critic of the country, André Bazin hailed it as a masterpiece of the postwar stylistic tendency he characterized as spatial realism. Bazin's disciples, who we all know now as the nouvelle vague directors, followed and adored Welles' masterpiece. François Truffaut proclaimed that ""everything that matters in cinema after 1940 has been influenced by 'Citizen Kane'."" Thus the film's reputation grew and its new found reputation slowly found the other side of the Atlantic as well. But why did this happen? Why wasn't ""Citizen Kane"" forgotten, and why, for one, did it arouse the interest of Bazin?First, it ought to be highlighted that the story of ""Citizen Kane"" is excellent. Loosely based on the life and times of media mogul William Hearst, ""Citizen Kane"" tells the story about a lonely giant who conquered the American media. It's a story about a man who dedicated his life to possession, but tragically became to be possessed by it himself. As one might have noticed, I am using the past tense, and such is the nature of Welles' narrative in ""Citizen Kane"". The film begins with the protagonist's death, and then portrays the attempts of a journalist trying to figure out the meaning of his last words -- ""Rosebud"" -- by interviewing people who knew the man. ""It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing,"" he supposes. This kind of structure was not considered the done thing back in the day. Although the basic structure of finding out a person's past goes back to Sophocles' ""Oedipus Rex"" as well as numerous detective stories, the uniqueness of ""Citizen Kane"" lies in the use of different perspectives, creating a non-linear narrative that has echoes from ancient drama and epistolary novels.Yet it wasn't really the intricate story that most fascinated Bazin. What Bazin emphasized was the film's style. Although all scholars have given up on the phoenix myth of ""Citizen Kane"" and its innovative use of various cinematic means, it is simply a fact that the film made the style public, thus standardizing it for Hollywood. The aesthetic features of the so-called spatial realism, which Bazin adored, supported by the technological innovation of the BNC camera, include deep-focus cinematography, sequence shots, and deep-space composition. These had been used before, but hardly with similar, dare I say, philosophic unity. This stylistic tendency is enhanced by Welles' relentless use of heavy low-angle shots and dynamic montage sequences. There are innovative cuts that spark imagination and soundtrack solutions that open the story and its characters to new dimensions. ""Citizen Kane"" is often celebrated as a bravura of the art of mise-en-scène since it puts a lot of emphasis on pre-filmic elements such as setting and lighting, but the real gist of the film's brilliance lies in the unity of these together with cinematographic and post-filmic elements.More remains to be said, but space is running out. The end of the matter is, I guess, that none of the individual elements of ""Citizen Kane"" are, precisely, individual. They have not been distinguished from one another, but rather resonate luminously together in a unique fashion. Technological innovation goes hand in hand with aesthetic inspiration and both support the whole of story, theme, and style. Such unity may not have been present in Hollywood before 1941. From the groundbreaking use of the BNC camera to themes of power, loneliness, and defeat, which are reflected on the level of style, using setting and editing, for one, to reflect the emotional distances between the characters or their existential experience of emptiness, ""Citizen Kane"" remains a gem to any lover of cinema. It's up there with immortal works of art from poetry, music, and painting. It is, like all great art, a tightly and beautifully sealed original whole which is why (instead of one big nameable innovation) the film has been considered to be of such magnificent proportions."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Oct 21, 2004",10/10,"I've heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, so I finally decided to get the film, and find out if it really is all that it's cracked up to be... I must say, it's great. The plot is great, and the way it's told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won't reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I've seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can't praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It's only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn't move at all. When there weren't great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn't seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can't do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I'm writing this, it's #11. That's pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven't seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don't let the fact that it's old and black & white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, in every sense of the word. 10/10"
gobosox,"Apr 21, 2004",7/10,"OK look, let me settle something between those who love and hate this film. A lot of people hail this film because it is technically brilliant and ground breaking. Director Orson Welles did a lot of things visually that no one had ever done before. Nearly every film maker was in some way influenced by this movie. This movie also had a great impact in its time. The title character was based on media giant William Randolph Hearst. He was that generations Donald Trump. He opposed this film so much he did everything in its power to stop its release and almost succeeded. Lastly this film contains some of the strongest and most common themes in literature; Life versus death. It is for these reasons why this film is so revered.On the contrary people who hate this film mainly complain that it is boring. Which is a legitimate complaint. The story is slow compared to today's standards, and there is no real Hearst character alive today in which to relate. So yes, the story on the surface is outdated. However, this does not make it a bad movie. It was not made as a Matrix/Star Wars type of movie which can be enjoyed even at surface level. This is not pure entertainment. Remember there is more to film than storytelling. This film was designed to be cinematically beautiful and to tell a basic story of love and redemption. There is much more to the story than the thinly veiled attack on Hearst, one just needs to look deeper. Look at Shakespeare or Hawthorne for example, their literary works are universally loved. Yet, many people blow them off because they refuse to look past the outdated language into the beautiful prose and simple ubiquitous themes. Just because something is outdated does not mean it lacks worth in today's world.My advice to those who did not like it the first time or have not seen it yet is simple. Watch it again for what it is. Do not expect to be on the edge of your seat for two hours. Watch it for the cinematography that alone makes this film among the best (I don't agree with AFI's number one ranking but I think it still ranks high). Look deeper into the story and try to connect with it on some level. At the very least appreciate how influential this film was and where the industry would be without it. If you can do this, then maybe some of the naysayers will change their minds. Again, you do not have to love Citizen Kane, but at least respect it for what it is."
TheLittleSongbird,"Sep 27, 2010",10/10,"That is not to say I didn't love it, this film is absolutely brilliant in every respect. I just more admire it rather than adore it, but I completely understand its reputation as a classic. The cinematography is enough to earn the film's reputation, every shot, every angle is exemplary and has so much visual drama, and you never know from looking at Citizen Kane that it was made on a shoestring budget. That is not all though. Bernard Hermann's score is superb, the story while not easy to understand at first is interesting and the screenplay is thought-provoking. Not only does Orson Welles direct impeccably, he turns in a magnificent performance as Charles Foster Kane, while the supporting acting is excellent too. People may dismiss Citizen Kane as boring and dull, and I have known people outside of IMDb to say that, but I have yet to hear any of those people to say it is not well-made or directed. As for me, I loved this film very much, and while my praise doesn't completely go beyond sheer admiration I cannot deny it is a great film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Lechuguilla,"Jun 29, 2008",6/10,"If ever there was a film that I had a love-hate relationship with, ""Citizen Kane"" is surely it. Some of the non-script elements are as good as what one would find in any other film. Yet, the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), an early twentieth century newspaper tycoon is terribly dated and painfully boring.The film's B&W cinematography is arguably the best in film history. DP Gregg Toland uses high-contrast lighting and murky shadows to create a wonderfully noir look and feel. And in some scenes bright back-lighting puts foreground characters in stark silhouette, creating an authoritarian and oppressive tone to the story. This is true especially in the film's first thirty minutes. Throughout the film, frame compositions are clever and interesting, like one scene in the second half wherein a woman, with her back to the camera, blares out an operatic aria on stage to an audience that we viewers cannot see, amid murky, shadowy lighting; it's like something from a nightmare.And the film's visuals are laced with strange optical illusions, as a result of Welles' use of deep focus camera techniques. In one scene, for example, background windows appear normal in size relative to characters in the foreground. But when a character walks back to the windows, we see that the windows are actually much larger and higher than first appeared, and that renders the character small, by comparison. The same optical effects show up in the Great Hall of Xanadu, with a fireplace that appears average in size, until a character walks back to it; at which point the fireplace is seen in its true size; it's so big and high as to overwhelm the human figure.Sound effects amplify these optical effects. For example, in the Great Hall, the cavernous, mostly empty, room strongly echoes human sounds, creating the impression of some huge, dark cave. The whole feel is one of oppression and death. Just terrific.But the film's story, about a corpulent newspaper tycoon, is so dated as to be largely irrelevant in the twenty first century. Kane starts out with noble intent to help the lower classes. But over time he changes. And throughout, he is egotistical, overbearing, bombastic, loud, and generally too full of himself. His only real belief is in himself. He is fond of possessions, but is emotionally empty. In addition to an unlikeable protagonist, the script's dialogue is very talky.The film's acting is generally quite good. I particularly liked the performances of Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, and Agnes Moorehead. Special effects are good too and, when combined with lots of stock footage, create the visual illusion of a cinematic epic.Some viewers love this film; others loathe it. I love the cinematography and sound effects, but loathe the story. ""Citizen Kane"" should have won several Oscars, including especially cinematography. That it did not has caused Hollywood endless guilt, and to compensate, they routinely vote the film as ""the number one greatest film in history"".But it does not deserve that lofty title. Hollywood needs to give the film several postmortem, but well deserved, Oscars, especially for B&W cinematography. Then, they need to let go of the guilt."
Cowman,"May 2, 2004",N/A,"It's a difficult undertaking for someone of my generation to watch a film like CITIZEN KANE.  Not because it's ""too old"" or ""too boring"", but because it has been hailed--almost universally--as the single best motion picture ever made.  And while the anticipation of seeing a film with such overwhelming acclaim may be quite exhilarating, actually watching it is ultimately an intimidating and somewhat disappointing experience.This isn't to say that I thought CITIZEN KANE was a bad film; in fact, I thought everything about it was downright brilliant.  From the enchanting performances right down to the meticulously planned camera movements and clever lighting tricks, there isn't a single element of CITIZEN KANE that isn't a stunning achievement in all areas of filmmaking.CITIZEN KANE's storyline is deceptively simple.  Even though the plot unfolds by jumping in and out of nonlinear flashbacks, it is surprisingly easy to keep track of.  The straightforwardness and relatively fast pace of the story are what make it seem intimidating.  Because everything moves smoothly along without any standstill, it feels like we are being fooled-like there is something much greater that we just can't seem to grasp.  As a first-time viewer, I knew from its reputation that there must be *something* that separates this movie from all the others; something buried within its simple plotline that everybody else has seen, but that I just could not seem to get a handle on.  And then, during those final frames, that something was revealed, and it all began to make sense.  To me, it was these moments of confusion and uncertainty followed by a sense of enlightenment and appreciation that made watching CITIZEN KANE such a meaningful experience.But no matter how great of a movie CITIZEN KANE really is, it can never live up to one's expectations.  Although I do feel that it is deserving of its acclamation, the constant exposure to its six decades worth of hype and praise will invariably set most modern viewers' standards at a height that is virtually unreachable--even if it really *is* the best movie of all time."
murtaza_mma,"Apr 24, 2009",10/10,"Citizen Kane is probably the best that American Cinema has ever offered, nigh perfect from the start till the end. Often competing with The Godfather, to be numero uno, Citizen Kane is in a league of its own and nonpareil on countless number of fronts. The creative innovation and the technical advancements implemented, can be least regarded as incredible and astonishing, for a 1941 movie. The movie pioneered the phenomena of time switching and special effects in the world of cinema.Citizen Kane has stood the test of time for well over six decades, serving as a benchmark and source of inspiration to the film-makers of different era. Citizen Kane is an obituary about a fictitious Charles Foster Kane, a business magnate and a newspaper tycoon. Through this movie, Orson Welles, not only immortalized Charles Foster Kane but also proved his mettle, as a writer, director, actor and most importantly as an auteur. The scenes presented as flashbacks, not only display his versatility as an actor (taking care of the nuances and the subtleties needed to portray the different stages and aspects of Kane's life), but also his story-telling brilliance. Kane's murmuring of the word 'rosebud' at the time of his death and him publicly annihilating his election opponent, Jim Getys, represent the two extremes of human life, the very low and the very high, respectively.The scenes between Welles and Joseph Cotton are an absolute treat to watch, the latter being at his sarcastic best, depicting contrasting emotions of sympathy and disgust towards his childhood friend, owing to the dichotomy that he suffered, simultaneously taking care of his duties as a journalist, and his friendship with Kane. The movie is studded with numerous mesmerizing and unforgettable scenes and moments, which immensely contribute to the apotheosis that it so deservedly enjoys. A true cinematic magnum opus, without an iota of a doubt and a must for every cinema lover."
framptonhollis,"Feb 15, 2016",10/10,"""Citizen Kane"" is possibly the most acclaimed film that I know of. It's been called the ""greatest film of all time"" by a lot of film critics, polls, magazines, etc.The film is a chronicle of the life of Charles Foster Kane, a fictional character based off of William Randolph Hearst, a famous newspaper publisher. The film's structure is highly unconventional, in which Kane's life is revealed through interviews with various people who knew him well, making a majority of the film a series of flashbacks.On both a technical and story level the film is quite influential. The story, itself, becomes far more bleak and dark than a lot of the films coming out at that time (at least in the US, that is), and it completely insults a very powerful figure (that being William Randolph Hearst) who was still alive at the time, and fought to get the film banned (just watch the documentary ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" and the drama ""RKO 281"", two films that are also quite great).On a technical level, there's many extremely inventive techniques being developed here. There's one particularly interesting low angle shot that was made so low because Welles actually drilled a hole in the floor of the set. Other than that shot, you mine as well look at every single other shot or scene if you want to see some technical innovation. You could just analyze it frame by frame if you want to attempt to see all of its influential visuals, and you still may not have truly seen all of the detail. As Roger Ebert said on the commentary, ""Citizen Kane"" is actually a special effects picture. The main difference between this film's special effects and the special effects in a film like ""Jurassic Park"" (another greatly influential film) is that the special effects in this film are kind of hidden, but nonetheless powerful in their own right.A lot of people may call it the #1 most important film of all time, but I have to disagree. While it certainly is one of the most important films of all time, one really needs to go back to the silent era to find all the TRULY most important films. Films like ""A Trip to the Moon"", ""The Great Train Robbery"", ""The Birth of a Nation"", and ""Intolerance"". Welles, himself, actually did say during his introduction of D.W. Griffith's classic ""Intolerance"" that that film deserves all the credit for a lot of modern cinema's techniques.However, with all its technical innovations that have been talked on and on about time and time again, I've heard very little about how ENTERTAINING the film is. ""Well that's because it isn't entertaining!"" I can hear some guy who had overly high expectations (and gave the film 1 star with a lengthy review entitled ""Disappointing"") shout. Well, you're wrong, the film is quite entertaining! Sure, there's no action sequences, explosions, Adam Sandler doesn't play his twin sister, and Kevin James doesn't wackily fall down 420,000 times, but there IS true human emotion, iconic lines of dialogue, and a truly compelling imagery that ends with one of cinema's greatest twists! There was actually a time in my life in which I watched ""Citizen Kane"" nearly once a day because I enjoyed it so much! I genuinely watched it TWICE in one day just because of how much I enjoyed it, which is very rare with me.If you're looking for the greatest film of all time, maybe you should lower your expectations a tad bit and just experience the film for what it is."
caspian1978,"Apr 15, 2001",10/10,There's something worth stealing from Citizen Kane if you're a film maker. What else can you say about this film except for it being the greatest gift one can give to the film industry. Having it have been a box office bomb when it opened in LA in the 1940's only adds to the films greatness. Citizen Kane was before its time and still remains today a movie marvel. There is not a single film school in the World that will not show this film at least twice to its students. A perfect film to watch and discuss for the entire class period. Citizen Kane has more examples of modern movie making than any other film made before or after.
RM851222,"Sep 15, 2015",9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Citizen Kane"" (1941) isn't the best or most important movie ever made in my opinion. As there one word cannot explain man's life, one movie can not influence flow of cinema itself. That said ""Citizen Kane"" is a very good picture, while it's opening ~17 min are nothing short of brilliant and next 40 min are superb, the movie felt short a bit during the end, with to much being focused on ""the singer"" rather on Kane's life itself.There are some truly brilliant camera shoots in this movie, which i suppose was one of the first camera tricks at the time. Acting is very good, especially by Orson Welles - he should have won Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Script is great and directing is also a tip notch, that is why this movie barely drags.Overall, ""Citizen Kane"" is a very good movie about with some mystery. I kinda guest the meaning of this word during the end, and last scenes confirmed my guess - it is a good mystery but maybe a bit over-hyped (no spoilers). This movie definitely worth seeing once (even as i'm watching for the first time just now in 2015)."
yavkaconsult,"Dec 18, 2023",6/10,"Okay. I watched this movie recently finally and totally understand why it's been praised so much.To be honest though, the story didn't grab me that much. Yeah, the mystery itself was interesting, the characters were well written, the plot too. It was directed nicely and the cinematography was on a very good level. Overall, the movie is a good example on how a story should be told on the big screen.The actors are OK. Nothing spectacular from my point of view.I just didn't find the story itself very interesting, but in the end I don't regret watching it. It's good, but that's it.Final score: 6/10."
dataconflossmoor,"Oct 30, 2006",10/10,"More movie review lists have awarded ""Citizen Kane"" the honor of being the best film ever made than any other film whatsoever..Deservedly so!! Why?... The superb character portrayals... Charles Foster Kane (based on William Randolph Hearst) was a character which sparked a lot of controversy in the movie industry back in 1941!! This film did not even win best picture that year, that award was given to ""How Green was My Valley"". Reluctance to allow a film like ""Citizen Kane"" to be released, evoked a formidable indication that people had a perception of the silver screen as the purveyor of the stilted panacea which provided glossy entertainment for the movie audience!! The ugly depiction of abhorrent human nature that ""Citizen Kane"" so succinctly illustrated, left a scar on the manufactured illusions of movies during this era!! So many film's entertainment agenda during the '30's and '40's were fortified by high budget fantasy!! These illusions orchestrated a premise of escapism that the moviegoers grew accustomed to!! (Wizard of Oz is a stellar example)...Nevertheless, ""Citizen Kane"" hit the big screen, and from there, received unprecedented critical acclaim!!What was the attraction?.... Charles Foster Kane was a neglected and irascible man who concocted a myriad of avoidable vulnerabilities in his life. His childhood became a pitfall of doom and despair which left an indelible mark on him!! His empathy for the working class people inevitably translated to his perception of them as chattel, and that he must be the ameliorated recipient of their gratitude!! His fame and fortune was predicated on the idea that the banal proletariat be relegated to the pathetic plight of a marketable commodity!! So many concepts were avant-gard in this movie, this is why they were widely unacceptable!! Concepts such as: The life of a corporate mogul being the culprit to making Charles Foster Kane fall prey to vanity and social entitlement!! He became a victim of megalomania, this was his ultimate downfall!! The dark human emotions and vindictiveness of politicians seeking election and/or re-election manifested themselves through very authentic reactions from the characters in this film!! The perennial egocentric demeanor which afflicted Charles Foster Kane throughout the entire movie, signified a pejorative compassion which was totally self centered!!!The character portrayal of Charles Foster Kane by Orson Wells was outstanding..Genuine feelings that were related to selfishness and avarice in this movie simply astounded me!! People have to consider the year this movie was made (1941) to fully appreciate the ideas which were thrown out at the movie audience!! No matter how reprehensible Charles Foster Kane was, he was also NEWS!!! This will always be the way of the world!! This newspaper king wound up being utterly thwarted by a form of convoluted justice!!! Leaving a largess of artwork behind, merely pointed out to everyone that his priorities purported a horrid arrogance!! The onus was on the movie audience to get acquainted with the despicable aspects of negative emotional qualities that Charles Foster Kane masqueraded around like coveted trophies!! Ultimately, his childhood put a lethal spin on his adverse reactions to everything, and played a significant role in this movie!! I strongly recommend to anyone who is interested in movies, that they see this film!! ""Godfather"" ""Shawshank Redemption"" ""Lord of the Rings"" (Fellowship of the Ring) and ""Gold Rush"" have all been selected as the greatest movie ever made by one critic's list or another, but, not nearly as often as ""Citizen Kane"" though!!! ""Citizen Kane"" is an absolutely remarkable movie!!"
Vartiainen,"Jun 8, 2016",7/10,"Any art becomes harder to appreciate as time passes. We look at statues and paintings from, lets say the Ancient Greece, and we appreciate them for their aesthetic, their style and the craftsmanship that went into making them. Yet we often know very little about why or even how they were made. Were they political in their time, like art often is nowadays, or were they made simply to feed the artist, like some of the greatest works of art in history have sometimes been made? And if we somehow found out that a painting of a human figure in some prehistoric cave was actually a political satire of the rival clan chief, would it add value to the work?I ponder this because I don't think I fully get Citizen Kane, or if I even can get it without a degree in history. Back in its days, the film was widely applauded for its groundbreaking style and its cinematographic feats. Orson Welles put himself on the map by pulling off tricks and visuals that had never been seen before. He also based the story of one Charles Foster Kane on a real life business tycoon William Randolph Hearst, a polarizing figure back then, thus tying the film to the days of its release.And I view this film and I must admit that it didn't blow me away. The cinematography is brilliant and impressive, but I've seen most of the tricks already in newer films, and thus their impact is lessened. And while it's an interesting character study about the meaning of contentment, wealth and American ideals, I was left with the impression that I was missing something. And I think it's that I have no real life parallels to compare this film to. Especially seeing as I'm not an American.Is it still a good film? Oh, definitely. It's a pioneer of its field, its themes are very deep, it's beautiful on the technical level and even the story, while rather slow, does keep you interested through the capturing presence of Welles' acting. I do recommend seeing it, though I must admit that I respect it more than I like it."
AphroditeVenus,"Jul 9, 2007",1/10,"I know why you're reading this. You're smart, you have great taste, a passion for cinema, and you see CK near the top of every 'Great Movie' list ever compiled. So with great anticipation you borrow a DVD copy and sit down for a real treat, and... you can't get through the first half hour. You fall asleep.Surprised, you think, 'It must be me, maybe I'm tired,' so a month later, you try again. But you don't even get as far as before, and wake up drooling out the corner of your mouth as a bloated Orson Welles, with really bad age make-up, groans 'Rosebud, Rosebud'.It doesn't make sense. You're perplexed. You've watched other films on the lists... Casablanca made you stand up and cheer, cry, laugh, feel connected to all humanity. You even adore films on the list that some might consider oblique, like 8 1/2, which you reckon reinvented cinema language, weaving in and out of memory, dreams, psyche, reality, putting the human spirit up on the screen, making you cheer, laugh, and feel connected to all humanity.So why does CK leave you so cold? You wonder, 'What's wrong with me? Am I stupid or something?'Your borrowed DVD copy gathers dust (notice how the lender never asks for it back?), taunting your unquiet mind: ""You must watch me: I'm the greatest film of all time!"" But you shudder at the thought. Life's too short and, after all, there's more engaging things to do - like scraping plaque off the dog's teeth.Years pass. Finally, you can take it no longer. You think, 'To be a serious film lover I MUST watch Citizen Kane! Maybe I was too immature before - yes, that must be it!' So you gird your loins and sit - awake! - through the whole thing. The whole turgid, ponderous, dull, vacuous, plodding, dank catastrophe. It's even worse than you feared. An emotionally and intellectually empty story. Your average six year old can invent a more complex, engaging tale.Genuinely puzzled, you ask people who name it as one of the greatest films of all time why they like it, and with barely concealed superiority that phoneys are wont to adopt, they wax lyrical talk about the haunting mystery of the final words, ""Rosebud, rosebud"". You notice there's no feeling behind what they say. They also talk a great deal about Gregg Toland's cinematography, with liberal references to ""deep focus"", and you appreciate this, you really do, the cinematography was damned fine, best thing about the movie. That shot which started outside the window then tracked back into the room was really cool. But you just don't believe a movie is made great by cinematography alone.In all your inquiries, you never once hear the following phrase, spoken from the heart: ""God, I love that film"".So here you find yourself, reading IMDb comments.Well, let me tell you this: There's Nothing Wrong With You! You Are Right! It's Overrated Flashy Unintelligent Rubbish!One day, perhaps (one can but dream), the coolest, greatest, most admired film being in the world will point out the bleeding obvious nakedness of this bloated Emperor, and the assorted film critics, film studies teachers, and others who need to be told what to think by an authority figure, shall squirm, and CK shall drop off the lists once and for all.Until that great day, don't be afraid to speak the truth."
Mr_Hulot,"Aug 13, 2002",N/A,"Citizen Kane is majestic, elegant and noble.  It begins at the end, we see a man of obvious wealth and power breathe his last, and then the mysteries of his life are unraveled via a series of anecdotes, barely remembered scenes and highly subjective memories.  The boldness of this approach cannot be overemphasized.  At the time that this film was made Hollywood was for the most part used to creating straight-forward stories with clearly identified heroes and villains.  Kane dared to present Man as he is, rife with confusions, internal contradictions and uncertainty.As the film progressed, we see Kane, loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon slowly sacrifice his ideals in order to build his financial empire, losing his friendships with those who believed in him until ultimately he looses everything he has, his marriage, his friends, and his integrity.  Though he is the richest man in the world he lives his remaining isolated in his privately built mountain estate where he has surrounded himself with material pleasures, alone and despairing, one senses that he welcomes death.  The film takes the view that wealth and power are inherently  destructive of human values.  Kane himself states `If I hadn't been born rich I  might have been a really great man.What is so masterful about Kane is its ambiguity.  We never are certain if Kane really did believe in the values that he professed.  At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people.  This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore).  Her character is given a paper-thin characterization, the only obvious flaw in a nearly perfect movie.Orson Wells gives a bravura performance as Kane, both identifying with and condemning the man.  This film was his first venture into movie making after the infamous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that threw America into an uproar.  Wells, a child prodigy, had a background in Shakespearian theater, offering modernized adaptations of the Classics, a bold and unusual gesture at the time.  He brought that kind of sweeping tragic romantic sensibility to his first film.Unconstrained by Hollywood's traditions, he broke all the rules.  The deep focus photography that gives Kane its theatrical look was one of his innovations.  A mastery of sound, gained from years of working in the radio was another.  Kane is an avalanche of technical innovation, unmatched in any other Hollywood film.Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth.  The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb.  Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does.  And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien.So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it's characters is universal in it's compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art.Kane was one of the most controversial films ever made.  Hearst, offended by his portrayal, offered RKO a small fortune to destroy the film.  When that didn't work his newspapers embarked on a campaign of defamation against Wells, thus proving that the film's criticism of the power and corruption of the press were precisely on target.  Wells was never given a free hand to direct how he liked again and American Cinema was deprived of the one of the greatest geniuses to adopt it as a medium of self-expression.It's influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst's efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Citizen Kane.  It's not just a masterpiece it's a creative touchstone.Of course there were other talents at work in making Kane, Hermann Mankiewicz's efforts on the script were indispensable and Bernard Hermann, the composer most famous for working with Hitchcock provided the films beautiful music.  Still, the film remains most obviously the work of Orson Wells, a veritable hall of mirrors reflecting the great artist's dreams, obsessions and fears.  Citizen Kane is not just one of the great works of cinema it is one of the greatest artistic creations of the century"
QulkSiLvR,"Jul 19, 2001",10/10,"Citizen Kane, the film, is many things.  It is a brilliantly crafted series of flashbacks and remembrances.  It is an engaging story of a dynamic man in a dynamic world.  It is a remarkable statement for the wide range of time periods that it covers.  It is a deceptively simple story centering on perhaps the most meaningful word in all of moviedom.  Behind all that, Citizen Kane is the American cinema.  There is not a major director today who has not been influenced by the genius Orson Welles put forth in his debut masterpiece.  The film centers around a group of reporters investigating the origin of the dying newspaper tycoon (loosely based on William Randolph Hearst), Charles Foster Kane's last word: Rosebud.  The movie begins with an unforgettable newsreel montage summarizing the man's life.From there on, the viewer is thrown into a gloriously chaotic world of flashbacks upon flashbacks, in which the viewer slowly learns just about everything about Charles Foster Kane's enthralling life.  From his trying childhood to his rise to power to the pinnacle of his success to his marital difficulties to his fall from grace, the story of Charles Foster Kane is presented for the viewer in a way that few other movies can offer: magically.  Citizen Kane, undeniably, is THE triumph of the American cinema, and one of the greatest films every created."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 17, 2024",9/10,"""Citizen Kane,"" directed by Orson Welles, is often hailed as one of the greatest films in cinematic history, and for good reason.

The story unfolds through a series of flashbacks, driven by the investigation of a reporter seeking to unravel the mystery behind Kane's final word, ""Rosebud."" This structure allows the film to delve into the complexities of Kane's character, revealing the paradoxes of wealth, ambition, and loneliness.Welles delivers a groundbreaking performance as Kane, embodying the character's multifaceted nature with remarkable depth.

This technique serves to enhance the storytelling, drawing viewers into the world of Kane and intensifying the emotional weight of various scenes. The film's striking composition and meticulous attention to detail create a lasting impact that is still studied and admired by filmmakers today.What makes ""Citizen Kane"" truly remarkable is its exploration of themes such as power, memory, and the ephemeral nature of happiness. The film's exploration of Kane's troubled relationships and the emptiness that accompanies his success is both timeless and relatable, prompting viewers to reflect on their own understanding of fulfillment and legacy.""Citizen Kane"" remains a cinematic landmark that resonates with audiences across generations.

ccthemovieman-1,"Dec 13, 2005",8/10,"Hey, make no mistake: this film does deserve lofty status. It is a good film, fantastically photographed.....but the greatest of all time? I question that, but that kind of question - Who's number one? - is impossible to answer.I would think to be number one you would have to have a great technical film, great story, great acting, great camera-work as this has, AND have it generally loved by the public. Then you have a true number one picture of all time. I'm not a fan of ""Gone With The Wind,"" but that was a technical marvel, too, for its day and was universally loved by millions of people....so I can see that being listed number over Citizen Kane. The same goes for Casablanca, Ben-Hur and a number of wonderful films.Anway, concerning this movie, I enjoyed it best for the cinematography. Orson Welles, the ""genius"" behind this film, was ahead of his time with his inventive camera-work. The acting is good and it's interesting to note that this was Welles' first acting role. Yes, he was an amazing talent, behind or in front of the camera. The story is pretty unlikable and, in this day and age would be too boring for most people under 50, sad to say. However, even older, more ""mature"" folks find this hard to get through sometimes from what I have read.The unlikable part mainly comes from the lead character, ""Charles Foster Kane,"" played by Welles. He is simply a selfish egomaniac. Other unpleasant parts of the story include several scenes with his second wife, in which she berates him in this shrill hysterical voice; the fact there is very little humor in here and the ending is anything but uplifting.For those who find this a confusing story, I suggest giving it another chance. I found this film better the more chances I gave it. It also looks fabulous on the latest special-edition DVD. In summary, it was a great technical achievement but remember professional critics usually have the same mindset and are afraid to be their own person, so don't feel stupid or inadequate if this film doesn't do it for you. You are hardly alone. But, yet, that camera-work has to be seen and appreciated if you really love movies."
gftbiloxi,"Jul 29, 2005",10/10,"In order to survive the passing years, a film must be able to transcend the limitations of the era in which it was made. This is a difficult test, particularly for films that largely rely upon new technology and innovative technique for impact: as these new effects are seen more often in other films, we come to accept them as standard, and in consequence the film that introduced them no longer has same the freshness as once it did.To a certain extent CITIZEN KANE faces precisely this problem. A pioneer in the use of deep focus photography and in innovative editing, KANE stunned audiences of its day with a powerful visual and aural montage. Some forty years later, however, most filmgoers have had at least some opportunity to see other and later films that at least approximate KANE's effects; consequently, these elements lack the same impact they once had, and the film must increasingly rely upon story, script, and performances for continued appeal. And it is here that KANE runs into a bit of trouble.The story KANE tells is quite cold, and although the script has incredible precision, bite, and complexity, it ultimately presents its characters as second-rate personalities who prove unable to transform their lives into anything beyond the pathos they so deplore. They are not likable enough to be sympathetic, they are not dark enough to fully stir our curiosity, and for all Charles Foster Kane's millions they ultimately emerge as merely so many opportunity-squandering unfortunates. As such, while they certainly engage the viewer in an intellectual sense, they seldom engage the viewer in an emotional one; this coupled with the fact that the film's technique no longer offers quite the same shock-of-the-new as once it did makes CITIZEN KANE increasingly problematic with the passage of time.There is a tremendous amount to admire in CITIZEN KANE, but with each passing year it becomes more and more of a historian's darling and less and less of a film that remains able to engage a purely casual viewer at all levels. Even so, it is (and will no doubt for the foreseeable future remain) a landmark film, one that will be worthy of considerable reverence for many years to come.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
bartvanbenthem,"Nov 8, 2005",9/10,"Kane ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was Orson Welles' film debut, and in it he created an enduring masterpiece that is considered by many to be the greatest movie ever made.Story:Shortly after ""Citizen Kane"" opens, we see aged newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Welles) softly drawl the word ""Rosebud"" and die. Sensing that there's a story behind Kane's dying word, a magazine editor shows a reporter a newsreel obituary that chronicles how Kane created a business empire, married a U.S. President's niece, ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York, divorced his first wife and married a second, collected art, built a fabulous estate called Xanadu, and divorced his second wife. The reporter is then assigned the task of ferreting out the significance of ""Rosebud."" As the reporter's investigation progresses, fascinating details about Kane emerge.My opinion:Citizen kane is maybe for a lot of people (myselve not included) not a real entertaining movie, But there is no doubt about it that aws one of the most important movies ever made.The visual style of ""Citizen Kane"" looks stunningly fresh and inventive even today, and the unconventional narrative structure of the Oscar-winning screenplay still seems daring. Welles' portrayal of a character who gradually ages from 25 to old age is unexcelled, and the movie's supporting cast, most of whom had worked previously with Welles on stage and radio productions, is superb. In short, everything came together in ""Citizen Kane"" to make it one of the greatest character studies ever captured on film.Citizen kane is also one of my favorites and is listed in my top 5 of all time: 9.5 / 10 Masterpiece !!!"

When it comes to plot, camera-angles, themes, characters, acting and such, it seems like few movies are as praised as this. Still, when I read reviews on other classics, for example Casablanca, it feels like they say many of the same things.I'm not an expert on what makes some films objectively better than others, but if the other classics with most of the other ""greatnesses"" actually ARE interesting and fun to watch, then Citizen Kane should also be able to entertain as well as just being ""great"".You can say what you want about movies, but no matter how well they're made, they should also entertain in some way or another to be classified as great. And I'm not one of those guys who only like action movies. An example of a great movie is Requiem for a Dream. It's disturbing, repulsive and scary as h*ll, but I couldn't keep my eyes from it, and it made a brutal impression. Other examples of movies that are deep, makes an impression AND are entertaining could be One flew over the Cuckoos Nest, The Visitor, American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.But entertainment isn't all. I see that. If Citizen Kane had made an impression it wouldn't fail no matter how uninteresting. Taxi Driver is another movie I bored me through, and don't want to see again, but still I find it good because I couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. It made an impression. Citizen Kane doesn't do that either.And to all you die-hard-fans who hate me, wants to disgrace me, and finds it horrendous to call a classic ""not entertaining"" I'll just quote the great Ingmar Bergman: ""Citizen Kane is a total bore!"" To call me retarded or something like that would be to call one of the greatest directors of all time the same. In addition it's clear that many more agree as well. It's not long since the feature was in the top 3 on IMDb. Today it's number 29.So all in all, I may not know how to judge objective qualities of movies, but I'm certain that movies that doesn't leave any impression whatsoever AND isn't entertaining at all aren't great no matter what. And that's why ""the greatest movie ever made"" fails for me. 3/10"
marolita_7,"Nov 18, 2011",7/10,"OK so you've watched the movie and saw that its terrible and wanted to see what other people think or you're reading reviews before you watch it and you find people giving it 10 stars for the saw called amazing ""cinematography"" well its not only you who hated this movie i hate it too as well as many others this movie is completely dull and boring !!! I wasted 2 hours of my life, i read reviews before i watched it and saw that some people hated it, i slept when i came to watch it the first time so i said maybe i was tired that day but i gotta admit i slept really good while the movie was still running. Next day i thought that i maybe should watch it again but it was still boring i mean how more pathetic can a movie be !! This movie should never be on the top !! It should be on top of the IMDb's Bottom 100 list !! I regret watching this movie, if you haven't watched it yet i advice you NOT to watch it ! its PATHETIC !"

meggs212,"Nov 17, 2003",N/A,"The movie Citizen Kane was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. The movie begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane, who was the editor of the New York Journal.  He says the name rosebud and drops a crystal ball, which falls to the ground a shatters.  News clips are shown about the different occurrences in Kane's life depicting how Kane acquired his fortune.  Throughout the whole movie reporters are trying to figure out what the word rosebud meant and why it was the last word he said before he died.  The reporters find people who knew Kane throughout his life trying to get information from them that would put some sense to Kane saying `rosebud' as his last word.  Many of the stories told by the people interviewed show the audience a lot about his life through flashbacks. One of the opening scenes is that of Kane's mansion called Xanadu.  It has a sign that says `no trespassing' that is hung from the outside gate.  The shot is very dark and gloomy, hinting that maybe Kane's life was the same way.  He was a very power-hungry man that went from being at the top to rock bottom.  Many other movies have definitely taken note to style and effects of this movie.  The camera work, lighting, acting a music contributed to making Citizen Kane one of the best American movies of all time.  Orson Welles deserves all the credit that he receives from this movie.  He was the leading character, producer and director; basically a one man show that still many of us appreciate.  I thought that this movie was well done.  It had so much symbolism that made the movie unique, although if you didn't know what was symbolic during the different scenes it would be hard to follow, but most of the symbolism is easily recognized.  One of the best symbolic scenes that also foreshadows is when Kane is at the top of the stairs and he is told that he lost his position and as he walks down the stairs the camera is shooting from at the top and it looks like a spiral showing that Kane's life and career are out of control.  Citizen Kane was very dramatic and all who took part in the movie played their roles well.  The characters seemed very real and believable making this movie very memorable.  This film has features that every movie should try to incorporate; symbolism, great actors, interesting storyline, excellent camera shots, lighting and sound techniques.  I think everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time because it is one of the greatest American movies of all time."
kosmasp,"Jul 10, 2020",10/10,"From the very start, it is made clear what we will get here. A very controlling and aware movie. The frame of the window ... well if you watch the different shots that lead up to the house, you will notice it too, I won't have to point it out. And as controlled and rehearsed that was, as much is the rest of the movie. Especially when it comes to framing, but also lighting. The movie made use of many different techniques to keep the cost down, but still look epic - and it succeeded, thanks to the complete control Orson Welles had over it.Something unprecedented back then. A first time movie director having all the control? Apparently there were some spies on the set, but Welles knew of and about them and tricked them in some instances (like with scenes where you couldn't see the main characters because of backlighting).This is as much a technical achievement as it is an achievement in storytelling. Especially considering we already know at the beginning what will happen, just to unfold (through interviews) and fill in the blanks. Rosebud - more than just what it was but what it stands for. It is about something rather than just one thing. A lot of interpretation can be made, because a lot of thought had gone into the movie. Welles knew what he wanted and while it may feel ""boring"" to some viewers now, he achieved everything he set out to do.So love it or hate it, the movie is above any criticism - which again does not mean you have to like it or rate it higher than what you feel it deserves to get. Just remember: if you don't like it or do like it a lot, does not make your opinion better or more right than others on it. This is hailed as a classic for many reasons though, try to enjoy it for what it is, not what you would want it to be"
jofitz27,"Jun 3, 2005",10/10,"Citizen Kane (according to the American Film Institute) is the greatest film ever made. Though I cannot comment fairly on that (I haven't even seen half of the nominated 100) I can assure any readers one thing: Citizen Kane is marvellous. I am not simply following the crowd, as I thought one to many official movie reviewers were doing. I agree with them; Citizen Kane lives up to the hype, just about.I heard from a few average (but movie-loving) people that they thought Citizen Kane was good, but not superb or as good as it was supposed to be. I read so many great reviews, and really did think the reviewers were simply afraid to put this historic film out of place. I apologise: Citizen Kane is nearly perfect, and were it not for some small details in the second half of the film, it would be.Nearly everything is spot on. The musical score, in particular, is the best I've ever seen. The film has charisma, charm. The acting is impeccable. The script fantastic. It's epic. And all done by a 25-year-old, which really gives it full marks.And especially for the time, it must have been incredible. The cinematography, the landmark qualities, everything was so original and new. But in the final half hour, deeper insight is necessary. We are left hanging on a thread, wondering especially after some incidents how the newsroom is going. We know little of Kane newspapers, though the dilemmas in his personal life are particularly well played out.Top banana, this is.**** out of **** (4 out of 4)"
stefanbe,"Jul 5, 2007",10/10,"Has a film ever been more praised and loved by film critics than Citizen Kane? Some people will say The Godfather or Casablanca hold that title, but I think it's Citizen Kane. The praise is certainly deserved, because this is certainly is one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time. Much more fascinating is the fact that it was almost never released and close to be destroyed. Welles had already created controversy with his ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast that shocked America, but that was nothing compared to what erupt thanks to Citizen Kane. Newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst believed that the film painted an unflattering image of him and was determined to bury the film, along with Welles. Due to Hearst's power of the press and radio waves, the film was barely advertised and flopped on its initial release. It would also lose the Best Picture Oscar to John Ford's sentimental How Green Was My Valley (considered by many to be the Academy's biggest mistake ever). Kane would disappear and only after both the careers of Hearst and Welles fell did it start to gain an audience upon numerous re-releases from the 1950's onward. It was praised by critics as a masterpiece and Welles was put alongside Chaplin and Ford as one of cinema's greatest artists. More and more acclaim is given to Citizen Kane each day and rightfully so.Millionaire tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies one night in his bed at his giant castle, Xanadu with his very last word, ""Rosebud."" A reporter (William Alland) working on a news reel about Kane is soon asked by his boss to investigate the importance of the word. So, he begins to interview previous colleagues of the newspaper runner, which leads to various flashbacks of his life. After his mother becomes rich, she sends Charles away with a bank owner and he soon grows into a prosperous man, who decides that ""it would be fun to run a newspaper."" He gains control of The Inquirer, which soon blossoms into a major enterprise. He soon marries the president's daughter and runs for senator. After that breaks off, he meets a young woman who he wants to become a successful singer, but she is not able to hold a tune. Yet, through all of this, does the reporter ever find out what ""Rosebud"" means?Citizen Kane has been looked into and analysed by many critics (including one providing a commentary for the DVD) and almost everybody has a different interpretation. I, for one, view it as a story of a man who despite gaining a lot of money, never really became happy and that one word is Kane realising that his death is probably the best thing to have ever happened to him. Kane becomes so insanely wealthy and successful, that he forgets what life is all about, which explains why he just melts away in Xanadu for all the years after his second wife's divorce. Kane may not be the kindest gentleman, but he certainly is fascinating, which is probably what adds to the everlasting appeal of Citizen Kane. Orson Welles set out to tell the story of one man and made a masterpiece and a classic motion picture history. His performance, direction and screenplay are all perfect in every way. His supporting players, which he brought to Hollywood with him from the Mercury Theatre are all impressive as well. Gregg Toland, the cinematographer, also deserves heaps of praise for his brilliant camera work and lighting effects."
goodguy-16,"Jun 22, 2010",10/10,"I was wrong in seeing the film for the first time as a teenager (14-15). I wasn't mature enough to grasp the meaning of the movie and the entire plot. Because of that first view, I've been under the impression that the film is strange and alienated.Yesterday I decided that it deserves a second view, now that I'm a little bit older (22) and have seen more than enough films, compared to when I was younger.I just finished watching it and it left me with teary eyes and a lump in my throat. I was moved - and didn't even see it coming.When I first saw the film I couldn't relate to Charles Foster Kane, and it wrecked the film for me - until I decided to watch it again.In my opinion, the early and final years of Charles are those that make the film get under your skin and into your heart."
Cinemayo,"Jun 10, 2004",10/10,"I am totally elated to say I've just had my first - and by no means my last - wonderful experience with the well-labeled ""classic"" that is CITIZEN KANE.I decided to see it bright and early, at 7:30 am where I could be at my most alert and perceptive. It did not disappoint me in a single way. And even though I was fully prepared in advance to think ""there's just no way this is going to be the 'best film ever made',"" the more I became entranced in it, the more I understood precisely why so many fans and critics over the decades have bestowed such an honor on it. It's a truly great motion picture - and if I'm not presently prepared to call it ""The Single Greatest Film Ever Made,"" I certainly think it's one of the greatest, at least that I've ever seen.I must say with regret, however, that I'd already heard what ""Rosebud"" was before watching the movie, and that's a real shame. Because I would have been totally blown away by that bittersweet revelation had I not expected it. The only thing for me to hope for was that, at least, the manner in which this information was revealed in the film would be properly dramatic and effective, and not just some character telling its meaning or some other less than stellar presentation. I was actually hoping that the movie would end with the ""Rosebud"" object somehow being amidst Kane's personal possessions -- but who would ever have though that it was going to be SO brilliantly revealed - with such grandeur! Absolutely perfect - drama at its finest!The performances were marvelous, beginning with Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten (what a shame to think Cotten was ultimately to be handed such junk as LADY FRANKENSTEIN later on). I spotted people I never expected to see, such as George Coulouris as Thatcher (another who wound up in Grade Z horrors like 1957's THE MAN WITHOUT A BODY!).I was totally intrigued with the character of Chuck Kane continuously, and I loved the manner in which this well-crafted story was told via flashbacks and time leaps backward and forward. Of course, the cinematography was second to none and, I imagine, astonishingly fresh and innovative for its day. Dialogue was great, too; I particularly liked one funny bit where the elderly Thatcher tells the young adult Kane: ""You're too old to call me 'Mister'"", to which Welles replies, ""and you're too old to be called anything else"" !Orson Welles was a genius with this work of art. I can't wait to dig into the documentary, and perhaps even Roger Ebert's commentary. To think that Welles was so young when he fashioned this beautiful film, and had complete creative license! This is what I like with a director when I can get it - one who is in charge of everything, not just someone who is merely directing someone else's ideas. I like a director to conceive, write, direct, and edit everything (at this point I'm not positive that Welles did it ALL, but he did enough!).Well, I could go on forever at this moment, but I'll let others get a word or two in. All I can say is - if you hadn't guessed by now - this baby's got a space on my shelf with its name on it! And by the way, EXCELLENT restoration job, Warner!"
DaveDiggler,"Aug 11, 2010",6/10,"I really can't find anything in ""Citizen Kane"" worth liking. Do I see what the big fuss is about? Sure. And it is one of the best looking and most well made film of the 40s (from what I've seen. I admittedly don't watch many films from the 40s, because of bad experiences with ""great"" films such as this). ""Citizen Kane"" is a monumental achievement because of some of the technical aspects. I have no reason to watch ""Citizen Kane"" ever again though. I don't particularly like any of the acting, and the story is just dull to me. I don't watch movies for editing, camera work, lighting or technical achievements. Those aspects of filmmaking certainly can greatly help or hurt a film, but without a good script, and without good acting, you just have a good-looking movie. That's the case with ""Citizen Kane."" Supremely directed and extremely well crafted for its time, but I just didn't care for the man or the exposition of most scenes.A lot of directors can make a good-looking film, and a lot have. The remake of ""All the King's Men"" is wonderfully shot, but the movie is a complete mess that is just butchered by the director (most noticeably the atrocious casting and the shampoo commercial-esque editing). ""All the King's Men"" does have a good performance from Penn, but that's about it. Other than that? It is a terrible movie. ""Citizen Kane"" is not that bad and Welles' direction is far better, but I think it's a similar case were two movies look a lot better than anything that's happening between the characters, or within the story. The characters might be exquisitely framed, but I just didn't care what they had to say.It is masterfully made for its time and it is a greatly influential film. That's what it is remembered for and what it was always be remembered for. Rosebud comes second. If you rate a movie purely on direction, then you probably give it a high score. If you don't, then your taste will dictate how effective it was. For me, ""Citizen Kane"" is another major disappointment to add to the heap of ""disappointing classics."""
lindsaaay,"Jul 15, 2015",10/10,"Citizen Kane is so far my favorite movie of all times. This movie has great acting, lighting, plot, and so much more. I first saw this movie around the beginning of the year 2015 with my dad. At first I also didn't understand what was happening with all of the time jumps, and stories. Once I saw it a couple of time, I got what was going on, and loved it. Citizen Kane has a lot of story behind the scenes. Orson Wells based the movie on a man named William Randolf Hearst. When the movie released, Hearst wanted Citizen Kane to be destroyed, and never seen by anyone because the movie pretty much tells about his entire life. There is so much more about what happened in between Hearst and Wells, but it is an amazing story. Citizen Kane is a perfect definition of an excellent movie. If you ask me, I say that everyone should see this movie. Citizen Kane isn't a movie for everyone though. If you're a big movie person, and willing to see any movie, than watch Citizen Kane."
beaconb,"Dec 2, 2021",7/10,"After hearing for years, perhaps decades, that ""Citizen Kane"" was one of, if not, the greatest film ever made, I watched it. Perhaps because of all the hype, it was a letdown for me. From what others have written, it was a breakthrough film of its time. But I'm not watching it in 1941, I'm watching it in 2021. After watching movies for the past 50+ years, this one just didn't do much for me. It certainly didn't entertain me. The acting is great, but that wasn't enough to carry it for me. I would only recommend watching it just so you can say, ""Yeah, I finally watched it, but...""."

I've been to screenings with discussions at the end to help me see its ""greatness"". Believe me, if there was SOMETHING that I could act all high and mighty and cinema snob about it, I would. But CK escapes me. It was a bomb when it first came out, and at least for the last 30 years it's been a bomb with me and my other cinema aficionados. I still don't see why it's so highly rated. It's like a prank and these pseudo-intellectual wannabes have latched onto this awfully boring film to act like they have some superior taste and expertise than anyone who doesn't like it.I wish more people would come on here and give it a fat 1/10 to lower its rating. For 50 years I've never liked it. And today I still don't. And this is DECADES of watching and enjoying 1000s of movies with other likeminded cinema aficionados. Please bring this rating down.

majikstl,"Jun 13, 2005",10/10,"There is a telling moment in CITIZEN KANE that quietly reveals a lot about what makes the film great. It is a scene set in the dark days of the Great Depression, where Kane is turning over much of his empire to his arch-nemesis, Thatcher. As they talk, Kane casually walks away from the camera and we suddenly discover that the room the men are in is an illusion. The background wall that looks to be right behind the them is actually twenty or thirty feet away, the window sill isn't at waist height, but actually is over Kane's head. The room is huge and Kane is dwarfed by his surroundings. Kane than walks back toward the camera and perspective again creates an illusionary intimate image.It is a neat camera trick and KANE is full of neat camera tricks. It discretely plays with our perception of reality, just as the story does. Through out, Charles Foster Kane is at a distance and slightly out of focus and then he is up close and personal; he is larger than life and suddenly small and petty; he is always at the center of the picture, yet concedes the foreground to the various witnesses who tell his story. CITIZEN KANE is a treasure chest of cinematic gadgets and gizmos; yet as deliciously stylized as KANE is, the style meshes perfectly with the content. CITIZEN KANE is a story of illusions and perceptions told through illusions and perceptions.Before KANE, and for the most part afterward, no film has quite taken hold of the medium of film and done so much with it. Other directors have tried to dazzle us with how cleverly stylish they can make their films, but usually the effect is self-consciously arty: Every rabbit pulled out of a hat is greeted with a drum roll and a fanfare. The beauty of KANE and the reason director Orson Welles remains an artist of awed respect, arise from the casual grace with which he performed his magic tricks. His rabbits are in themselves so fascinating that how he produces them is only of secondary interest. Yet for a film obsessed with stylistic trickery, CITIZEN KANE still manages to be an incredibly personal story.To say a film is efficient may seem like a backhanded compliment, but part of the wonder of KANE is that it tells so much story and covers so much territory on a B-movie budget. It is an epic created on sound stages and with editorial mosaics. Welles begins his film with a mock newsreel obituary announcing Kane's passing, then basically repeats aspects of that same story several times over from different perspectives, maintaining a vague chronology, but jumping around in time to let us know that there is more to a life than the mere passage of time. Welles tells us who Kane was to the world, then who he was to the people who actually knew him -- suggesting that who we are is defined not by what we have done but by who we have touched. It is one of the most effective and insightful film biographies that was ever made. The fact that it is a biography of a fictional character is totally irrelevant.The essence of CITIZEN KANE is the fable of the blind men and the elephant. Like the blind men, who, upon examining only a part of the beast, assume that the elephant is a rope (the tail), a tree (a leg), a sword (a tusk), etc., the witnesses to Kane's life see him as a spoiled child, an idealist, a hypocrite, a monster and so on and so forth. All are correct, yet all are wrong, only seeing in Kane what they want to see. We never meet Kane the man, only Kane the illusion, yet we end up with a vague grasp of who he must have been. If CITIZEN KANE offers any universal truth it is that a life -- or a movie -- is more than the sum of the parts.Even given all the well-deserved praise proffered to Welles as a director, he never seems to get his due as an actor. His embodiment of Charles Foster Kane is, simply put, one of the great screen performances of all time. We remember that KANE saw Welles as a first time director, but it was also his first time on screen professionally and he gives a performance that is both self-assured and subtle, bold and bemused. Taking Kane from his twenties to his sunset years without a false note, giving a performance that combines gentle humor with grandiose theatrics, Welles creates a character of shifting moods and conflicting motives, yet always consistently believable. In later years, Welles perfected his persona of larger-than-life bluster and wounded arrogance, on screen and off, but he never again got a chance to play a character of such complexity and nuance.KANE's status as ""the greatest film ever made"" is always being challenged, defended and debated, yet it is remarkable how seldom the film itself is imitated. Despite being given this perfect blueprint for how to film a biography, it is rare that any film attempts to break free of the this-happened-that-happened style of storytelling. It is as if the legendary stature of the film intimidates others.Hitchcock once said that film is life with all the dull parts edited out. Welles adheres to this and goes one better: CITIZEN KANE is all highlights and underlined passages, a Cliff Notes biography of sorts. Does this allow us to get to know the real Charles Foster Kane? Well, yes, and no. We are allowed to solve the mystery of ""Rosebud,"" but Kane the man remains just out of our reach. We never really meet Charles Foster Kane, only his shadows. Welles and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz give us pieces of a puzzle, but the pieces are not all from the same puzzle."
Uliabes,"Oct 20, 2007",10/10,"When it comes to Citizen Kane, one question eclipses all others: Is it the best film ever made? The answer, for me anyway, is yes.Citizen Kane is still easily THE greatest films ever made. Its not 'one of', or 'the second', its the FINEST. I don't think any film will ever over-shadow it, either. Its one of the most famous, as it (successfully) broke every cinematic boundary in the book. It introduced countless innovations that are today a common part of film-making.The movie opens with an unforgettable image of a distant, fog-shrouded castle on a hill. It's a classic Gothic shot, and goes a long way towards establishing Citizen Kane's mood. We quickly learn that this place, called Xanadu, is the dwelling of America's Kubla Khan, Charles Foster Kane (Welles), a one-time newspaper magnate who could have become President if not for an ill-advised extramarital affair. Xanadu, in the words of the faux newsreel that gives a brief history of Kane's life, is the ""costliest monument of a man to himself."" Any resemblance to The Ranch, William Randolph Hearst's real-life San Simeon abode, is not coincidental.In the opening, Kane is dead, and utters the word 'rosebud' as he hunches over. His death, like his life, is a big news event, and the paper he owned, the New York Inquirer, is desperate to unearth the meaning of his cryptic last word. Is it a woman he bedded? A horse he bet on? A beloved pet? Some long-lost, unrequited love? The truth, which isn't revealed until the closing scene, represents one of the all-time greatest motion picture ironies, and leads us to believe that, on some level, Kane regretted not having led a simple, quiet life. A ten minuet newsreel follows this to exhibit his larger-than-life accomplishments.After this, reporters and the public in general, begin to investigate what he actually meant by 'rosebud'. The film dips into flashbacks (in chronology), to search for 'rosebud's significance. It also shows interviews with his loved (and loathed) ones, to see if they have any inkling to what it may mean.The movie is a visual masterpiece, a kaleidoscope of daring angles and breathtaking images that had never been attempted before, and has never been equaled since. Every image is depicted with incredible detail, and beauty.There's no doubt that Citizen Kane is far ahead of its time. Uncompromising, unsentimental drama of this sort was not in vogue during an era that was better known for titles like The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, and How Green Was My Valley (which beat out Kane for best picture).Not only is this film-making at its best, but motion picture archives and collections across the world would be poorer without copies of this film, which will forever be recognized as a defining example of American cinema."

adamsandel,"Apr 5, 2021",7/10,"First of all, having been told that this film is the greatest of all time for many years is bound to disappoint first time viewers. And complaining that a film is over-rated is a complaint of the critics and scholars, not of the film itself.But while it's clearly a tour-de-force of screenwriting, direction, and visual style, I've always felt that there's something missing: emotional impact.It's certainly a well-told yarn, but there are very few moments that make you feel emotionally connected to, or empathetic with, any of the characters. The film makes me marvel at its stylish panache, but it never really makes me feel anything.Without that emotional connection, it feels like a trailblazing achievement for its time, but not a great work of cinematic art."
manulapique,"Aug 22, 2024",5/10,"Often hailed as the greatest film of all time, ""Citizen Kane"" has garnered immense praise for its technical innovations and bold narrative. However, its reputation may be overstated when considering its actual impact on audiences.The film's acting, influenced by Orson Welles' theatrical background, feels dated and overly dramatic, making it difficult for modern viewers to connect emotionally with the characters.While its non-linear structure was groundbreaking, the fragmented storytelling can feel unfocused and self-indulgent. The quick dialogue and shifting perspectives often sacrifice clarity and emotional depth for the sake of cleverness.Compared to other classics like ""Casablanca,"" ""Citizen Kane"" falls short in emotional impact. Its thematic exploration of power and corruption lacks the personal resonance that makes a film truly memorable.While ""Citizen Kane"" was undeniably innovative, its status as the greatest film ever made is greatly questionable. The overacting, disjointed narrative, and lack of emotional connection suggest that its reputation may owe more to critical hype than to genuine cinematic greatness."
bilsborrow23,"Sep 24, 2012",10/10,"The BFI top 50 films list was dominated by one film for 50 years. That film, was ""Citizen Kane"". Any film that tops a critically acclaimed list, deserves a watch. I can say without a doubt that this film is one of the most compelling and stylishly executed motion pictures I have ever viewed.As for my title, ""The Best Film Ever?"", I truly believe if there is one film that rises above the others I have viewed it must be this one, there is something so unique and tidy about the way this film has been put together and shot, it is full of iconic shot's that when you watch them you will want to pause the film and just stop and stare with delight at the beauty of the camera work and the perfect acting that is being displayed within the shot.The plot of Citizen Kane consists of a young boy, Charles Foster Kane, who has been rejected by his parents and is given away to live with a rich, money grabbing politician who is very wealthy. Charles runs into this wealth and also becomes the head of a newspaper company named, ""The Inquirer"". Charles changes the whole system of the newspaper and how they fill their papers. Charles transforms the paper and makes it much more politically competitive with the other papers, this draws attention to the Inquirer as well as drawing attention to Charles himself. Charles then runs for governor and displays a powerful speech which consists of some tremendous acting and is surrounded by some iconic scenery which is lead by a large poster of Kane which stuck in my mind because of its wonderful vastness. Everything looks good for Kane until his affair, (so to speak), is discovered by an opposing governor candidate. When this story gets out, Kane's chances of becoming governor deteriorate and this starts Kane's spiral of self destruction and in time drives him into his grief hole which he calls ""Xanadu"". He goes to live there with his wife who he lost his chances of governor for and slowly becomes a more miserable weaker man.The second side of the plot is a lot shorter but is a key part of the film. It starts when there is a shot of Kane, (At this point we do not know who Kane is), drops a snow globe whilst delivering the words, ""Rosebud"", and then the snow globe rolls down some steps and smashes on the wood floor and Kane dies. Then after his death a newspaper journalist is sent around to talk to Kane's acquaintances to find out what rosebud could possibly mean, the conversation's between the journalist and Kane's acquaintances turn into flashbacks which structure the whole film wonderfully and create an entertaining unpredictable story that it would be almost impossible to appreciate if not enjoy immensely.My verdict on this film is pretty much summed up by the title, the film is structured unlike any other films in its time period and is assisted superbly by consistent, powerful and distinct acting that when viewed will impress anybody who is a lover of films and also appeals to people who are used to watching films that maybe are not so acclaimed, I am instructing you now, do not be hesitant to watch this film, it is almost impeccable and thoroughly entertaining.""Whatever I do, I do because I love you"", from me, Kane receives a 10."
Keenan_Investigates,"Jan 29, 2007",10/10,"I went into this knowing of its great reputation, but fearing it would be very slow and boring with a lot of dialogue and a heavy 'moral message'. Although it did have an underlying message (and a very strong and well made one too), the film wasn't at all what I expected; the camera work and music in particular livened it up, and at times it was quite light hearted. I think this helped make the emotional scenes all the more powerful. It kept me gripped all the way, and I don't have a long attention span. The acting throughout is superb, with very little of the overacting that you might expect from this period, with Welles in particular giving an outstanding performance in the lead role. My advice is give it a try, even if you think it's not your type of film."
Sonic_Ocean,"Mar 11, 2013",10/10,"A movie of epic proportions is how I would describe Citizen Kane. I have watched this film a couple of times, expecting not to like it as much as I would. Being a movie that gets a lot of hype with its title as 'the greatest movie of all time,' I can clearly see why. Is it the greatest of movie of all time? I don't know and that is up to your opinion, but all I can say is that I try not to watch films with those impressions influencing my expectations. Although what I can say is that I greatly appreciate this film and I can accept the praise and I feel it is one of the best films I have ever watched.Despite being from the 40's, this movie somehow feels fresh to me, even today in this day and age! The way that this story is told feels so intrinsic. The movie begins with an introduction of the whole story that really took me off guard at first, but then I realized it didn't tell the human aspects of the story that was to follow and this is one of the most unique introductions in a movie I have ever seen. You think you know the whole story from this mini-documentary styled intro, but this is still a jigsaw puzzle that still needs to be solved by the people who know Kane personally to fill in most of the blanks, especially the mystery of 'Rosebud.' Kane was a powerful figure, but a character who also had a sense of humanity and through this, it's easy to feel a connection to Kane. As we delve into the human aspect of the film, we become more and more immersed with the story and it is a very human story, in my opinion. This to me is what makes the movie effective.And what also astounds about the story is that it feels complete and it did not need to have anything else added to enhance or add further drama to the story. You would think a movie that tries to tell a story of a man's life young to old would feel rushed, but at this running time, it feels like you know the guy! Never have I seen such character development this good and fleshed out on film. And to top it all off, the makeup looks very realistic, along with Orson Welle's acting, which perfectly pulls it off for his different ages throughout the movie.And that is only a few of the great aspects of this film. The great cinematography techniques in the movie have definitely made me more analytical and aware of these intricacies in film. Not only is the story filled with ambition, but you can see it in the beautiful visuals. From Kane's huge, but sparse mansion to scenes utilizing chiaroscuro, you can see the influence it had on films today. From starring and also directing this film, you can see from watching the film the amount of ambition that Orson Welles poured out into this epic.After watching Citizen Kane, I cannot help but feel like there has been a transition from me being a casual movie watcher to a serious film buff. With its simple, but grandiose story, its breathtaking visuals and even the music that perfectly compliments every scene, this movie has become a timeless beauty that ages like fine wine."
tjgoalie13,"Oct 8, 2015",9/10,"Citizen Kane has often been considered one of the best films ever made, and for good reason. The film uses complex and expert composition, camera work, and pioneered new techniques like deep focus, and elaborate camera movements. However, the most impressive part of Citizen Kane is the subtle meanings that can be taken from the composition, if viewed closely enough, it can drastically change a viewer's opinion of the characters. All the while using the life of William Randolph Hearst as a blueprint for the character and story.When discussing Citizen Kane there's a lot to talk about, some of which is more obvious than the rest. One compositional trick the film used was the use of low angle camera frames. This meaning the camera was below Kane quite often to imply power, this often helped reinforce that Kane was a man of great power. The use of camera angles did help reinforce that Kane was a man of power, but was most likely used more for leading audiences to show the duality of the character. Another obvious aspect is that of Deep Focus, and elaborate camera movements, both of which were groundbreaking at the time of release. Citizen Kane's most impressive achievement was that of Deep Focus, a method in which everything in the foreground and background is clearly in focus. Deep Focus was used effectively to show that Kane was important even in frames when he was seemingly trapped. Despite the fact that Kane was a powerful man he's consistently shown as being trapped, helping reinforce the duality of the character.Charles Foster Kane is besides his superficial facade a very tragic character, but it may take a few viewings to realize this. In multiple cases throughout the film composition implies a further meaning, most often the composition is made to make Kane look trapped. The two best examples of this are in the beginning with his parents, and at the midpoint of the film, when Kane is in Susan Alexander's room with Boss Gettys. An understandable question is why Kane shown as being trapped?The answer is given in the beginning, and throughout until the end ""Rosebud."" Rosebud has it's literal meaning, and the figurative meaning of a lost childhood. However, the film consistently shows the audience that Rosebud represents that Kane is a lonely character, looking for a love he was deprived of before he had a say in the matter. Multiple lines in the film reinforce this for instance when Kane says ""A toast, Jedediah: to Love on my own terms. That's the only terms I've ever known.""It would seem logical that Susan Alexander paralleled Rosebud, as their affair, is the only time Kane doesn't look lonely. Rosebud being Kane's lost innocence, and love, may have been filled by Susan Alexander, the best evidence of this is that Kane admits he's looking for Rosebud before he meets her, but is distracted by her, symbolizing that she represents the same thing Kane that Rosebud does. In the end however, Kane loses Rosebud again, and he loses Alexander as well. It's impossible to ignore the tragic look of an old lonely Kane who sits in an empty Xanadu, probably wishing he could give it all up for another life, one where he had Rosebud.Rosebud is also theorized to be a reference towards William Randolph Hearst. Film reviewer Gore Vidal theorized that Rosebud was Hearst's nickname for a private region of his mistress Marion Davies, other theories were that it was Hearst's nickname for his childhood bike, either way it seemed to connect to Hearst. It seems obvious that Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life despite what Welles said. The evidence is that Xanadu is remarkably similar to Hearst Castle, both characters were media moguls who helped start wars, and both had mistresses.Regardless of whether or not Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life it is still a great film full of meanings. It is so full of meanings, and elaborate compositions it's almost impossible to address all of them, but that's only a testament to the film's sheer quality. At the time the film changed the way filmmakers approached framing, and movement. It seems that still today few films have been so dense with literal, compositional, and figurative meanings as Citizen Kane did. It will forever remain a masterpiece of American Cinema."
manendra-lodhi,"Aug 2, 2012",9/10,"If you see a 50 years old film and still find the cinematography and other film making techniques to be compelling than just imagine the impact it would have over the audience in those times. From the start I found it to be a visual treat. Over the first few minutes it runs as if you are sitting in a local train and which stops at different stations and you get to know the glimpses of your journey. Such is the great editing which is used in the starting.The story telling manner was completely unorthodox and has blown my mind. What is more important to note is the character of Charles Kane. The film has depicted his character in such a way that the audience is in a confused state as to what truly was his nature. I like films which make people guessing and thinking when they leave the Cinema Hall. The acting of the director himself was awesome and other characters also performed very nicely. In all, this is a film which will leave you thinking about it all the time obviously making you guess the different aspects of the story. Any cinema lover is sure to enjoy this.PROS:The story of the film is brilliantly written and the character of Charles Kane has been analyzed with full depth. What is more compelling to me is that analysis of the character done in the film is from the point of the view of the director and the writer. But it also leaves space for the audience to make their own version of this character. Such great is its depiction. No doubt that the cinematography and editing are at their best. To understand how great the techniques are, you have to get out of the world of films that we are living in currently. Only than one can truly understand what is great. Orson has given the best acting in the film as the lead character. The only other one whom I would compare here would be Francois Truffaut and his acting in the film Day for Night. The progress of the story, the depth of the nature of the important characters and their part in the film are satisfying to the maximum level.CONS:In the middle however I got drifted away a little from the film but that might be because I was carrying too much of expectation from the film and was expecting it to be as compelling as The Bicycle Thief but I understand that both of them are of a different genre. And maybe we should never carry too much expectation because when we do so than our mind makes us to find faults in the act we are going to perform. But the pleasing editing again took me into the film.MESSAGE: ""Truth is bitter.""VERDICT: ""A must watch film for all lovers of cinema."""
the-fearless-america,"Apr 24, 2016",9/10,"Citizen Kane is a movie that considered as the number 1 best film ever made in history from so many movie professionals. Firstly i even didn't believe it in any such way. Then i try to watch it. Wow, Citizen Kane was indisputable. I didn't need to contemplate carefully to make a statement that Citizen Kane was the best movie ever made. Cinematography that Welles use exalted by so many directors nowadays. It teach the next generation about what a true cinematography is. Welles is an inspirator of film directors.The difficulties to make Citizen Kane was extremely high. Maybe the hardest film ever made in history. The shadows and lighting direction implementation was absolutely triumphant. The camera set- piece, positioning, and movement was indisputably genius. I can't compare the geniusity of Orson Welles in Citizen Kane to anybody. This was a true maximum potential of cinematography in movie history. If we ask which movie have the best cinematography ever, of course it was Citizen Kane."
GusRED149,"Oct 29, 2015",N/A,"Without a doubt the Best Film ever made. Orson Welles make this masterpiece in 1941 and still hasn't been overcome. The Acting is incredible, with every performances unique and perfect. The Direction is flawless. The Cinematography is perfect. The Art is Impeccable. The Sound is Incredible. The Editing it is Revolutionary in its own way. Many of the novel techniques Welles developed with the cinematographer were calculated to offer new angles on film space. Everything that has something to do with this film is a masterpiece. The Story is a major hit, with an amazing plot and a strong argument, This Film is a Masterpiece, is truly one of the best films out there, certainly a high point in early cinema. and every award that it get its well deserved."
talisencrw,"Apr 12, 2016",10/10,"I fondly recollect, growing up in Canada in the 70's and 80's, my mom taking my older sister and I to the cinema (my dad was more interested in watching bowling, hockey, or either crime shows, British sitcoms or hockey on TV). Despite all of his TV appearances over the years, and films he acted in to fund his own productions, the first time I was aware of Orson Welles was one of those startling and bizarrely professional yet unmistakably charismatic 'Paul Masson' wine commercials that they tend to make fun of on The Simpsons in these decades gone by. My first thought was 'that voice is amazing', then 'he looks like he'd be a fine grandfather or Santa Claus', and I instantly wanted to know who he was: Just the way he carried himself, I knew he must be both brilliant and someone who was really important.As you can tell, I'm not going to unnecessarily repeat all the endless accolades this film has gotten over the years. If you're any type of film lover, you have either seen this or will eventually--unless you're hit by a bus tomorrow (Heaven forbid) or something else drastic. It's a hallmark of what is possible in cinema. I waited until I was 46 to see this, because of its stellar reputation. It's not my favourite Welles--either acting or directing, and not by a long shot in either regard--but I'm very glad that I finally saw it, and I'll probably revisit it every couple of years for the rest of my life. There's just something really special about it that's hardly ever seen any more--and I think of that just as wistfully as Charles Foster Kane did about his beloved 'Rosebud'. That a 25-year-old could be so gleefully and breathtakingly experimental and innovative, yet still endlessly entertain, is nothing short of miraculous."
BA_Harrison,"Mar 27, 2020",7/10,"It's been nearly 80 years since the original release of Citizen Kane and I imagine that any film fan worth their salt already knows the secret behind 'Rosebud', the final word uttered by newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) immediately before popping his clogs. But even if you are well aware of the significance of the word, this classic drama is still a must-see if only because of its status as one of the most important and critically acclaimed films ever made.Somehow, I made it to the ripe old age of 52 without seeing Citizen Kane, but finally popped it in the DVD player to see what all the fuss is about, and while I wouldn't class it as a masterpiece myself (I believe I have very different criteria to most for that accolade), I did enjoy the film, finding it an engaging study of a powerful character, brilliantly portrayed by Welles, who goes convincingly from cocksure youngster with big ideas to an old man with more than a few regrets over the course of two hours.Told through flashbacks recounted by various acquaintances of Kane, to a reporter trying to unravel the meaning of Rosebud, the film flits back and forth through the wealthy man's life: his childhood, when his parents became filthy rich and sent him East to be schooled; his building of a news empire; the Great Depression; his two marriages; a failed political career; and old age, as a recluse in his sprawling Florida mansion, Xanadu. It's a rocky ride through the ups and downs of Kane's life, in which the happiest moments were before a shed load of gold made him one of the richest men in the world (which should be a big clue as to what Rosebud refers, if you've spent your life living under a rock and don't already know).The lack of a gratuitous sex/shower scene, ninjas, barbarians, talking animals, cyborgs, exploding heads and dwarfs mean that Citizen Kane doesn't get full marks from me, but even though it's far removed from my usual fare, I still had a good time (Welles had a great eye for an interesting shot, that's for sure). 7/10 -- glad to have finally ticked it off my list of essential classics."
guy_r,"May 5, 2004",1/10,"I have tried to watch this movie 3 times.  Each time I promise myself that I will watch it through to see all the facinating camera angles and light shading.  I want to see the last ten minutes of the film and be awed and amazed as I realize that Rosebud is something extraordinary.  I want to recognize Mr. Wells' genius, daring, and inventivness.  I want to feel the passion, emptiness, and all the other powerful emotions that the actors and ""unique"" cinematography portray in this movie.I have not been able to make it yet.  This is the single most boring hard to watch movie that I have ever tried to watch.  I can usually watch about any movie at least once, but not this one.I don't need exciting special effects, car chases, shoot outs, or sex scenes to keep me interested.  I just need the movie to be interesting. This film is not interesting to me.  I love history and I watch many older movies and I appreciate most of them for what they are, and in the time frame that they were made.  But this one is just very hard to watch. If you have to have a college professor,(who himself has had to read a book about it to understand it) explain a movie to you so that you can appreciate it, then I'm sorry folks but then it just ""ain't good"".I have enjoyed thousands of movies, and I have disliked many also, but very few have I never been able to finish watching and this is one of them."
pioneerlythere37,"Sep 14, 2015",9/10,"Without subtitles I thought that Charles Foster Kane had said ""frostbite"". In the opening minute I almost thought I was watching a horror movie, the way the cinematographer went from one scene to another, aided by the fact that Xanadu looked haunted.The trivia for ""Citizen Kane"" was some of the most interesting trivia I've ever read. Orson Welles wrote and acted the character of Charles Foster Kane superbly well, and I suppose also did well directing himself. If this movie does anything, it is displaying yellow journalism and corrupted almost-politicians. Only Charles Foster Kane would think it ""fun"" to run a newspaper. At times Kane appears to be the man he wants people to think he is: a loving, kind, honest man, who would fit better than any other eligible man as the governor. Thanks to his friends, we brutally discover the true man underneath the layer of fake skin: a selfish, heartless man who only has one true goal in life: success, which he believes will also bring him happiness. But success cannot buy happiness, which he seemingly doesn't find out until his final dying moments.This movie was definitely not one of my ""Great Movies"", as it was Ebert's. As interesting as this movie was, the thing that nagged at my mind the most was the fact that, if he died when he was alone, how does anyone know what his final words were? Somehow, amazingly, this thought apparently never did occur to Welles or any of the other cast, crew, or producers until after it was released, whereas it occurred to me within ten minutes, as I'm sure it did to many other viewers. Did Ebert himself miss this fact, even after hundreds of viewings, or somehow shrug it off, even after doing an audio commentary on it? Perhaps I can see how he shrugged it off, considering I have done the same on other movies I've enjoyed, though the problems were less obvious and less important to the plot.This movie seems almost documentary-style, first giving us a summary of his life, then going back and addressing each plot point in more detail. The movie's strong points were the directing, characterization, and cinematography, and Welles' acting, although the other actors were quite disappointing. The movie was interesting and fun to watch, and the mystery kept us intrigued, although it was not quite what I was expecting. Charles Foster Kane was a very entertainingly arrogant character, and quite an incredible debut for Orson Welles. The end reveal is fascinating and meaningful in itself.My Official Score: 89.5/100"
ChristophCinema,"Oct 19, 2012",10/10,"When I first saw Citizen Kane, I hated it. Why? Because it was called The Greatest American Film of All Time. The first time I saw it, I was 12 years old, and I didn't even care about the movie. I just watched the movie and pointed out all the reasons why this movie sucked. To me, Citizen Kane was The Worst American Film of All Time. Then I saw the film again when I was like 16, and it was a little better. I then saw it the following year, and then I finally understood why it was called the greatest. After that third viewing, I finally had that appreciation for it that most film buffs have. There are many things that make this film the greatest. First of all, the cinematography is jaw dropping. This movie is so beautiful to look at; it almost brings a tear to my eye. The shadows, the angles, the camera movements, everything is just perfect. This may be the main reason why this film is considered to be the best, but there are other reasons too. Another great thing is the acting. This isn't typical 1940s acting; this is stuff that could still win Oscars today. The acting is so good, and the writing is so realistic, that it keeps you hooked from beginning to end. In fact, that's what made me love this movie. The story of Charles Foster Kane is just fascinating, and it's really interesting to see his story told through various flashbacks. The last thing that makes this movie so incredible is the impact it had. When this movie came out, it didn't do too well. In fact, it was like a cult movie years after its release. The film was based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, and he wasn't too pleased with what Welles was showing about his life (like his affair). Hearst wanted to have every print of this film destroyed, but Welles fought for it, and the rest is history. This really pushed the boundaries of freedom in cinema, and just knowing that makes it so much better. What I find very remarkable about this movie is legendary filmmaker, Orson Welles. This was his first movie, he was only 26 years old, and he wrote, directed, and starred in it. The man was a genius, and a true inspiration. Even if you don't want to admit this is the best movie ever made, that's fine. Even if you don't think it's the best, I don't think you can say it's a bad movie. Don't look at it as the best movie, just look at it as a movie, and maybe you'll appreciate it more. Greatest Movie of All Time? Yeah, it's kind of hard not to like it?"
itsahoverboard,"Jan 30, 2022",7/10,"Changed moviemaking forever. Ahead of its time. A cinematography and editing marvel for sure. It's still a painfully boring and emotionless story however, and I don't think it gets better with repeat viewings like some say.There are two other flaws: the acting, apart from Welles, is sometimes terrible. You can tell these are first timers and you call they are stage actors. Also, not that it's that important, but the makeup is really bad. It looks like they are wearing weird reptilian latex masks."
LowellFan09,"Sep 1, 2015",10/10,"Many critics and fans alike regard Citizen Kane as the greatest film of all time, and it's easy to see how that endearing reputation has befitted its audacious production for so many decades. In experiencing the film on Blu-ray (the 70th Anniversary Edition, to be exact), the film holds up magnificently well through the innovative and distinctive structure, make-up/visual effects, and lighting employed by Orson and his team all those years ago.Citizen Kane, of course, was the directorial debut of Orson Welles, whose booming and authoritative voice had made a him career in radio after co-founding the Mercury Theatre with John Houseman in 1937. By 1938, they created the Mercury Theatre on Air which would showcase their famous reading of the H.G. Wells classic, 'War of the Worlds,' a prank many took serious upon first hearing. Eventually, RKO Radio Pictures would grant Welles total freedom to make any picture he wanted; needless to say, Citizen Kane was born and became the darling it now is with both critics and fans around the world. While the picture did lose RKO money initially, the financial loss says nothing of its considerable contribution to cinema.The film is known for its incredibly poetic composition, deep focus, and nonlinear storytelling, which I must say, allows revisiting the picture to be a much more pleasurable experience since one is always trying to dissect all these wonderfully visual elements. Much of this credit should go to cinematographer Gregg Toland, whose use of 'deep focus,' a terrific technique whereby the back and foregrounds are equally in focus, became essential in giving Citizen Kane its unique and often-times deceptive appearance. Toland of course won the Academy Award for cinematography for William Wyler's 'Wuthering Heights' the year prior, and would subsequently assist Welles in making a picture that allowed the audience themselves to decide the importance of what was on screen without obvious dictation from the director or crew. So many of these incredible shots allow for plenty of clever effects and underlining of character foreshadowing as the story moves along.The acting is also a remarkable standout, in particular Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead, both of whom were friends with Welles from his Mercury Theatre on the Air radio crew, as were most of the actors in the film, in fact. The latter however - the stunningly enigmatic Agnes Moorehead - is my favorite performance of the entire picture. There's such a restraint and composure to her character that goes unmatched by anyone else. Sadly, she has less screen time than her co-stars, but this of course makes her no less effective in my view. Her performance is so boldly pronounced that she alone is responsible for quickly hooking the audience into the story of young Charles Foster Kane; we cannot help but want to learn of what happens to this young man through seeing his mother portrayed so fearlessly in such an important context of the movie. Bernard Herrmann's music is also a grand addition to the picture, loaning its duties to all sorts of emotions - drama, comedy, suspense; he even supplies an original aria for one of Kane's opera- singing mistresses. It's a fantastic, widespread composition for which brings a lot of weight to Welles' vision. The Blu-ray of course is great and features the stunning, Academy Award-nominated documentary, The Battle for Citizen Kane, along with commentaries and other features. It's definitely worth upgrading from the DVD and I urge anyone who has yet to see this film to purchase it immediately.Citizen Kane is a fine example of how motion pictures can establish themselves as true art and what young filmmakers should focus on as an influence over their own productions. Let us not forget those who laid these tracks before us; they surely lead back to some magnificent places, don't they?"
rpadgham,"Mar 31, 2023",1/10,"I'm afraid this film did nothing for me. It is sadly over hyped and not worthy of all the praise it has received. I forced myself to watch this film but it was a struggle to engage with the plot. Like a few other people have said, it might have great cinematography for the time it was made, but lacks that crucial ingredient - entertainment! I can chalk it off as being seen but won't be waking another two hours watching it a second time. I don't think I'm alone in disliking this movie. There are films that deserve high ratings on imdb but this isn't one of them. I hope more people take the time to give this the raspberry award it truly deserves."
Anthony_Miller,"Feb 9, 2016",10/10,"As someone who's seen plenty of excellent modern films, I expected Citizen Kane's greatness to strongly depend on historic innovations rather than truly timeless quality. But after watching it in my film course this week, I immediately recognized why it has been touted by many (including famous film critic Roger Ebert) as nothing less than the best piece of cinema to ever grace the silver screen.Orson Welles and his team left no stone unturned in their quest to fill every scene with clever camera-work, intelligent blocking, smooth editing and... well the list goes on and on. Right from the first scene, where you are embraced with the cold and dark tone of the movie through creatively plastered-together shots of the ominous Kane castle, you know you are in for something special. Something that I don't normally notice in contemporary movies but I picked up on in this one is the lighting. The lighting in this film is practically another character, and this in and of itself is something to be in awe of. I can't imagine the amount of time, effort and talent it required to craft something so precisely beautiful. I feel like a sap going on like this but Citizen Kane truly is a masterclass in filmmaking.I went into this movie expecting a dull experience with decent technical aspects and cheesy performances but left it with a whole new mindset on what makes a good film and what makes a good filmmaker. If you're a terrible cinephile like me who is reluctant to watch the 1940s classics, I strongly recommend giving this a watch."
bigticket-36199,"Sep 19, 2025",10/10,"""Citizen Kane"" is a mysterious drama that examines the many layers of society through the lens of a profoundly complex character, inspired by the lives of media barons and tycoons.The story leads us to Xanadu, a vast and opulent estate in Florida, owned by the immensely wealthy newspaper publisher and industrial magnate Charles Foster Kane. The aging Kane lies alone on his deathbed. Holding a snow globe, he utters his final word - ""Rosebud"" - and dies. A newsreel obituary recounts his life, while the world reels from the sensation of his passing. Yet the enigma of his last word sparks even greater intrigue. The producer of the newsreel assigns journalist Jerry Thompson the task of uncovering the meaning behind ""Rosebud."" Thompson begins interviewing Kane's friends and associates, piecing together fragments of a life shrouded in power and mystery...At just twenty-five, Orson Welles - as director, co-writer, and leading actor - fuses documentary-style framing, a retrospective narrative told from multiple perspectives, and groundbreaking technical innovations that forever changed cinematic language. The film dazzles with stark contrasts of light and shadow, unconventional camera angles, and the striking use of deep focus that still feels breathtaking today. A brisker narrative rhythm, powerful close-ups that expose raw emotions, and sharp, often sardonic dialogue together weave a magnificent cinematic tapestry.Through these shifting accounts, we glimpse not only Kane's persona but also the emotional landscapes of those closest to him. The settings shift from grimy newsroom offices to lavish halls and, ultimately, the dark emptiness of a deserted mansion - visual echoes of Kane's ambition and inner void. Bernard Herrmann's haunting score enriches the film's mood, while the transformative makeup work makes the characters' journeys through time utterly convincing.Thematically, the film plunges into the murk of morality, interrogating the so-called ""American Dream"" - its promises of success and its corrosive consequences. It shows how glory devolves into isolation, and how a life cannot be summed up in a single word, though a single word may hold the missing fragment of a soul.As Charles Foster Kane, Orson Welles delivers a performance of vibrant intensity, charting a course from youthful exuberance to bitter decline. His shifts in voice, presence, and gesture paint a portrait of a man torn between confidence, longing, vanity, and ultimate defeat.Joseph Cotten as Jedediah Leland offers the moral counterpoint - the loyal yet disillusioned friend. Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander Kane embodies a tragic figure, broken by the vortex of power yet retaining a glimmer of defiance. Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein radiates warmth and loyalty, while George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher personifies cold financial authority, the figure who steals Kane's childhood and chains him to a world devoid of empathy.The supporting cast - Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, William Alland, and others - further enrich the film with their vivid portrayals.""Citizen Kane"" remains a landmark of cinematic innovation and artistic daring. Its story is universal, resonating even today, as themes of ambition, dreams, fears, and missed opportunities are timeless. I have returned to this film many times in different stages of my life, and each viewing reveals something new. For me, it stands as not only one of the finest works of the 1940s but also one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of cinema."
alexis-368-973240,"Sep 6, 2012",9/10,"Although Citizen Kane was intended to make fun of William Randolph Hearst and his lavish ways of living, the movie nevertheless shines. It has every element a classic film has: romance, mystery, adventure, and even a little bit of thriller/horror.Unlike many movies, I could feel the same emotions as the character. Because the acting is so well done (with maybe a few cheesy sections), Citizen Kane is very convincing.I admire how you can never see the faces of some of the characters. That was done on purpose to convey that these characters were not very important.The dialogue is very succinct and unique. No other movie could have such clever screenplay. Of course, ""rosebud"" is the most famous line out of the movie, but the way the characters respond to each other is irreplaceable.The flashback is very gradual so that it is not confusing. I am very fortunate that I don't have to waste energy trying to follow along.I find it interesting how Orson Welles tried some new filming techniques. He used camera angles to show dominance, deliberately put actors in danger, and made sets very detailed and elaborate. In fact, he was one of the few directors at the time to have a ceiling.Although the first time I saw Citizen Kane was in a high school videography class, I still felt like I was in a theater, enjoying the classics that some people never notice."
pleamon111,"Dec 13, 2014",10/10,"In all honesty, I went into this movie knowing about how people call it a film classic so I am not looking at this movie as if it was just released yesterday. One of favorite aspect of this movie was how they didn't just tell the story of Kane's life beginning to end as most movies do, the way Welles used Kane's last words ""rosebud"" as more of an object through which the rest of plot developed was very interesting.My biggest complaint with the film is that throughout the movie there are several key characters and while brilliantly acted, I never fully understood who they were. If I watched the film over again I would probably understand who everyone was but in my opinion it took something away from the story. These characters were very interesting and each had a different perspective on who Mr. Kane was, I feel that if I could distinguish his account from his best friend I think this would have added more to the experience for me.Another aspect I really enjoyed about the movie was the acting. Although as previously mentioned sometimes it was hard to distinguish who was who, but the performances were still really good. Orson Welles did an amazing job as the rich powerful, but never happy newspaper tycoon, Charles Foster Kane. I really enjoyed seeing how Mr. Kane reacted to money and wealth and how as he gotten older he looked at the world differently. Also Dorothy Comingore who played Susan Alexander Kane had a wonderful performance that really showed the emotional toll of living with Mr. Kane. The way her character developed really highlighted how Mr. Kane changed throughout the film and really added something to the movie.The only other problem I had with the movie is in some parts the movie was slow. This was not a huge part of the movie but some scenes seemed to drag on a little to long.In Conclusion, Is it 'The greatest in cinema history' as some have said? I don't think so. With that being said is it possible that I just didn't appreciate the movie fully. Probably. I think it was well directed, acted, and had an interesting story. I will definitely want to watch the movie again and maybe after a second viewing I will understand its full brilliance. Util then, I think this is a great movie that definitely made cinema history at the time and has only been getting more respected as time goes on. I would definitely recommend you see this move and make your own conclusion."
fred_loeper,"Apr 30, 2021",7/10,Heresy! Heresy!Of course Citizen Kane is a great movie. It holds my interest up to the point where he must choose between his mistress or his family. After that it is depressing and boring...until the mystery of Rosebud is resolved.
AukeBriek,"Mar 8, 2013",9/10,"How to watch a movie like Citizen Kane? It's supposed to be the best film ever made according to the most prestigious poll in the world, for decades in a row, only recently being surpassed by Vertigo. It seems to me that there are potentially two major factors related to this fact, that might bias and distort our judgment of the film itself, our naked experience of it so to speak. The first one is the most obvious: either a fear of being excluded from the cinema in-crowd, or otherwise just being overwhelmed by all those respectable opinions of all those respectable critics who surely must know what they're talking about, or just plain unintelligent herd-mentality, might cause you to think that this film is much better than it actually is. There is also a less obvious possibility: the fact that this film is so highly revered might cause you to think that you are only bullied into thinking that it is so great, and that you start to think that the only way of preserving your authenticity is to denounce it or to greet it with a lukewarm response. Personally, I know I'm susceptible to both distortions, both based upon the a priori fact of 'Kane' being canonized as it is. A fact that, in these cases of distortion, will determine your opinion of the film, regardless of whether or not you have actually seen it. A fact that may very well blind you completely to ""die Sache selbst"". I think that a phenomenological reduction is in order here. A commitment to completely shut out the knowledge of Kane having the reputation that it has, while watching it. Only then are you perhaps able to actually see the film, let alone judge it. But this is no easy task. In fact it is an impossible task. Therefore, it would seem to follow that it is impossible to watch it. That may be true strictly speaking, but of course not all things are as black and white as the film itself. It is all a matter of degree and a matter of at least trying, or perhaps not of trying, but of letting go, much like 'trying' to sleep cannot be successful when it is literally a matter of trying. But if that is what you shouldn't do, then what should you do? I think that you should let yourself be immersed by the film, let it touch you if it gives itself to you and let it fail to touch you if it tries too hard, if it pulls on your heart like it were only a puppet on a string. All in all, it is your heart that provides you with the most reliable compass. That is not to say that your heart should be opposed to your mind and that if it would 'merely' blow your mind it wouldn't be good enough. Again, things aren't as black and white.But enough about all the preparations. To the film itself! Was I touched by the film? Yes I was. In fact at times I was touched deeply by it, more than I remembered from the last time. Especially by some of the scenes with Kane's wife in the opera house and the scenes in Xanadu, where the true nature of their relationship was revealed. But is Kane a manipulative film? Yes it is. I think that Orson Welles perhaps suffered from many of the same faults as Kane himself, like Leland said: ""You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you love 'em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. Something to be played your way, according to your rules."" Citizen Kane is a film that self-consciously wants to be loved. No, it demands to be loved, to be taken before anything else. Very, very hard work went into the making of it to ensure this. It avoids extremities and one-sidedness so as not to exclude any viewers. It includes beautiful and innovative shots in order to appeal to critics and formalist, but mostly not so obvious as to become elitist. It tries to be deep, profound and mysterious and takes itself dead-serious. There was one scene that didn't touch me as much this time, even if it did before, and that was the Rosebud scene at the beginning: it was so intensely self-serious that for a fraction of a second it went over the top for me and became almost comical, like a self-parody (and the fake mustache didn't really help there). But mostly the film is absolutely perfect in terms of editing, narrative and dramatic development, composition, cinematography and an undefinable feel of greatness and precision permeating almost every shot that can only be the product of extremely hard labor and loads of talent. There were also less than perfect qualities, such as the somewhat slower development of the middle part, the acting that varied from great to constructed, even from Welles himself. Also the atmosphere is strange: mostly the film smells like newspapers, money and power-grabbing. Of course that is what the film is about, but as an atmosphere that is normally not really a virtue. Still, this dry and somewhat suffocating atmosphere becomes part of the tragedy of the film, just like the fact that the film is just as manipulative as Citizen Kane himself, becomes part of that tragedy and actually deepens it. Just by not succeeding to create a beautiful atmosphere, the film tragically makes us wish to be released from it and makes us yearn for something lost. Just by the fact that it tries to manipulate us, tries to pull our strings too hard, and fails to touch our hearts because of it, the film becomes the very deadness and emptiness that sends chills down our spine, from the top of our heads, straight to our hearts. 10/10"
Foux_du_Fafa,"Jan 24, 2010",6/10,"""Citizen Kane"" is most certainly a landmark film over a variety of fields: cinematography, plot structure, acting, content and countless others that I can't recall as of now. It is certainly a visually spectacular film and its method of using a frame narrative to tell someone's life story is worthy of note/praise. Yet to be quite honest, I don't think that ""Citizen Kane"" otherwise really stands as a particularly intriguing film. Its pace is quite slow and too much of the film concerns itself on Kane's romances. I understand that it is worthy of respect, but I can't help but think that people are being a bit pretentious when labelling it as the GREATEST film of all time. As good as it may be, it certainly won't ever be in my Top 10."
paidinfull13,"Mar 31, 2018",1/10,"This movie was seen under my pledge to finish any movie I had started.
Otherwise I would not have finished it.
Back in 1941 when it was first released, perhaps people had not much else to watch...and so they were surprised by a mysterious film.
But we are now in 2018, and I can assure you, there is nothing entertaining in thei 2 hour movie.
Nevertheless, I am glad I saw it, so that I can judge the people who claim it is a masterpiece as people of little taste.....in my opinion. 
You have been warned."
miguelneto-74936,"Oct 6, 2016",8/10,"Citizen Kane is one of the most important films in cinema history, if it is not the most important, the script is amazing, the film has excellent dialogues, the acting is very good, the pace depends on the person who likes to film that has enough dialogues, will enjoy much more already who do not have patience, Citizen Kane not anger please, I liked the movie, the more I found the pace more or less time was tiring, plus the excellent script and good dialogues made me continue with the film, photography is good, the film is black and white, the soundtrack is good too, the costumes are great, and the film great time, Citizen Kane is very important to the movies film, and deserves to be seen for all lovers of the seventh art.

stablum,"Feb 6, 2006",10/10,"This is possibly the best motion picture ever made! It holds you outside and keeps you inside at the same time. Made in 1941, and without the greatest cast, this film is telling the story of a newspaperman before and after his death.Talking about the cast: The movies three main female parts, played by Dorothy Comingore, Agnes Moorehead and Ruth Warrick, all playing a Kane, are doing unforgettable roles, and I wonder why none of them became real stars after this fantastic performance. The story is classical without being boring or ""I've-seen-it-before-like"". You will soon forget that this is a b/w-picture! You will find the colors inside!"
daveisit,"Nov 11, 2000",6/10,"""Citizen Kane"". Great direction, Brilliant Script, Outstanding Acting, and Revolutionary camera angles. On technical merit it's a 10 out of 10.

moritzherz,"Apr 10, 2023",3/10,"Well, I expected a lot of Citizen Kane. 8.3 IMdB score, 100 percent on metacritic and in the Top 100 of IMdB. So then I watched ""The Masterpiece"" and what a surprise it was dissapointing as hell.I have been watching these ""classics"" for years now and have to admit that it's either a hit or a complete miss. The chance is 50 to 50 if you ask me.Citizen Kane is one of the bad ones for me, because I saw this a hundred times already in films of that era. Yes, the technical stuff may be great, but that alone cannot entertain me. The story was just boring, I eill likely forget, about it quickly.With this said, turn down your expectations for this movie or just don't watch it at all."
guy_anisimov,"Feb 8, 2007",9/10,"i don't think that there is Any other film that raises so many expectations as 'Citizen Kane' does.i watched it for the first and second time a couple of days ago and i really don't remember myself being full of so many expectations ever before watching any other film.of course there are new films coming out all the time where a favorite actor of yours is playing or a director directing etc' where you also have high expectations.this case is different, here it is a film that is considered to be one of the best if not the best film ever made,leaving the fact of it being so old that just makes it much easier for a first viewer to be disappointed.anyways, i loved it!almost everything about it.the start, the ending, the story - that is alone so amazing and truthful, its just as if its a real man's life we are seeing a film about.the characters and obviously their acting as well, Jedediah, Kane, Bernstein, all of them really unforgettable.it took me by surprise, thinking before watching it that its a almost 70 year old picture I'm about to see, what could i possibly see in it that i haven't seen before?well, it doesn't get much more original then this.the only reason i didn't rate it with an excellent 10 is that i kind of disliked Kane.in the start of the film you just adore his character but as you learn more and more about it you stop liking it.i surely understand the reasons for it, and how it is making the film realistic and Kane's story so similar to many other people's with their own minor lifts and major falls just like his.i didn't like many decisions Kane made and also in general i just couldn't relate to his character.besides that personal little problem i had, Citizen Kane is a flawless movie that shouldn't be missed by any movie fan, not even in a 100 years from now."
spire65,"Apr 6, 2005",10/10,"There is no doubt about it that Wells did groundbreaking stuff as far as how he filmed this movie, which adds support for many critics claiming this to be the best movie of all time. Both the story and acting are equally as enjoyable. So...why do so many people dislike Citizen Kane? Because there's no action and no killing. It's easy to see that many Americans want to see movies that are superficial with tons of action. These movies are certainly enjoyable to watch, but they're a dime a dozen. Many Americans also dislike black and white movies on the simple fact that they don't have color. (""Many"" doesn't indicate a majority, just a statistically significant amount.) The last ""drawback"" that Citizen Kane possesses is that it is already highly acclaimed. People hear so much about this movie that what they expect is a completely unattainable level of greatness, and many people already know the significance of rosebud prior to seeing this movie for the first time. However, despite these ""drawbacks"" Citizen Kane still manages to hit the top ten on IMDb. As other reviewers advise, watch this movie for what it is. Don't expect action, killing, explosions, or CG effects. Expect filming ingenuity, great acting, and a great story."
Quebec_Dragon,"Jul 30, 2009",9/10,"Why another review of Citizen Kane, a movie that made its mark in cinema history and is often regarded as the best film of all time? I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's to put my two cents in and to share what a 36-year old first time watcher but movie aficionado thinks about it. I was amazed it was made in 1941. It's in black and white but has modern original cinematography. It was revolutionary back then and I still regard it as original today. The plays of shadows and lights, who is lit up or not, and how, are not only beautiful but are evocative and serve storyline purposes. The transitions from scene to scene, backgrounds and foregrounds old and new fading out or in, are amazingly well done. Even today, you rarely see anything as artistic as this. The flashbacks and flash-forwards are very cleverly done (witness the diner table scene between Kane and his wife going from early twenties to middle age). The makeup in Kane is for the most part positively astounding and ages the characters better than most modern films. The camera angles are mostly unconventional, playing often with perspective for story purposes (notice Kane smaller in the background during bad moments or bigger than life when things go well). There are quite a few shots (Kane standing underneath a giant poster of himself for one) that are quite memorable and still powerful. I could go on but technically this movie is a marvel even today.Despite the unconventional story structure, you never get lost, although you might be temporarily confused, and it makes the whole storyline very engaging. It follows the trials and tribulations of a very rich and influential newspaper mogul from childhood to his death but not in chronological order. As a matter of fact, the film starts with the death of Kane, followed by a newsreel (like in old World War II screenings) recapping his whole life and then followed by an investigation into Rosebud, his mysterious last word. It's inspired by the life of real newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst who tried his very best to destroy this movie... literally. There are lots of creative liberties taken but if you study the background, you will notice the similarities. It's a great story extremely well told. You might not care about Kane but he's certainly a rich, complex and fascinating character. He's played by the director Orson Welles and he shows a wide range of emotions and acts differently according to age, not just in demeanor but physically. The other actors, most of them newcomers to cinema, are very fine although a few succumb, including Welles sometimes, to overacting just a tad (they were mostly theater actors which would explain the theatrics I suppose). On first viewing, I found the mistress of Kane particularly annoying and badly acted to the point of being grating but on second thought, I think she was supposed to be that way, a bit of a superficial simple floozy.Overall, I was impressed, despite high expectations, at how original, enjoyable and artistic Citizen Kane remains in 2009. It might not be one of my favorite films, nor would I consider it the best film of all time but I think it still appeals to modern sensibilities and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece. I highly recommend finding a copy of your own, preferably with the great commentary track by the famous critic Roger Ebert (Kane being his favorite film of all time) and with the illuminating documentary about the Battle of Citizen Kane showing the conflict between director/main actor Orson Welles and Kane's inspiration: Hearst, as well as their biographies.Rating: 9 out of 10 (not a 10 because I wasn't moved or awed as much as a few other select films)"
kcfireplug,"Dec 12, 2005",10/10,"What makes a great film? In my opinion it is the following:#1.Photography (most important because it IS a film. If it's shot badly, then your skrood.) NOTE: I consider the best filmmakers to be great cinematographers first, such as Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, Etc.#2. Directing/Editing (I lump the two together because the director really edits what is going on while it's being filmed, then finishes the process in the cutting room)#3. Acting (If we can't believe the people, we've lost it. But, bad acting can be corrected in the cutting room, and with multiple takes).#4. Sound and Music (If what we hear doesn't fit, the movie might as well be silent).Now, this is all well and good for a movie that tells a great story. Add to that a serious dose of style, ingenuity, and passion, all of which can be found in each frame of Citizen Kane.Citizen Kane isn't just a great movie with great characters, a great cast, great music from Bernard Herrmann or great photography. At the time of its creation it was like a cannon shot from the camp of RKO at the media moguls who were dominating the minds of people at the time.This message was not only important to the American public who had a right to objective journalism, but also because we were seeing the affects of divisiveness over the airwaves thanks to Hitler, and the power that comes from shaping the perceptions of the masses needed to be acknowledged from a semi-fictional standpoint, and Wells did it with so much energy and style you can't help but admire this work even 60+ years later. Citizen Kane shook the rafters of the media, and even though they played it down, everybody at the time was feeling the quake.Above all else, Citizen Kane tells the story of a man who is a victim of his own success, a story that can never be told enough.When you see Citizen Kane, you're not just watching a well made film, you're watching a piece of art, a piece of history, and a timeless story of how power corrupts.Absolutely."
Piper-10,"Feb 17, 1999",10/10,"Ease the tension. Give it a 10-rating. I'm not sure if I could pick any movie and claim it was the Best Movie of All Time. That's a great deal of pressure. So I ignore such a label, and I watch the film.""Citizen Kane"" is powerful, but it's so well constructed as to give you multiple impressions of Kane that it's hard to realize how emotionally charged this movie is. I love it for lines such as Kane's explanation of what he would've been if he hadn't have been rich: ""Everything you hate,"" he says. And I love the movie because of Welles's voice. You could look at this movie a hundred different ways, and the details would still remain to support you.It's perhaps one of the most intricately-constructed films I've ever seen, and the honesty in the film is magnificent. This movie does make me sad, because among other questions, it asks this: ""If you're remembered after you die for what you did, what you will it be?"" And, to me, that's a very sad question to want to ask. A feeling that there is no absolute understanding between people. That it's all skewed by our own personalities. That who you are depends on the paper you chose to read.How could anyone not think this movie is great? Best film of all time, whatever. The movie is brilliant, one way or another."
BigJimNoFool,"Dec 12, 2020",6/10,"Re-watched having just watched, and really enjoyed, MANK. This however still remains, for me, a film that i admire rather than love or even enjoy. It's just rather dull in performance, script and having a connection to any of the characters. Sure its directed with visual flair and there is some lovely shots and photography to be enjoyed.Overall i just didn't care enough about Charles Foster Kane to have an emotional attachment to the film and therefore as a drama it failed."
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Mar 11, 2006",10/10,"I recently watched the Oscars, and my mom also told me how it was one of the worst audiences, like it was the 2nd least watched Oscars of this history of the awards. We were talking about what could be the possible problems, in my opinion, the movies that are nominated, people really haven't either heard of or didn't enjoy that much. But in general, movies just don't have the same magic they used too.Watching Citizen Kane for the first time was a relief for me because I almost forgot that there were terrific movies out there. Citizen Kane is a brilliantly made political drama with terrific acting and excellent cinematography. I almost forgot how amazing the classics can be. I think my favorite part about this film is just how the people never figured out what Kane's last word was before he passed, ""Rosebud"", meant. I felt like some things should just be left in peace and you'll always have at least one piece of the puzzle missing.What a terrific and perfect movie that should be watched by all. To those who feel the same way about cinema recently, take a chance to watch one of the classics. I think that's the only way we can just get a good view on Hollywood once again.10/10"
Pelrad,"Apr 30, 2000",6/10,"Citizen Kane   **½ / 4This film is regarded by some as the greatest motion picture of all time. Most of these cite their one and only reason as its innovative and influential cinematography. This raises the question: is it just to use the latter as the sole criterion for stamping a film with the ""all time best"" label? A further question that may be raised: does a movie that is technically brilliant qualify as great without due regard given to its ability to entertain?Although the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and judging motion pictures is as subjective as it is objective and an art as much as an analysis, I'd like to identify several elements, which are universally considered to make a movie great: the enjoyment one is given by its plot, dialogue / script, musical score, depth of character, solid acting and directing, and cinematography.In my view, an all time best film must be outstanding in all of these; Citizen Kane was not. Its plot was overtly dull and unsophisticated: reporters review the boring life of an uninteresting man who rose to prosperity. Citizen Kane had no memorable dialogue whatsoever (compare it with ""Casablanca"" in this department); its script was nothing special. Its musical score was a far cry from the creative genius of someone like Ennio Morricone, Leonard Bernstein, or even John Williams. There was absolutely no depth of character in the film-none that appeared had any heart or appeal. Its acting was only satisfactory. Mind you, the actors did not have very difficult roles to play. Because of this, one could not direct praises towards the director who had an obviously unchallenging job. This leaves cinematography. Influential? Yes. Innovative? Yes. The greatest of all time? No. Even ""Touch of Evil"", another Orson Welles' classic (and much, much better than Citizen Kane), had far superior black and white photography and use of shadows.Does all of this mean that Citizen Kane was a bad film? No. Citizen Kane is an average film and, though overall boring, generally deserves a marginal ""thumbs up""."
Askvold,"Sep 20, 2003",1/10,"Let me start of by saying that I understand that this movie was important when it was released, and that it had great influence, and I respect it for that. I found it extremely dull though, I can't believe people claim this is the best movie ever made. It sure isn't. I would probably have fallen asleep if it had not been for the hope that it would come up with something of interest before ending. I might as well have fallen asleep though, cause not much happened. I watch a lot of movies, and I don't mind artsy or unsual ones, like El Topo, Breaking The Waves, Santa Sangre, Satyricon etc. Citizen Kane completly failed to interest me though, and even though it's far from the worst movie I have ever seen, I would not even dream of calling it the best."
Hitchcoc,"Mar 10, 2006",10/10,"Many say this is the greatest film of all time. I don't know. It's such a personal comment that I don't believe even a modest consensus can be reached. That said, there is no disputing that this is one of the most influential projects ever done. Having read some books about Orson Welles, I still don't understand, other than having as strong a personality as is possible, how he had the film knowledge and vision that went into this masterpiece, on his first try. There are hundreds of stunning shots. The camera and what it does is enough to carry the film. The editing take us from place to place in a heartbeat. the characters are pithy and interesting, especially Kane. Then there's the William Randolph Hearst thing that is going on in the background. We see power; we see power corrupting. We see love of self contrasted with love of others. We see the oppressive cloud of loneliness descend upon the powerful. Wealth versus happiness. Which is, of course, the overriding theme. If anyone doubts the effectiveness of black and white cinematography, just watch five minutes of this film. More can be done with a few shadows than a full palette of colors.I first saw this film in college. We had a new student union which had a nice little theater in it. I had heard of the film, but this was pre-rental, pre VCR, so if one were to see such a film, you had to simply wait. Even television tended to avoid this as too artsy. I sat at the screening. There were a couple of football players in the audience (I could tell by their jackets). I remember being mystified and confused and wanting to see the film again. It took about five years until it showed up on television and, even though there were about 60 commercials, I still enjoyed it. When I got my first VCR, it was the first movie I rented. What a trip. Anyway, as we left the theater, one of the football players said to the other, ""Well that was the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen."" This just reaffirmed that it was a great film.I'm sure that most average film-goers are not willing to put in the effort to get the most out of this film. That's their prerogative. I've often hated pretentious films that others have clucked their tongues about. If you look at my reviews of movies like ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" you will see I am not a film snob, but this is one great movie and I hope everyone gets to see it before they go down that last hill in that little red sled."

hbdave_77,"Nov 13, 2008",10/10,"Few films in the history of cinema have received as much analysis & acclaim as 'Citizen Kane'. This is most admired film of all times & considered by many thinking men as a best piece of cinema by legendary actor, film maker Orson Welles. It is debut film of Orson Welles as a Director.America's largest & most powerful landlord of Xanadu & Newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Cane died with the last uttered word 'Rosebud' in the very initial scene. Next we see News clips & documentary featuring the power & riches story of his biography including his rise & fall of empire covered by every news agency of the world. Now the million dollar question for the reporters is who or what this last spoken word 'Rosebud' supposed to mean. The flashbacks of Cane's life unfold by the other characters reveals the life story of social & personal ups & down of his life & its really sentimental & realistic portrayal I have ever seen. Welles has told the story of a man increasingly captive of his own needs. Even as the suspense about ""Rosebud"" unfolds in the last scene to the audience, it still remains enigma to figure out what it is. Orson Welles has done remarkable work here in acting & direction & production at the age of 25 & its simply his inborn talent. Its character not only the character of lifetime for him but for the world of cinema to cherish forever. The movie's technical brilliance lies in its landmark B&W cinematography by George Toland with apt use of light & shadow & deep focus photography. One can also notice the powerful lines of dialogues & speech uttered by Cane throughout the film. Most of the principal actors in 'Citizen Cane' were new to the motion picture & yet everyone performed extraordinary especially Joseph Cotten as Jad. The movie is regarded as the ""world's best film by Sight & Sound magazine in the last 40 years (1962-2002). It is quite sad to know that it was flop at box office but gradually became admirable classic as time passed. Nominated for 9 awards at 1942 Academy awards it only won one: Best Original Screenplay.A Pure Gold.Ratings- 10/10"
SocallyKid,"Nov 21, 2009",10/10,"The comment that began: It's a difficult undertaking for someone of my generation to watch a film like CITIZEN KANE. That statement could be made by anyone for the last 30-40 years. I came to it the exact same way, aware of its reputation. But I saw it at a revival theatre 37 years ago. I was 18 when the Godfather and Cabaret were Oscar noms. CK was a box office flop, the rep grew 15-20 years later by the French critics of the early 60s- THEY could have said the same thing: ""It's a difficult undertaking for someone of my generation to watch a film like CITIZEN KANE."" Instead as an older citizen I see more of a dismissive attitude twd b/w films by 'today's generation' which has little to do with the greatness of CK itself. Alas there is nothing more self limiting than being modern."
elvircorhodzic,"Jun 2, 2016",10/10,"The fascinating mystery drama, the most ambitious and boldest debut film, with time he got labeled as one of the best and most innovative. I will not engage in, nor even parody comparisons. I am only interested in the ""rosebud"". The relentless pursuit of power, empathy and proving are not the essence. Things that no one pays attention are the essence. CITIZEN KANE is a dramatic and narrative masterpiece. The work in which all details of biographical mosaic of one man. A man who is after all a ""big"" except in being true to himself. The man can not be explained in one word, but to man one word can mean almost anything.The press magnate's only means of stories through which the director demonstrates extremely fresh, innovative and secure access, skillfully guiding the story and the actors, playing with light and shadow, deep personnel and other plans, and creating a whole that attracts maturity. I am delighted by the fact that each average viewer of the film can compose and reconstruct the story of the main character as he wants. The man and the emergence in society. Not many people will find some sort of fund, mainly to raising story to a multitude of disagreements, search and conflict. Man until deep talk with himself will not be able to talk to the world.Although Kane is incredibly rich and powerful, failing to take advantage of this wealth and power in order to win the election for governor, to promote his second wife as an opera star, or have the love and loyalty of those who surround him. At the end is shown as a lonely old man, imprisoned in his castle, ornate palace which was built to satisfy his ego. His precious things can not replace the emotional loss to the in your life.The acting is pretty good. I think that . Joseph Cotten (Jedediah Leland), garnered the sympathy of the majority.Kane is people generally was good fun. Loneliness, visible at the end of the film fulfills the main character throughout his life."
jvincent1,"Jun 24, 2007",10/10,"Is Citizen Kane a masterpiece? The results of the British Film Institute 2002 poll of major directors and critics found Kane to be rated the best film of all time, and Orson Welles the greatest director. Do the intelligentsia of film have the exclusive right to determine which film is or is not a masterpiece? Certainly not. However, the use of the term ""masterpiece"" is being thrown around so casually today as to render the word virtually meaningless. If you look at IMDb's user rating, you would find Citizen Kane ranked #23 and The Shawshank Redemption #2. This is a rating by us common folk, not people who have studied film or make their living from movies. Does this give rise to the contention that The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece also? One may argue the point, and if you read through the user comments, many, many people use the term to describe that movie. I'm sure if you read through the user comments for, say, Pulp Fiction, that ol' word ""masterpiece"" will be there again and again. Check out Forrest Gump. I haven't, but my money says you see that ""m"" word quite a few times there also. After all, it DID win six Academy Awards. If all these movies are considered masterpieces by enough people, does that make it so? I really don't know. I do have my opinion and the privilege to state it, everyone else like it or not. You may disagree with my view, but you shouldn't absorb it and react personally. A masterpiece in film is no different from any other art form. Painting, music, sculpture, literature; some works are great; others mediocre. Greatness must stand the test of time. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen that Dali, listened to Wagner, or read Shaw's play. Each time is the first time. There's a wondrous quality there which fascinates always. A sense of immortality. So, is The Shawshank Redemption a masterpiece on the same level as Citizen Kane? Not even close. Kane meets my criteria as do many others. In fact, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not even Welles' best movie, so I must think highly of him as a filmmaker. Kubrick, Bunuel, Wilder, Ford, Fellini, Fassbinder, Lang, Ozu, Truffaut, Kurasawa, Hitchcock, Altman, maybe Goddard, maybe Herzog, look out for Tarr, Visconti, the list of great films by great filmmakers is long enough, but not so long that every GOOD film we see is a masterpiece. Let's collar that word and hold it in a safe place before it becomes completely superfluous. I'm sure Welles would approve."
Innsaane,"Jul 30, 1998",N/A,"Citizen Kane is the perfect film.  The story is so detailed, yet told magnificently in just two hours.  The meaning of the word Rosebud is something that makes you think about your own life, and what the meaning of love means to you.  Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is a nasty, greedy old man who wants nothing in this world but to please himself.  The fact that he can't love anyone is a wonderful touch to the already wonderfully filmed movie.  I've seen this movie four times on video, and I'll see it again and again.   ****"
Writer228,"Nov 6, 2005",7/10,"""Citizen Kane,"" released in 1941, was ahead of its time in cinematography. Many long cuts, showing action in real time, fill the film. The few short cuts are taken mainly to emphasize dialogue. This story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane is based loosely on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who fought the release of this film into theaters.The story is not told in chronological order. The first impression we get in this film is of a run down mansion, inhabited by a dying old man, whose last word in life was ""rosebud."" The quest of the film is to discover the meaning of this word.""March of the News,"" a satire of the theater weekly ""Time Marches On"" newsreel, is footage of Kane documenting his lifetime, and gets the audience inside the life of this powerful, yet uncaring man. The story of his life is told through a series of flashbacks, some spanning many years through one dissolve. Kane collects statues, paintings, animals in a zoo, and a vast area for his home and castle in Florida known as Xanadu, based on the ""castle"" of William Randolph Hearst, who did his best to destroy the film before it was shown to the public. Charles Foster Kane is a montage of several real-life characters, Hearst among them.As a boy, Kane is removed from his mother's home because she has come into money, and wishes for the boy to be well cared for. In addition, the father is excited about receiving $50,000 each year during the boy's absence. The mother, played by a young Agnes Morehead of ""Bewitched"" fame, is solid, stoic and almost unfeeling at the loss of her child. Similarly, Kane does not visit his parents during the film, referring only to his mother's passing, and possessions he ought to go through.The shot of a portrait of the newsmen of ""The Chronicle"" dissolves into a shot of his new ""Inquirer"" staff. Kane paid these reporters well to come to work for him. One senses Kane has no scruples, despite the fact he gets his way by being charming. During an office celebration, Kane dances charmingly with chorus girls, his dancing reflected in an elaborate shot with his image reflected in the mirror as his friends Mr. Bernstein and Jedidiah talk of him as a great and famous man, and all sing an original some about Charle Kane.Kane announces his engagement, and consequent marriage to the niece of the President of the United States, Emily. He wants not only to fit in with the elite, but to have high society to bend to his whims. His is not a happy marriage, shown in a series of montage cuts over the breakfast table. His wife eventually leaves Kane and takes their son because Kane doesn't spend time with them, or understand and empathize with family feelings.He treats his wives like another of his many possessions, telling the women what they are, what they will think, and what they will do. His second wife pursues a career in opera, which is a mistake because she has no talent. Her misery falls back on him, but he pushes her to continue.Kane has political aspirations which burst like a bubble once his extramarital affair with the second woman is made public, and his first wife divorces him. The grandiosity in which Kane presents himself is actually very shallow, his work for his fellow man's benefit appears only in his early life. As an old man he is callous and uncaring of anything that doesn't have directly to do with him. ""All he ever wanted was love,"" recollects Jedidiah as an old man.We learn of the meeting of Kane and his second wife on a street corner, as she leaves the drugstore with toothache medicine, and he has just been splashed with mud by a passing horse and buggy. Thety retire to her boarding house room, and his attempt at first seduction is quelled by her keeping the door open. Their relationship shown on screen is harmless, but the audience knows that more comes to pass between them. Kane loves Susan because she loves him, without realizing he is a wealthy powerful newspaper man. But, the more she knows him, the less she likes him.Kane pursues the governorship of the state, expressing his concern for the ""working man."" His dreams for the Presidency of the United States die, but out of his grasp because his affair is exposed. ""A toast to love on my terms. That's the only terms that anyone really knows,"" says Kane when defeated at the hands of his precious working class, now represented by organized labor.Kane is a man of wealth and power, and builds an opera house in Chicago for his wife to sing in. As well, his newspapers across the country give her rave reviews. Only his friend, and arts editor prints a scathing review which Kane finishes as the man, Jedidiah Leland, his friend from college days passes out from drinking before he finishes the review of her performance. ""Some kind of friend he is,"" shrikes his lame songstress, now wife.Despite a palace of 49,000 acres of scenery and statues, and the still being built compound/castle of Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane, and he erupts into a violent temper explosion in which he destroys Susan's room. Kane lives his final years alone, in what Leland refers to as his coliseum.As a group of reporters and photographers survey more possessions than can be counted, the audience sees Kane's sled, burning in an incinerator. Can one word really sum up the wishes of one's life?"
Sportzcars89,"Jun 3, 2005",10/10,"Orson Welles' 1941 masterpiece, ""Citizen Kane"" is widely hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made, and AFI placed it atop their 100 MOVIES list. Don't get me wrong, this is not a mega-Hollywood blockbuster. There are no explosions, the movie is sixty-four yrs. old, and it is in black and white. Some people will stop reading this here, but I would seriously advise anyone who has not seen this classic story of power, life, love, loss, and death to rent or buy it immediately. The B&W cinematography, and the nostalgic, almost haunting feel to the lighting and the ""deep focus"" camera-work draws you in to the outstanding visuals. The visuals! From the opening shots of Kane's storybook like castle (no reavealing anything about that here!) to the crane shots over the bar in the rain, the movie is a stimulating and detailed picture to watch. Not only that, but the story is rich and detailed, and structured beautifully, with Orson Welles playing the title role as a recently deceased newspaper tycoon, a la William Randolph Hearst. A powerful and both loved and hated public figure, a young reporter is sent with the task of finding the meaning of his last words, and in turn takes a journey through flashbacks and meetings with various people connected with the gigantic tyrant. You leave the story as confused and as haunted as you come in, but it doesn't matter. The acting, visuals, and timeless story draws you in and leaves you with a film classic that is not easily forgotten. Highly influential and an American classic, ""Citizen Kane"" is an outstanding drama any real movie buff will appreciate."
son_of_cheese_messiah,"May 8, 2011",7/10,"One scene sums this film up for me. Welles, as Kane, walks to a window which appears to be of normal size. As he approaches it, we see it is enormous and 6 feet off the ground. He then walks to the foreground again, and once more the window looks normal.This seems to say ""Look how clever I am, to do this"". This cleverness pursued for its own sake is the hallmark of Welles in general and Citizen Kane in particular. As Welles himself said in the film which provides the other bookend to his career, F For Fake: ""I am a charlatan"".This is not to say that Kane is not a good film, merely that its constant gimmickry detracts from it. It has as many special effects as a modern day science fiction film and Welles, being the infant terrible he was at the time, has an endless need to put in as many trick shots as possible even if they seriously overbalanced the rather slight storyline. Never do a simple shot when you can have a camera crane in, then dissolve, then have a piece of furniture open up and so on. All this has made the film beloved among cinephiles and uncriticisable among anyone else.But is the story any good? Does the pacing and narrative hold up? The answer is just about yes, although the story is not as good as it thinks it is."
bobspencerhire,"Jul 18, 2021",1/10,"This will be the ONLY way you will be able to appreciate this waste of 2 hours. I have tried SO MANY TIMES to sit and finish this movie, I AM a fan of Wells, I AM a fan of movies, but to be entertained. Not to play ""find the Easter eggs of cool things they did before their time"". Dark is DARK. BORING is BORING. CK=DARK & BORING. Don't forget getting yelled at for 15 minutes by the world's WORST ""movie tone news reel"" announcer. How boring must life have been if they cared for ONE SECOND what he meant when he said ""rosebud"" ugh!"
maxastree,"Oct 15, 2015",10/10,"Citizen Kane is a great movie, a first of its kind to include a novelistic character arc, depth, scope and technical innovations that hadn't been so successfully directed previously, although given that hundreds of thousands of films were produced throughout the 20th Century, the claim that Kane is the ""greatest movie of all time"" is just glowing hyperbole.But is the film really good? Yep. Follows the story of an impoverished child that lucks out with a land deed that makes him a super-wealthy industrialist (a plutocrat, really) and owner of multiple newspapers, he's a media tycoon and philanthropist who's designs for nationwide (global?) power and influence are bought down by the sensationalistic media and personality politics that he himself had made a lions share of his fortune from.The acting is strong, every scene and sentence either moves the plot forward or develops character - if only Hollywood movies these days could follow these two concepts without digressing into pointless CGI ""franchise"" movies that infantalize their audience and dazzle them with computer rendered frames that the brain unconsciously recognizes as fake anyway, but besides all that, Kane is a movie about a seemingly real man, and an era: the American century.I don't subscribe to the notion of American exceptionalism, and am not actually American at all (even if I did live there, I wouldn't consider myself) but the film is really about the birth of a culturally, and economically new power apart from ""the old country"", with new values, new leaders and new forms of equality and mass media. The film also explores the inherent contradictions and hypocrisies of the new ruling class of the 20th century; Kane goes from being a genuinely useful idealist, to being an obscenely wealthy fool, trying to dignify the lot of the working class (his own social roots) by pushing a music retail clerk and mediocre stage singer to the level of stardom through his own great wealth and media influence. You can see parallels to today's society in every sequence of Citizen Kane, and its worth seeing more than once."
halodude-91048,"May 14, 2015",N/A,"What can I say about Citizen Kane that has already been said by so many? Despite my ten star rating, I don't personally see it as my favorite film or the best film of all time (not that ten stars implies that). Before having seen it, I purchased the 70th anniversary edition because I knew that I would enjoy it (which I did). It is a pioneer in film and one of the greatest story lines and characters ever captured in cinema history. It has gone down as one of the greats for good reason. It is well written, acted, directed, filmed, and deserving of more Oscars than it won. It's two hour run time suits it perfectly, and unless you're an action film crazed personality, you'll most likely find yourself very intrigued. Great film."
robsha,"Jan 20, 2005",7/10,It would be difficult at best to contribute any insight in what might be the most analyzed movie of all time. So I think I'd like to just give my initial impressions of this film after seeing it for the first time in over a decade. This is a hauntingly powerful work. This is a film that many will relate to and revisit mentally. The strength of the film lies in the writing. The unique way in which the story is revealed and the smart believable dialog. The technical aspects are also unique and the use of light is superb. It's one of the best and certainly one of the first. Some of these images will sear themselves through your eyes into your brain. Orson shows his story telling and visionary talent in this piece. He was well beyond his time which is why his peers booed this film multiple times during the academy awards. It's looks as though Orsen had the last laugh as this one time art house film becomes one of the films against which all others are measured.
Imaginist,"Feb 18, 2006",10/10,"""Citizen Kane"" has often been called the greatest film in cinematic history, and with good reason: it is a stroke of genius on the part of Orson Welles. He was only 25 when he directed this film, and yet he pioneered some of the most amazing cinematography and production techniques of his day or any other. At a first glance, ""Kane"" is a rather simple story: a young boy, Charles Foster Kane (played wonderfully by Orson Welles) inherits a large fortune and winds up dying alone and unhappy--his last words being the infamous ""rosebud."" Although it seems like a rather cut and dry endeavor, it is so much more than that, mainly because the film is done in flashbacks.We begin with Kane's death and then move backwards and forwards through his life, in an attempt to find out what ""rosebud"" means. This is brilliant editing on Welles part; he takes a simple story and creates a complex mesh. Through these many flashbacks we slowly but surely begin to learn of Kane and those around him, and this creates quite the portrait. Welles almost always shoots Kane and other strong characters from a low angle, making them appear lager than life--this especially aids in the character development of Kane. Before this film, using camera angles in such a way was scarcely heard of, but here we see a new technique:Welles shows us that angles can do more than just make a movie look""pretty.""Another fascinating technique Welles employs for character development is set design. Whenever Kane is present, it seems that the ceilings are lower, for examples one should look at Kane's publishing house, and some of the rooms in his mansion. This further demonstrates Kane's massive size and power, and at the same time higher ceilings are used when more inferior characters are used. For example, a newspaper reporter interested in solving the mystery of rosebud, is first shown in a great hall looking at some old records and memoirs belonging to Kane's old guardian, Mr. Thatcher. Because of this we recognize that this reporter is not important, but rather only secondary. Also, Kane's second wife is often sitting in the largest rooms the Kane mansion, which makes her look rather small.However, the best example of how Welles uses set pieces to enforce Kane's power is when he is running for governor. Here, Kane makes a speech to a very large crowd, and behind him is a mammoth picture of himself. Of course, what is also amazing about this scene is that Welles discovers a new technique called deep focus: he is able to simultaneously keep the large picture and Kane in focus, giving the illusion of depth. After this speech Kane is all set to win the governor's race, but through a twist of some dirty politics, he looses, and soon after, his first wife leaves him. Of course, to anyone paying attention this comes as no surprise--we know there has been distance between Kane and his wife for quite some time. However, we do not receive this information through dialog but rather through Welles brilliance use of subtlety. Welles shows us several scenes of the couple sitting together and having breakfast. Each breakfast encounter comes and goes with great speed leading into a dissolve which then takes us to another breakfast meal. We see the couple slightly bickering, but the way Welles shoots the scene it looks as though they are still eating breakfast right next to each other, which does not usually indicate tension. However, the last frame of this breakfast montage shows a wide shot of the couple, and we see them sitting at a much bigger table then they were first sitting at, and they are also sitting directly opposed to each other. This part of the film tells us a wealth of information, and all because of a set piece (a table), the clever use of editing, and the camera placement. No other film maker before or since this movie has used these technical aspects to flesh out so many details, not only about the characters, but about the story.The amazing thing about Welles is how much information he is able to convey using subtlety and some simple yet poignant dialogs. Welles does not hit the viewer in the face with his film like so many movies in this day and age (i.e. anything done by Michael Bay), but instead he opts for letting the audience come to their own conclusions. And when I had mulled over this film, the conclusion I came to was rather depressing: Charles Foster Kane had all the money and power in the world but this could not buy him love, and like most of us, he never comes to realize that simple fact, which in the end left him bitter and lonely. Thinking about all of this was rather heart wrenching, but what really drove it home was when I came to discover the meaning of ""rosebud"": it was one of Kane's childhood toys. That to me is most upsetting of all: the only time Kane was ever truly happy was when he was a child--when he was free from his wealth.Kane could have said or thought of anything in the world on his deathbed, but instead he chose to reflect on his short-lived childhood. Now if that doesn't get you misty eyed, not much else will. I recommend ""Citizen Kane"" to any mature person looking for a deep and intricate film, in which there is much more than there first appears. However, it is probably wise to watch the movie twice, in order to discover all the little and large things Orson Welles so masterfully paints on his canvas of celluloid. All and all I give ""Citizen Kane"": 5 out of 5 stars.Copyright 2006 Imaginist"

bigfoot127,"Jul 11, 2007",1/10,"I was reading the list of the top movies one evening on the AFI, and I saw this movie was #1 American Film. So I decided I would rent it and I saw it today. I was expecting to be blown away and this would be the best movie I would ever see. Well was I in for a surprise.This movie is by far one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. The worst would have to be Zigfield Follies but this comes pretty close. I do like and enjoy classic films. I don't care if a movie is in B&W either. But this movie is just dated, and I don't see what the hype is about. This movie is just 100% overrated. I am someone who can sit through movies but this one I got bored of.I thought maybe it was because I got interrupted in the beginning of the film, and maybe it would get better later on. Well it just kept dragging. So I got to basically the last 36min of the film and had to just turn it off. So a few hours later I figured I would try to watch it again, but I couldn't even watch 5min. I just went to the last 10min of the movie and was disappointed.All I can say is watch this movie at your own risk, and I hope you enjoy it more then me. Seeing the reviews on here I feel good I am not the only person who didn't enjoy it."
joshuafagan-64214,"Feb 3, 2016",10/10,"Like most anyone who has watched this movie over the last fifty years or so, I was introduced to it by a great number of people proclaiming it to be the greatest movie of all time. So at the age of fourteen, I got it from the library, popped it in, and had my understanding of film changed forever.I do not consider this the greatest movie of all time. But it is the most important movie of all time. It is arguable that film should be divided into two eras: the pre-Citizen Kane era and the post-Citizen Kane era. There are enough revolutionary techniques and ideas to make a film lover's head spin. But one thing a lot of people overlook is just how good this movie is on its own right.The best way I can describe it is a film version of an acclaimed twenty-century novel. There is sharp symbolism, highly developed characters, a somber mood, and nuanced discussions about broken dreams and the human condition.If you're a fan of those types of stories, you will enjoy Citizen Kane. If you're not, you may not, but do yourself a favor and watch it anyway. Just like every literate adult should have already read The Great Gatsby and Of Mice and Men, every filmwatching should have already seen this movie. If you have not, I suggest you take care of that.Me? I adore The Great Gatsby, like Of Mice and Men, and will watch this film over and over again. It concerns a reporter trying to track down the meaning of the last word of the famous media Tycoon Charles Foster Kane. Along the way, he talks to various people who knew Kane and gets many different sides of the story. He ends up not finding out the meaning of that last word, but we, the viewers, do.Now, I'm not gonna spoil what Rosebud is- this despite the fact that it has basically become shorthand for 'spoiled twist'- but I will say that it fits with the themes of the movie quite nicely. This is the right way to do a twist. One thing many directors and screenwriters forget is that twists are not merely supposed to be shocking; they are supposed to add to the story in a fundamental way. Most good stories I've seen get this. All bad stories I've heard do not. It is a fundamental and simple concept, so I have to wonder how so many directors and screenwriters miss it.Speaking of directors and screenwriters, for this film, they are one in the same. Mr. Orson Welles fills both roles and acts in the titular role, pulling off the most astounding triple play in movie history. Any triple play is incredible in this industry, but doing it in one of the greatest films of all time: that's impressive.There is a scene midway through the film where Kane walks through a hall of mirrors. It stuck in my mind, and it sticks in the minds of almost everyone who watches this movie. I cannot think of a better example of the power of visual storytelling. An amateur filmmaker would have just had Kane ramble off his emotions. But Welles, taking advantage of his medium, crafted one of the most haunting and memorable scenes in cinematic history. If you have a friend who won't shut up about how books are better than movies, show them this film and point out this scene.One thing that surprises many inexperienced filmwatchers is how this film only won one Oscar. Yes, a film said by many to be the greatest of all time only received the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Best Director? How Green Was My Valley. Best Cinematography? How Green Was My Valley. Best Art Direction? How Green Was My Valley. Best Picture? How Green Was My Valley.Now, How Green Was My Valley is not a bad film. I suggest you watch it if you have nothing better to do. But it's no Citizen Kane. I doubt many of you have heard of it.Oddly enough, this was not simply a case of poor decision making, though you could find much of that if you look in the annals of past Oscars. Media mogul William Randolph Hearst believed this film to be about him in all but name (very arguable) and said it was a negative portrayal (eh) that misrepresented him (definitely not). He could not get all copies of the movie destroyed or anything like that, but he did fight it at every turn, and he is likely the main reason why the film did not get more Oscars.Ironically enough, William Randolph Hearst's name is one that has somewhat been eroded by the passage of time. The only thing many people in my generation know about him is that he likely inspired this movie. So it turns out that the film he fought against ended up giving him a form of immortality.Kane is one of the most complicated characters in all of film, and more importantly, all his complexities mean something. Nothing feels like it's there just to make the character more complex. The result is a brilliantly textured story, one that can be loved even by people who aren't typically into this type of arc.This film does not only feel revolutionary, it feels alive. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it is the first film to feel truly, cinematically alive. There were great films made before it; among them are Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz and King Kong. But those films were merely sweeping, brilliant stories put on film. This is a unique, cinematic experience."
bryden2000,"Jan 10, 2015",10/10,"When I think of perfect films I think of godfather, vertigo, psycho, Schneider's list etc. but comparing those films to citizen Kane is a crime. I watched this film when I was 13 and was bored to death, throughout the entire film I was wondering what all the hype was about, then I was wondering what rosebud meant, it was listed #1 on rotten tomatoes and I was confused, was it something I missed? I watched Steven spiel bergs masterpiece black and white film Schneider's list and I was mesmerized, I sat down and rematches the film for a second time, and liked it so much I watched it a third, almost a year later I have seen it almost 10 times. Why is Orion Welles considered one of the greatest directors in the world? I don't know either, but all I know is if anyone made Kane as their debut film today, they would within the likes of Charles Chaplin, Nolan, Spielberg, Hitchcock, Scorsese, Clint Eastwood even woody Allen. This film is my favorite movie ever made, and although Welles never made a movie this good again, he made this classic and for that I'm grateful."
stumpmee77,"Jun 20, 2009",10/10,"This is my favorite film. Biblical flicks are in a category all its own.It's screenplay uses elements from every movie genre except sci-fi as its reaching beyond imagination. But in terms of imagery it takes a little bit of everything. The beginning plays as an early Hollywood horror story; darkness, fog; the later Hitchcock film Psycho brings to mind Kane's castle ""Xandu"" it's featureless house, other than its dark shape, looming in the moonlight. Don't touch it's cinematography; it'd be akin to making Gone With the Wind black and white.The ending left me a pleasant mishmash of emotions. It's a deliciously fragmented piece the outer manifestation of the story telling, Susan's obsession with puzzles and the gradual corruption of Kane's personality is pieced together by those he came in contact with. Neither are finished--but that's the the aspect of this masterpiece that sets it apart; Welles keeps his characters unperceptive of what made him tick. In his divulging the film's nagging question, Welles concludes its ending opposite of the style he had employed throughout--successfully drawing the ""Rosebud"" mystery away from the compilation of putting together by the characters then waving the answer in front his face--It's impact upon me was a jumble, none of it ""lame"": bowled over how the answer had indeed been provided albeit fleeting much earlier. It's a touch of sadness; for the reporter's quest remaining unsolved and those in contact with Kane never understood him. He was an enigma.Between creepy beginning and mind-blowing ending, poignant, touches of comedy, those in Kane's life (especially promoting his ""singing"" second wife) and the title character's slide; from champion of the people to absorption of his infallibility.Concerned over repeating myself and not describing it to the digress I want without spoiling it, I'm closing it by recommending While watching it (and please watch it; it'd be worth one's while) Keep those reminiscing about Kane as separate puzzle pieces while watching."
jackhall-17335,"Nov 28, 2015",10/10,Citizen Kane is a beautiful film that reveals new treasures each time you watch it. The first time I watched it I didn't care much for the film or the characters but after about 10-15 viewings it's gotten to the point that the last 40 minutes have me on the verge of tears. The reason is that each time I watch it I learn more about the character and it becomes such a tragedy as you watch. The camera work in the film is so beautiful and based on the other films I've seen from before this film came out it seems that this was the first movie to make the camera itself a character. However no character in film history is more interesting than Kane. Every word he says seems to be a contradiction or spite until you realize that the whole time Kane was simply a puppet trying to grab hold of his own strings destroying himself in the process.
vkarabill,"Aug 11, 2022",7/10,Citizen Kane has perfect cinematography and good acting from Orson Welles but the story is a little bit poor on my opinion . Great movies but no the greatest movie of all time.
loza-1,"May 24, 2005",1/10,"All the pseuds say it; all the polls of the ""greatest films ever made"" say it: this is the greatest film ever made. Orson Welles, in between mouthfuls, shows his genius once again.But things are never quite what they seem.Take all that brouhaha about ""The War of the Worlds."" All those people thinking that the Martians had really landed. Or did they? I have heard this play twice, and I have to say that I cannot see anybody being taken in by a radio play that is not particularly good. Indeed when you dig up the contemporary newspapers, you can see a distinct absence of named people; and the articles smack of having been written before the broadcast even went out. At the time, the Mercury Theatre was being threatened with the termination of their radio series: they were that bad! What better to keep them on the air than the biggest load of hype in entertainment history. It is reckoned by some historians that not a single person headed for the hills as a result of this radio programme.But surely Orson Welles answered his critics in ""Citizen Kane."" Didn't he?Well if taking the story of Hearst, blackening the reputation of Marion Davies, and pinching unusual camera angles from other directors, like Michael Curtiz, is genius, then Orson Welles is a genius and ""Citizen Kane"" is indeed the greatest film ever known.It just goes to show that if people go around shilling Orson Welles as a genius, the pseuds will be stupid enough to believe it.But don't take my word for it. See The Adventures of Robin Hood, which predates Citizen Kane. There you will see all the unusual angles you will wish to see. Curtiz even has a couple of shots taken from the fireplace, the difference between Kane and Robin Hood is that in Robin Hood, the fire is lit. Also in Robin Hood you will see moving camera shots a-plenty, especially in the opening scene in the great hall at Nottingham Castle, which means that the often repeated statement that Orson Welles invented moving camera shots in Citizen Kane is utter drivel. I will repeat it just in case the pseuds miss it yet again: Citizen Kane is NOT the first film to use moving camera shots and Orson Welles did NOT invent this technique.If you want to call Michael Curtiz a genius, I have no problem with that. He certainly has more right to that appellation than has Orson Welles.But I can be wrong. And I have been proved wrong. I once said to a friend of mine: ""Is it just me, or is Citizen Kane the most overrated film ever made?""He replied: ""You are wrong. Citizen Kane is a great film. whenever it is shown on television, I never sleep better.""As someone who has fallen asleep in front of Citizen Kane myself, I just had to admit that I was wrong.And all those people who stayed at home instead of going to the cinema, making Citizen Kane a box-office flop. They were wrong, too.Or were they?"

chrisart7,"Jul 15, 2009",10/10,"A friend once remarked that ""Casablanca"" is a much 'warmer' film than ""Citizen Kane."" Upon rewatching 'Kane', I found that is not quite the case. It starts out rather ominously, intentionally so, but once Charles Foster Kane's early adulthood is portrayed there is much humour abounding, both subtle and slapstick, until his (first) marriage begins to cool (as a decade is depicted in a memorable montage sequence over a long dinner table). Thereafter the film's noir shadows complement a descent into a very unpleasant downward spiral until the finale (obviously inspired by ""Rebecca"", produced by David O. Selznick and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, only a year earlier; some of that film's opulent interiors are also mirrored in Kane's extravagant settings). Welles must have realised the picture was plummeting into such dark, glamourless territory as to leave the moviegoers with a 'negative' experience that he tacked on an introduction to the Mercury Theatre players at the end of ""Citizen Kane"", backed by a jolly tune utilised in one of the earlier sequences.Not all of the music is by Bernard Herrmann, as is commonly believed. Two musical segments in the ""News on the March"" sequence were appropriated from the 1939 ""Gunga Din"" film which was scored by Alfred Newman. The first, a pastorale snippet accompanying a quote about Xanadu from Coleridge's (unfinished) poem ""Kubla Khan"", then the trenchant strains while Kane meets with infamous world leaders like Hitler and Mussolini. The first appears in the ""Gunga Din"" scene where Sgt. Cutter (Cary Grant), atop an Indian elephant, halts just before a chasm spanned by a wooden bridge. The second appears in ""Din"" during a scene where the Thuggee cult leader (Eduardo Ciannelli) rants about prior despots, saying, ""Surely Napoleon was the maddest of them all!""None of Welles' later films comes close to ""Citizen Kane"" which only affirms that this was not a one-man show. A long list of superb collaborators only heightened the quality of this landmark motion picture."
SpelingError,"May 31, 2015",9/10,"It is not hard to see why this is considered to be one of cinema's greatest movies ever made as this movie hits every element perfectly.After a wealthy newspaper tycoon dies, journalists scramble to find out the meaning of his last word ""Rosebud"". Then we see the history of his life and everything he encountered throughout it.The acting is magnificent. Especially coming from Orson Welles who in my opinion gave one of the best performances ever put on screen. But every other actor offers something great to the movie and not a single one of the main actors did a weak job acting. They all gave strong performances.Wells direction is terrific and he is able to use basic elements to craft something truly brilliant with this picture. His work behind the camera is immaculate and it brings the viewer into a truly special experience.This movie is engaging from the very first scene. Some people may not like the talk heavy dialogue but if you like slow paced movies (which I usually do) then it shouldn't bother you.This movie has stood the test of time. It has aged well and it shows no sign of losing popularity. Is it one of my favorite movies of all time? No, but the reason it gets a 10/10 is because of its impact on cinema and how much it contributed to it. The only American film which comes close to topping this masterpiece is ""The Godfather""."
nolan-key,"Nov 18, 2013",10/10,"Even if this movie doesn't look interesting to you, I highly recommend seeing it. This movie I consider the best ever made. The story goes like this.... the movie opens with Mr. Kane's dying with the last word he utters ""Rosebud"". Later everyone tries to find out what exactly Rosebud meant. People go around asking people about Mr. Kane's life and we see it through many other people's eyes. I love how we see Mr. Kane's life through other people's eyes! This movie has arguably has the tightest screenplay in film history not to mention having a great script. Plus the ending has a twist and is extremely satisfying. The Gothic architecture and cinematography is fantastic. Everything shot is dark and has shadows. The movie gives you a great moral telling you that money can't buy you happiness. This was Orson Welles best movie and his first! I'm just flat out impressed this was his first movie, it's fitting that one of the greatest directors ever's first move was one of the best ever. This movie really inspired me to love movies! There's a reason why this is in so many of the best movie directors favorite film lists such as Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg! This is one of my favorite movies ever and continues to inspire people and be praised today.P.S. I wrote this view on another website and decided to post it on IMDb"
chaos-rampant,"Apr 23, 2012",N/A,"I watch Kane every couple of years, each time with more films inside of me, with more references around the thing, and expect it will kind of crumble a little, seem a little more borrowed or less sharp, or basically not that big a deal. I do not hope, mind you, being an ardent Welles fan. I just think I will have outsmarted him this time around.I fail every time. Every time I come up with even more impressive insights, discover fresh corners I had not accounted for. Every time it makes my head spin this was at all possible or allowed to happen. It really is the work of genius and just so rich in every aspect.dramatically, for instance the scene where young Kane is about to be handed over to the bank, where tables are turned at the last moment and turns out the stern mother is really the caring parent, something that ties in with the overarching sentiment that appearances can fool you and really mean nothing. This is perfect writing right here, complex characters, Kane of course above the others, a man who can go on a noble rhetoric about the workingman even as he plots war.visually, goes without saying really and has been extensively documented elsewhere.the structure above all, the image pieced together from many not entirely trustworthy testimonies, as the film- and storymakers inside the film keep pushing for better drama and better 'truth'.But all this has been celebrated a thousand times over, rightly so. The startling insight for me this go around was the staging of the opera, just two shots.One is clamor and commotion on stage as the camera pulls back to reveal the curtain has not yet lifted, then everyone freezes into place, lights wash into the space as the curtain lifts to the sound of applause, and choreographed with the first bars of the song the camera tracks up and above, across a multitude of strings leading up to the two stagehands overseeing the show. Later into the film we get the reverse shot, the mirror. Everyone freezes into place as before, but now we see the curtain lift, lights blaring directly in front of us, but the curtain lifts and we don't see an audience. Only pitch black darkness and the song going out to it.The astounding accomplishment is neither shot individually, even though both are perfectly crafted. It is how much of the world of the film is mapped between them (it would take a Tarkovksy to sustain more internal space between anchors).One anchor is puppetmasters in control of this image being staged, but not who we thought, not Kane, who watches impotently as part of the audience, not anyone important, only those two ordinary workers on the level of the gods. The reverse of this? Nothingness that contracts space of itself to create something out of nothing, something that fills the void and is light and song calling out.Between them we have a cosmogony several layers deep, each one generated by an image being staged to frame something out of nothing. It's worth puzzling over the many shots this ties into, all to do with projected light through the dark creating the world of the film.Something to meditate upon."
moonspinner55,"Oct 2, 2005",7/10,"Orson Welles made his directorial debut and stars in this thinly-disguised expose of newspaper czar William Randolph Hearst (who later sued Welles for libel). Chronicle of paper tycoon's rise and lonely demise is exquisitely presented, with beautiful black-and-white photography and excellent performances, but second-half of the story meanders, and portions of the film are smug or callow. Welles won an Oscar for co-writing the screenplay with Herman J. Mankiewicz, the film's only award out of nine nominations. Perhaps it was felt that Welles was too talented for his own good, and indeed the picture is heavy on self-importance. Entertaining, to be sure, and voted the best film ever made by the American Film Institute in 1998."
namashi_1,"Jul 29, 2013",10/10,"'Citizen Kane', Written, Directed & Acted by the late Orson Welles, is something so magical & poetic, it defines Cinema. I Have NEVER seen a film as good as 'Citizen Kane' since 'The Shawshank Redemption'.'Citizen Kane' Synopsis: Following the death of a publishing tycoon, news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance.'Citizen Kane' is about The Great American Dream. The Protagonist, Charles Foster Kane, is one of the few people who achieve greatness on Celluloid. He lives his dream, rises above the normal commoner & even sees through The Great Depression. The Protagonist defines ambition, greed & one-man-ship. Its a supremely well-written character, that also explores emotions & has his share of outbursts.Orson Welles is at his greatest high as far as creativity & imagination are concerned. He delivers a story so compelling & magnetic, it's hard not to be stunned by his work. His Screenplay is flawless & utterly amazing. Every Sequence, Every Character, is magnificently written. His Direction can be described as a Study. He handles this Epic Human Tale, astoundingly. And as far as his Performance goes as Charles Foster Kane, he's impeccable. His performance elevates Charles Foster Kane to perfection.On the whole, 'Citizen Kane' is Cinema At Its FINEST! A True Masterpiece!"
shervman,"Apr 18, 2006",6/10,"I had to watch this movie for a my film1400 in college and fell asleep three times during my first time watching it. Yes, great cinematography, great camera angles, light, bluh bluh bluh, and oh my god it was made in 1941. Bottom line is if you think about whether you'd prefer watching this movie at your leisure over a lower rated movie, like lets say Untouchables 99% of people would choose the latter. Why? because this movie is perhaps the most well-made BORING film of all time. Unless you're trying to find out all the cool movie-making techniques used in the movie, as opposed to paying attention to what's actually going on in the movie you're not going to like this. 5 out of 10 at best!"
Carma_Gagne_Chan,"Jan 31, 2008",3/10,"For the life of me, I have tried hard to understand how and why this movie could possibly be considered the #1 film in the first 100 years of American film-making. The first time I tried to watch it, I got a few minutes and hated it; I couldn't make myself care. I tried again, because it's a ""classic"" made by a ""genius"", and I sincerely wanted to understand how it could possibly be voted higher than Casablanca.It is boring and noisy and the makeup is horrible. I will never understand why this movie was voted #1. I wouldn't even put it in the top 100.It has failed in every way a film can fail. I don't care about the protagonist. I find it cliché, obnoxious and dull. Perhaps in its day it was fresh, but it doesn't stand the test of time the way Casablanca does.I don't care what anyone else says about this movie; in my opinion, it is the worst thing a movie can be: boring. I will never force myself to watch it again."
pratamabugi,"Jun 4, 2015",10/10,"I've heard so many great things about Citizen Kane. They said it's ""The root that starting modern cinema"". Then, I start seeking it, the history of it, even the big point of conclusion and interpretation insides this film!!Anyway, time passes. The Generation flies. I can't lie to fully enjoying this film. But I get the huge essence after watching Citizen Kane. The essence that probably found the meaning itself, as a time going away. I think it's superb legacy, the reminder to all film industry. Maybe, we doesn't care too much at that time, but finally time has reveal itself. That's why I think how wonderful it was Orson Welles vision. I know the Orson Welles himself has died even before I was born. But, can you believe that twenty four years old Orson Welles makes a landmark of the motion picture. I can only said, it's a landmark of storytelling. Amazing storytelling that endured beyond the generations.As a ""rosebud"" itself, Charles Foster Kane legacy highlights that finally changes peoples argument about him. As a life, human and the film evolution. I said, it's wonderful film making. Beautiful in many ways, I only just can't live at that time!!"
panag-parask,"Jan 16, 2015",10/10,"So I decided to write a review because I saw lot of people do wrong to this movie and others being a little unrealistic. The following is purely my opinion on the movie. I'll try not to go into much detail about the movie itself. Let's just think first when this movie was made, 1941. The story starts with Charles Foster Kane ( The protagonist. ) dying and breathing out his last words which were ""Rosebud"". So, from the beginning of the movie there's an enigma, what is ""Rosebud""? A journalist who'll write an article about the death of Kane tries to find the meaning of this word. So, with a lot of flashbacks and a flawless storytelling process we get to know who Kane was, where'd he come from. He's nature, he's good characteristics and his bad characteristics. We get a taste of how his life progressed. What I liked about Citizen Kane except from it's mystery and simplicity is how well we got to know our protagonist. By the end of this movie you may or may not understand what was the meaning of ""Rosebud"". I just have to suggest one thing, try and watch it. If you like it, you'll watch it again. If you don't, give it an another try and if you still don't like it then you never will. It's one of this movies that passed the test of time and still matter because in it's core, it's a movie about a human being. It was a classic ""must-see in your lifetime"" movies that really lived up to their hype!"
uhrig888-677-841561,"Sep 1, 2013",10/10,"I don't know if there is such a thing as a ""perfect"" movie, but this comes as close as anything I have ever seen. I recently re-watched Citizen Kane for the first time since high school. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it again, probably because the first time I saw it I was a little underwhelmed. I'll just chalk that up to immaturity though, this is most certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. Students of film history can tell you all about the innovative camera techniques and such that make this film very important. I prefer to just focus on the actual experience of watching it. First of all, every scene (and I truly do mean every scene) is absolutely visually stunning. You could pretty much take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery, it is that meticulously put together. Aside from that, it's just a great story. I don't usually find biopics about ""great men"" very compelling, as they have a tendency to elevate people to this almost god-like, larger-than-life status that causes me to just become disconnected and not care at all about the main character. Citizen Kane does precisely the opposite, it takes a ""great man"" in the eyes of society and brings him down to a human level. Ultimately Kane is just like everyone else, a man in search of lasting happiness that proves more elusive than it seems it should. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane, or even if it's been a long time, then go watch it as soon as possible. You certainly will not regret it."
bkrauser-81-311064,"Oct 27, 2013",10/10,"What can be said about Citizen Kane (1941) that hasn't already been said? Sights and Sounds magazine came out with its decennium list of best films ever and for 50 years gave Citizen Kane top prize. Last year Citizen Kane was relegated to the number two spot by the Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo (1958). Previously anyone worth their stuff would have to admit that Kane is at least among the best movies to ever exist. So to spell it out, even with some light bruising, Orson Welles's freshman feature has some high expectations to overcome.I won't justify the critics by writing a manifesto on its artistic value. There are too many essays out there already who have done that in the past seventy years. Besides which, despite my enthusiasm for film and film history, I am by no means an expert. Therefore my ""academic"" justifications would seem disingenuous and misleading. Instead I will be introspective and give you my person reasons why Citizen Kane is, to me, one of the best movies ever committed to celluloid.My interest in Citizen Kane peaked when I was in my late teens. This is when I started to take film seriously for its social and artistic value. Citizen Kane has appeared on multiple lists of important movies and therefore I was simultaneously intrigued and intimidated by the thought of watching it. After all the works of Federico Fellini and Robert Altman are for the most part plebeian to me despite being universally acclaimed. I have no serious means to justify my reasons for disliking Altman or Fellini so if I was not a fan of Welles I was clearly an unlearned philistine.Strangely enough I was compelled to watch Citizen Kane only after watching Reefer Madness: the Movie Musical (2005). The Showtime original feature made veiled references to William Randolph Hearst; the larger than life newspaper tycoon who became the inspiration for Charles Foster Kane. I knew that Kane didn't exactly glorify the man so the scales were tipped and I rented it.The first five minutes of the movie I had to remind myself I was watching something made in 1941. The use of shadows, mirrors and the assortment of camera techniques could easily fit into a modern Hollywood thriller. Cinematographer Gregg Toland used deep-focus camera techniques to fixate on both Charles Foster Kane and the space in which he inhabits. The technique was used extensively during the last act to create a sense of eerie emptiness, whereby Kane's world was enveloping him.Deep-focus cinematography is just one of the many reasons Citizen Kane is from a technical standpoint near perfect. The story switches back and fourth between flashbacks, told from a myriad of different people. Their opinions effect the overall impression the audience gets of Kane and as a result, we cannot truly believe everything they say. Kane is seen as warm and brash in one flashback, then seen as cold and distant in another. What results is a movie whose central character leaves you with more questions than answers.I suppose the movie's enigmatic tone is what interests me the most about the film; along with its brazen political underpinnings. It was pretty clear upon release that Citizen Kane was a film a clef, and William Randolph Hearst who wasn't exactly pleased by its release. He accused Orson Welles of being a communist and according to legend Hearst arranged for a naked woman to jump into Orson Welles's arms when he entered his hotel room in New York. There would also be a photographer in the room to take a picture that would be used to discredit him. Welles stayed away from his hotel room that night so its unknown whether this is true.What was true was Hearst may have sunk the film. It was a financial dud for RKO films and it would only go on to win a single Oscar for best screenplay. Welles would go on to direct a hand-full of American films before settling in France, however his autonomy was compromised. He would never have complete artistic control for a major studio financed film again. This is not to say his other American films; The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958), and The Stranger (1946) weren't excellent. But if Welles had more freedom to do what he wanted, he might have had more than just Citizen Kane and The Trial (1962) to brag about.While I could go on and on about the brilliance of Citizen Kane, the best way I can summarize it is to say that among the list of movies accredited as ""the best ever,"" Citizen Kane is among the least overrated. The plot is great, the story structure is great, the artistry is great; everything about it is great. The best? Well that's ultimately up to you.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"
evan-sennett,"Jul 26, 2011",9/10,"A lot of my friends call Citizen Kane over-rated. It is number one on the AFI top one hundred list and is considered by many to be the greatest film of all time. My friends say that it has great cinematography, but when it comes to story, it lacks.I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was a great plot and very entertaining. Through the entire film, the audience is waiting to find out the meaning behind Charles Foster Kane's final words. It drives the plot well.So, personally, I thought Citizen Kane not only had wonderful photography, but a strong story. Now, is it over-rated? Perhaps. To call something the greatest film of all time is saying a lot. There are so many films out in this world, and plenty better than Citizen Kane, but it was good enough for me to put it's poster upon my wall."
CinemaClown,"Aug 9, 2013",N/A,"Citizen Kane is the motion picture which, since its release, has been widely regarded by almost all critics, filmmakers & even many viewers around the world as the greatest film of all time. And although I agree to some extent that, purely on a technical scale, this might be the most influential picture ever made but based solely on its plot & story, there are far better examples in cinema than this one.Still, there is no denying that Citizen Kane is a boldly crafted feature which not only defied all the typical methods of filmmaking that were in use at its time of production but also ended up completely rewriting the manuals of filmmaking in the process. The film tells the story of a publishing tycoon whose death makes news reporters scramble around to discover the meaning of his final utterance.While there is a lot to take in here, the best part of Citizen Kane remains its stupefying cinematography & the overall structure of its narration while the worst was, in simple words & in just my opinion, an insufferable boring story. So boring that it took me 6 unsuccessful attempts to finish it. But once it accomplished that, the end result was surprisingly better than what I was expecting from it.The film presents an unusual portrayal of a larger than life character told through different people & is wonderfully assisted by its carefully crafted screenplay, innovative sharp focus photography, non-linear narration, inventive use of make-up, sound & transition effects, splendid score & a strong central performance by Orson Welles in front as well as behind the camera.On an overall scale, Citizen Kane is arguably the most experimental cinema of its era that has somehow managed to stand the test of time and is certainly one of world cinema's highly influential & important works whose significance to the film medium is simply as mysterious & profound as the symbolism behind the word, ""Rosebud""."

martino-sanzovo,"Apr 5, 2015",10/10,"Who is Charles Foster Kane? Is he a Communist? A Fascist? An American? The ""No Trespassing"" sign that we see at the beginning of the movie tries to warn us. Yes, throughout the movie we will get different narrations which describe Mr. Kane; but will we go over the fence and will we really understand who Mr. Kane is? The unseen reporter (Mr.Thompson, shot in darkness) seeks the last great news: Rosebud! Is Rosebud the missing piece? Will it explain everything? Mr. Kane, the great man, by pronouncing this word just before dying returns to his childhood, the childhood stolen by a banker. Charles Foster Kane comes back to a piece of wood that meant the only real moments of happiness in his life. ""If the headline is big enough, it makes the news big enough"" tells us Welles/Kane; and the news is big but the unseen reporter cannot solve the riddle. At the end of the movie the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle seems to be Mr. Kane himself; we get his story from several (unreliable) narrators but we don't feel to have trespass the Kane's barrier. Orson Welles (director, producer and main actor) delivers a masterpiece through an extensive use of dissolves, deep focuses and flashbacks. Music and sounds give rhythm to the film and Welles' outstanding acting completes the picture (by the way, Di Caprio's best performances certainly took a lot from Mr. Kane). Citizen Kane remains up-to-date after more than 70 years and will be immortal; it is strongly recommend watching it more than once to appreciate all the techniques used by Orson Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland."

Than you get an even deeper understanding of all the levels Orson Wells tried to show/act out in the film.The story is fascinating how a man can be driven by things happening in his childhood, which of course probably is a speculation. the only person who would know is William Hearst himself and his is dead. But also Orson Wells extraordinary way of reflecting the inner and outer of the leading character is amazing!

Nobody has ever shot half as he did. Just look a the low-angle shot in the office. Awesome! ""Rosebud"" is actually the symbol of Citizen Kane's youth, which is the only thing that failed in his life. I mean, he was more powerful than anyone, he was married to a beautiful actress (who tried to commit suicide), but he didn't have a real youth.

It is fun and intriguing and every scene it will surprise you with fantastic dialogue or music. I must say that will attract men, as it is every man's dream for power, parties, and women. I had always vision of Orson Wells older man with a beard. It was nice to see him young and vigorous. Great film!"
hollywoodjohnny,"Oct 20, 2012",10/10,"Citizen Kane, 1941When I first saw this film, it was back in my 10th grade Journalism class - pretty fitting due to the content of the film. When our teacher asked, ""What is considered the number one film in the history of American movies?"", different answers floated around, but no one in class had heard of Citizen Kane. Surprised by this, our teacher played us the film and following the showing, 90% of the students in my class hated it. Said it was boring. Said they didn't get it. Said they didn't understand why it was the best film. Personally, at the time, I enjoyed it. I thought it had a good story, a great leading actor in Welles, and some cool tricks of the camera. It wasn't till the fourth or fifth time that I really saw the films true beauty and understood why it was such an iconic, classic movie.Citizen Kane is a flawless film. Genius director Orson Welles' debut picture was arguably the greatest film in the history of cinema. Given complete freedom to write, direct, and act by major studio RKO, Welles certainly made his mark in Hollywood with this unbelievably beautiful picture. Welles' style and innovative techniques really shine here and completely revolutionized the future of filmmaking for all movies after it.As an aspiring director and writer, this is a pivotal staple in the history of classic films and one that I could watch endlessly just trying to analyze every shot. It truly is an amazing movie.Everyone should see this movie if you want to see filmmaking at its best."
brchthethird,"Feb 15, 2015",10/10,"CITIZEN KANE is one of those films that often makes critics' top ten lists of the greatest films ever made, and has built quite a reputation as such over the 70+ years since it was released. It's also one of those films that people might be familiar with, but may not have seen. And until now, I hadn't actually seen it myself. So, does it live up to its reputation? Yes, it mostly does. The story, if somebody out there doesn't know, is about Charles Foster Kane, who is taken from his parents at a young age to live with a powerful businessman and, once he comes of age, takes over control of a newspaper. Over the course of his life, which is recounted almost entirely in flashback, you see a transition from an idealistic, principled young man to a reclusive shell of his former self. I thought it was a very well-written, well-shot film that gives a very balanced portrayal of a polarizing figure. All of the performances were excellent, especially Orson Welles, who was the brainchild behind this film. I also took notice of the incredible camera-work and cinematography which made effective use of light, shadow and space as well as some really sharp camera angles which provide visual insight into power dynamics that are an integral part of the story. However the most important aspect seems to have been a man who desperately wants love and approval, but doesn't know how to get it except by trying to buy it. It is this single part of Kane that makes him a compelling character, despite being such an enigma otherwise. There was also the film's central nagging question of what his final word, ""rosebud,"" meant. I thought that the answer, which is revealed in the film's final moments, was a bit underwhelming but extremely effective as a narrative-driving device. Overall, this is a classic film that deserves to be seen by all, if for no other reason than that it is an important part of film history."
cschiss,"Sep 24, 2021",N/A,"After watching this film 80 years after it was made, I think it still holds up as an entertaining film.To understanding how unique and revolutionary the camera work was requires knowing the context.This movie is a classic for a reason!!!"
imahottieandahalf,"Nov 16, 2003",10/10,"It starts at the ending and then makes its way from the beginning to the end through multiple viewpoints.  Not a very odd concept in 2003, but in 1941, when `Citizen Kane' was made, this was a very rare and not well thought of way to make a movie.`Citizen Kane' appeared to be very ahead of its time with the structure of the story to the lighting effects/shadowing used throughout it.`Citizen Kane' is the story of a small boy that is taken away from his parents (with the permission of his mother) by a businessman and the story of his life after that.Growing up with his birth parents, he didn't really have a lot going for him except the love of his parents.  Yet, when he grew up with his new `family' he had the chance to inherit many different things, yet he chose a small newspaper, called the Inquirer.Among the millions of dollars he was already worth, his newspaper started to become big and the movie portrays his adventures in relationships with him and with others throughout his life.When the director (Orson Wells.also the man character of the movie) and creators of `Citizen Kane' were making the film, they almost wanted to give up because they though no one would want to watch the movie, nor would they like it.  Yet, in reality, `Citizen Kane' became known as the best movie in history and the influence of every movie today.The movie is very unique in many ways and it's uniqueness pays off in the end.You may be skeptical of the power and influence of this movie during the first half, but as long as you pay attention and put thought into the movie, it comes out as one of the best movies you've ever seen.Once you've watched this movie, you'll have an entirely different perspective on movies and when you get out of them in general.`Citizen Kane' is a bizarre, though provoking movie that some may not like, but as long as you're someone with the ability to think for yourself, you should thoroughly enjoy this movie."
kpxr2943,"Mar 15, 2005",6/10,"Citizen Kane is consistently in lists of the best movies of all time. After watching it several times, it's clear that this ranking is no longer deserved. Sure, Orson Welles was a great innovator, and, FOR THE ERA IT WAS MADE IN, Citizen Kane had groundbreaking cinematography. It is well-written, very well-acted. But the cinematography, which many reviewers here and elsewhere dwell on ad nauseum, looks contrived and amateurish by today's standards. A good example is the often described slow descent of the camera into the nightclub. What makes other movies true classics (Seven Samurai, The Third Man, Casablanca, etc.) is some combination of excellence in script, acting, cinematography, music; but the key is that that amalgam of features withstands the test of time. It is as engaging now as when it was made. If you are a film student interested in the history of film, by all means study this film. If you are a film fan, the cult of admirers this film has will make you feel guilty for not liking this it and ranking it #1. It is worth seeing once, but that's about it."
winner55,"Aug 1, 2006",10/10,"general statement of principle; I am sick to death of commercial filmmakers preying on the young by obscuring the fact that, as filmmakers, they have nothing original to say or do, by chewing up the past and spitting it out again with ""new, improved"" special FX.yet, judging from some of the reviews i read here is that the sad fact is that many young viewers are not only ignorant of film history, they earnestly wish to remain ignorant.what could possibly be gained by a surrender to one's own ignorance. an ignorant man has to be told what to do and what to think. simply rejecting the advice of one's elders does not constitute freedom of thought - it is exactly when we reach a decision contrary to that of our peers that we discover what it may mean to become an individual.this means, of course, that statistical arguments concerning the uselessness of history are wholly unconvincing. to say that 'most people agree with me on this point' doesn't say that the point is well-made; possibly everyone in agreement with it is simply wrong.to assert one's independence and then turn around and say that the 'majority agree' is self-evidently contradictory. to abide by such statements despite evidence and reasonable disproof, is not simply exposing ignorance - which can be corrected through education - it is simply stupid.furthermore, since an ignorant person has to be told what to think, it follows that such a person is a victim waiting for a crime to happen. such people seem proud of their ability to thumb their noses at people who reach out to help - but they easily and quickly fall victim to con-artists, who usually know how to make such people feel good about the victimization.knowledge of history means; not getting scammed for want of it. it means deepening one's awareness of the strengths and faults of those we admire. it means that we learn the tricks used to produce something of value, thus making it easier to find and judge value.in film it is also well to bear in mind that good film-makers are precisely those who have studied film history the most. this gives them a stock of film-techniques developed by others on which to draw for increased effectiveness of their own films. i find it unclear, why it is young viewers of today wish to remain in ignorance of where the contemporary film-maker draws inspiration.this fact blasts away the commonly proffered assertion, 'we do things better now than anything they did 'back when'. if that were true, then the film-makers of today would not need such inspiration; but they do.finally, it is simply a fact that those who profess ignorance - as a desirable quality - have nothing new anyone might be able to learn. they always get basic facts wrong.citizen Kane is not about a 'newspaper editor' - to suggest so is merely to admit one's ignorance. Charles foster Kane is a 'media mogul' - as we would call him today - which means that he belongs to the 'upper ten percent' of the population that decides the future for the other 90 percent. he helps to reform politics in new york city; he intimidates a president into going to war with Spain. he gobbles up entertainment media in new york and los angeles, simply to give his wife a stage on which to sing.and - all of this is misguided. even his attempt at political reform fails because it has little to do with 'helping people' as he claims at first, and everything to do with his own ego and ambitions.one of the tell-tale signs of ignorance to be found in reviews of it is the harping reference on the 'rosebud' motif.the movie has nothing to do with rosebud - that's just a little joke on Welles' part.finally one has point out the tasteless ignorance of insisting that a film is weak because - heaven forbid - it's not in color. that's sort of like saying 'your father's a fag because he hasn't gotten your mom pregnant in years'. - it is wholly irrelevant to any movie whatsoever, to be sure, a director can handle color well - but he or she can handle black and white lighting and composition equally well.citizen Kane is one of the most innovative films in cinema history, and it has been used as such by filmmakers literally ever since its initial release. yet these innovations are still as striking as ever - from the use of convex glass reflection in the opening sequence, to the amazing tracking in and out of the fireplace at the end.if you care about film, you owe it to yourself to see the film; had it never been made, neither would any contemporary films that you enjoy today, or that you may enjoy tomorrow.and if that doesn't sink in - then, screw it - i've no patience for fools.still one of the best films in the history of cinema, and still a film necessary to see and appreciate."
kaneforgov,"Jun 29, 2004",10/10,"I have seen Citizen Kane numerous times over the last 25 years and studied it in film class years ago while in collage and it remains my favorite film of all time. Not because of the awards and accolades it has won but because it taught me to look at film and film narrative in a different way.Having said that I do admit that I understand why currently some younger viewers don't appreciate it as a masterpiece. In the age of MTV film-making and CGI inspired scripts, many current moviegoers don't have the patience to allow a film to unfold before them, taking literally until the final frame to complete the story and characterization. The truth is that film production has come so far since 1942 that we take for granted many of the storytelling and cinematography techniques that Wells employed. Although he may not have invented these techniques, Wells used them in groundbreaking ways and his influence can still be seen in movies today. There is also little recognition of the film within the context of when it was made. Wells, at 26 years old, had produced a very controversial story using film techniques that were quite new to movie making. Using a cast of mostly unknown stage and radio actors he managed to make a movie that wasn't simply the filming of a stage play, which was a common style of the period. Add the controversy created by the William Randolph Hearst connection (and the fact that Hearst newspapers of the day wouldn't carry ads for the film) and you see a movie-making story that has become a part of American culture.I'm looking forward to re-watching Citizen Kane, this time with my 15-year-old daughter. Hopefully, she'll get it even without Orlando Bloom or Lindsey Lohan.On the subject of Rosebud:I never believed Kane's dying word 'rosebud' had a deep psychological meaning such as a representation of everything he had lost or his inability to love. Some have suggested rosebud was 'mantra for memories of a lost childhood' and the separation from his parents which lead to his lonely life. To me, it was simply the last memory of an old man. Spurred by the visual of Susan's snow globe he recalled one of his oldest memories. At the end of the film, when asked what he thinks Kane's final word Rosebud explains, the reporter says, 'I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life.'In actuality, Rosebud, a simple memory of Charles Foster Kane's, was Orson Wells' catalyst for telling the story of Citizen Kane.I've always had a certain fascination with the character of Charles Foster Kane and Orson Wells' portrayal of him as well as many of the themes of the movie. One moment likable and attractive, the next despicable, Well's played Kane with a charisma that has been rarely equaled on film, (or in Wells' subsequent films.) Themes such as wanting to be loved but being incapable of giving love and a man's value being measured by his 'collections' are fascinating to me. Even now, with all the modern advances in film technique and the hundreds of movies I've seen, I still get chills at certain points of the film. I first saw the film at 20 years old and for me the movie represents my awaking to seeing film as art. It also gave me the desire to look below the surface at Wells' motivations and created for me a fascination with his style.Equally fascinating is the 'making of ' story behind Citizen Kane. The power struggles and controversies that surrounded the production of the film are Hollywood legend.Most people with whom I've discussed Citizen Kane, who love the movie, don't really care whether it's considered the 'best film of all time'. The awards and recognition the film has earned are not determining factors in how I look at Citizen Kane and my passion for the film goes beyond any websites top film listing. In the end, one's favorite films tend to be determined by how they touch you personally and not the box office or acclaim they attain."
LeonLouisRicci,"Jun 26, 2012",10/10,"In 2012 writing a Review of Kane is a lose-lose effort. So many Critics and Film Scholars have exalted this excellent Experiment that almost anything said here has been said there. So addressing the current Expectations of watching this Today might have some Relevance.There is a strange closed Cynical modern Perception and some in the audience absolutely hate this Film. Probably because They have been told so Loudly and Affirmatively that this is either the greatest Film ever made or one of the greatest and therefore it is a huge Letdown. It could hardly live up to the Anticipation and Expectations. Especially when it so Off-Beat and Avant Garde and was the first to use Techniques that have become so common as to be pedestrian.There is that matter of Taste. It is not for Everyone. But must be Respected, if not liked, for its place in the Evolution of the Art form. It changed the very Thinking about what to do with the Palette and how to hold the Brush and Broke the Boundaries and shed the shackles of the those who Painted with Film.One would have to, and this is the Framework for most Ancient on the Fringe Films, understand Cinema Chronology. The Paradigm of the Picture industry and the Historical body of work at the Time of Release, and the general Anticipated Acceptance of what was then being Offered for Consumption.One could even say it is a Stand Alone Film.In 1941 there was Nothing Like this at all. The Style was as New as anything that came before. Think Jackson Pollock. Or any other breakthrough Artistic Form. Movie fans Today have to accept that most of the Awe about Citizen Kane has been a Progression of Appreciation for the Audacious and Anti Establishment use of the Tools of the Cinema that were always there but arranged in Anarchy and that spun a New Direction and Citizen Kane changed the Language of Film Making."
equinox042,"Nov 17, 2003",10/10,"Citizen Kane is as many have said, one of the greatest movies of all time.At the begining the movie starts out very elusive. Panning up the front gate to the cast iorn 'K' at the top. Them slowly aproching the dark castle, but on the way passing an empty cage labeled lions with a pair of monkeys sitting atop it. Beyond that a gondola, and through a golf course, a mote and draw bridge, and finaly up to the single lit window in the highest tower of the castle only to have the light diminish.At the time of its release Citizen Kane was a revolutionary film. The camara technieque of fading from one chene to another. And still today it is a great movie. The movie Citizen Kane is unique in such a way that there is no other movie like it. It begins at the end of Kane's life. Kane's life story is told in parts by many people, from many diffrent pionts of veiw. From the uptite banker that took him in as a boy, and his best friend (if he had any), to his second wife.The movie fallows a reporter that is searching for one thing and one thing only,Kane's dying word; 'Rosebud'. The reporter learns Kane's life story and gleans from it nothing that can help him discover the meaning of 'Rosebud', though its meaning is revealed to the audience at the end, and the movie comes together and what realy mattered to to Kane is told. And as it turns out Kane's happiest days were as a boy with his folks."
redryan64,"Jan 16, 2008",10/10,"It comes to mind of an incident occurring back at the work place, which was directly related to CITIZEN KANE (RKO Radio Pictures, 1941) and to the why to its having been almost universally held as being 'The Greatest American Film.' The 'work place' was the Chicago Police Department, the year was ca. 1991. The question of ""They're having CITIZEN KANE on cable all week long. Why are they doing that?"" The question was posed by one of my old partners, a guy whom I had known for about 25 years at that time. Let's just call him Officer Elmo Aymee. (Much like DRAGNET, ""The names have been changed to protect the Innocent.""As for an answer (there were about 6 of us in the Doughnut Shop then) it was myself who finally answered ""Well, Elmo, CITIZEN KANE is considered to be the greatest film of all time, and this is its 50th Anniversary."" Without much of a hesitation, Elmo responded; ""Yeah well, I'm not watchin' it because I don't like Orson Welles!"" That was sure as about a tough and unexpected a reply that could be returned; but I did my best to maintain the 'high' level of this discussion by saying, ""Well then you must not have seen THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979); as it had Welles in a Cameo, toward the end.""But now seriously, folks, it is no exaggeration to heap such praise on the Film. And it is certainly not considered to be puffing to bestow such a title as the Greatest Film on this one, singularly conceived and so constructed movie. We must remember that at that time, circa 1940, the young Mr. Welles was considered to be a young genius with his Star still rising in the Hollywood Zodiac. His accomplishments in varying theatrical areas were undeniably superb, being in the classification corresponding to Academia's designation as ""Suma Cum Laude"", or in the Queen's own tongue, ""With Highest Honors"".*We of course know of his famous and infamous ""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" national broadcast over CBS Radio in October, 1938 as a weekly installment of The Mercury Theatre of the Air programme. Everybody's heard of that and there was even a Made-for-Television Movie telling the story. But the accomplishments of the young Orson Welles date back much further than that; extending back to the time before the New York Stage and Radio days. .At 14 years of age as a Prep School Freshman, young Master Welles was writing and producing plays which were staged at the Woodstock Music Hall, in Woodstock, Illinois. This was nothing unusual, for the talented adolescent lad. This sort of thing had become expected of him and no surprise in those days in New York with partnership with John Houseman in the Federal Theatre Project.So when Orson was being courted by RKO Radio Pictures to ink a ""standard, Rich & Famous"" Hollywood contract; Welles would continually make what would surely be deemed as being outrageous demands, but RKO apparently ""double crossed"" him. They gave in. So, it was armed with guarantee of absolute Artistic control and an essentially a ""the skies are the limit"" budgetary considerations, that he headed West; taking his company of players and Musical Director, Mr. Bernard Hermann, along for the ride and appointment with destiny.OUR STORY.Aw, c'mon! We all know that! So let's waive this part. All in favor signify by saying, ""Aye""! All opposed signify with ""No!"" The ""Ayes"" have it. So, on with the Show, Schultz!For such an outstanding example of the Cinematic Arts, the underlying structure of the story & screenplay is rather simple, amazingly non-intricate even. When all is cleared away, what we have left is a good, old-fashioned Detective Story. Sure, we have no hero with names the likes of Sherlock, Marlowe, Spade, Blackie or Philo. And there are no colorful supporting characters to help solve the mystery.There's no mysterious murder, but there is the mystery of the identity. Just who or what is ""Rosebud"" and just what did this mean to Charles Foster Kane on his deathbed? The non-frilled structure of the Detective Story would certainly not be enhanced by the use of flashbacks, for the flashback is an almost indispensable ingredient of the way a detective or other investigative person uses by way of the interview.But again, how does an otherwise normal and standard story-type command such great acclaim and accolades? The ""secret"" lies in the methods of story-telling by flashback with the most colorful of overlays. As the story continues to unfold, it goes over the same ground already covered, but it always takes us a little more along the way. The story is also seen from a different view point each time some re-visitation occurs.All of the scenes no matter where they come in the story, in present or flashback, are accompanied and successfully underscored with the original score of themes, queues and incidental music, all specially ordered and special delivery sent to the movie audience by the Maestro, himself, Bernard Hermann.As a result of the Mercury Theatre Company's relocating out to the ""left coast"" it truly does appear that Tinsel town would never be the same. First of all, Mr. Welles' own Star quickly increased in size to that of a Nova and then to the status of a Super-Nova; before its explosion and crashing down to Earth. It would be years before Orson's brief flirtation with life at the top was gradually supplanted with the appreciation with performances in films like THE STRANGER (1946), THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (1947) THE THIRD MAN (1949) and scores of other roles over the years.And over the years whatever the role that Mr. Orson Welles had in whatever film project, or Television appearance, he always did his best in giving his all. And that includes THE MUPPET MOVIE."
harry-76,"Jun 30, 2001",10/10,"Orson Welles really put one over on RKO executives  through clever distraction and manipulation in the making of ""Citizen Kane.""  He made history by creating a true art film by using the Hollywood system.The trouble was, ""Kane"" was simply over the heads of the mass audience at the time, and the film didn't make the profit the studio expected.  The total result severely injured Welles' reputation, and inhibited his future ability to work freely and without inhibition--necessary requirements of the true artist.The real-life scenario of Welles' being beckoned to South America to create a US ""propoganda movie,"" was undoubtedly a pay-back to private funders, who had granted Welles the addditional monies needed to finish ""Kane,"" but which place Welles in a vulnerable position of future obligation.With the debacle of ""It's All True,"" the Pan-American project, which was parallel to the unauthorized studio hacking of ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" the dye of destiny was cast: it would be an uphill career struggle for this artist through the rest of his life.Nowhere in the annals of film history is there so great a tragic figure as that of Orson Welles, whose genius deserved as fine a working environment as possible.  Alas, the distored values of the motion picture industry is the culprit; likewise, the blame is extended to big business in general, with its primary objective being almost perversely profit-oriented.As the years pass, the great work of Welles will undoubtedly escalate in appreciation.  Come to think of it, isn't that the case with so many genuine artists of history and their creations?In the meantime, let us continue to discover and uncover the subtleties of a great artwork, ""Kane."""
Howyadoin95,"Jul 29, 2002",N/A,"Citizen Kane is a masterpiece! It is one of the two greatest movies of all time; the other being Lawrence of Arabia. Some things in this movie are phenomenal, and that's why I like this movie so much.One thing that amazed me, and not finding out until listening to Roger Ebert's commentary on the DVD, were the ""optical illusions"" as I call it. One that I like in particular is the scene in Mr. Thatcher's story, the one part in 1929, when Kane walks to a window, and is below it, but when he walks back to the table, he is seen taller than the windows. Wow!Another thing is the scene in Charles childhood, when the camera is showing Mr. Thatcher and Charles' parents talking. In the background, in the mirror, is Charles still throwing snow outside. That showed how long of a take that scene had. Wow, again!Another thing was, and not finding out until watching The Battle of Citizen Kane, that this movie was based a lot on William Hearst's life. And also that this was Orson Welle's first film. Wow, to the third power!And one last thing is that I like the ending very much, but I won't give it away. So, see it for yourself; you won't regret it! Rating: 4 out of 4"
Tashtago,"Jun 7, 2008",6/10,"First I'm a huge film buff love many of the classic films Hitchcock, Lean, Kubrick etc. but i've never understood what's so great about Kane. I know all the technical stuff, rapid panning, jump cuts, crane shots over model sets yes yes it's all very impressive but Pauline Kael called it a ""shallow masterpiece"" and that's what it is. Imho the main reason is none of the characters are likable and several Bernstein, the reporter, second Mrs. Kane are annoying and shrill. Even Kane himself , can anyone honestly say they care about him? Most or all great films have at least one or two characters the audience sympathizes with or at least finds interesting, here there's no one and there never has been anyone, for this reason Kane is shallow , shrill, and pretty dull when you get past the technical wizardry."

But when it came to this movie, which was praised by critics, I was asleep because Orson Welles let me down with his acting. Also, the movie didn't know when to stop, and for some reason just seemed to go on and on and on and on, not to mention how pointless the ending was. Number one film of all time nothing. The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption, Casablanca, Star Wars Episode V, all exceed this film, in every single way possible. This film just didn't move me like it moved the critics, who are insane to have even given it an A grade because it was pathetic. 4/10"
slokes,"Sep 21, 2004",10/10,"They say that the Bush-Kerry race is full of negative campaigning, but neither candidate has yet gone so far as to pledge that, when elected, his first act will be to see to the ""indictment, prosecution, and conviction"" of his opponent. Charley Kane does, though, so much for political civility, not to mention guaranteeing a fair trial.Re-watching ""Citizen Kane"" at any one time is to discover it anew. There are a lot of great films, great because of the way they advanced the art of film, which don't burn their way into your brain and heart the way ""Kane"" does, finding new ways to amaze every time you watch it. The wonder of ""Kane"" 63 years later is not only its greatness, but how much doggone fun it is.Orson Welles made a film so electric, so outrageous, so simultaneously joyous and sad, it's a wonder it did as well as it did, getting nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and winning the prize for best screenplay. So ahead of its time in so many ways, it's a wonder too RKO ever released the thing, even without significant pressure from William Randolph Hearst to destroy the movie because he believed, not completely correctly, that it was all a big dig at him.""Kane"" manages to be entertaining from first to last. Its quick cuts and clever transitions have only benefited from the MTV generation like few films of its time, yet it also retains a certain classic Hollywood grandeur, in its gaslit sets, black-and-white compositions, Joseph Cotten's marcelled hair, and the endlessly quotable dialogue.And it's often hilarious, too. Sometimes in very overt, slapstick ways, like Signore Matiste's music lessons to the impossibly amateurish Susan Alexander Kane. Sometimes in cleverly sardonic ways, like when we see Bernstein examining the alternative headlines the morning after Kane's unsuccessful gubernatorial bid. There's more subtle jests, some which require multiple viewings. I just caught one, where Kane first makes the acquaintance of Susan Alexander by taking her up on her offer of ""hot water."" She provides the hot water alright, as Boss Gettys makes sure.Welles performs the rare trick of making intelligence fun, his own as well as the viewer's. It's a magic show that has lost none of its power all these decades later.Welles was only 25 when he directed and starred in this, his first real film role, but he already made his mark on popular culture as something of a trickster in 1938, when he convinced millions of radio listeners the Earth was under Martian attack in his adaptation of ""The War Of The Worlds."" ""Kane"" starts out with similar trickery, putting up a fake newsreel of the kind moviegoers were accustomed to seeing back then. Welles himself was quoted as saying the whole identity of ""Rosebud"" was a bit of a blind alley, ""dime-store Freud"" he called it, but the notion works, not only in setting up an air of mystery to the proceedings (shades of film noir, the genre that immediately succeeded Hollywood's Golden Age that concluded with ""Kane"") but asking a question that Welles' own life seems to beg in retrospect. When is greatness enough for its own sake, and when is it just a way people isolate themselves from the rest of humanity?It's a shame that ""Kane"" didn't launch a series of Mercury Theatre productions, not just the truncated ""Magnificent Ambersons"" and the weird ""Journey Into Fear"" but a slew of other films, as Welles and his team once envisioned. It fed a bit of a myth, of Welles as an artistic martyr. Welles did suffer from his vision, but he also suffered from being Welles, impossible, petulant, and mercurial. ""Kane"" suffers a bit, too, seen too often as a start not followed through on by its prime creator than as a brilliant individual achievement that has fed so many other great minds since its release.A couple of reviews down, someone calls this ""another boring black and white film,"" and I almost peed in my pants. Not from anger, but laughter. People can think what they want about ""Kane,"" and they will anyway, but as Matiste would say, ""some people have it, and some don't."" Give it a chance; you won't be sorry."
Varlaam,"Oct 18, 1998",10/10,"Any (re)viewers who came away with negative impressions of Kane probably made the mistake of watching the film on video. You should never approach a classic film in anything but a proper movie theatre. Would you watch ""2001"" at home on a 14"" screen? You would! Why? Watching 2001 on anything other than a full-size movie screen, or even better an IMAX screen, is a waste of time. Its grandeur cannot be appreciated under home conditions, pausing the film every 10 minutes to check on the laundry.Citizen Kane has a lot more plot than 2001, but the problem is the same. Everything that's daring and exciting about the direction -- the crazy camera angles, the freakish tracking shots, the wildly imaginative changes in mood and lighting -- you don't get anything of that on a tiny screen. All you get at home are the clever plot, brilliant dialogue, and great performances, but even so I find Kane boring at home too. Oh, and don't forget the subversive assault on the necessarily irresponsible use of corporate power. Off hand, I can't think of a single Welles film that works on a TV screen. Well, maybe Touch of Evil, since it's so heavily plotted. But with Ambersons, Lady From Shanghai, The Trial, Chimes At Midnight, to cite just a few quickly, you're just ruining it for yourself getting your first exposure at home.There's a second-run movie theatre somewhere near you that needs your support and probably shows nice, scratchy prints of Kane, exactly the kind that everyone who loves Kane saw their first time.I'm one of the people who thinks the AFI list is a bad joke which can safely be ignored. By accident, some great films did manage to wind up on the list. Citizen Kane is one of them.As our Neapolitan compatriot, who most graciously excluded his own country's Ladri di biciclette from consideration, says, Citizen Kane is ""il più grande film della storia del Cinema"". I think it's the greatest in cinematic history as well. Yeah, and it's boring at home."
patate-2,"Sep 24, 1999",10/10,"I'm not in the habit of granting gold, silver and bronze. In this case I'll make an exception for this is an exceptional experience. I watched this film many times. Lately, I found myself crying for no apparent reason while watching it. It must be the Stendhal syndrome has dawn on me I guess. There are two periods of film history: Before-CK and After-CK.My guess is it still is ahead of its time just as Van Gogh was 100 years ahead of his time. Nowadays, his painting he could never sell himself are breaking record prices at auctions.Years from now, the general public will demand to be taken beyond this milestone. As of now, it still is ""art-house"" stuff for students and intellectuals."
otuswerd,"Oct 27, 2009",10/10,"..in my book, and I have a big book of films. I first saw Kane in the mid 90's and had already acquired a distinct taste in films. The Cohen Brothers, Taratino, Lee, Lynch, these were my favorite directors in the early 90's, and WHAMMM, here comes Welles.This film gave me goosebumps within the first few minutes. The cinematography is by far some of the best I have ever seen, and the suspense leading up to one single word is amazing. The way the story is told is delightful, and Welles just steals the show. There are so many camera tricks in this film I had seen before though, and it was all in the films by the directors I have just mentioned. One of my favorite things Welles does with the film is how he took out floors to film different angles of himself to look powerful, while most other people in the film are shot from above to seem lower than him. I never realized the influence this film had on other filmmakers, and still see it today in several films.I can only imagine the excitement and buzz around it when it first came out. It was good for me going into the film knowing of the Hearst family and the true basis behind the films characters. Get this film, make some popcorn, and sit back and enjoy the amazing Citizen Kane... Rosebud."
aakash-karkare,"Nov 3, 2010",10/10,"I will not discuss whether this is the greatest film ever made or not. There is no greatest film. You either like a film or you don't. No one film is the supreme film, as there is no one book that is the best, no one song and so on.Citizen Kane is Orson Welles debut feature made in 1941. He was commissioned to make it by RKO features after he got some fame from the now infamous 1938 broadcast of the war of the worlds. He got the chance to develop his own script use his own actors and crew and had a lot of creative control and thus we got Citizen Kane.Citizen Kane is about a man: his life, his trials, his tribulations, his ups, his downs and finally his death. The movie opens with what is now one of the most iconic scenes in movie history. An aging Charles Foster Kane played by Orson welles himself lets slip a snowglobe as he utters his final words "" Rosebud ""From then on we are taken on a journey through his life. And we watch the talent of welles unfold. Maybe it is his career in radio and theatre but Welles can do one thing and that is tell a story. There is not one dull or uninteresting moment in the film. The story unfolds in a brilliant manner and you are completely sucked into the world of Charles Foster Kane that is so well created by Welles and portrayed by his hand picked crewWelles has created a fascinating character study in Charles Foster Kane. There have been so many great men and everyone has always tried to scratch away at the surface at try to reach the whole truth about what a man was. Welles tries to show that there is no one truth or no one answer to a man's life. Life is so vast and so varied that every man at one point is occupied in living so man different lives that it is impossible for anyone to gauge what one action or one word meant.The final monologue is filled with profundity. Even if parts of the movie seem aged (none did to me) that final monologue will always remain relevant as will the movie .And I am giving it a 10 not because I am another admirer of the emperor's new clothes. I could have given it an 8 or a 9 but now it has become cool to hate Citizen Kane. To protest against these people citizen Kane deserves a 10"
psionicpoet,"Nov 18, 2003",N/A,"It's incredible to see how masterfully Orson Welles, a Hollywood newcomer both in front of and behind the camera, has outclassed the directors of our time when it comes to composition, style, and symbolism. Few of the current crop of directors heralded as ""great"" - directors like James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and David Lynch - can match the overall quality and message of Welles' single most influential film. In a time when films are valued for spectacle over quality, ""Citizen Kane"" is like a breath of fresh air.""Citizen Kane"" is more than the story of a newspaper magnate's rise and fall; it is a tale of what is ultimately important in a person's life. Despite the vast riches that Kane attains, he is far from happy. He is left with two failed marriages and few friends. At the close of his life, all he has left is his memories - and something called ""Rosebud.""Though Kane himself says ""I don't think there's one word that can describe a man's life,"" that is in fact true of his life. ""Rosebud"" is what mattered to Kane in the end; it was the only thing that he truly wanted. Not in a literal sense, but instead what ""Rosebud"" stood for; a mystery masterfully concealed until the very end of the film.It is easy to see why film critics laud ""Citizen Kane."" It was revolutionary in its own time, a feat that few films can attest to. It's disuse of chronological storytelling and heavy use of frame composition for inferred messages can be compared only to some of director Quentin Tarantino's better efforts, where style is held almost above plot. Welles manages to do even Tarantino one better, elevating style and maintaining and engaging plot at the same time. It's easy to see why ""Citizen Kane"" gets its praise; I would admit to being one of its admirers."
Losshir,"Jun 30, 2006",9/10,"I'm gonna be brutally honest here. I didn't exactly like this film. After years of hearing how it was by far ""the greatest film ever made"" perhaps it's expectations were too high. How can any film possibly meet expectations when expectations are nothing lower than perfection? With the knowledge that this film is universally considered the best ever made, there is no way it could possibly meet that bar especially for someone who rarely agrees with such massive popular agreement. Many scenes were enjoyable, and many were boring, but maybe I didn't ""get it"" or maybe I didn't want to.A large problem with this film has nothing to do with the media but the people who love it. Professors who adore it, critics who dissect and people who say they love it to sound smart and artistic. No film can possibly survive after 60 years in those conditions.You can shoot me for saying this, but the acting was overdone, and the film was very dark physically. Normally I don't mind that but in some scenes I wasn't able to make out the emotions and faces of the characters. I understand that this film was a massive undertaking as far as films that do creative things such as camera angles, mixed up narratives and things of that nature, but that does not mean its the best one out there. It served as a good first stepping stone but talented film makers have gone a long way since then.People seem so eager to praise it they forget that there are also many problems with it and that in some instances, it's greatest assets are it's greatest liabilities. While it had character development I was hoping for more, although I enjoyed the fact that the audience would have to insert their own opinions about Mr. Kane in attempt to understand him. Despite this, I wasn't that interested in this man's life or the people surrounding him, and in such a character driven film, concentrated around one man, that is a very large problem.Maybe I'm too saturated in the sugar-coated world of Hollywood but I was expecting more from this film. Many scenes were boring, and a movie can be the best ever made, but if half of its boring, whats the point? Maybe upon a second viewing I will appreciate it more. Does it deserve to be acknowledged for technical and narrative innovations? Yes. Best film ever made? No."
frankde-jong,"Mar 15, 2022",7/10,"The evening I saw ""Citizen Kane"" for the first time I was very excited. Tonight I would see the best film ever made. Of course I was in for a big disappointment. When I saw ""Citizen Kane"" for the second time my expectations were a little lower and thus I appreciated the film more. I am however still of the opinion that ""Citizen Kane"" is not the best film ever made.The story is about the life of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles himself) told from the perspective of different relatives. This way of telling the story illuminates the fact that there is no such thing as a single truth. This fact is however illuminated in a more convincing way in ""Rashomon"" (1950, Akira Kurosawa)Charles Foster Kane was born poor but later became rich because gold was found on the estate of his parents. The story of his life is that a big ego and great ambition does not necessarily brings great happines. Owing and enjoying turn out to be very different things. At the end of his life Kane lives at the gigantic estate Xanadu which only brings him loneliness (from his friends) and alienation (from his second wife). Xanadu is a symbol of megalomania and reminds us of similar symbols such as Graceland (Elvis Presley) and Neverland (Michael Jackson).""Citizen Kane"" is not only well known for his story but also (or mainly) for its form. It uses camera-techniques (cinematographer was Gregg Toland) such as deep focus, low angle and wide angle. Al of these techniques had been used earlier, but the combination was unique.For me the smart thing about ""Citizen Kane"" is the way in which it combines substance and form.Deep focus, in which foreground and background are equally sharp, was used to show us young Charles (still poor but happy) playing in the snow in the background while in the forground a trust is established which is at the basis of his later wealth (and great ambition).Low angles can blow up images and are used to symbolize the blown up ego of Charles Foster Kane.Wide angles on the other hand create distance and are used to accentuate the loneliness at the end of the film."

It is now the standard by which my friends and I rate movies. Instead of 1 to 10 it is now ""Citizen Kane"" to ""Lord of the Rings"".I suspect that some people who claim to like this movie do so because they want to appear intelligent for understanding the importance of Rosebud."
RohitRajkumar,"Aug 14, 2009",10/10,"You must have come across many hoardings describing 'Citizen Kane' to be the greatest cinematic experience ever.Initially,I laughed at it as I knew that it was a box-office disaster and how on earth could it be the best film ever?But out of curiosity I wanted to watch this movie.And guess what?It's terrific.I have never come across a movie which was technically brilliant in every department other than this.This movie deserves a top spot on every movie list just for its sheer brilliance and the execution.Orson Welles has acted,co-written as well as directed 'Citizen Kane' and I truly believe that no other actor could have done more justice to the role of Charles Foster Kane because Orson is 'Kane' personified.It is a masterpiece in terms of film-making and will be cherished for years to come."
jall1,"Jul 11, 2002",10/10,"Everyone knows the hype. Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever made. Some people agree completely with the hype, others acknowledge Kane as a masterpiece but not necessarily the greatest ever made, and then there are those that just don't understand the hype at all. I recently saw Citizen Kane for the first time, and I'm going to have to put myself in the first group. It does deserve the hype.I understand why some people find the classics boring and wonder how they could enjoy Citizen Kane. I enjoy watching the classics because I'm interested in cinema history and film technique, but when I put historical considerations aside and just look at the films themselves, I often find them to be rather tedious. Citizen Kane is not like the other classics. It is still fresh and entertaining, and I recommend it to everyone, film buff or not. You should keep in mind, however, that Kane was made in 1941. To avoid disappointment, don't expect an action movie with flashy special effects, a tear-jerking drama, a laugh-out-loud comedy, a suspenseful thriller, or a mind-bending story with deep thoughts about the universe, plot twists, or amazing shocks that will blow you out of your seat.What you can expect is the simple yet fascinating story of the fictitious publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane, a story told with such cleverness and skill that it is a joy to watch. Much has already been said about Kane's dramatic and technical achievements, and I agree with the praise. I especially love the circular narrative structure, the brief montage that encapsulates the gradual disintegration of Kane's first marriage in only two minutes, and the scene in which the elderly Kane rips up his second wife's room. Welles' performance is mesmerizing as he lurches through his furious rampage. If you are interested in film technique, I highly recommend the DVD version of the film with its excellent commentary tracks (especially the one by Roger Ebert).If you watch the DVD, also make sure to see the documentary that comes with it, The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which chronicles the clash between Welles and the real-life publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Hearst was angered by the portrayal of Charles Foster Kane, a character undeniably based, at least in part, on Hearst's life. Hearst banned any mention of Kane in his vast newspaper holdings and threatened any theaters that dared to show the despised film. He also tried to buy all available copies of the film and have them destroyed, and he came very close to succeeding. The scary thing is that if Hearst had been only slightly more successful, no one would have ever seen Citizen Kane.It is the fact that Citizen Kane survived that makes it the greatest film ever made. Its triumph is not only a testament to the power of the cinema, but a shining example of how that power should be used. Some critics acknowledge Kane as a technical masterpiece, but erroneously fault it for being too shallow. Such critics miss how Citizen Kane dared to truthfully and intelligently display the corrupting influence of vanity, wealth, and power and how it defeated a challenge from those very elements in real life. Never falling prey to the pride that it warns us about, Citizen Kane does not stoop to pretentious preaching or arrogantly claim to know all of the answers. Welles was an arrogant man, but he put his arrogance into his performance of Kane, not into the tone of the film. Citizen Kane is powerful in its simplicity and subtlety, and as serious and thoughtful as it is, Kane still manages to be fun, entertaining, and above all, clean and inoffensive. Hearst's papers have faded away with time, old copies preserved but read by no one. The old black and white movie that those faded papers almost destroyed lives on, viewed by millions of people. The cinema and Hollywood hype reign supreme.Hollywood's hype is a two edged sword. So quick to wield its influence whipping up a frenzy of anticipation for new escapist entertainment and filling its chests with ever growing profits, Hollywood is slow to use its enormous power to raise awareness of important issues, to give artistic expression to truth and to opinions and ideas that matter. When it does attempt to use the better edge of its sword, it is so often merely an assault of violence and pornography in the name of `edgy,'  `stylish,' or `educational' art, and just as often a sappy, cheesy, or politically correct rehashing of stereotypes and clichés. Citizen Kane shines as a glorious example of how it should be done, and I wish Hollywood would follow its example more often."
Bri22,"Jul 21, 1999",10/10,"""Citizen Kane"" is possibly the single most ""important"" film of this century. Setting aside the (then) controversial subject matter and the grief Welles went through over this film, watch the film at least once for sheer enjoyment.  The black & white cinematography is brilliant, the direction is smooth, and the key players all turn in outstanding performances.  Orson Welles richly deserved his Oscar for Best Actor this time around.  Even the makeup, while seeming ""overdone"" by today's standards, is effectively used. This movie belongs in every movie lover's library!"
Chris-435,"Mar 1, 1999",10/10,"The careers of Orson Welles and Herman Melville are eerily similar...there is the great early work that is thought by some to be the alpha and omega of their respective forms (Citizen Kane and Moby Dick), there is the long eclipse, there is the great late work rediscovered (Touch of Evil or (the yet to be rediscovered and absolutely flabbergasting) Chimes at Midnight and Billy Budd, sailor), and there is the irrepressible mindf**k (F for Fake and The Confidence Man). But even more than that, Welles and Melville were the two most disillusioned artists America ever produced, which goes a long way toward explaining why average people interested in the arts as mere ""entertainment"" don't like their work. Both Kane and Ahab are singularly unpleasant individuals who are crushed by the cosmos in one way or another in spite of their indomitable defiance. These are not pleasant archetypes in the least...but they are infinitely more valuable than all the ""heroes"" of popular fiction. Welles and Melville take a speculum to the human condition by testing these characters to destruction. Citizen Kane has one of the most difficult structures in film. Its fractured narrative prevents the viewer from truly understanding Kane--but this is the point of the movie...why else would the film conspicuously leave out one crucial viewpoint (Kane himself)? In this respect, Citizen Kane is also a lot like Hamlet, which is similarly impenetrable. Anyone who demands identification with the ""hero"" is going to be sorely taxed by Kane--this separates the men from the boys, so to speak.Is Citizen Kane THE greatest film of all time? Of course not. To declare that any film holds that honor is ludicrous. After all, once a certain level of craftsmanship is attained, once a certain level of insight is expressed, these distinctions become meaningless. Star Wars lost the best picture Oscar to Annie Hall in 1977--is one better than the other? The experience of watching either of them is so radically different that the comparison is absolutely invalid...they have nothing in common except their relative excellence. Kane's hold on the honor stems from the fact that it invented more of the language of sound filmmaking than any other movie, but no one claims that the other contender based on that criterion is the greatest film of all time (that would be the extremely controversial Birth of a Nation). Dont get me wrong...Kane is ONE of the greatest films...but no film could or should be asked to stand as the alpha and omega of the art.Even so, Kane is a harrowing aesthetic experience.And Kane IS massively entertaining. I resent the notion that a film has to elicit some knee-jerk emotional response to be considered entertaining--having the eye engaged and having the mind challenged ARE entertaining...but I sometimes forget that we as a people more and more value feeling over thought...God help us all.(If anyone is interested, I also reviewed Cat People (1942)"
bryanf-85728,"Feb 25, 2019",N/A,"Often considered the greatest American film Citizen Kane's reputation precedes it- but there is a reason for it. Directed by wunderkind Orson Welles(who was barely into his mid 20s) Citizen Kane is a towering achievement of themes which resonate with anyone of us, and the cinematography and pacing are so good most American filmmakers swear by it. Based on the life of a real life newspaper moghul Kane tells the story through flashback of its titular character Charles Foster Kane(Welles). It is a given that for such a work of art the reputation is indeed going to take precedence. But if seen with an open mind one will realize that Citizen Kane is a work not only ahead of its time but also a precursor of many a character studies done in the Hollywood system. Citizen Kane will stand the test of time, as it has for so many decades now."

If you had told me that this was a period piece that came out last year, I would believe you. Well, I wouldn't because I know some of the actors and stuff, but you get the point.

canermustafa,"Oct 3, 2023",9/10,"""Citizen Kane"" is a cinematic tour de force, a testament to Orson Welles' directorial brilliance. The narrative unfolds like a carefully crafted puzzle, revealing the enigmatic life of Charles Foster Kane. Welles' multifaceted portrayal of the complex protagonist keeps you entranced, showcasing a remarkable amalgamation of ambition, love, and loss. The innovative use of deep focus and inventive storytelling techniques set a standard for generations to come. However, a slight detachment from the emotional core prevents a perfect score. Nevertheless, ""Citizen Kane"" remains a cornerstone of film history, a must-watch for cinephiles and an enduring exploration of human complexity."

thinker1691,"May 6, 2010",8/10,"Throughout the late 19th and creeping into the 20th century, there were great men and powerful individuals. Some were discovered great after their death, others proclaimed it for themselves and a few were humble enough to accept the results of their labors. Here is "" Citzen Kane "" which many loyal fans claim was the finest movie ever made. I watched with avid interest reasoning it was a good film and a grand testimony to the late William Randolph Hearst. Despite his annoyance with it, Hearst tried unsuccessfully to have it destroyed. Within the length of this movie is the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orsen Wells) who with a sizable legacy rose from obscurity to the richest man in America. With the aid of his closest friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and the often irritated Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane) he gallivanted from one lively pursuit to another, having fun with his wealth often at the expense of others. Believing he is incapable of failure, he runs for Governor and attempts a high profile marriage. Despite power and position, Caine learns first hand there are some things money can't buy. The movie itself is a Black and White study in human nature and we should remember the adage, 'the bigger one gets in life, the smaller he becomes.'

This film was truly exciting every minute I watched it. The cinematography and acting were both outstanding and Welles did very well as the director in overseeing all of this. The lighting is what really made this movie. It did very well in complementing the personas of the actors and actresses on screen and truly made the film that much more enjoyable. I can also say without a doubt that the sound in both the effects and the way the characters were heard helped the audience to gain a greater enjoyment and understanding of what is truly a work of art.

filipemanuelneto,"Jun 12, 2016",8/10,"This film focuses on the figure of Mr. Kane, an important news baron that just passed away, leaving the journalists grappling with its mysterious and enigmatic last words. Directed and written by Orson Welles, who also gives life to the lead role, this film also has the participation of other players and is considered by many the best film ever made.First of all, its necessary to clarify one thing: despite the opinions of many people consider this movie the best ever, these considerations are ALWAYS subjective and likely to be discussed. Each person has the right to think of another way, like it or not, period. Now let's get down to business.When I saw this movie for the first time I was not able to understand or to see why it was so acclaimed by critics. Currently I'm most able to understand the reasons. The actors glittered in their roles, particularly Welles, who would become one of the film's biggest names in his time. The script is simple, but it tells a good story, which addresses such important issues as the simplicity and true happiness. Its a film made with love by those involved, where every detail has been thought and rethought. The use of non-linear narrative, through the use of constant flashbacks, allows the public to see the life of the deceased millionaire, a missing character, but always present. The scenarios are excellent and even the camera angles were thought innovatively. For all that, this film was considered a landmark. It doesn't have a history that goes stay forever in our memory, but it was a film that showed to the industry that certain narrative techniques, light, shooting etc. were truly possible.So, my advice is to forget the critics, specialists and experts. Forget that is an acclaimed film and see the movie, enjoy the film before you think about it."
garbstanley,"Oct 22, 2018",N/A,"Is Citizen Kane truly the greatest of all films? That depends on who you ask but the film is indeed a force to be reckoned with. The story is about a lonely newspaper magnate as he loses touch with society and descends into madness and frustration. The cinematography was so influential that many DOPs even today consider Kane to be the film that influenced their style. The emphasis on deep focus, long takes and shadows is revolutionary. Of course at the center of Citizen Kane is Orson Welles who not only is the main lead but also the soul producer and co-writer, and of course the director- this film defines the wunderkind talent and genius of Kane. Such was the impact of this film Orson Welles probably never came out of its shadow. Citizen Kane is a masterpiece and there is no reason to not be enthralled by it."
Storm3p,"Apr 27, 2020",10/10,"Orson Welles, despite never having made a movie before, was a masterful director and actor. His experience on in Broadway shown through, attempting many techniques that people at the time thought were too hard or even impossible. He not only attempted these, but succeeded in applying them to this movie. While, at times, this movie can get a sense of unreal amount of praise that is impossible for any movie to live up to, it is still worth all the attention and should be seen by everyone."
Felix-Wackenhuth,"Apr 7, 2025",7/10,"Had waited a fair bit to watch this movie, almost like saving the last treat, forgetting it and then 70 years later finding it again.Even though the treat wasn't like the rest of the bucket was the last treat a refreshing one. It didn't have a new taste, no new color, but instead had a different shape. If you where to compare it to the treats you get today, you would probably be able to still see some resemblances in the design, the shape. I can't really say that the treat was anything extraordinary, all treats go bad after a while, but this one had a lot of sugar in it which made it keep its sweet, it was hard, took a while to get any taste of, but in the end payed of. I got a sugar kick.Treats like these are like time stones, they try something new, they take a chance. A chance to shine, a leap of fate. I cant say if it had any resemblance then, but it sure can say it had on today."

This movie was so boring I had to watch it several times because i kept falling asleep and missing certain parts. Fine, it was clever having Rosebud, and the importance of youth, but i felt that this is an example of a movie, that could be told in about 5 minutes, rather than stretching it out into one of the longest and most boring movies that i have ever seen. Now, i was also shocked at the acting. i generally find that acting supports a relatively weak script, however in this movie's case, i felt that the relatively weak script was supporting the awful acting. i personally was not very impressed with the acting strictly because the reactions felt very forced and everything was very overdone. all in all i was not impressed at all with this film, regardless of past ratings."
GasMan-H2O,"Jun 11, 2025",9/10,"Citizen Kane (c.1941) Is an American drama film starring Orson Welles (May 6, 1915 - October 10, 1985) and co-written by Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz. It was Welles's very first feature film. This quasi-biographical film examines the life and legacy of one Charles Foster Kane, portrayed by Welles, a composite character based on American media barons William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, as well as aspects of the screenwriters' very own lives.This film has a run time of around 119min. On a budget of 839K to made just under 2 million at the box office.A classic B&W film you'd love to have in your collection."
jamesfrancishall,"Nov 6, 2021",10/10,"Orson Welles' masterpiece Citizen Kane is considered, according to the American Film Institution, the greatest movie ever made, and for very good reason. This movie is about the life of Charles Foster Kane, and the meaning of his last words: ""Rosebud"". Citizen Kane is so important because of the technical accomplishments made which were incredibly revolutionary and ahead of their time. The use of lighting is incredible, using dark and heavy shadows during sadder moments, and the opposite for more jovial moments. The use of lighting is extremely effective in the opening scene, using dark shadows covering the bodies to create a mysterious silhouette, with a perfect amount of light around them to make them visible.What struck me as the greatest technical achievement was the cinematography. Like the German film 'M', which was made ten years earlier, it has certain uses of the camera which where almost never seen before. If one analyzes the cinematography in the opening scene, you will realize that this camerawork was not common for the time, but it is so inventive and original that it is undeniable that it is ingenious, for example, the use of deep focus and, in the beginning, a fish-eye view though broken glass.Orson Welles plays Charles Foster Kane in an amazing way. In general, all the performances given are great, because of other talented actors such as Joseph Cotten, who was to later play in other movies like 'Shadow of a Doubt', 'The Third Man', which also has Orson Welles in it, and 'Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte'. Even though Joseph Cotten is excellent in this, Orson Welles truly was at his best, even though he was only 25 when he made this film! If you are a film buff, than you must see this, because of its technical accomplishments. For an 80 year-old film, it has not aged a day. Why is this movie an essential in film school? A few reasons are its lighting, cinematography, and character development. This is a must-see for any fan of drama and mystery movies, for any film buff, and any fan of movies. God bless all who read this and bye!"
alexsnower,"Jul 12, 2021",10/10,"This is not my favorite movie of all time but I respect it enough to put it in the top 20. The plot is beyond what anyone at the time could've conceived. The camera shots, pans through glass ceilings, blurring objects in the foreground, filming people on an upward angle indoors, they all changed film forever. Anyone who wants to be a writer or director should watch this. It's a masterclass on how to make a movie. Deserves a better rating than The Prestige, Fight Club and other movies people obsess over because they haven't seen a movie made before 1970."
sme_no_densetsu,"Jun 23, 2008",8/10,"If you know anything at all about film criticism then you probably know that ""Citizen Kane"" is widely hailed as the greatest film of all time. However, I think I can safely say that this film's high stature is due more to it's enduring influence than to it's particular merits.Of course, I don't mean to imply that the film is poorly made, even by today's standards. Welles's direction can only be described as visionary. Combined with Gregg Toland's cinematography & Robert Wise's editing, the film has a look that's light-years ahead of it's time. And let's not forget Bernard Herrmann's fine score.The story is an engrossing one. The enigmatic Charles Foster Kane's last word, ""Rosebud"", sets a reporter on a search to unearth the meaning of this cryptic final statement. We are whisked thru different periods in the man's life, piecing the puzzle together through the remembrances of others. The ending does not disappoint, elucidating the mystery with a subtlety rarely seen on the big screen.The acting is well-handled throughout, particularly Welles as he portrays Kane from age 25 to death with the help of ingenious makeup artists. I do wish, however, that a few of the other performances had been more subdued and less overtly theatrical.While I believe that there are later films that supercede ""Citizen Kane"" in terms of quality I will concede that there may be no more important film. Needless to say, this film is required viewing for anyone who purports to know anything at all about motion pictures."
ghazyp,"May 3, 2013",8/10,"Lauded as America's greatest motion picture of all time, Orson Welles succeeded in utilizing advanced techniques in cinematography, storytelling, and especially lighting and camera angles. Citizen Kane represents the pinnacle of Welles's film-making career despite the surrounding controversy during its time of release. The film had parallels between the eponymous character, Charles Foster Kane, and William Randolph Hearst, who was an American newspaper magnate. Welles combined innovative techniques of deep focus shots along with a kaleidoscope of angles. Different types of angles were utilized in order for the audience to deepen their understanding of each character. Despite the film's confusing newsreel sequence, Welles succeeds in utilizing unique camera angles and advanced cinematography in a perfect manner.Released in 1941, the film became subject of controversy for the brutal portrait of Hearst's life. Citizen Kane also revolutionized how cinematography, a non-linear storyline, and a kaleidoscope of angles were used effectively. The famous eerily opening featuring a shot of the eponymous character's (Orson Welles) mansion, Xanadu. The camera depicts a foggy and murky atmosphere with a deep focus shot of Xanadu atop of the hill. The scene then cuts to a room with a dying Kane, holding a snow globe as he mutters ""Rosebud."" The camera focuses on the globe as it rolled out of his left hand and broke.Welles employs different a non-linear storytelling which features the death of the main character in the beginning of the movie. As the news unfolds of his death, the famous newsreel sequence unfolds on screen. It presents a brief of narrative events in roughly the same order as the movie as a whole. The editing of the sequence was well-done as the narrator of the newsreel points out that ""Kane helped to change the world, but Kane's world now is history. The great yellow journalist himself lived to be history. Outlived his power to make it"" Reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) was determined to find out the meaning of Kane's last word ""Rosebud."" He was assigned to discuss with Kane's former associates in an attempt to uncover the meaning of Rosebud.Different camera angles allow the audience to understand the character emotions and tensions within a scene. For example, there was a scene that involves using a low-angle technique when Kane was having a discussion with his friend, Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten). He confronts him after his defeat in the election for governor against Jim W. Gettys (Ray Collins). In the office, where the discussion took place; Leland commented that ""(Kane doesn't) care about anything except (himself)."" As Kane walks closer to the camera, Leland said to him, ""You just want to persuade people that you love 'em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms."" The low angle emphasizes Leland trying to assure his moral superiority to Kane.Citizen Kane made advances in cinematographic advances. Cinematographer Gregg Toland made a significant contribution to the style of the film through the use of deep focus. It refers to having everything within the frame, even the background, focused at the same time. There is a famous scene, involving Kane's mother, Mary Kane (Agnes Moorehead), having a conversation with his father, Jim Kane (Harry Shannon). Deep focus shot was effective in depicting the Kane family, discussing with Walter Parks Thatcher at the table. She figured out that she was given a stock in order to be given ownership of the Colorado Lode, a working gold mine. She signed an agreement to transfer $50,000 per year given to both to her and her husband. Charles Kane eventually owned all possessions by the time he reached the age of 25. The deep focus shot allowed the background which is inside Mary Kane's boarding house to be focused. We see Kane's parents signing the agreement and the distance of a young Kane outside, playing in the snow.In spite of the movie's age and its confusing opening sequence, Citizen Kane has attained its status as ""the greatest film ever made."" The American Film Institute has ranked the film number 1 in the first top- 100 ranking in 1998. Using deep focus shots allow the characters' emotions to be understood through Gregg Toland's extensive use of back-lighting. What matters is to understand Charles Kane's ruthless rise of acquiring wealth, as he enters the newspaper business. The difficulty to interpret Kane's life has become apparent as reporters attempted to decipher his last word ""Rosebud."" This word was a clue that Kane was not just a mere symbol of his public accomplishments. Who, really, was Charles Foster Kane?"
dragon-90,"Jul 6, 2000",N/A,"Citizen Kane (CK) is considered the archetypal art film, even by many of its biggest fans.  But at the time it was made many of the ""arty"" techniques it employs so effortlessly were new and innovative uses of sound and high-tech visual effects.  What Orson Welles (the 25 year old boy genius who wrote, directed, and stars in the movie) achieved in CK was the realization of cinema as multi - media capable of imparting rapid cognition.  We do not actually meet protagonist Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles) until half an hour into the movie, yet by that time we pretty much know (one version) of his life story.Every scene, every line of dialogue, contributes to the whole yet we are left pretty much at the beginning (despite the famous surprise end) when the movie ends.  But you have the sense of having been on a long insightful journey.Citizen Kane is almost 60 years old, yet is still considered one of the (if not the) greatest films ever made.  This reviewer scoffed at the idea at college and has searched for more perfect films but has to admit that it remains fresh and terrific.  Why?  Because, like good fiction, CK takes you into a world that is almost real and through a tale that spans the ages.  It is still a masterwork."
josh_flanders,"May 24, 2020",7/10,"Citizen Kane tells a pretty interesting story and it is perfectly fine film. There are some good things about it, though I have my complaints as well. There's nothing terrible about it, but honestly I just don't understand what the big deal is about this film.For many years it has been called a groundbreaking masterpiece and the greatest film of all time and this and that. To me it is a perfectly good film with its strengths and weaknesses just like the rest, but it is not particularly better than many other films that are also good.I won't bother to list the films that I think are better than this, because everyone has their own taste so my list would be different than yours or anyone else's. But I just don't see how so many people could agree that it is the best film. If you don't believe me you can watch it for yourself and make up your own mind."
KungFu-tse,"Jun 6, 2004",9/10,"The first time I rented and watched Citizen Cain, I actually fell asleep. This was shortly after AFI listed it as the #1 movie of all time a few years ago. I didn't understand the movie at all and I certainly didn't understand why it was #1.Now I realize how ignorant I was.Last year, I took a course in college on Film (I'm working on being a film director myself). Citizen Cain was a topic that the professor brought to us early in the semester. This would be my second time viewing the movie. But by this time, I had a basic understanding of film history, shots, camera angles, script writing, etc.You see, you have to understand what movies were like before Citizen Cain, and after. Citizen Cain was a revolutionary movie in terms of edition, camera angles, and story. It was also ahead of its time.Let's start with story. The movie starts with his death. The entire story is told through interviews and flashbacks by everyone who was involved with Cain. Unlike other movies with a linear narrative, this movie required you to think and put all the pieces together.Another big thing was the way light and dark was used. High and low camera angles were used to the extreme. I can't point out every single one but you could ask a film expert point them out.Another big thing was that the movie was pretty much a satire of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper mogul. I recommend watching the movie ""RKO 281"" with Liev Schreiber and James Cromwell so you'll know what I'm talking about.Sadly, the movie failed at the box office. It wasn't until years later when critics saw the movie and realized how great it was.So if you saw Citizen Cain and didn't get it, I don't blame you. I didn't get it the first time either. It's largely due to the fact that the movie is so old, so there's a large generation gap. Also, you need to know a bit of film history, what happened during the making of this film, and how this film influenced virtually every film make after."
happygoluckyduck,"Mar 17, 2005",10/10,"This film is simply put, perfect. But in this reviewer's opinion, a little too perfect. Orson Welles, at only 24 years old, obtains complete artistic control and all the financial aid he would for creating this film. On the set, no one but cast and crew was allowed. The progress of filming was kept entirely secret from producers and studio executives. The movie is released and William Randolph Hearst leads a vicious crusade to have the movie boycotted. And in the end, everyone recognized that it is a landmark in film making history and perhaps one of the greatest movies, if not 'the' greatest movie of all time; in short, perfection. All of these are pretty odd circumstances for just one film, don't you think? I think so, For perfection is beyond the grasp of human minds and hearts. Then one must ask, how then was this film created if a perfect film can not be created by man? Well, frankly, Martians. Yes, it may come as a shock, but martians were the ones who created Citizen Kane.Martians have been observing humans for a millennium, studying our trades, our relationships, and ultimately our art forms. Film being the synthesis of most visual and auditory arts, the Martians decided in 1938 to give film a try. Through mind control and virtual hypnosis they manipulated a young, influential radio personality and actor to be their human front man. That man was Orson Welles. Welles, using Martian mind control received permission, finance, and freedom to go ahead with 'his' project. The reality of it was the Martians were in complete control of the production, using their influence over all the mercury players and cast members to do their will. The set was a closed set all the time, simply because the Martians were out in the open giving direction. When a producer would come by, the Martians would go into hiding, and upon Martian instruction the humans would start tossing around a baseball. Only a martian could think of a ploy so devious.Though no evidence for this exists, it is my opinion that William Randolph Heart caught wind that it was Martians heading up this project, and being objected to the mind control and manipulation, he lead his notorious crusade against this picture. He felt that human rights were being violated, and who can blame him? But really, in the end, no harm was done. The actors had created a marvelous performance under Martian instruction, and the Martians had proved to themselves that they understood human relationships, especially our need for love. Thus being satisfied with their artistic endeavors, the Martians headed off, only to return as consultants on the film 'Seven Samurai.' But, even though Citizen Kane is not a product of human artistry, it still is a wonder to know that someone out there understands us humans, even a little more than we do.See this movie."
jim-862,"May 23, 2005",10/10,"This is a great movie, the best drama ever made. Everything about it is perfect. And the test of it is that no one at the time of its release knew what to do with it, or what to make of the genius of Orson Welles. These two facts themselves engender a tragedy that should, but probably will never be, a film like Citizen Kane. Yes, it was nominated for all the right things. And son of a gun, the Academy ACTUALLY gave CK an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.BEST ACTOR 1941 Sgt. York? I love Gary Cooper, but... BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR 1941 How Green Was My Valley, Best Picture, Best Director? A great film, and by my list of films, John Ford is a great director, but... BEST FILM EDITING 1941 Sgt. York again? Now, come on! Guys, didn't you see that newsreel mock-up stuff, splicing CFK next to Hitler etc? Sgt. York? MUSIC 1941 All That Money Can Buy...well, at least Bernard Hermann, music man for CK, won.The Academy is not an Oracle of Film Greatness, and sometimes they even get it right. But in 1941 they looked past the brilliant Jewel that is Citizen Kane and picked up, instead, a handful of shiny pebbles."
Jim-480,"Apr 13, 2004",9/10,"Much of the dismissal of the quality of Citizen Kane comes about because of several factors:1) There is a disconnect between what critics expect of a movie and what general audiences expect of a movie.  To say that CK is entertaining is simply an opinion - no more, no less.  Our opinions on films can be researched and refined or raw and personal.  To claim that one is better than the other is arrogance, but we do it because of some sort of instinctual belief that ""everybody should think the way I do.""  This is not the case, however, and there is going to be backlash when Kane isn't the movie that people expect.  It is not entertaining in the traditional sense. It's hard to get attached to the characters unless you really want to, and the story (the life of a media titan) isn't something that naturally appeals to everyone.  It's a movie you have to work at liking.2) CK is astoundingly technically accomplished and years ahead of its time. When you compare it to the standard movies of the day, you can see how much film instinct Welles had and how revolutionary the film was.  However, most people today don't have an expert grasp of the intricacies of making movies, and most don't care about things like lighting, blocking, and camera placement.  Most people go for story and characters and see movies as passive entertainment.  They don't want to focus on extraneous things like short/long shots.  And they shouldn't be chided for wanting a movie to be simple to understand - most people watch movies as entertainment, not as a hobby, and breadth of film knowledge shouldn't be a requrement for doing so.3) CK is defended extraordinarily heavy by often-arrogant film-buffs who imply that the only people that should judge a movie's quality are the people that study the movies.  This is a dangerous and stupid position. IMDB is set up so that EVERYONE gets an opportunity to share their opinions. I'm not a big fan of Godfather (boooring) but I understand that my opinion is only one of millions and therefore not all that important.  Film geeks want their opinion to matter more, but the truth is that it really doesn't. This bothers them, because they've spent so much time loving movies only to watch their vote get cancelled out by a 12-year-old that rates the Princess Diaries as a 10.  Guess what?  That movie was made for 12-year-olds, and CK was made for people who like to watch movies that are mental exercises.4) The dangerous title of ""Greatest Movie Ever Made.""  Movie-watching is too personal to ever apply that title to anything.  Yes, we can all agree that certain movies are better than others, and the majority can be expected to make an opinion on how people in general view a certain movie.  But to call a movie ""The Greatest Movie Ever Made"" is implying that everyone should feel that way.  Everyone will not feel that way.So a good many people hate Citizen Kane.  That's their right.  Film-going shouldn't require an initiation and entrance exam.  IMDb is the sum of popular opinions, and CK-lovers just aren't going to get everyone to love such an dense, complex film.  Some people don't look for that in movies, and they are no more wrong than you are for wanting it."
Spondonman,"Oct 6, 2013",9/10,"And imho those years 1915-1955 were the most entertaining in movie history too. I've never called myself or written down that I'm a film ""reviewer"": unless you get paid for it by someone else and it's your job title the internet is generally the place to simply pass comments about this, that or the other. There's more than enough reviewers out there in the world anyway, and critics or snickerers too. I dislike passing bad comments on anything because 99% of the films ever made took some effort and brainwork even if I didn't personally approve of it. I could never ""review"" Kane, passing some paltry comments on such a monumental film is hard enough, but over the last 40 years I've now seen it so many times think it's high time I gave my opinion too.Disjointed story told by disparate people at different times of boy growing up to be ruthless newspaper magnate who is used to getting his own way with everything and everyone, and a newspaper reporter trying to find out what he meant by his dying word. So: It's relentlessly inventive and near perfect in every department, script, acting, production-direction, camera-work, sets, costumes etc, with the available technology they had at the time presenting a movie that still looks fresh as a daisy to someone who doesn't. A nitrate-gleaming black and white production, with no colour, cgi cartoonery, swearing, relevance to ordinary peoples' lives, sex or violence for enlightened modern audience tastes (but containing some analogue cartoonery for those who need the fix) – it's the lack of these absolute essentials that most people today can't forgive in Kane. And the plot isn't incomprehensible and no one grunts through their parts like today. On the other side are people who think that after all the decades this has now been proved to be the unbeatable ultimate in cinematic art, and all other films are simply also-rans with Kane in its somewhat traditional role of being unassailable. Both sets are wrong of course - it's all personal taste and nothing lasts forever, even criticism isn't static. However, Kane is set in the amber of the Golden Age of the movies and is to me the best movie from that celebrated era. Indubitably. Again however, if I could only take one film with me to watch on a desert island this isn't it.Far from being mediocre the end ties everything up beautifully, and it helps make poignant sense of the previous two riveting hours. Unlike the vast majority of films, come good, bad or indifferent criticism it'll still be here after we're all gone so let's hear it for Good Old Citizen Kane!"
Mojambo85,"Apr 6, 2004",10/10,"I'm really sick of seeing people panning this film.  Either they're doing it just to spite those of us who appreciate good films, or they're doing it because they really have no clue what makes a good film good.  A lot of the user comments I've seen here fall into both these categories.  Which leads me to believe that most people on imdb.com have no real appreciation for cinema as a true art, and also as a true form of entertainment.  But that's another subject.Citizen Kane is easily the best movie ever.  To audiences today, it might not wow with its special effects, its lighting, its acting, its camera work, its editing, its sound; the list goes on and on.  Most of us have been born and raised on color, explosions, and even CGI in the case of the many teenage LOTR fans here.  But the fact is, for its time, Citizen Kane re-invented all that could be done in all of the above areas.  I can only imagine what it would be like seeing it at the time of its release.  It would have been simply mind blowing.  No movie ever since has revolutionized cinema like Citizen Kane, not even the Godfather movies, however good they may be.And it's likely that no movie ever will do again what Citizen Kane has done for cinema.10/10...and this deserves to be #1 on the Top 250."
daveb75,"May 5, 2004",10/10,"""Citizen Kane"" is a very mature film. And you have to participate, as a viewer, to get into this one. For example, the use of short lenses with everything in focus (background, foreground, etc) forces you to choose for yourself what you think is more relevent in the frame. Welles and Tolland never impose their vision on you. It also gives way to overlapping dialogues, which was unheard of back then, and still is rarely seen in standard Hollywood movies. Same thing with the editing. Welles seldom cuts in talking scenes, instead he just keeps long takes rolling, therefore, once again as a viewer, you have to participate and focus on what you think is more important in the scene, rather than have the habitual overuse of separate talking heads forcing you to see one actor and not all of them. In ""Kane"", you can witness all the characters' reaction to the events. Sometime Welles will cut only at the very end of a dialogue for dramatic emphasize. Then, there is the structure of the film. Everyone seems to think they knew the real Charles Foster Kane. But nobody really ever knows everything about another person. That's both the beauty and the tragedy of any human life. But by giving us first of all the death of the main subject with his final and famous dying word, Welles is using a gimmick to allow us to witness different recollections by the people who think they knew him best. But the bottom line is, all they can do is give us a rendering of different events and can never get at the heart of the man. And that's why no one really knows about Rosebud. ""Kane"" never had a huge budget but it made a wise use of special effects that don't call attention to them like ""The matrix"" does, for example. That gave a grand look to the picture. But you never realize it as you're watching the film. There would  be a lot more to say about this wonderful work of art, but it would take years to match all that has been written about ""Citizen Kane"" and a lot of people explain the film a lot better that I can. I'm just asking the potential viewers of Orson Welles film to use a little intelligence while viewing it. It's a piece of poetry. Even Jack Kerouac was flabergasted by the  poetic aspects of it. It gave new meaning and exploded boudaries for cinema. So to call this film dated, to me is like saying that Beethoven's fifth symphony isn't worth listening to because it's been made so long ago. Time doesn't have an effect on true works of  art except to keep them alive and aging well, like a good bottle of wine."
cyoc51,"Apr 19, 2004",N/A,"I have recently seen the movie Citizen Kane. I thought the movies was very good compare to many of the movies of today. I like the idea of putting three perspectives in the life of a person. At the beginning you have the death of Citizen kane and his final word ""rosebud"". Then it showed the media perspective of his life and who they thought he was. Then you have the perspective of his acquaintances who understood his personality in a different way. What other hidden information is the idea of a silent power. The power to control the human mind or to structure a social order. I notice this today by the media choosing what they considered to be important.Some people's comments about rosebud as just being the name of his snow board are just not seeing the picture. That word meant his hidden emotion. Deep inside he didn't have what he thought his destiny was supposed to be. Money couldn't buy his love for his family and used his wealth for revenge. So in my perspective, Citizen kane was never a man of wealth. In monetary terms he did loose most of his money; however, in what was truly important to him was lost ever since he moved away from the family farm. In that perspective money is not wealth, love and happiness to be with people that loved was wealth. Since, he was taken from it, everything was lost from there on. The newspaper was just a scapegoat to hide his inner feelings. His reactions toward his wife, the singer, was to give her what he didn't have and that was happiness. He wanted her to be extremely happy, because he felt that she is doing what she always wanted to do.The screeplay resemble the movie ""21 Grams"" and many other old and new movies. I like the way the movie started how Welles was able to mixed in different cultural perspectives in given us different ways of understand the persons life. Sometimes movies have hidden messages that are never found, because some people are to caught up in seeing things from their own perspective. I don't blame them for it because that is human nature and it is useful for our survival.I don't know much about lighting and special effects, but that doesn't limit me from understanding the films objective. Today movies are being done very quickly, so the movie industry could make more money. Citizen Kane was consider was a commercial bust, but if the person takes the dream and objective than this could shape the way the person thinks about the world. To me that is more important, then just having movies that have many sex scenes, bad acting, bad scripts, putting songs that don't go along with the movie, etc.Citizen kane has allowed directors to expand their talents and it is a movie that will be remember for along time. That is what makes myths, legends and Heros. Like Julious Caesar, he wasn't the firt emperor of rome; however, most people acquaint him to being the first emperor. His idea was the reason for the introduction of Augustus Caesar, his nephew Octavian. The same could be said about Citizen kane, orson wells ideas of the use of the camera for psychological purposes and the structure of the story is what made it remarkable. Ideas are what introduces inventions and inventions are introduce by a conglomerate of ideas."
jamesforeman-87634,"Jan 24, 2022",7/10,"Powerful, but disappointing biopic - portrait of a wasted life full of luxury opening with Charles Foster Kane who whispers the word ""Rosebud."" With that he dies releasing an ornament that crashes to the floor such as his life. During his life he had alienated himself from everyone, focusing on a political career. Those who knew him are interviewed examining the meaning of his final words. Speculations evaporate into flashbacks to show his brief childhood to his introduction into the world of politics. Directed by Orson Welles who was only twenty-five when he directed this film, and its impact would render it his masterpiece. He also takes to acting and flawlessly portrays Kane through his adult life and mirrors his frustration and longing for the one thing he missed. Outstanding supporting work by Joseph Cotton and Everett Sloane who portray friends of Kane's who also worked with him, and both with different results career wise. Dorothy Comingore plays his mistress who grows tired and depressed until her only option is to leave. Agnes Moorehead plays Kane's mother who reluctantly makes the decision along with his father that ultimately affects his entire life."
august_sanders,"Apr 17, 2025",7/10,"I enjoyed it, but it suffers from a problem that I, a young viewer of old movies, have seen come up quite a bit. The references don't make any sense. Nowadays we don't have an equivalent for some of the things brought up in this movie. I'm sure that in 75 years people won't have any clue what the hell is going on with Hollywood right now, and that's just what happened to this film. There are two types of people, I think: ones that understand what Citizen Kane is about and ones that just see it as a good film about life and death. Unfortunately, I fall into the latter. I still believe it's good (maybe a little dull in the middle), but I just don't see why it's so highly praised. Maybe I'll understand upon rewatch in 5 years..."

You can watch this at film school and whatever, but beyond that if you show this at a movie night your friends will not thank you."
danielviam,"Apr 28, 2004",10/10,"The real importance of ""Citizen Kane"" is not its story, although the script is a strong character study.  The strength of ""Kane"" is in its incredibly creative use of light, camera movement, and deep focus to create a film that at the time was literally revolutionary.It is important to remember that ""Kane"" was Orson Welles' first film.  He had just attained both fame and notoriety with his ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast, and had only his radio background to sustain him.  RKO studios, then in serious financial trouble, saw him as a man capable of creating a riveting story, not as an innovator.Fortunately, in Welles they had also hired a man capable of attracting brilliant men to his side.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland was at the time probably the best in the business; he is given top billing by Welles in the final credits.At the time that ""Kane"" was made, film in America was in a rut.  The ideal, which movies stuck to, was to create a ""Natural"" look--no obvious lighting, the camera at eye level, no obvious cuts or transitions.  Welles, unfamiliar with all this, used obvious light, a VERY mobile camera, and wipes, fades--all the techniques that modern filmmakers used today. The American Film Institute, in its highly controversial ""Top 100,"" listed Kane as the #1 American movie.  Although many would disagree, I feel that its impact on the way films are made today might give it the merit to have that high place."
kennethwmccall,"Oct 31, 2005",10/10,"I think that the making of a movie is truly a collaborative process, thus the films of the studio era are without doubt the most fascinating and inventive to date. This does not mean that an independent film cannot be a good movie, it just doesn't have the expertise and resources behind it to make it a truly great movie like Citizen Kane. It also doesn't mean that the big bygone studios didn't turn out their fair share of clunkers, but in my mind, to find the best movies of the last century you have to look to the big studios.As to Citizen Kane in particular, it is always fascinating to watch. Unfortunately when we think of special effects these days, it's with action films of dubious quality, but Citizen Kane probably used more and to better advantage.The innovations, such as deep focus, sets with ceilings, the mixture of newsreel footage(both real and staged),the effect of overlapping dialogue are amazing. And to think that this was at a time when sound movies were only about a decade old and the movies themselves weren't even a half century old. It's amusing to think that when these techniques were used to create a realism unseen in films up to that time, the audiences were put off, since it was so different than anything else they had seen and they thought it looked phony!I recently heard a comment from Richard Chow(the editor from Star Wars) on TV that he is still learning things from Citizen Kane, and its great cinematographer Greg Toland, decades later.So in conclusion to me Citizen Kane stands head and shoulders above any movie before or since."
OttoVonB,"Jan 12, 2007",10/10,"Charles Foster Kane (Welles), newspaper giant and billionaire, dies alone in his huge domain Xanadu. His last word, ""Rosebud"", sends news reporters and investigators on a hunt to uncover his complex past and unravel the dying legend's words.""Citizen Kane"", by then first-time film director Orson Welles (then in his twenties with acclaimed radio and theater work under his belt), is still stunning and fresh today, despite containing many elements of film which we today take for granted, but were unheard of at the time. In 1941, the multiple flash-back structure, complex visual vocabulary - including angles that are still less than orthodox - and scope were truly revolutionary. What remains is an almost exhaustive film class in one movie.Orson Welles imbues the grand-standing and often vulgar Kane with undeniable charisma. His presence in his own films would soon prove to be one of their most enduring strengths: think of his jovial Falstaff in Chimes at Midnight, his repulsive Quinlan in Touch of Evil and his simmering Othello in his adaptation of Shakespeare's play. Welles's would be a career of superb roles and cameo, and Kane is no exception. As his wounded best friend, Joseph Cotten holds his own with panache and emotion, and all the supporting turns are fine, amplified by the then novel overlapping naturalistic dialogue to make this one of the most alive films of all time.Citizen Kane also marked a turning point in talkies, where they ceased to be neatly illustrated plays or books and became something else: something that is meant to work primarily on a screen. Whereas classics of the silent and later were defined by frames (like a painting) or dialogue (like a novel or play), Citizen Kane is defined by movement and editing, juxtapositions of moments and images, duration of frames and nature of cuts. It was the first film, and to this day one of the very few films to fully make use of the complete film-making arsenal. that it is endlessly entertaining as a story (kudos to screenwriter Mankiewitz) is the icing on an extremely alluring cake.""Citizen Kane"" often grabs the number 1 spot in critic polls, and for all its technical and artistic excellence, its entertaining nature makes it easy to appreciate throughout the ages, something a Kubrick or a Tarkovskyhave never achieved despite their brilliance.hands down one of the best films of all time!"
hooman13,"Mar 31, 2000",10/10,"Citizen Kane is so far the most admired movie by the film critics and movie makers all over the world. There are many reasons to love this masterpiece, including many technical achievements which helped the further development of cinema as well as the deep meanings behind it such as: the wealth and love can bring misery rather than happiness or how difficult it is to judge a person when we find out the reasons behind his acts as well as how can a person be mean and selfish as well as considering and generous during the different periods of his life. Don't expect to love this movie right away after the first time watching it. Citizen Kane is a movie that should be watched several times. You should read about it, you should think about the deep meanings beside it, and you should pay attention to it's unique cinematography, editing as well as it's special effects, for example the fact that the beautiful mansion in the movie was mostly paintings on glass. Also try to read about the life of the newspaper industry icon William R. Hearst in which this movie is based on. Citizen Kane for sure is among the top 10 movies of my life."
salfamily,"Sep 28, 2001",10/10,"Is Citizen Kane the greatest film of all time? Who cares? The fact that it's great is qualification enough.While I can't say I'm surprised that so many have called this movie ""boring"" (the success of Jerry Bruckheimer hasn't escaped me, after all), I will say that I'm disheartened. I've always found the picture to be breathtaking, even exuberant, throughout its entire 119-minute running time. The sound and dialogue have a crackling wit to them, and the visuals! What can be said of Toland's cinematography that hasn't already been stated a million times over?No, Citizen Kane is not emotionally jarring, and we don't necessarily feel any sympathy for any of its characters. We are not meant to identify with the movie's hero, Charles Foster Kane. We're merely asked to be intrigued by him, to contemplate his situation and how he came to it.If the revelation that comes at the end of the film is a letdown, well, it's supposed to be. Ultimately, Rosebud is no more important to Kane the man than the girl with the white parasol is to Kane's assistant, Mr. Bernstein-- the girl whom Bernstein saw on a ferry dock one day and then never forgot. Rosebud is a remembrance, perhaps a symbol of youth or a transcendence that was never achieved, that has no significance outside of Kane's own mind. The revelation of what it truly is underscores the futility of trying to fathom and define a man's motivations-- it explains nothing.But Rosebud's function within the film is clear-- it's the key that Welles and his collaborators use to open up the world of Charles Foster Kane and then spin us through it. And what a trip it is! The structure of the narrative and the visual program play out in a surprising, almost gleeful way (although people call it ""slow,"" I always find myself exhausted trying to keep up with what the movie throws at me). After I've watched it, I often have trouble pinpointing where exactly in the film certain scenes occur. It's almost too rich, too varied, to subtract from.I also disagree with the notion that Citizen Kane is a ""cold"" movie. Several scenes emit a strong (if reserved) emotional warmth (those in which Kane first meets his mistress come to mind) while others are quite humorous (the razor sharp dialogue and the dead-on timing of the actors contribute substantially to this). And besides, not every movie is meant to give you a warm fuzzy feeling inside; not all set out to make you cry. Some simply dazzle you with the brilliance of their conception and force you to reconfigure your notions of what a movie can be."
jaywolfenstien,"Oct 28, 2003",N/A,"Or at least one of my favorites.  The very first viewing of Citizen Kane I didn't much care for.  I didn't hate the movie, and it had its originality and it was definitely different than anything than I was used to.  Maybe it's because at the time, I wasn't as into older films and the dramatic difference in film styles came as too much of a shock.  Who knows.  But a film widely considered by critics as one of the greatest films of all time had to have something going for it.  I gave it a second chance and really liked it.  In fact, I liked it enough to sit through both commentaries on the DVD.What I love most about Kane is its simplicity and it's relaxed pace: a story about one person who never did anything too terribly exciting in terms of fighting in a war or some grand action scene(s).  By the end of the movie, a lot of modern film goers would argue that nothing happened throughout the length of its running time, but in reality, quite a bit has happened in the carefully planned and arranged narrative as we explore Charles Foster Kane's history and personality.  The film spares no detail in addressing Charles as he grew up and matured--what he was and what he became, and yet it never lingers on any one era of his life too long.  Mankiewicz and Welles spent just enough time in key places to communicate necessary points and move on, reaching each keypoint at its own comfortable pace . . . and, again, having grown up in a generation of epileptic cutting it did take me one full viewing to get used to entire scenes shot from one camera angle.I could go into detail on other landmark aspects that other reviewers, no doubt, have already covered - however, I don't see it necessary to repeat it all.  Besides, if anyone is interested the DVD features two commentaries by authoritative sources, Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert, both of whom do a better job than I could.  I will, however, say that like other `old' films such as Hitchcock, I thoroughly enjoy seeing films like Kane because in the craft I can see the cornerstone of generations of films that followed. It's like reminiscing over an old photo-album.And being a film-music fan, I have to comment on Bernard Herrmann's first film score.  While not my favorite, it deserved the Oscar nomination that it received.  Very few composers have come onto the film-scoring world as strongly as Herrmann did with Kane, and very very few scores have the heart of Herrmann's Citizen Kane.  From poking fun to at 'cliché' Opera to the depths of its leitmotif surrounding rosebud, this is a beautifully crafted score with one of the greatest ranges of sounds to contrast with the film's narrow subject matter.All in all, I love Citizen Kane because it utilizes all the techniques of its day (and even inventing quite a few) as tools to tell a story, but never does Kane lean on those tools to compensate for anything.  It doesn't hide behind hours of boring Kung Fu or hundreds of CGI droids, it doesn't invent some unwelcomed quirkiness to be `artistic', nor does it spill blood and guts like there's no tomorrow.  It tells its story, and the film is judged by the story it tells *like all films should be*"
Tubular_Bell,"Nov 25, 2006",10/10,"Most people who go around brandishing 1/10's for this movie are probably trying to stir a reaction, or are on a self-affirmation quest of sorts. Hey, if you watch this movie and don't enjoy it at all, do yourself a favour and don't try to rewrite history. Bashing the hell out of this movie is every bit as worthwhile as bashing Beethoven's 9th Symphony, or Da Vinci's Mona Lisa; no one cares. This IS one of the most significant, important, influential and striking movies ever made, and it has been relevant and innovative for more than 60 decades, and it's bound to be so for a long time. Get over it. Share your feelings if you wish but don't try to look smart. So there.Those who haven't yet watched the movie NEED to watch it if they have an interest on cinema, on what it represents and what it has represented for all this time. The movie is an important piece to movie history just like ""Rosebud"" was important to Kane. The thing is, this movie isn't just a historical document. It's a powerful, gripping story that is still significant to this day. I'm not willing to tell the whole story here - many have done that before me. It's more worthwhile to advise you to watch the movie, instead. This isn't a story to hear - it's a story to WITNESS.Movie buffs go crazy for this movie, and they have a right to do it. Citizen Kane's technical innovations and clever storytelling style really do play tricks with the viewer, and make an apparently simplistic (only on the surface!) story come alive. Of course, it's not a movie for everyone. One who's utterly unimpressed with the movie won't get any beating from ME. But even the most impatient ones should at least try to look through the surface. It's a rewarding movie, and deserves no less than 10 stars. Give the critics some credit on this one, for one."
juliemonfils,"Oct 24, 2020",7/10,"This film was innovative for its time because the use of deep focus allowed the audience to view both the foreground and the background in focus, so instead of movement from the camera the audience was able to follow other cues in the background. There was a fluidity to the scenes and less cuts because cinematographer, Greg Toland, was able to develop a frame where a whole room could be seen in one shot, rather than having to show the character moving around constantly. I noted this first in an instance with the shot in the scene where Mrs. Kane is shown sitting inside with Mr. Thatcher at the table, Mr. Kane standing in the mid ground, and a young Charles Kane is shown in the background out the window playing in the snow while the adults inside discussed paperwork. Because this film is told from the point of view of a flashback, it makes it harder to follow the story through the interviewers accounts, but the story was interesting and required some thought."
MrJLove,"Feb 3, 1999",1/10,"Citizen Kane has always been regarded as a great movie and even makes the IMDB's top 250 list. But friends, from the viewpoint of this twentysomething, Citizen Kane is a long, drawn-out, torturous film. Perhaps it's because I'm from a generation where 100 million USD budgets are commonplace for any ""epic,"" but CK lacks what makes a good movie for me. The ""new"" editing and filming techniques Orson Welles used were fairly uninteresting, his story was mildly entertaining at best, and all the focus on ""Rosebud"" was simply ridiculous. The scene where Kane says Rosebud moves fast and is edited jaggedly, yet the whole film revolves on it for people. I find that curious.So beware of all the hoopla for Citizen Kane, I find it misplaced. It is a relic of the motion picture industry and should be stocked away accordingly."
gavin6942,"Nov 21, 2014",8/10,"Following the death of a publishing tycoon (Orson Welles), news reporters scramble to discover the meaning of his final utterance.What stands out about this film is the cinematography, not just the concept of ""deep focus"" (which puts so much in a single frame, such as young Charles out the window) but also the use of the lowered floor to make people larger than life. For students of film, this is one they must see early in order to fully grasp the importance of the camera.What is also interesting about this film is its rising and then falling star over the years. Disappointing on its first release, booed at the Oscars, and silenced out of existence... it later rose to be considered by many as the greatest film in cinema history. Now, since the 1990s, it seems to be slipping again. Not that IMDb is an authority, but it has fallen from the site's top spot to much lower. How far will it fall?"
gmatusk,"Mar 16, 2005",10/10,"There's not much I can add to what's already been said about this much-discussed classic, but I would like to comment on the revisionist trend of Best Movie lists to downgrade this film from its traditional #1 position. For instance, the original list compiled by ""Entertainment Weekly"" critics rated ""Citizen Kane"" #1, but then a subsequent list moved ""The Godfather"" into #1 position.Well, I've watched ""Citizen Kane"" with pleasure at least 25 times, but 3 times around with ""The Godfather"" is enough for me! And if critics are just sick and tired of rating ""Kane"" #1, then I can think of better replacements than ""The Godfather"" -- for instance, any hilarious comedy written & directed by Preston Sturges -- ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" springs to mind -- or Billy Wilder's ""Some Like It Hot"" (#1 on AFI's comedy list). I think comedy is ultimately more profound than tragedy, so I don't see why a comedy can't be considered for the top spot. Comedies also tend to be overlooked at Acadeny Award time.But I suppose I'm unusual in that I think ""Citizen Kane"" has many fine comedic touches (the flustered vocal coach and prompter during the opera sequences would be one instance). I realize that, overall, it's a tragic drama, but there are quite a few comic highlights along the way. It's a very entertaining film.Finally, in the interests of ""truth-in-advertising,"" I should mention that I have a personal reason for my interest in ""Citizen Kane"" --- I am related (not by blood, but by the marriage of one of my dad's sisters) to members of the Missouri branch of the Hearst family. So 3 of my cousins are, in turn, distant cousins of Patty Hearst. And my late uncle, Richard Hearst, told me of family visits by the real Citizen Kane, William Randolph Hearst, who handed out silver dollars to the kids (my uncle was one of the kids). All my Hearst cousins like the film --- but I suppose some of the California Hearsts might be less enthusiastic about this classic film."
wicked_smart12,"May 4, 2005",10/10,"More people who voted on this movie gave it a 1 than a 5 (1 being the lowest, 5 being medium, 10 obviously the highest). These people are brain dead. They don't watch movies to be challenged. They look at movies the way a child looks at a puppet show. They need to be constantly entertained every second before they lose interest or they'll walk off and find something more visually arresting to entertain themselves with. It's sad, but I believe it's true. Citizen Kane influenced film-making period. Not just a particular genre or a director - film-making. I can understand a person not understanding all its technical achievements, after all most of us didn't go to film school (I sure didn't). But giving a movie like Citizen Kane a 1 - the lowest possible rating for a movie - warrants total ignorance on the part of the viewer. I'm embarrassed for our society when I see these things happen."
oldskool84,"Sep 29, 2001",10/10,"What can I say that hasn't been said already on this masterpiece. The first time I saw Citizen Kane I wasn't that impressed with it. My opinion of Citizen Kane was that it was a good film but definitely not the best picture ever made. When a movie is so hyped up you can't help but be dissapointed but on my second viewing I was amazed by the film. This is probably the best experience I've ever had watching a film. You can feel the energy and youthfulness in the picture and you could sense that the filmmakers were trying to push the boundaries of film and were not afraid to experiment.I still don't think that Citizen Kane is the best film ever made though, no film can be called the greatest. How can you prove that? You can have a favorite film but calling it the best is just ridiculous. Now I've heard alot of people say that the ending was terrible and it doesn't make sense. The thing is that the movie is not saying that Rosebud is the answer, right before the end Mr. Thompsons says that no one word can explain one man's life. That's the filmmakers telling you  what your about to see should not be taken as an explanation for Kane's life.I think Rosebud is the search for one's lost innocence or childhood. The important parts of our life that we want to remember. I think Citizen Kane is about humanity, our search for understanding and meaning of our lives and how we lose ourselves in the things that don't matter. Anyway that's just my opinion. To all the people who didn't enjoy this movie, I would encourage them to see it again and you'll be rewarded. For anybody to truly appreciate any of the great films you must watch it more than once. There is so many things I would like to say but that's how life works, you never get to say everything you feel."
silentium,"Jul 30, 2003",10/10,"So sayeth Charles Foster Kane -- a bigshot stock-holder who is arrogant and cynical. But this is what interests us; not the honest american making his way through honest methods -- we like to see scandals and heart-ache. It enthralls us.What made this film important was it's narrative, which transcended typical movie fare and pioneered new age film-making. The visual trickery and camera mastery is so apparent. Welles created this at age 25 -- I applaud him.This film is artistic in its direction, but it's story is much more poignant, even today. One thing I remember off the top of my head was the cockatoo that lacked and eye - it squawked and then dissolved. Leaving John Q. movie-goer wondering what the deal was with this one. So, this guides us into looking deeper. There are moments of apparent visual trickery - and then there are moments of genius subtlety. The shadows that often look so really are often hinting at something behind the eye, something we have to feel instead of see. Is this the best ever? I don't think it bests The Godfather, but I think it runs a close race and dismisses other classics with ease.A+: A grand achievement that will long be remembered. Hollywood directors should focus more on deeply intimate stories instead of their regular tripe."
Histrymaker,"Nov 17, 2003",N/A,"Citizen Kane...not many films can measure up to its level.  This dramatic film portrays the life of one man: Charles Foster Kane, a ruthless newspaper man who leaves one word in his rememberance: Rosebud. The entire film looks into this man's life through the views of his closest friends and aquaintances.   It also begins and ends with his death, and follows closely with the missing puzzle piece to his life, rosebud.This movie was far ahead of its time.  It was the first film ever to use special effects, and most of it is unbeknownst to the viewer.  The film is rich in symbolism to answer the questions of how and why something happens.To be perfectly honest, this seems to be a basic black and white film that in todays culture would be unattractive and boring.  But it is much more than that.  And the makeup was enthralling!  They were able to make a 24 year old Orson Welles a some 70 year old man, and make it totally inconspicuous.  Not many films, even today, can do that.This film was very exciting and worth many viewings, and is the epitome of all films, which is why so many other productions have followed in the footsteps of this one outstanding film: Citizen Kane."
helen_king22,"Oct 11, 2024",6/10,"Good classic film. Charles Foster Kane's last word: Rosebud. The movie begins with an unforgettable newsreel montage summarizing the man's life. From there on, the viewer is thrown into a gloriously chaotic world of flashbacks upon flashbacks, in which the viewer slowly learns just about everything about Charles Foster Kane's enthralling life. From his trying childhood to his rise to power to the pinnacle of his success to his marital difficulties to his fall from grace, the story of Charles Foster Kane is presented for the viewer in a way that few other movies can offer: magically. Citizen Kane, undeniably, is a triumph.6/10."
mcawesome,"Nov 7, 2001",5/10,"Pick up any guide about movies, particularly one written by a professional movie critic, and ""Citizen Kane"" is rated the best or near the top of the list of movies ever made.  There is no question that Orson Welles coalesced many film-making techniques of the thirties, as well as innovations of his own, in producing ""Citizen Kane"".  Additionally, at the time of release in 1941, there was great pressure brought to bear on Welles and the studio not to put the film out due to its (fictionalized) portrayal of powerful publisher William Randolph Hearst.  All very admirable, but does it make for a great movie?  Not in my opinion.The story itself is not all that remarkable.  The characters, including Kane, are not overly engaging and I never found myself caring what happened to any of them.  Parts of the film are staggeringly boring.  It takes a good 15 minutes for the plot -- or what there is of a plot -- to get moving. Yes, certain techniques of directing, camera angles, flashbacks, and the like, are interesting from a scholarly viewpoint. However, the real interest of a dramatic film should come from interesting characterizations, a good story, and tension amongst the characters.  In these critical areas, ""Citizen Kane"" is sorely lacking.Watch this movie if you are a film scholar, professional or amateur, or if you want to see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, this film is wildly overrated."
davelucas1974,"Apr 1, 2013",10/10,"www.TheMovieFrog.com Classic Cinema Series #2 - Citizen Kane #2Starting a review for Citizen Kane feels a lot like starting a review for Casablanca did. What am I going to say about the film Roger Ebert has dubbed ""the greatest of all time"" that hasn't been said before? EVERYONE knows that this is one of the most innovative and masterfully constructed movies ever told. It was drastically ahead of its time in terms of cinematography, editing, sound design, you name it. But we all knew these things long before I started this article.I could certainly write a whole review about the acting, so naturalistic and understated for a picture of the time period. Welles is a revelation as Kane, with this marvelously smug yet confidential line delivery like he's talking down to you and honoring you with a secret wisdom at the same time. Agnes Moorehead is positively creepy as the loving mother who has completely turned her emotions off in order to do what's best for her son. Dorothy Comingore absolutely blows me away as Susan Alexander Kane, probably the most fully realized character not featured in the title. Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, the movie is full of great performances. Again...we knew this going in.I could speak at great length about the film's groundbreaking narrative structure. We begin with the end of the story, then we get a brief overview that lays the ground work for the sub plot that creates the structure for the rest of the movie. Then we see different, shifting periods in Kane's life through the eyes of several different characters who all have their own take on who the man was. This may not seem so significant in an age where film makers like Nolan and Tarantino regularly turn chronology on its head, but these men owe a huge debt to Welles for showing them how it is done long before they were born. But...we knew this.I could write a piece in which the central point is that Citizen Kane is one of the most quietly busy films ever made, rife with symbolism. In the opening scene alone, we are treated to images of snow super-imposed over Kane's face symbolic of both an ending, and the story's beginning (which we don't know yet). We see the snow globe shatter, as Kane lets go of his... (continued at www.TheMovieFrog.com)"
CriticalViewing,"Apr 27, 2016",10/10,"This film by Orson Welles shows the end of the film first, but without explanation. The ensuring story, is about that explanation. It fills in the pieces of it as it goes along from various angles and viewpoints from those who knew him in some way in some point and time, or the few that actually managed to have a close relationship with Mr. Kane, such as his best friend Leland. This film capitalized it's black and white color base, use of low and high camera angles to show the power dynamic, and lighting most heavily to relay this story (outside of the ever clear use of diction in this, and many other, films). The film plays in a staggered time-wave while remaining logically chronological. It progresses with giving flashback moments of a forward moving story that we as the audience know from the opening scene, him dying alone saying ""Rosebud"" with his final breaths. The film makes great use of being filmed in black and white, to have stark shadow contrast, and of light 3-point lighting. Low key lighting is made dominant, but high key is used as well. Just as in life, there are happy times and there are not so happy, dark, fearful, stressful, depressed times. It is an autobiographical representation of real world William Randolph Hearst. Hearst hated the film and fought to keep it out of theaters, away from eyes that would view it and stick to it as truth of the extremely powerful man, how always has an air of a low camera angle following his life. Kane, becomes just as powerful, but the dark side to all of his success, and all of his and those close to him, such as his wife. The Welles rendition both shows the extravagance and aired out the dirty laundry of it all. He kept the fact that Hearst was a hard working man with the drive and ambition, dedication to success and charm, that helped bring him to the top. But he added in the bad, which was distasteful and unacceptable to Hearst. Still this film remains in circulation, and the cinematic prowess with which this story is told remains one of the many great American film classics."
g-britosgutierre,"Nov 8, 2016",10/10,"Orson Welles breakthrough hit had me in awe of the fantastic job the crew had done in all aspects. The cinematography was beautiful, kudos to Gregg Toland. There was focus on the intricate settings, but also on the emotional expressions of each character, connecting their feelings with the love they have for the deceased Kane. The camera panned, shaped, and angled so that it felt like we were on those stairs when he shouted at Getty's, it felt like we were there when the results of the election came in as well. Another great aspect were the players, introducing stars that became well known to the public after the movie was put on the big screen. There was focus, depth, and a great story that made this film a brilliant success."
eroberts-93865,"Dec 11, 2015",9/10,"Citizen Kane is tremendous, to say the least. The film feels larger than life. Not just conceptually, not just in the sum of all its parts, but also through smaller things like sound design, camera movement, set design, lighting, moving performances and even tiny scraps of dialogue.When each component of a movie serves that movie so well, they can be forgotten. The final product seems to transcend equipment and technique, though they are obviously imperative to the film the audience ends up seeing.The sense of space conveyed by the film is incredible. The larger-than-life feeling that even strikes the audience plays well to the character of Charles Foster Kane, as well as to the ""point"" of the movie itself. The spaces within the movie get bigger and bigger as it goes on, and as Kane's life goes along and his riches grow. Those in the film who are searching for the meaning of Kane's last words are moving into bigger and bigger spaces, in the company of more and more important people, but getting no closer to the point. In many ways, this is how Kane's life itself is portrayed to feel. All of the money, statues, square footage in the world could not lead him to a meaning, to a sense of fulfillment. One scene in particular comes to mind in relation to this: a conversation between Kane and Susan in a parlor of their mansion. They need to shout across the room to one another, and their echoes show the audience how empty material pleasures can be.The performances in the movie are fantastic as well. Small and simple movements or expressions carry dialogue that seems small but feels quite heavy, even to those watching. This is the result of that rare combination of excellent writing acted out by just the right actor.In many of these ""smaller"" factors, Citizen Kane seems to have hit the lottery. Each aspect is great in its own right, and fits just perfectly with each other piece. There aren't many other movies like that."

jasmanius,"Jan 6, 2000",7/10,"A few weeks ago I was in the position to see Casablanca and Citizen Kane in the same week, after not having seen them for a long time. I came to the conclusion that Casablanca was still a great movie, and that CK was not that good after all. It's actually very boring and slow. The acting is, except for the last part, not convincing and at times really outdated. The film-techniques that are supposed to be that great, didn't help the story at all, and that should be the main purpose of any technique. My conclusion is that CK is still a hype, and it doesn't deserve to be one. Maybe it's worth the 250th place in the poll, just for the supposed historic importance (which I don't get, but I give the 'learned' some credit)."
have_a_nice_day131,"Nov 11, 2007",1/10,"I don't need a lot of action and car chases in order to like a movie. I just need a good script and good acting. This movie had neither. For those who don't know the premise a group of reporters try to find the meaning of a millionaire's last word..Rosebud. It's a good premise, but executed horribly. All of the characters and the actors playing them are dull and unrealistic. The dialogue is boring, and sometimes even laughably bad (""Let's all go to the window""). The cinematography is simple and dull, and the plot is incredibly predictable. Those who like this movie need some explaining to do. All I've heard from them is ""you're an idiot if you don't like this movie."" Is the only reason these people enjoy Citizen Kane because they're snobs who are too good for quality cinema? I challenge these people to find one redeemable quality of this atrocious film. Then I might reconsider my position."
seanwilson556,"Mar 8, 2011",10/10,"Maybe it's because the newer generation aren't into the older films. Maybe it's because they aren't fans of black and white films. Maybe it's because they find it ""dull"" and ""boring"". The sad thing is: I am in the new generation. I've not met anyone my age (21) who enjoyed Citizen Kane or don't bother because it is ""too old"". A lot of people my age who use IMDb love this but we are in the minority. It really is sad.Citizen Kane is a tough film. It's tough because the main character, Charles Foster Kane, isn't really a very nice man. The viewer follows this mans amazing journey but also leads to some bleak and dark moments in his life. So it might be tough to watch 2 hours of Charles Foster Kane (played to perfection by Orson Welles) but don't give up. The acting is unforgettable from Welles, Dorothy Comingore, Joseph Cotten, Everett Sloane and especially William Alland as the reporter Jerry Thompson even though we never see his face. Terrific and innovative move from (also director) Welles.The cinematography is exquisite. Containing dark rooms and hallways and offices with beaming light soaring through the windows, it just looks lovely. The lightness (and darkness) play important roles as well in Citizen Kane. Many times actors faces (including Welles and Alland as previously mentioned) are covered in the darkness to show sometimes the corruption and lies a ""picture perfect"" businessman can be. Darkness dwells in all of us but we don't always see it. Along with the lovely cinematography is the creative and gorgeous camera shots. Welles utilises long takes and some wonderful crane shots which show us the larger than life characters in a larger than life world. Just look at Kane's mansion and you'll notice the dream-like castle he lives in.It's a masterpiece that almost wholeheartedly deserves the moniker: Greatest Film Ever Made. It's definitely not for everyone's taste. But it's a film that eventually got highly praised in terms of story, camera work, cinematography, acting and it's non-linear style. It's not my personal favourite but I can't say anything bad about this film (apart from the newsreel footage of Kane's life, I find it annoying). It will hopefully live on to entertain newer generations.Sean."
StanleyStrangelove,"Sep 2, 2005",10/10,"Citizen Kane is wunderkind Orson Welle's first film and has been considered by critics and directors for the past 50 years as the best film ever made. It's #1 on the American Film Institute's top 100 best films. Charles Foster Kane is a publisher of a yellow journalism newspaper. He becomes rich and powerful and establishes a publishing empire. He builds a costly mansion for his wife, Xanadu. Citizen Kane is the story of his rise and fall. Joseph Cotten is Kane's friend and partner but their relationship deteriorates over the years. The structure of the movie is told in flashbacks which keeps the film moving. The movie was a box office flop. But for decades it's been discussed and dissected in film classes. It's a great character study filled with interesting characters and great dialogue and the movie deserves to be at the top of the list."
brandondboucher,"Oct 4, 2005",10/10,"""Citizen Kane"" is a very well-written movie with a great plot and wondrous character development centered around one man. What's more is how impressive of an achievement it is for the director, Orson Welles. It was his debut film and he directed, co-wrote and starred in it. It is a defining piece which, at least for me, serves as a basis for other films. I would categorize it as a drama/mystery film, though in some ways it resembles a tragedy. However, saying anymore would disclose too much information. The only advice I can give is this: when you watch it, watch it with a clear mind and be patient. The movie does take some time to get started, but patience pays off bountifully. After that the pace is perfect and keeps the viewer engaged. Not much more can be said of this film, just watch it and experience it for yourself."
wereuat06-1,"Dec 15, 2006",9/10,"Citizen Kane (according to the American Film Institute) is the greatest film ever made.I can assure any readers one thing: Citizen Kane is timeless. I am not simply following the crowd, as I thought one to many official movie reviewers were doing. I agree with them Citizen Kane lives up to the hype, just about.Citizen Kane is nearly perfect, and were it not for some small details in the second half of the film, it would be.Nearly everything perfect. The musical score, in particular, is the best I've ever seen. The film has charisma, charm. The acting is impeccable. The script fantastic. It's epic. And all done by a 25-year-old, which really gives it full marks.And especially for the time, it must have been incredible. The cinematography, the landmark qualities, everything was so original and new. But in the final half hour, deeper insight is necessary. We are left hanging on a thread, wondering especially after some incidents how the newsroom is going. We know little of Kane newspapers, though the dilemmas in his personal life are particularly well played out."
frank_olthoff,"Jul 2, 2001",N/A,"With the impressive surrealism of ""Caligari"" and the gross realism of ""Potemkin,"" ""Citizen Kane"" remains a masterpiece of film history. Orson Welles, its 26-year-old creator, achieved a lot with his ensemble of fine character actors and actresses. Despite its age, there is still some touch of its near-to-sensational inventiveness to be felt, which is basically due to Gregg Toland's brilliant photography which combined low-key crime story lighting and grand melodrama camera craftsmanship. Art direction and special effects, too, are conducive to the whole. Although awarded only one Oscar, Welles established his reputation as a genius, and there is an ironic hint at his earlier ""War of the Worlds"" success when Kane warns a reporter in the beginning: ""Don't believe everything you hear on the radio."" Its working title being ""American,"" the picture's original criticism of newspaper tycoon Hearst is worth more than a latterday footnote, although its omission seems to add to the timelessness of ""Citizen Kane.""Of the players, I still couldn't make out Edmund Cobb (as a reporter), who appeared as the bad guy in some 170 or more B westerns from 1930 to 1950, plus a couple of A's such as ""Winchester '73"" and ""River of No Return."" I did actually discern Alan Ladd this time, I think. - Welles does a good acting job, too, as does his favourite, Joseph Cotten (""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" ""The Third Man""). Moorehead and Sloane of the Mercury Theatre stock company are wonderful, but Ray Collins' short performance as Jim Gettys, virtually reduced to his voice as he hardly mimes and moves, is outstanding to me. This is a pic worth seeing a hundred times, not least because of its humanistic message."
davidkelly1977,"Mar 14, 2004",6/10,"I am another person who really couldnt wait to watch this movie. It has been voted best movie ever in so many polls I was waiting to be blown away in some way. Dont get me wrong Im not one of these people who think a film cant be the best in the world unless it stars Arnold Schwartzawhatever, my DVD collection contains many genres from past and present. Except this one! I finally got around to buying the DVD. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and yes it is a good film, but best film ever? In my humble opinion this wouldnt even reach the top 50. I know that for its time it was technically brilliant and well ahead of its time. But I can think of other much better films from the 40s and earlier. To Kill A Mockingbird, Cape Fear, Night of the Hunter? This will probably get remade one day, and no doubt ruined. Bizarely enough, the welles character kind of reminds me of Michael Jackson. The success, the scandle, the building of a overstated theme home, the longing for a forgotten childhood, the buying of affection etc."

The actors were awful and the characters they played were even worse, i couldn't identify with any of them. The worst part of this movie was with out a doubt the plot, this movie was told mostly in flashbacks and could not hold my interest.This film also just went on and on and was way overdone.Overall this movie was visually pleasing but every other aspect of it just made this movie unbearable to watch."
shattenjager777,"Dec 8, 2004",10/10,"I've taken my time before commenting on what is usually considered the great American film masterpiece, but at this point I feel up to it--having now watched the film eight times and read four books about it as well as watching the documentary ""The Battle over Citizen Kane"" twice. No, it doesn't take that much effort to understand the film, but research can embolden a person.The first comment so many people now make is that ""Citizen Kane"" is not a work of genius, but they're wrong; it is a work of genius--four genii in tandem. Herman Mankiewicz was a self-destructive, crazy, egotistical Hollywood genius long before Orson Welles would define that phrase (though he was not, as some have contended in recent times, a Hollywood intellectual--he was a master of lowbrow screwball comedy in the 1930s--see Pauline Kael's book ""Raising Kane""); Orson Welles really was a genius, for all the things he wasn't; Greg Toland is perhaps the most famous and celebrated cinematographer in history to this day; and Bernard Herrman wrote seemingly every memorable film score from 1940 through 1970 (including what I consider the greatest film score of all time, ""Psycho"").""Citizen Kane"" also did not receive bad reviews upon its release; it received unbelievable raves. I read over 20 contemporary reviews of the film and over half of them called it the greatest film of all time, and the least adulatory called it a ""good film"" but not quite a ""great film."" How we've had it come down to us from history that ""Kane"" received bad reviews upon release, I don't know; but it is patently untrue. It received fewer reviews than many films because of the Hearst boycott, but those it did receive were all adulatory.Now that I've dispelled some annoying myths about the film, I'll speak of the film itself. Perhaps its most notable quality is its beautiful and strange look created by Greg Toland and Orson Welles (how much each did is a matter of some conjecture). It is loaded with brilliant high-contrast lighting; large, mostly vacant, stage-like sets; and odd camera angles that give it a distinctive look that would then be appropriated by the film noir genre.However, what truly holds the film together is one of the greatest characters and performances in film history. Not truly William Randolph Hearst but rather an amalgam of big media types, including Hearst; Charles Foster Kane is an amazing character and Orson Welles's performance is nothing short of extraordinary--from the somewhat awkward dancing in the song scene to the unsure look on his face when Jed Leland asks for the Declaration of Principles to the way his physical mannerisms change as he ages, Welles crafts a wonderful performance. But if you're looking to define Kane by one moment in the film, it's not ""Rosebud,"" it's the speech Jed Leland gives about him, saying correctly, ""that's his story.""The other performances in the film are also top-notch, highlighted by Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander, Joseph Cotten (whose performance may even equal Welles's, though his part is much less showy) as Jed Leland, and the beautiful Ruth Warrick as Emily Monroe Norton.Of all of this film's innovations, its use of music may be the most important. Music as a scene transition device was a radio trick, but since ""Citizen Kane,"" it's become standard in film as well. Bernard Herrman provided a score that is mostly brilliant, if at times a bit over-dramatic.""Citizen Kane"" is fascinating and, above all, fun. It's loaded with great small pieces of humor (""Kane Elected""--""Fraud at Polls,"" for example) and has all of the intellectual and academic fulfillment one could want in a film. It's not, as are many ""great"" movies, something only for film-studying intellectuals; ""Citizen Kane"" is a wonderful work for the masses all the way around."
nelliebell-1,"Mar 28, 2004",10/10,"The motion picture Citizen Kane is most recently being marketed in a two disc special edition from Warner Brothers.The one disc is of course Citizen Kane and the second disc is entitled,The Battle over Citizen Kane-Special Features.I would recommend if you are in the market for the movie get the two disc special edition.It is important to understand why or at least how come this movie is so highly thought of,the second disc will assist the would be viewer in determining what kind of a problem are we up against.I originally saw Citizen Kane somewhere around 1970-1971 and I did feel it was interesting, however what about when you cant put your finger on it but its still there? Thats somewhat how this film was then and this time around I know why.The film was in part about Orson Welles own life however much is as I was aware of upon the initial viewing many years ago about William Randolph Hearst.This area is why I recommend the special edition.Hearst is the one who said you send me the prose and I'll provide the war,this is not meant to excite it is meant to warn you as to what your up against.Hearst was a very dangerous and even frightening character because according to the information that was provided he may have contributed to the assassination of President McKinley.This special disc will provide enough material so that you find that when we talk about undue influence,propaganda,areas like creating your own stories just to increase circulation and very unseemly attributes,there was know one more powerful nor influential then Hearst.The idea of what all this influence means was virtually invented by Hearst and this is what I mean when to suggest that what is in fact reality is not the well spring of a Democracy but of a horse of a different color and that is the death of a democracy.There are no dreams only the pedalling of a system and its undue influence and Hearst was an important part of a lie that we are even today suffering the effects of.There is good reason why this film is thought of so highly because like some other films they tend to comment on reality without knowing just how justice in this heart and this mind sees what it has attempted to accomplish.The idea of influence is perhaps like the power of suggestion it electrifies the night air,it maybe the impostor we are looking for,I kid you not.In fact this type of a discourse has provided a underpinning to some of the twentieth centuries most serious calamities.The idea of false importance is of a worthy psychological look see as well as the problem that we are drawn to now take a look at-This film is smart and if such considerations are somewhere even if only on the shelf somewhere it might be worth viewing.These items are of course not mentioned lightly and indeed there consequences do not go away simply,they must be dealt with because this is a problem.In a manner of speaking the call is yours as to the purport of this two disc edition and the films place in film history.P.S. Do not take the idea about ""rosebud"" seriously,upon the initial viewing I seem to recall that rosebud was the name on his sled.This film is something of a satirical look at the life and times of William Randolph Hearst."
smcguirk-88356,"Apr 12, 2016",10/10,This movie was an all around great movie and lived up to it's reputation as being one of the best movies ever made. Even though some think it is boring due to the fact of the slow and old style it was filmed in. From the great screenplay to the superb acting throughout the entire movie. I especially like the lighting used and the way it fit the plot of the movie. The long scenes help build the plot and draw the audience in. The plot focuses around the word Rosebud since they were Citizen Kane's last words he spoke before he died. The story was simple and easy to understand even though the use of flashbacks that were somewhat out of order.
alejandrothedirector,"Nov 2, 2012",10/10,"I had always admired Orson Welles but I'd never seen any of his films. I admired him because like myself he was an actor, magician and film director. I've always known that Citizen Kane was considered to be the greatest film of all time by many critics and yet, I still hadn't seen it. I finally got the opportunity to watch the film for the first time recently and it's climbed to become one of my favorites. Citizen Kane has themes as old as literature itself: love, ambition, corruption and the price of success to name a few. These themes are part of the human condition and some of my personal favorites, so the film strongly appealed to me. The most impressive asset of the film was Welles. In addition to directing and writing the film, he also starred in it. Considering that this was his first film and he was given complete creative control by RKO, it was monumental. The film's cinematography for its time was groundbreaking material, with camera shots that had never been seen before or had just been emerging, such as the use of deep focus so the audience looks at the whole scene. Knowing a little on Welles' personal life, one of the film's most interesting aspects was that in many ways Welles was Kane, gifted and a slave to his own hubris. The film portrays a life of riches as poor substitutes to love. All Kane ever wanted was to be loved like every human being, but he was stripped away from the moment he was taken away from his parents at a young age. He spends the rest of his life trying to relive that childlike wonder, which is what his sled is symbolic of. If he can't be happy, then he makes the lives of those around him miserable as well, such as pushing his second wife Susan towards an opera career that she never wanted. He spends his later years in Xandu, his own castle. He spends fortunes on statues, to the extent that they completely occupy his home and he even has doubles of the same ones. The only two possessions he cared about were his snow globe and his sled, which reminded him of the life he wanted to rekindle. This is filmmaking at its finest. Welles pushed the boundaries and made the film his way, with his people without RKO breathing down his neck. I believe the only criticism a person could give is that it is boring to them, which is a fair complaint considering the plethora of films that are out there today and how much more technologically advanced Hollywood has become since the early 40's. I feel as if ambitious or intellectual men will get the most fulfillment out of Citizen Kane. I personally give it a perfect rating."
Chris_Cadatal,"Nov 17, 2003",N/A,"Probably the most innovative film of all time, Citizen Kane provides a rich amount of visual artistry, groundbreaking editing techniques, and a complex, but powerful storyline for any viewer to enjoy.  Hands down, this film raised the bar and set the standard for what a real movie should be.Orson Welles, who starred in, directed, produced, and co-wrote this film, gave the movie industry a fresh new outlook on how movies should be made and presented.  Having already gained notoriety in radio, Welles took on the challenge of filmmaking when he was only 25 years old.  No one knew nor expected anything remarkable to come from Welles' work, but the cinematic genius produced a film worthy of being praised as the greatest film ever made.What sets this film apart from all of the other's made in that era up until now was the brilliant use of the camera.  Welles used many different angles and inventive lighting techniques in his shots to show the emotion within that scene, or the relationship between the characters of the movie. Aside from all of the technical aspects, Welles also had a lot of metaphoric and symbolic elements hidden in his film, however one cannot count or see all of the symbols and metaphors since these elements may be interpreted in different ways.  But in doing so, Welles broadened the views of his viewers, by making them think about every aspect of his film as opposed to just watching it.Citizen Kane depicts a man in a classic rags to riches story.  That man is Charles Foster Kane.  This film shows Kane's strategic climb up New York's social ladder and how he got to become a world-renowned newspaper tycoon. Kane's strong will and independence kept him on top.  But as the plot gets thicker, the audience sees that his `do it myself' attitude ultimately leads to his demise.  Kane was a man that had everything he ever wanted, except of course, happiness.  Something was missing, and as the movie got closer to the end, you could really see the emptiness in Kane's life.  He longed for something or someone called rosebud.  William Alland, who plays Jerry Thompson, the `News on the March' reporter trying to uncover Kane's life, best explains this idea.  In the movie, he says, `Mr. Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost. Anyway, I don't think it would have explained everything. I don't think any word can explain a man's life. No, I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle...a missing piece.'Ironically enough, the movie starts off with the end.  After grazing through Kane's estate, Xanadu, the viewer sees Kane on his deathbed saying his famous last word, `Rosebud', which by the actual end of the movie, the true meaning of rosebud is revealed to the audience without the actors in the film realizing it.With so much symbolism and artistry put into every scene, it is no wonder why Citizen Kane is considered as the greatest movie ever made.  This film changed the cinematic world one shot at a time.  It is undoubtedly a classic and truly one of the best American films out there."
CyndiReynolds4,"Nov 17, 2003",6/10,"According to many this is the best motion picture made.  Staring Orson Welles who also directed and wrote the story.  This is pretty incredible considering that he had never even set foot on a stage before. I guess you could say that he is a genius at that.  This interesting story takes on from the beginning. With its incredible lighting and shading techniques and the great way the beginning of the film fades from one photographic shot to another, as if each picture was blending into each other, this film was surely ahead of its time. `Citizen Kane' also introduced, to its audience, how much of an effect wealth can have over idealism.  The narrative techniques add a great deal to the film, it laid out the films setting for you.The camera starts at a fence with a sign that states no trespassing, then slowly fades into a barbed- wire fence, and lastly to an iron fence with iron flowers.  Kane's estate, Xavier, stands upon its man made hill surrounded by its lush landscape and a zoo as big as Noah's Arc.  The camera, disobeying the sign, creeps past the castles gates and into the yard showing incredible shots of the surroundings of the castle.  Each photograph fades into one another bringing you closer to the castle.Suddenly the camera reaches a window with the light on that gets turned off.  The shot fades to a hand holding small snow globe, unexpectedly the man whispers `rosebud' the snow globe drops and pieces of glass and water fly everywhere.  Later a woman covers the mans body as if he had died.  This first scene sets the rest of movie.  It shows what a powerful man Kane was. Across the world newspapers and radios were reporting this mans sudden death.Although Welles work was great, along with most films, it had its side of controversy.  `Citizen Kane' was a movie strangely parallel to William Randolph Hearst's life.  Hearst was known for his great writing on the Spanish-American war.  His type of journalism was known as yellow journalism.  Hearst felt the film was a plagiarism of his own career and wanted RKO to burn every copy and negatives they have of `Citizen Kane.'Orson Welles starred in, wrote, and directed `Citizen Kane.'  Though he never made a movie or starred in one, he was commended for his outstanding work.  He added much power and brilliance in this movie, which caused much controversy.   Though the film in its time was great and still today rated as one of the greatest movies of all time.  This reviewer gives it a six out of ten, just because it seemed like the greatest part of the movie was its cinematography.  I didn't find the movie line very interesting, but if you're an old film loving kind of person, this might be the movie for you."
bwright68,"Jan 10, 2019",10/10,"Orson Welles's Citizen Kane is a landmark in the history of Hollywood filmmaking. This is due in no small part to the unprecedented amount of creative control ceded to him by RKO Studios. Welles was unquestionably a genius, but his uncompromising desire for artistic integrity, coupled with filmic concepts and production methods deemed unconventional at the time, would prove to be not conducive with Hollywood's powers-that-be. Regrettably, the degree of freedom that would foster the realization of his cinematic debut was to never reoccur with any of the enfant terrible's subsequent films. As such, the magnum-opus that is Citizen Kane survives as a lasting testament to its auteur director's innovations. Welles's editing, cinematography, narration, mise en scene, sound, acting, and props are crucial elements in this regard.
Welles's manipulation of time was crucial in maintaining Citizen Kane's non-linear story. This was achieved, in part, through transitions consisting of dissolves and form cuts. For example, when Kane, the new owner of ""The Inquirer,"" asks why rival newspaper ""The Chronicle"" has a larger circulation, his loyal associate Bernstein (Everett Sloane) attributes it to their journalistic integrity. To clarify, he points to a photograph of ""The Chronicle""'s editorial staff. The image proceeds to fade out into a slow dissolve while simultaneously transitioning into a form cut of the same staff-members in identical staging positions, except this time posing for ""The Inquirer""'s photoshoot. Thus, Welles's cinematic language wordlessly advances the story by eliminating the time needed to show Kane buying his competition's integrity and loyalty.
The theme of being bought and sold applies to the protagonist's childhood as well. In particular, the scene when Charlie's parents ""give"" him to the banker Walter Parks Thatcher (George Colouris). In this instance, cinematographer Gregg Toland's use of deep focus and long camera takes help tell the story. The short lens used in this example provides the large depth of field which allows us to clearly see Charlie playing outside the window in the center frame's background. He is also the dominant in a frame within a frame, foreshadowing his imminent entrapment and loss of innocence. Additionally, the long camera takes give us time to take in information about the adult characters based on their acting. For example, the stern countenance and stoic posturing of Mrs. Kane (Agnes Moorehead) in the right foreground emphasizes her concentrated control over the details of Thatcher's contract (which is appropriate since it involves her son's welfare). Despite her patrician facade, Mrs. Kane wants Charles to have a better life, even if it has to be with a Wall Street executive as his guardian. Her husband, on the other hand, shambles from middle-ground to foreground, all the while babbling ineffectually like a doddering old fool. He is clearly not in control of the situation. The wide angle lens of deep focus photography allows all four characters in the shot to stay in focus regardless of which distance plane they are positioned in. Additionally, the lack of distracting edits allows for every aspect of the performances, along with the well planned mise en scene, to be taken in by the viewers on their own accord.
One way the apportioned facts about Kane are taken in by the audience is through the film's innovative narrative devices. There are two examples which occur early in the film that help us learn about our protagonist before we actually hear him tell his own story. The first way is achieved via newsreel footage announcing his death. It begins with the booming, non-synchronous narrator's voice announcing the death of Charles Foster Kane. Descriptions of his wealth and influence are accompanied by transitioning wipes of Xanadu (Kane's palatial residence), his extensive art collection, and a multitude of guests enjoying their stay in the war-profiteer's estate (an optically printed Adolf Hitler among them). The narrator also explains how the scandal of the newspaper tycoon's extramarital affair with Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) cost him his bid for politics. The second way we learn about Kane occurs in the darkened screening room when the ""March of Time"" newsreel ends. In his attempt to humanize Kane for a follow-up report, the newsreel director demands more background information on the deceased magnate. We are then able to parse out bits and pieces of speculation amidst the din of overlapping dialogue (a common Welles trope) that follows, including the current whereabouts of his second wife, Susan. This also provides a starting point for lead reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) to begin his investigation.
The starting point for the audience's investigation begins with the establishing shot of Xanadu. This same imagery also appears at the end of the film, essentially bookending the story. Although both emphasize his wealth, each scene offers a different takeaway for the viewer. For instance, the film opens with an ascending crane shot over the wrought iron ""K"" atop Xanadu's main gate. In the distance, Kane's palace (a matte painting) looms in the misty background which, like the protagonist, is shrouded in the unknown. Although we know little about Kane at this point, the roaming camera reveals a private zoo, golf courses, and docked gondolas materializing out of the fog. Clearly, a wealthy individual lives here. However, after we learn of his death, our perspective changes. For example, at the end of the film, a bird's-eye tracking shot (the camera mounted on an overhead cable) curates over the labyrinths of Kane's crated artwork. Xanadu's captured collection of empty opulence is not unlike that of the pyramids; both retaining riches of dismayed men inside their sepulchers of shattered dreams.
Occasionally, ear shattering sounds serve as signals for transitions occurring in Citizen Kane. Although the godlike newsreel introduction, ""News on the March!"" is a salient example, the most innovative (and bizarre) use of sound occurs in the third act to herald his wife's flight from her gilded cage. As the shot begins, a loud screech is heard from an enormous Cockatoo optically printed on the left side of the frame. Presumably, only the audience sees and hears the Cockatoo, although it's quite plausible the birdcall emanates from an aviary in Xanadu's zoo. This diegetic sound effect nonetheless signifies Mrs. Kane's cry for freedom, as well as mimicking her limited operatic vocal range. The bird's image then cross dissolves into a full shot of Kane approaching the bedroom, inside of which Susan hastily packs her suitcases. Like the Cockatoo, Susan Kane is seen by her husband as an object of beauty that must be amassed and stored alongside the other symbols of his material wealth. Like using his newspaper as a platform for yellow journalism, and the questionable ethics employed in his vying for public office, Susan's exit is another failure at control which leads to Kane's disillusionment.
The believability of Welles's character metamorphosing from a young entrepreneur into a disillusioned old recluse can be partly attributed to make up. However, the real method behind his portrayal of Kane's age progression is due to a convincing acting style. Originally trained as a stage actor, he cut his teeth treading the boards at an early age. The magnified emotional and physical expressions needed to convey the character's inner moments to a theater audience were perfectly suited for Kane's boundless energy and subsequent lethargy on the big screen. The scene, for example, in which young Kane is seen cavorting with all the dancing girls in ""The Inquirer"" newsroom is bristling with sheer youthful exuberance. The ceiling in the room is low, making it appear as if the structure itself cannot contain his energy. As he reaches middle age, his mannerisms are replaced by less physicality and more bellicose oratory in his self aggrandizement. The shot in which he confronts Boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins) in Susan's apartment is an example of this. As a younger man, he would have likely resorted to violence in the face of his opponent's blackmail threat. However, Welles' indicates Kane's decline with slower, more deliberate movement, such as his decision to not pursue Gettys down the apartment building's stairwells. Instead, he resorts to blustery bravado on the upper flight (like his campaign podium), exclaiming,""I'm Charles Foster Kane!"" By the end of the film, he is an aged and broken man alone in the cavernous catacombs of Xanadu. His girth, borne out of Dionysian decadence and disappointment, causes his trembling legs to shuffle along at a hesitant gate. Welles's innate theatrical dramatics conveys a visceral decrepitude, contributing a great amount of pathos to his iconic emergence from the ruins of Susan's bedroom. As he lethargically lumbers past his shocked domestic staff, and between two opposing mirrors, Kane's spiritual nadir is endlessly repeated into the illusory vanishing points of the props' myriad of images.
The prop that is most germane to the theme of Citizen Kane is the ""No Trespassing"" sign posted on Xanadu's main gate. Like a hieroglyphic curse intended to thwart grave robbers, the sign decries prying into Kane's enigmatic persona. At the outset, its mute warning goes unheeded by the advancing camera's single-minded scrutiny, as unyielding in its movement as Kane's headstrong temperament. Yet, despite the transgression into Xanadu's inner sanctum in which we are privy, Kane's only mortal self-disclosure occurs in his single-word valediction: ""rosebud."" Later, through his associates' excoriations and obsequies, we incrementally learn of the pyrrhic victories of Kane's ego. These present conflicting images of him as a crusading journalist, yet rhetorically stooping to ""Remember the Maine"" artifice; a champion of the working man, yet not approving of unions."

mkirit1,"Dec 24, 2014",1/10,"After learning that this is rated ""the best movie of all time"" in many surveys, I decided to watch it. I am confused who voted this the best movie, this movie is a nightmare. It is very boring and the story is so ordinary. It took me three days to finish watching it, after going to sleep the first two days. I kept at it expecting something interesting might happen, but nothing happens right till the end. Even the ending, which is supposed to reveal something enlightening, is very lame. Watching birds and squirrels is more interesting than watching this movie. Save your time and energy, avoid this movie, unless you want some frustration in your life."
ToldYaSo,"Jul 16, 1999",10/10,"The first time I saw ""Citizen Kane"" was in a Film Theory class where none of the film's finer points escape the notice of class or teacher. From factors which include history of the period in which the story is told, camera techniques, and most importantly the ground-breaking work done on the film, by then novice filmmaker Orson Welles.With the background story and attention to detail that a film class can illuminate for you, ""Citizen Kane"" can be an entertaining film to watch a number of times, as the camera angles and tricks employed are still interesting and appealing. What makes them more intriguing is to find out how unconventional they were at the time, and immediately recognize how truly commonplace they remain over fifty years later. It's hard for someone of my generation to appreciate unaided the finer qualities of this, the most stunning feature debut of all time.It's probably equally difficult for any feature filmmaker to not compare their first work to ""Citizen Kane"", and wonder how it measures up. The truth is, most directors can enjoy a far more popular reception of their film quite easily in comparison, as ""Citizen Kane"" was not received well due to the glaringly obvious portrayal and insult to media mogul William Randolph Hearst. While widely regarded as the finest film ever made this century, it lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""How Green Was My Valley"", which also goes to show how the Academy can often miss the mark completely.The truth is, ""Citizen Kane"" is a film lover's film. If you are not impressed by or aware of the technical details like lighting, editing, angles, tricks and bold innovations, you probably won't like it. There are other classic films that are perhaps more simplistic, which require not one iota of background explanation to understand, appreciate and enjoy the film. These are widely regarded as popular classics of a timeless nature, of which ""Kane"" doesn't seem to be.In an interesting and ironic twist in reflection of the film today, ""Citizen Kane"" will always remain a colourless, unaltered masterpiece much to the chagrin of William Randolph Hearst emulator Ted Turner. Turner's attempts to have it colourized were met with failure as contract specifications as laid out by the late Orson Welles clearly prohibit any such action or tampering with the film. For those of you who feel they will never watch it because it's not in colour, that's fine. We don't need you and you wouldn't like it anyway."
leosmith-11166,"Nov 23, 2015",9/10,"Citizen Kane is a timeless classic. In fact,it's probably the greatest film ever made(at least the AFI thinks so). Citizen Kane tells the story of Kane, an extremely weathly, but unhappy Newspaper tycoon, though the eyes of a reporter who is trying to find out what Kane's last words meant, Rosebud"". The film explores the darkness and depressiveness of humanity, and how money can't buy happiness.Most of the credit for this fantastic film should go to Orson Welles, as Wrote, Directed and Starred as Kane. The incredible talents of Welles, on and off the screen, really make the movie what it is. His acting is scarily good, the script is cleverly written and the direction is some of the greatest ever.Citizen Kane is truly a timeless Classic. By the end of the film, you will be trying to figure out was ""Rosebud"" means."
anthonydavid-25706,"Dec 18, 2015",9/10,"Citizen Kane is one of those films that you hear about a lot when studying film. After seeing the film, I can see why. I thought this film was great. Orson Wells does an awesome job telling a story through flashbacks. The dynamic between the characters is really cool as well. The acting, I thought, is really what shines about this film. Wells plays Kane himself, and no one could of done it better. Wells knew exactly how he wanted his loud, commanding chapter to be portrayed and he did exactly that. The editing is another great part of the film, flashbacks can be tricky but Wells does a graceful job in depicting it. The only criticism I would have is the dialog at many times seems like filler, as I was lost at time about what they were talking about, it seemed nonsensical. However, I sort of enjoy this aspect of movies sometimes, when the dialog is entertaining, which is true about this film. I would recommend it to anyone. It is truly a masterpiece in film."
Filmnerd1984,"Sep 10, 2009",10/10,"An utterly amazing film from start to finish. Orson Welles proves himself to be a master of cinema. not only a great and charismatic actor but also an accomplished director. Citizen Cane is considered by many to be the greatest film of all time. i now know what they mean, because this film is visually impressive in addition to having a great script and solid characters. but none captures the screen as the leading man himself. i loved the use of camera work which is used often by Welles. he films the more central characters or more powerful ones i should say in a way that makes them seem 8 feet tall. in the scene where wife number 2 is having a hissyfitt over getting bad reviews from her husbands own newspaper, Orson stands over here laying a wast shadow over her puny existence. he does not say it, but the scenes portray a kind of inaudible dialog saying i am Charles Foster Kane, who are you to question me?. well it is open for interpretation, but that is how i experienced it. i am ashamed of myself for waiting so long to see this extravagant chapter in motion picture history."
mermatt,"Jul 30, 1998",N/A,"This film deserves its reputation as probably the best film ever made because it is a wonderful study in how to tell a story. Even after the viewer knows the secret of the meaning of ""Rosebud,"" the story can be viewed over and over without losing its effect. > Rosebud is merely a story-telling device for the revelation of a man's character -- to the degree that any of us can know ourselves or anyone else. The lighting, symbolism, acting, and characterization can be studies in themselves long after the secret is known."

ncrypted-1,"Jan 28, 2005",10/10,"The main thing that stands out when watching Citizen Kane is that the techniques used in the cinematography were decades ahead of their time. Specifically, the rotoscoping in of reflections, the camera angles, and the ""pseudo-interview"". The camera angles used in Citizen Kane were not really picked up for common use until the early to mid 1980's. This film was the first to really integrate the perspective of the viewer to make an emotional and psychological impact outside of the typical movies of the time. It was a risk taken by Orson Welles, and has had impacts that reverberate to this day in the movies that we watch, though some directors do not even know ""why"" a camera angle holds so much impact. Viewing this movie as a time capsule of the art-deco period, and taking in the ""might of man"" attitude of the time period, it is easy to sense how Leni Riefenstahl and Ayn Rand both influenced the directors vision."

This is BIO pick about a man who rain a news paper. About good thing came to him when he was young. And how bad things came to him when he got old. And how he died saying rosebud. Find got the amazing mystery of why he said it. That is if you care boring. Citizen boring that is what they could have called it. I personally do not care why he said rosebud. I could tell you why but I do not like spoilers. All thou I am basically telling you not to see this boring crap. Well save big thrills for people who want to find out. This is one of very fellow movies I have been that looks like a horror movie made in those day but is not a horror movie. The horror movies in those days were great. But there were some boring crap made and this is one of them. Overrated boring crap at that. Good acting. But what a boring movie.
vman13,"Mar 17, 2004",10/10,"You are all probably thinking that I'm one of those people who like movies only because other people like them too. But I am in the firm belief that Citizen Kane stands as a masterpiece of the art of storytelling. As avid film watchers we all love to be told stories, and we love them to be told well. Citizen Kane is a milestone in American cinema, and is living proof of what a great movie can be. I can't think of another movie more complete and fully realized then Citizen Kane. Citizen Kane was made in 1941. Film makers have had 63 years to make a more influential film. I think we'll be waiting a very long time.Citizen Kane was starred, written, and directed by Orson Welles, and it was his FIRST movie!!! RKO Pictures took a big chance giving a first time film maker so much influence. Maybe if today's studios took more chances better movies would be made.There's nothing more I could possible say except watch and enjoy."
greenie-8,"Jan 22, 2000",10/10,This is the best movie of the century.  It was original and extremely well crafted.  Orson Welles was a genius.  Hollywood did not like him because at the time he was a maverick.  He didn't play by their rules. Citizen Kane had lighting and set design from the stage.  This made the camera angles even more extraordinary.  This was not common at the time. The acting by all was superb.  The story technique of using flashbacks has been copied and copied. It was by far the best use of this.  It is an original work.  It surpasses all of Welles' later works.
SnoopyStyle,"Aug 30, 2014",8/10,"Newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is dead in his palatial estate. His last word is ""Rosebud"" and reporters investigate what could it possibly mean to spice up his obituary newsreel. First they contact a drunken Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) who was Kane's dance hall girl second wife. There is Walter Parks Thatcher recollection of Kane's childhood and beyond as he first became his guardian and then became his biggest target. Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) was his partner in the newspaper business. Emily Monroe Norton Kane (Ruth Warrick) is his first wife who died in a car crash with their son.This is a technically superior movie. The scale is grand in its ambition. It's a character loosely based on newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. Almost all of the movie is one flashback after another which does take away some of the immediacy from the movie. It also clouds the character in second hand recollections. Despite that and the movie starts with a highlight reel of his life, the story remains fascinating."
Travis69,"Dec 10, 2003",10/10,"Aside from being argued as the technical genius of films, 1941's Citizen Kane also delivered plenty of ahead-of-its-time issues to the forefront: monopolization and celebrity doom. Citizen Kane is a film that charts the four-step life of entrepreneur Charles Foster Kane, a dramatic on-screen version of William Randolph Hurst, who merged his vast array of national newspapers and radio stations into an evil empire. The buying out (or making up) of other papers, such as the Chronicle for instance, along with his usual yellowish editorial tactics, helped the Enquirer become the voice of America; again only to be propagandized by one voice: Kane's.With popularity that skyrocketed nearly everyone but the president, Kane (the always masterful Mercury Theatre Radio guru, Orson Welles) looked to shoot even higher in politics-ala Larry Flynt-only to be dragged down by the same tabloid controversy he once seemingly mastered. This case will also recollect to the near chagrin Arnold Schwarzenegger took just days before election in this year's California gubernatorial race. Kane was sought fostering with a `singer,' much like the fun Arnold had during his `groping' days of Pumping Iron.Nothing in the film seems to swarm with more controversy, however, than Kane's final word, and the very search for, `Rosebud.' Was this Kane's second mistress? Or yet another one of his four-billion statues crated into a mover's worst nightmare? As you'll discover in the film's culmination, Rosebud was the only love Kane had for whom or what it was, and not because Kane wanted the love back; a rarity, since the gist of the film is about Kane desire for everyone's love. Again, this opening and closing to Citizen Kane is surrounded by the same aura the tabloid-edged Enquirer swelled upon the nation; of course it seems likely Kane would not have had it any other way. And much like America will always watch Schwarzenegger films (even more so now because he is governor), America then still read Kane newspapers, as Citizen Kane himself was always news-and if perhaps not the greatest, the most important film of all time.5/5 stars"
bigredintl,"Dec 6, 2006",N/A,"The limitations of the movie being in 'black and white' did not hinder the captivation of the viewer. The impact of Citizen Kane lies in mise-en-scene and the technical tools of film-making, lighting, framing, editing and angle. The most prominent cinematic technique used in Citizen Kane is probably the lighting. The director meant for it to be a dark picture with very heavy contrasts, so he used single source lighting. The objective was to use simple lighting devices in order to give the scene a certain ambiance and in some cases, to further develop the characters with the use of shadows. An example of single source lighting is when Thompson is reading Mr. Thatcher's memoirs. This single source light creates a sense of isolation which seems to accentuate Thompson's lonely quest. The way the light illuminates the room also says a great deal about Thatcher's personality, especially by how it illuminates the large portrait of him hanging on the wall. One of the most memorable times in the movie that a single light source was used is the scene where the reporters debate how they will add to the story. The bright light source that comes from the window is so soft that it, complimented by the cigarette smoke, covers most of the room in shadow. As a result, the characters are not easily seen. This scene is effective because it says a great deal about the reporters themselves, or at least how the directors wanted to portray them as; where they are not primary or main characters in the movie. Casting all of the reporters in shadow, implied that the director wanted the reporters to be seen as characters of no importance, not just as characters, but also as an institution when considering the media. The reporter scene also happens to be the strongest use of shadows and light, which is a more prevalent technique, used throughout the film that says more about character intentions and motivations. Shadows are used to express the ethical value of a character; they cast doubt on a character's reliability, or by the absence of shadow, display a character's innocence or truthful intentions. As opposed to the lighting of a scene, the use of shadow is more effective on a character. One of the most touching uses of shadow In the movie is during the scene where Kane reads the Inquirer's ""declaration of principles"", which he wrote. When he does this, he is cast in shadow as he reads the declaration but once he has finished reading, he is cast back into light. This says two things about Kane; regardless of whether his idealism is genuine, Kane does not have a strong enough character to persist with such principles. Shadows heavily used during the confrontation between Boss Gettys and Kane and his wife at the time at Susan Alexander's apartment.There is one scene in particular where Susan is standing between Gettys and Kane. In this scene both men are cast completely in shadow as opposed to her who is completely in light. This can be used to signify that both men are can be deemed as very dishonest people. Susan on the other hand is the innocent person in this quarrel. She is the victim of both men's ambition, which has forced her between them. Shadows were also used later in the film in order to display Kane's superiority over Susan. This is when she reads the horrible review about her by Leyland in the Enquirer. She tells Kane that she wishes to quit, but he demands that she continues singing. He stands up over her and she is covered by his shadow for a moment, suggesting his dominance over her. He intimidates her and she does continue with her career. Quality, direction, colour and source of light are large aspects of the scene where the reporters decided to find out what 'rosebud' means and therefore state the plot of the film. The quality of light is differentiated throughout the scene. The intensity and direction of the light source change depending upon who is speaking and the sources are intensified as the speaker's relevance increases. The main reporter, Thompson and his editor, Mr. Ralston, are highlighted and shadowed according to how big their roles are at a given time. From the beginning of the scene, Ralston's face is shadowed and his movement around the room is limited. While he is deciphering what he thinks about the news reel depicting Kane's life, his face is shadowed and dark as he moves across the set. Citizen Kane is still respected and admired because of the groundbreaking cinematic techniques that are just as inspirational to filmmakers today as they were fifty years ago."
scottemery,"May 2, 2012",7/10,"Citizen Kane has been labelled as one of the greatest movies ever made. The story of a newspaper tycoons life and how a reporter try's to find the meaning of his last word. Directed and starring Orson Welles.It pains me to say it but I found this film disappointing. I tried to go through my mind after the film searching for why I didn't enjoy it and I considered that maybe it was because of the age of the film, but then I remembered that there were many films from this era that I loved so that didn't stick. The only thing I could say is that maybe it was because it was literally the first big film after the new era of sound and at its time was considered groundbreaking while now it seems tepid. Even this reason doesn't really feel right with me and honestly I think it's down to the following reasons why I truly found this film a let down.The biggest hit to this film for me is the acting, it mentions at the credits that this film gave a first break for some of the actors and it really does show. Firstly though Welles acts his role perfectly as the love starved Kane, perfectly finding his electricity and his need for people to love him. Other than Cotton (perhaps the lead female deserves credit) I found the supporting cast poor in general but this is really to be expected as looking back to most pre 1960 film there are not normally more than two good actors in a film. This does not sound like much of bad point but I coming to why the acting in this film ruins it for me. There is one pivotal scene in the movie, the scene where the child is taken away towards the start. This scene was supposed to show the child's carefree nature and then how this is ripped from him by the corporation coming in and removing him from his family. The scene annoys me, the child actor does not portray the feeling of this emotion correctly and you watch feeling like it could of been done so much better and without this scene being done properly the metaphor for the film is lost. Now you may say this is harsh on the child actor but the people who made this film should have seen this and either re-shot with a different actor or thought of a different idea on how to work the loss felt by the child into the film.My second criticism of the film is partly to do with the way it is filmed, splicing different segments of his life story in different order due to them being told by different people. While I must firstly say this sort of thing in 1941 is groundbreaking and perhaps the fact that they even attempted it shows my following to be a moot point, but I still wouldn't expect this from the ""Greatest Film Ever Made"". Because of this way of film making the scenes with Kane himself are short and sharp, showing change in character very quickly, see scene with his first wife having dinner, this doesn't allow a true character arc. With more time spent in each scene perhaps a feel for the character or an understanding of why he changes could be seen. Also I would of preferred the film to have been perhaps 30 minutes longer to allow for more of Kane's character to be seen with perhaps some delving into his childhood or more of why he no longer ran the paper.I would like to make clear that while I did not completely love this film it must be seen as a groundbreaking film for its time and at the time, the best film ever made. It's use of camera angles and focus is far beyond anything seen in that age with some absolutely amazing cinematography. Two scenes stick out for me, but it must be said that there are many scenes throughout the film which look fantastic. Firstly where Kane is finishing Leland's review of his wife's performance and Leland slowly walks towards him from the distance showing Kane's madness and Leland trepidation of approaching him in one perfect shot. Secondly a scene where Kane signs away his newspaper shows Kane becoming smaller as he walks towards the window and then underneath it. It shows to our perception that the window is bigger than we think and that Kane himself has shrunk in stature.Lastly I would just like to add that after reading the film I read several posts on this films wall wondering why more was not said about Charlie's son. The people on the boards point to it as a flaw in the film while I claim it to be probably it's biggest success. The lack of attention to the child by Kane and the film overall(more so as a metaphor in terms of the film) is down to Kane's own loss of childhood. Being taken from his family and forced to grow too quickly causes Charles Kane to becoming a wreck, a man who will do anything to be loved. He buys possessions and creates a temple, he tries so hard to help the working man by promising to remove corruption and bring truth, he does anything for his wives but in the end does not listen to them thinking only selfishly. All of these thing's he does for love and attention but in the end the loss of his family and childhood leaves a gaping hole in a young Charlie and though he tries to fill this void he cannot, showing the true meaning of this film, and of of ""rosebud"", money cannot buy you happiness. 7/10"

KeithFerguson,"Apr 14, 2003",7/10,"If you want to make a movie seem even better than it already is, don't ever tell someone it is the greatest movie ever made. Not only will you most likely be telling the truth, you will also avoid setting a potential viewer's expectations far too high.Over the years, countless professional and amateur film critics have been herolding Citizen Kane as the greatest movie of all time. It is logical, then, that when I watch it in 2002, it should be the greatest movie I have ever seen. As you have already guessed, it is not. This movie is for a certain breed of people. It's dark realization on screen and an obvious lack of a character the audience can readily sympathize with can easily turn off many-a viewer. I found myself making a serious effort just watching the TV, obviously something that rarely happens.Potential viewers be warned: you will not be blown away the first time you watch this. The ""killer"" ending has been spoiled for everybody and the many great themes contained in this rich (maybe too rich) story will not be picked up when first watching this. My advice to anyone watching this for the first time is to wade through the twisting, often uninteresting plot, then rewind and enjoy the characters and images without having to worry about following the story.In conclusion, while Citizen Kane must have been the best movie when it came out, contemporary viewers might find it unappealing at first viewing and anticlimaxes thanks to the now-unsurprising surprise ending (not its fault, but something to consider), which in my opinion makes it fall short of best movie status. For a movie to work on many levels, which Citizen Kane does (but certainly isn't the only one) it must first work at the most superficial and let the viewer dissect it on his own. If you want to watch a fun classic that also has something to say, I recommend Casablanca."
Kane20,"Jul 2, 2012",10/10,"Citizen Kane has been lauded the best film ever made by many people. Do I particularly agree? No. But nonetheless, I think it is a great movie. It has some of the dated characteristics of cinema of it's period, the 1940's, but a lot of it's characteristics are still strong nowadays. I understand that the plot has some parallels to the real life story of William Randolph Hearst, but I don't know all that much about him, so I'm going to talk about only the film, which is great itself. The film is an important figure in the history of cinema, technologically and in terms of storytelling.The story is really not all that complicated, but the way it unfolds is great and engaging, and almost makes it seem complex, and it's told from a number of perspectives. The film opens up with the death of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), the owner of the Inquirer, a New York newspaper. Just before dying, Kane utters the word ""Rosebud"". Then an approximately ten minute long newsreel summarizes the story of Kane, representing the public's view of him, and an overview of the story. Then, for the rest of the film, we are shown more details and depth of the story via flashbacks as news reporters go around and obtain information about Kane and his life.For those of you who haven't seen the film, I won't fully spoil it for you. I'll just give an overview. Kane achieved success and rose to power, but eventually suffered a major blow to his reputation, and he crashed. Along the way, he even gets married and divorced twice. With the aid of his closest friend, Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), Kane starts builds a nationwide newspaper empire. He is ruthless as he achieves this, yet generous at the same time in a few ways, such as being willing to lose a million dollars a year to gain more newspaper circulation. Eventually, he runs for a political position, but his success to this is lost as his rival uncovers his affair with a ""singer"", and after this, his reputation is destroyed and his life's success declines. There is more to the story, but, like I said, I'm only giving a summary; I'm not giving the full story away, for those of you who haven't seen the film.All the while, we, the audience, and the reporters in the film, wonder who Kane really was, not just the story of the events of his life, from his rise to his fall, but who he really was underneath. They believe that a key to finding this out lies in his dying word, ""Rosebud"". At one point in the film, a reporter, Thompson, says, about the word, ""Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost."" At another point, someone (I don't remember who) says, ""I don't think one word can describe one man's life"". The entire movie is a puzzle, a puzzle of Kane's life, and not just that, but of who he really was (for lack of a better, deeper term). ""Rosebud"" is just one piece, a missing piece, of that puzzle, but it may be an important piece. Although, then again, maybe not. We do eventually find out what the word represents and what its origin is, and it represents one of the important messages of the movie, but I won't spoil it for, again, those of you who haven't seen the film.The film is great in terms of its storytelling. In addition to its storytelling, the film is also an important point in cinema in terms of a few other factors, such as cinematography. One of the most striking of the cinematographic effects is this stark contrast between brightness and darkness. Also notable are the camera angles - which create many unique shots throughout the film - and the use of deep focus, enabling images both in the back ground and the foreground to stay clear in focus. I also liked the music score. Bernard Herrmann, who also composed the score for Psycho (1960), created an effective score with very good combinations and uses of harmony, orchestration, melody, and other musical elements, and really supports the drama and moods of the film.So, in summary, while I personally don't think Citizen Kane is the best film ever made, I did find it to be great. Watching it was a very good experience for me. It's great in terms of storytelling and technical aspects, and, overall, like I've said, it's a great piece of cinema, and an important landmark in cinema history.My Rating: **** (out of ****)"

Days after of journalism hype over the news of his death, the journalist Jerry Thompson (William Alland) is sent by his boss to investigate the life of Kane, in order to discover the meaning of his last word, in which no one knows. Then he begins to interview all living people who knew and met Kane. Going from his best friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten); his secretary Bernstein (Everett Sloane); the 2nd ex-wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore). The journalist begins to discover that he plunged into the life of a lonely man who from childhood is obliged to follow the will of others. Nobody around Kane cared about him, and then he began looking through the acquisition of things the worship from the people, but it all led to his tragic and painful end.Many said at the time that Orson Welles (who also directed and wrote the film) based the life of Kane on a real tycoon from journalism William Randolph Hearst. Welles at the time denied such claims publicly, especially after Hearst negatively criticized the film saying it would denigrate his image. But the comparisons are almost obvious: Hearst was known to have transformed the simple New York Morning Journal to a sensationalistic newspaper (buy news from other newspapers or invent them) the same thing Kane did with the newspaper ""Inmaker""; Hearst built a castle with his name, the Hearst castle in Florida, and Kane made ""Xanadu"" in the Gulf of Mexico, both Hearst and Kane had nationalists and communists concepts (they were part of a political party but then denounced them).The critics doesn't idolize this movie for nothing. Mainly because it is WAY ahead of its time, to imitate the life of a tycoon on a fiction film was almost crime at the time, but not only that. Welles gives the film a magnificent direction with gigantic footage such filming today require multiple cameras (more than 20) and at the time they used a very limited number (less than 5). Including a amazing photography and beautiful cinematographic with spectacular scenery.Not only in direction but Welles gives the film one of the best screenplays ever written, primarily because it can be smart and fun giving a modern language and humorous moments. But above all, gives a timeless narrative to the history, that is, it doesn't follow a single timeline, going back and forward to the past and the future all the time telling pieces of Kane's life from childhood to the arrival to wealth. This technique was very advanced and almost impossible to do at the time. And along the incredible story of Charles Kane, the film uses elements of politics, romance, and even musical. And for several moments, it critiques the rich society and American politics (another thing that at the time was almost a crime).But of course, today many people will find problems in the film compared to today films. It is almost inevitable a film having problems, and ""Kane"" is no exception of this. The main problem is with so many characters in the film, somehow it fails in making us care about them (except for Kane), but once again we have to have in consideration the constraints of the script and cast at the time.Speaking of cast, that was also a great revolution. All actors were newcomers, making their first appearances in movies. Not only this fact, but also the fact that they are all extraordinary. Since Joseph Cotten and Dorothy Comingore simply superb, but who stands out is Welles himself. He in their 20s, considered the wonder boy, then took his skills as an theater actor and radio announcer and not only give a excellent directing and writing to the film but also a magnificent performance from start to finish.People have to take in consideration the time that the film was made and not criticize it comparison to today. Early there, it was the beginning of the 2nd world war with much of the economy focused on armaments, Orson Welles with a magnificent direction, superb script and splendid performance managed to make a mark in the history of cinema that should be remembered forever!10/10"

Some very intelligent, very film savvy people that I know are not fans of the film and they are right in their complaints: It IS too long, a bit dry, not exciting, and so it goes...But I love it. The cinematography and shooting techniques (as you've probably heard before) changed filmmaking and survive even to this day. The dialog seems silly at first blush, but when I hear what the characters are ACTUALLY saying, it is heartbreaking ""You'll hate it in Chicago, the wind comes right off that lake..."" really means ""Don't leave, you're the last one left that loved Charlie and Mr. Kane."" The acting is still good even by today's standards. If you can get past the screeching voice of Mrs. Kane the 2nd, you'll find that she's very capable. Welles is like a pot left to slow boil with occasional eruptions and Joseph Cotton handles his role with an admirable mix of humor and sadness.I come back to this movie time and time again and it doesn't disappoint. I won't try to change anyone's mind about it because as I said, the critiques are sound, but I'm glad this movie exists."
carljessieson,"Apr 8, 2015",10/10,"Hate to agree with the pretentious, boring film students who basically worship their copy of Citizen Kane (and rebuke every other classic or new film) I used to go to school with, but this is truly one of the greatest films ever made. I've watched it a handful of times and it never fails to stun me.Everything about this movie is perfect, it'd be a waste of time to list all the characteristics of this film that make it the legend it is- but I'm just gonna waste a little. Welles was so gifted. The cinematography is beautiful the whole way through. Fantastic use of lights and shadows. He was so artistic with his techniques, every scene was planned down to each detail. And the variety! Wow, so many different techniques with Welles' touch on them. His style is like visual candy, and every shot is sweet.All performances were excellent! Amazing they all came from the same place, and this was the first film for all of them. I was especially blown away by Welles, of course, considering he created one of the most iconic characters in film history. His performance was spectacular, from 25 year old Kane to old Kane, brilliant. The make-up applied to age the characters was so impressive. It looked better than some of the make-up work I see these days even. The character development was impeccable. The script was great. Good dialog, never lags, was always interesting. The non-chronological format was expertly executed, the transitions passing through years, transitions from flashback to present- seamless every time.There is nothing about this movie that I don't like. Such a monumental achievement, it's such a shame that Orson Welles had so many problems with the film industry. Can't imagine what he'd have left behind had the studios let him have total control. Anyway, obviously I strongly recommend this film and love having it in my own collection.10/10Bye love you"
grantss,"May 16, 2016",10/10,"Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles), media mogul, dies at his isolated palatial estate, Xanadu. A virtual recluse, his only company was his large retinue of servants and his collection of priceless artifacts. A news outlet sets out to reveal the man behind the legend, going through articles and books on Kane, interviewing his friends, associates and ex-wife. They see his rise to power and fortune, his marriages, his attempts at politics. Moreover, they are striving to discover the meaning of his dying utterance - Rosebud.A masterpiece in every way. Superb plot, written by Orson Welles and Herman J Mankiewicz. Covers some very powerful themes, all of which are still relevant today: the corruption of innocence and ideals by power, wealth and greed; the power, manipulation and deceitfulness of the media, the yearning for simpler times and how earthly fortunes mean nothing in the end.Brilliant direction by Welles - this movie set a new benchmark in the field and even today would be difficult to surpass. His camera work and cinematography are exquisite: the use of light and dark (especially), the camera angles, panning shots. Just watching it you know you are watching a master craftsman at work - every shot is carefully planned and deliberately aimed to create a certain effect. It feels like art.Solid performances all round, with Welles to the fore again. Even the makeup is in another league - witness the transformations of Kane from 25 years old to 30-something, to 50-something all the way to his final days at 70-something.Probably the biggest travesty in all of cinema is that Citizen Kane did not win the 1942 Best Picture Oscar. It was nominated in nine categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Leading Actor and Best Original Screenplay, but only one won Oscar - Best Original Screenplay. Best Picture went to How Green Was My Valley, a good movie but not in Citizen Kane's league.The reason for this may well have been a campaign by media tycoon William Randolph Hearst to discredit the movie and prevent it from being released. The movie was loosely based on the life of Hearst."
