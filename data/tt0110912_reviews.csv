kylopod,"Nov 17, 2005",10/10,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."

SebMoz,"Nov 12, 2020",10/10,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time."
gogoschka-1,"Jul 24, 2014",10/10,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
jaaanmerz,"Nov 6, 2020",10/10,"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time."
hockeydog-75085,"Jan 13, 2021",10/10,Before I saw this I assumed it was probably overrated. I was wrong. It lives up to and surpasses its reputation in pretty much every way. I would definitely recommend.
wolvesrug,"Jan 9, 2005",10/10,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will."
tfrizzell,"Jun 25, 2000",N/A,"My oh my.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5."
Stefan_Loves_Movies,"Aug 22, 2022",6/10,I heard so many people claim that this movie is a masterpiece and it also has high ratings. So I was intrigued to give it a go. I didn't get much enjoyment out of it. Maybe you have to watch it multiple times to enjoy it. As for the first viewing it didn't satisfy me.
jayrb-30977,"Jun 10, 2020",4/10,I don't understand why this is the 8th highest rated movie of all time. I saw how highly rated it was so decided to watch it. After the first half an hour I found it enjoyable but my mind wasn't blown. As the movie continued I kept waiting for something to happen that warrants its 8.9 stars. Nothing actually happens in this movie. I hope its just me because through my eyes its the most overrated movie of all time.
cooplander,"Dec 8, 2004",10/10,"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film."
discoelephant64,"Jan 19, 2005",10/10,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it."
TheHoodOfSwords,"Apr 21, 2020",8/10,"Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10."
connorveenstra,"May 25, 2017",7/10,"I don't get as much out of Pulp Fiction as everybody else does. I don't like that it doesn't have a strong message, I think the dialogue goes on self-impressed tangents some times and the Mia Wallace story doesn't tie in with the rest of the film and it just isn't that interesting to me. However, that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its style. The entire film from the costume design, to the camera work, to the setting of LA are dripping with noir atmosphere. The writing, while it does jerk itself off at times, is still pretty memorable and enjoyable to listen to. The acting is fantastic all around, getting especially good performances from Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Bruce Willis.While I don't think its a masterpiece, it is something fun to watch if you're looking for something different and intriguing."
guybrush105,"Apr 4, 2000",N/A,"Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10."
molg-18070,"Apr 29, 2024",3/10,"I tried to complete it many times and i just can't. It's too boring and the silence between every word and the next is too long, most of the film with no dialogues that effect or support the story.The characters don't have any true connection to eachother or to the viwer they just meets eachother because the writer want that , the blood is over and have no logic also the movie just goes without clear directions no drama no massages not even true fire guns and gangs work, its just characters moving with some
shooting and a lot of blood.Seriously bad color grading and camera movements, i didn't feel in touch with any character or scene except the first 20-30 minutes."
marcferrantejr,"Apr 17, 2020",10/10,"This is my favorite film of all time. Every second of this film is engaging, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Tarantino's direction and script is brilliant, and every role is perfectly cast. Everything that happens in this movie has a purpose, and you don't realize it's hidden in plain sight until the final moments"
bruce_ac,"May 28, 2017",8/10,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that I hear about all the time, but have never seen myself. After watching it, I'm confused about the hype surrounding this movie. I couldn't pinpoint the message the film was trying to tell. Nevertheless, the acting was outstanding (excellent cast!) and the charming style of Tarantino is unmistakable. I'd recommend a watch."
Quinoa1984,"Jan 20, 2000",10/10,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few.The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you."
sophiamrodriguez,"Jan 23, 2021",10/10,This movie is such a masterpiece for many reasons. The way everything connects makes it really important for you to pay attention. Lots of action and very funny. It also has a really good balance of everything you look for in a movie.
Gatorman9,"Apr 18, 2004",8/10,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)"
verbal-15,"Aug 2, 1998",N/A,"Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product."
htethtetsuhlaing,"Nov 6, 2020",10/10,Can't help but love it!🖤 bcoz it's good cool brilliant? I watched it over agian and again.
zacharyhamstra,"Sep 24, 2022",6/10,"This movie may be the most overrated film of all time, in my opinion. There is no point. It is not particularly funny. It is not particularly thought provoking. It is not some kind of masterpiece. It is, however, well made. Has good acting with a great cast. Is a fun way to divide up the scenes and plots.I was ready for this movie to end far before it did, because I learned about halfway through that there is just no purpose to it! No meaning! I definitely enjoyed aspects of it and there was some legitimate tension, without question. It all just felt messy. Truly my favorite part of watching pulp fiction were two scenes that I had seen from different memes 100 times before, and never knew where they came from. It was a, ""oh, hey, I recognize this image!"" That was the most joy I got out of this.By no means is it a trainwreck, but to be considered such a timeless masterpiece of cinematic glory? Not a chance. I would like to speak to every single person who gives this a 10 and have them explain to me what exactly this film does well, because I feel pretty confident everyone just gets in line and calls it amazing because that is the 'cool' thing to do."
Bologna King,"Aug 17, 2006",5/10,"The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy."
McLovin42X,"Oct 26, 2020",10/10,"One of the first and most memorable movies I saw in my teenage years that had a very particular way to tell a story, I couldn't help to be intrigued by all these nouvelle vague techniques that I was seeing and that showed me the range of creativity a filmmaker can have to tell a particular story with a certain aesthetic. Simply a timeless masterpiece that will forever be re-discovered by new generations."
destiniem,"Apr 16, 2020",10/10,"I absolutely love this film. Around 5 or 6 years old, I remember looking thought my mom's VHS collection and ran across the jewel. I asked her if I could watch it, and she told me that I was too young to see it. Several years later, I remember seeing the Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega storyline on the USA station and immediately was drawn in. Even at a young age, I was intrigued with the film. Years later, I saw the full film, and wow!!! Such an amazing movie! I'm a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino films, but Pulp Fiction is by far my favorite. With a stellar cast, amazing soundtrack, and simple but unique plot, this movie is miles ahead of many."
blue_camals,"Oct 6, 2002",N/A,"I have read some of the comments on this website concerning Pulp Fiction and perhaps I missed it but no one has mentioned the fact that Tarantino used an element from Elia Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"" in 1954 staring Marlon Brando. In Pulp Fiction, Marsellus Wallace told Bruce Willis that he is supposed to intentionally lose to a boxer named Wilson:Marsellus: ""In the fifth, your ass goes down. Say it.""Butch: ""In the fifth, my ass goes down.""Bruce Willis, not only doesn't go down and lose the fight, he kills Wilson. When I saw this, I became flushed with movie deja vu and felt very satisfied. Why was the boxer called Wilson? In ""On the Waterfront"" Marlon Brando has a famous monologue in which he expains how his boxing career ended: He went down intentionally against a boxer named Wilson because of greedy mobsters. Wilson, therefore was the invisble antagonist against Marlon Brando. Tarantino, being a smart guy, knew that in the deep annals of the film buff world, he could redeem Marlon Brando and all us film buffs that hate Wilson more than anything by killing Wilson. If it wasn't for Wilson, Marlon Brando ""coulda been a contender."" So, by killing Wilson forty years later, Tarantino effectively killed off the jerk that ruined Brando's Boxing career in ""On the Waterfront."" I don't know if many people had already realized this but I thought I would bring up to people's attention.Also, for Tarantino fans, watch ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (1955) by Robert Aldrich. It has the answer to why the contents of the briefcase, when opened by Travolta, give a glowing lightbeam on Travolta's face and we never see what's inside."
planktonrules,"Mar 13, 2010",10/10,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a brilliantly crafted film. The many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis."
hitchcockthelegend,"Feb 13, 2012",10/10,"It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10"

adamgreasley,"May 18, 2008",6/10,"A masterpiece? Do me a favour! Perhaps it's because of the hype that surrounds this film, but I was really disappointed with what I saw.Two and a half hours was too long in my view, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary happens.I didn't find it clever, nor were the ""unforgettable"" scenes like the dance between Travolta and Thurman or Samuel L Jackson's speech unforgettable.Maybe because cinema has advanced so much since 1994 that I would have had to watch it then to appreciate it, but I only recently saw Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time and enjoyed that immensely.People go on as if this film has the best storyline and gangster scenes ever but quite frankly, it doesn't.Moreover, I found Natural Born Killers more affective for it's style than Pulp Fiction.It does have some good scenes, and I was rooting for Bruce Willis' character throughout, but I saw nothing that makes this film outstanding or worthy of being so high in IMDb's rankings."
georgios-christodoulou,"Nov 2, 2014",5/10,"I was tempted to stop watching it about four times. I went up to the end just to see if, at least, there is something extraordinary or unexpected there. I really can't understand what all these viewers found to this film, to score it so high. It's the first time (or the second I'm not sure!) that I get into the mood of writing a review. The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION. I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind. If you find yourself in the position wondering whether to watch this film or not, due to its place in the list don't waste your time!"
kimmykat-99105,"Aug 4, 2020",10/10,It has been almost thirty years and this film stand the test of time. I loved it the first time I saw it and I love it still. The weaving of these storylines and the intricate twists and turns have never been matched. This is new wave filmmaking at it's best. It will be studied and discussed in film schools all over the world and lauded as the best of it's kind in filmmaking history.
aljabman,"Oct 12, 2020",10/10,"It's not a film it's a experience. The characters are very memorable The story of nonlinear dialogue and action no the whole movie is fast and fun there's no down time or anything boring the movie is long. There's more then 10 memorable scenes that is referenced in any type of media. I like to think of pulp fiction as resvoir dogs another film by the genius tarrintino as a better version of it. I thought resvoir dogs had the coffe scene at the start and mr white hurting the police officer. I thought the movie was stretched out more then it needed to and the ending gave me such a poor taste in my mouth. I still like it, like I would get a poster or t shirt of resvoir dogs to show my opinion. There did you see that I lost focus that's what pulp fiction does it makes you forget about the world but remember about the experience. The scene where butch reclaims himself in the eyes of walleces is a redemption story in itself about how we can all get together without fighting and being greedy. The part where 2 scenes ( tiny bit of a spoiler but watch Pulp fiction now if you haven't) where somehow at point blank range a revolver didn't shoot Jules and vincent and somehow Vincent shoots one of the guys in the head on accident. Thats a message life is like a box of chocolates the things you never expect will happen. Another part of the idea is the violence and sex violence plays a big part in this movie these are horrible people that everyone loves when I see this film I feel like it's a LEGO set controlled by tarrintino everything goes together like cause and effect yet while still being random sex is not that big in the film expect for the epic scene where butch remdeems himself and when butch is making out with his girlfriend but that scene was still great because he had to find his watch holy crap. This movie has dialogue lots of it and that's fantastic he is known for dialogue the tarrintino himself said that dialogue is a major component in his films and it shows, other films have such poopy dialogue where all they do is talk about nothing like get on with it. Pulp fiction is the story of 3 as 1 and should be hands down the number 1 film of the millennium ."

And in some ways the movie does live up to it's hype because the story is well written and acted out good too.But, to me, the movie is overrated. It seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like it's the only movie worth watching - like it is the ""King of Films"".

heisenberg12,"Feb 9, 2020",9/10,"So original, it comes off like an experimentational movie, but one that catches fire with absolutely brilliant writing, dialogue, and character creation, in addition to all-time standout performances by every single actor, which means the directing was also superb.Some people may still question what it's about because for the most part we have four different stories converging at various coordinates in a timeline loop that do not clearly have a meaning as to why other than to just have creative fun with the way it's told.You have a philosophizing, bible thumping hitman (Samuel L Jackson) finding his path to salvation and restored faith and theism while participating in the events that comprise the movie. This movie is perfect in so many scenes with only a few weak parts. It's loaded with memorable lines, and it was meticulously cared for into every last detail including the music and what dance moves characters should have in addition to the outrageously brilliant screenplay that somehow never slips over the top.Tarantino still hasn't even come close to this lightning in a bottle masterpiece."

jennyroussou,"Jul 15, 2020",10/10,"Pulp fiction is one of the most revolutionary films in the industry. It is funny, chaotic and entertaining. The film itself never tried to play it cool. And that is what makes it so captivating; its unwillingness to look cool and deep(like every Tarantino film) charms every viewer. Pulp fiction compaired to every other film of the industry probably looks like that one girl in the club that you will never see again but you will likely keep fantasizing of forever;She is totally indifferent and bored, effortlessly cool and gives the best laughs. Wait... Mia Wallace, is that you???"
pokemon_trainer_lucas,"Jun 21, 2019",8/10,"I saw this film last year when my dad recommend it to me, and I was not disappointed even though it was made before I was born. The idea of having several different people's lives meet at the end is not original, but it is cleverly done and it pays off. The characters have a variety of personalities and it keeps you on your feet. A must watch!"
Bamboo1,"Oct 9, 2020",10/10,"Pulp Fiction is pretty much Once upon a time in Hollywood, but better in every regard.Pulp Fiction encapsulated and defined the 90s, that's what this movie was. A piece of art, not a movie.This movie is all about the characters and the actors, not any plot. That's why I would rate the movie as follows1. Characters 112. Acting 103. Plot 74. Cinematography 105. World building 10We have stellar characters and acting. Cinematography is also amazing, it really sucks you in and the world building really makes you fell like you are in the 90s."

One of the most celebrated and acclaimed movies of all time is a damn masterpiece.Pulp fiction is one of my favourite films ever and for good reason:
-the amazingly genius nonlinear story telling
-one of the most enjoyable performances of all time from Samuel l. Jackson.
-and of course the dialogueLook, as someone who has seen all of Quentin Tarantino's great contributions to cinema history I can officially declare Pulp Fiction is still his best. After more than 25 years of being endlessly copied but never replicated there's a reason people still watch this movie so often.It's just so good."
BigChris777,"Dec 7, 2022",5/10,"Finally got around to watching this almost 30 years on. And it feels very out of date. Some set scenes are quite good, & there's a bit of humour. But on the whole it just screams self-indulgence. Topped off with Tarantino stepping in front of the camera. Ploddingly slow too often in an attempt to be arty and edgy, it just exposes the poor writing that the shifted timelines can't save. No investment in characters, or plot. Just a collection of scenes and ideas drowning in a lake of stagnant dialogue and overly long, trite scenes with characters and actions that make no sense. Very disappointing."
greatbun,"Aug 6, 2020",10/10,"Praise for this movie is abundant in media, and rightfully so. Pulp Fiction is one of the most fun and satisfying movies I've ever watched. Being a Tarantino movie, its characters and dialogue are top notch. This is probably the #1 movie I would recommend to someone (if they haven't seen it) as it's very easy to get into and you can just let go of reality and be sucked into the film."
tomaszkorzen,"Aug 5, 2020",10/10,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Every piece of this movie is put on right place and everything works.

claudio_carvalho,"Apr 20, 2014",10/10,"The hit-men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) work for the powerful mobster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Vincent has lived in Amsterdam for three years and is assigned with Jules to retrieve a suitcase that belongs to their boss. There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that God's hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side.""Pulp Fiction"" is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the winner and weakest ""Forrest Gump"") with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. ""Pump Fiction"" saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult ""Reservoir Dogs"". The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Pulp Fiction – Tempo de Violência"" (""Pulp Fiction: Time of Violence"")"
TheLittleSongbird,"Dec 9, 2010",10/10,"What can I say? This film is amazing, and I would go further and say it is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 26, 2022",10/10,"Pulp Fiction is to be seen to be believed, it was big, it was brash, it certainly arrived with a bang.One of the most stylish films ever made, Quentin Tarantino delivered something that viewers had been starved of for so many years, Pulp Fiction offered wondering very keen, like a new voice.Le Big Mac, that scene where Jules and Vincent are rambling on about McDonalds, just before doing a hit, that's one of.my favourite moments, the iconic moment though, Vincent and Mia dancing, it has to be one of the greatest movie scenes of all time, Chuck Berry, a scene I repeat and repeat, it's sublime.I'm not even sure if I like the storyline or not, it's maybe a little trashy, it just doesn't matter somehow, the film's good points are turbocharged enough to hide over any cracks. It's wonderfully violent, incredibly well paced, and full of action.Astonishing cast, Travolta at his best, Jackson, Thurman, Keitel, Roth, Willis, the names are endless, brilliant.The music, the music is just astonishing, it's what ears were designed for, you'll watch this and you'll be reaching for the soundtrack.What cinema was made for 10/10."
ving13,"Aug 5, 1998",10/10,"Tarentino's masterpiece has sent shockwaves through the entire film industry.  So many films are clones of it, try to imitate the dialogue, or hype, where applicable, their stars ""of Pulp Fiction fame."" Pulp Fiction features dialogue that rings true to life, unpredictable plot turns, and plenty of humor.  To best enjoy this movie, know as little about it before viewing it.  The non-linear plot serves a purpose and is not merely a gimmick.  It puts the most fitting part at the end of the film.  Truly a historic film in many ways."

Anytime the most common adjective used to describe your movie is ""cool"" you know you're in trouble.This is a silly, juvenile, vulgar movie. Tarantino should have had the courage to make a cheap, violent, trashy Hollywood-style movie and been proud of it. Instead, he made a cheap, violent, trashy, Hollywood-style movie and hid behind the ""irony"" façade. Works for 17-year-olds, doesn't work for the rest of us."

As I grew older and older I've come to realize that this masterpiece from the 90s aged like fine wine. It's easily one of the most rewatchable movies considering it's filled with an insane amount of quotables, great cinematography and most importantly, charming characters that will stand the test of time.I truly believe that this movie is a work of art, the way Tarentino handpicked the songlist for the soundtrack helped elevate every single scene of the movie to a whole new level.To cut this short, this movie is easily one of the best movies ever made, and my personal favorite movie and I urge anyone who hasn't seen it to give it a shot."
mrmystery99,"Apr 29, 2018",10/10,"Would it be too much to say Tarantino re-invented the cinema with this film? I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone. You can tell - especially in gangster films - they never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most quotable dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, fun ride that you feel stoned/dizzy/drunk after watching it eachtime. Despite originally thinking it was slightly overhyped, seeing it again and again has brought me to realise what it is. It's 'Pulp Fiction' and it's amazing."
davidcameron-20885,"Apr 8, 2020",10/10,"The USA can't offer much to the world, it's far too immature, black and childish for that but it can offer us a truly delightful film such as this masterpiece. I really liked the heavy use of drugs in this movie, it gave me tears of joy to see characters having the time of their lives on drugs and made me very nostalgic for my drug fuelled happy days as a youngster at Eton (Mess).The heavy use of drugs, violence, profanity and sex in this film has positively influenced an entire sexy generation of British people and I can't thank the United States enough for that, from youngish Brits swearing every 5 seconds to the cheeky games of hide and seek finding marijuana in the London Underground and asking waitresses for free sex after every bad meal at restaurants, this film truly has changed British culture for the better, I'm so proud of the beautiful ex-British colony known as the United States due to this film.The sexual abuse at the end of the film has also made the UK more aware of sexual abuse of males, this film has made many Brits more self-aware that men aren't invincible, they can be sexually abused and this film highlights the harsh brutal reality of that heinous crime so I thank this film for making Britain a safer place for men. I also really liked the diner scene, the best diner I've ever seen onscreen and just so stunningly beautiful, it truly does look heavenly that place and every happy night I have I dream of going to that diner with a few of my British mates and gently bonding with our lovely American children."

aplato,"Nov 6, 2000",7/10,"Pulp Fiction is a good, well-acted movie that is way, way, way over hyped by its fans. The core of the movie, the blathering of Vincent and Jules is fun and enjoyable. Bruce Willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation.In the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. However it is not the amazing Second Coming of Christ as many Tarantinophiles would have us all believing. Many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. Do we REALLY need to watch John Travolta stick a needle in Uma Thurmond?  Yeah, sure it was cool at the time but that coolness quickly wears off when you realize there is really nothing likeable about any of these people."
TedEBear,"Mar 13, 2008",1/10,"After having seen how ""Pulp Fiction"" has infiltrated its way into current pop culutre (the dance contest, Royale with cheese, etc.), I finally got a chance to see the movie from the beginning and couldn't believe what a huge letdown it was. There was nothing for me to grasp to make me care about what the characters were doing and why they were doing it, and the overly gratuitous use of the f-bombs put me off completely. It's almost as if swearing was substituted for wit and clever dialogue. I felt like Tarantino was trying to impress me with how much of a movie geek he is, but if he tried to make a movie with an engaging story, I might have liked it more. The only person he's impressing is himself, and it isn't working."
Skeletors_Hood,"Jan 23, 2003",N/A,"Why this movie is so popular escapes me.  I watched this movie at the recommendation of my friends, who all thought it was hilarious.  I found no humor anywhere, only lame philosophy wrapped up in glorified criminal activities.  I for one am glad that Forrest Gump won the Oscar over this load of bull.  I have never been able to watch anything with John Travolta or Bruce Willis since this came out, and it took me awhile to forgive Samuel Jackson for this movie as well.  Tarantino should never have been allowed to direct again.Skip this crap and rent something else, or you might lose respect for the actors involved.  I sure did."

chiragrathod09,"May 11, 2023",10/10,"Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and really a unique film by classic Quentin Tarantino. Quentin Tarantino is one of the best director and his all movie kept you engage from starting to end. He is a genius and believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable.Pulp Fiction is an iconic masterpiece that redefined American cinema. Known for its nonlinear narrative, razor-sharp dialogue, and eclectic mix of humor and violence, the film weaves together multiple interconnected stories centered around the Los Angeles criminal underworld.This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone and all the actors give their career best performance.The ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .""Pulp Fiction"" explores themes of redemption, loyalty, violence, and the blurred lines between good and evil. It confronts these heavy subjects with dark humor and a self-awareness that challenges traditional genre conventions.""Pulp Fiction"" remains a landmark in cinema history, praised for its innovation, audacity, and lasting impact on popular culture. It continues to captivate audiences with its unforgettable characters, memorable scenes, and Tarantino's singular vision, solidifying its place as one of the greatest films ever made.So, if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for .

If you're a film student, this is a must-watch. Some movies, as great as they are, once you're done watching, you know, you would never want to watch them again. Pulp fiction gets better with each screening as you discover more layers in the story."
flopezgraziano,"Jul 26, 2020",10/10,"Quentin Tarantino demonstrated to the world the powerful ingenuity he possesses, and of which he boasts in every minute of this one, his best film, of 2 and a half hours of duration. The real magic of the film is that its viewing is short and leaves you wanting even more, despite its length. Another particularly attractive aspect is its black humour and ordinary situations.
Everything is incredible in Pulp Fiction, but without a doubt the most charismatic thing of all is its script, dividing the facts into chapters that were later imitated in other films by other directors and repeated with other films such as ""Kill Bill"". These chapters are not even exposed in a chronological order, which forces the viewer to fit the pieces of the plot, which would be difficult to describe.
The next strong point is the very famous cast with brilliant performances that raise the quality of the film to unattainable levels. In particular I want to express my admiration for John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in their roles as thugs/collectors (Vincent Vega and Jules, respectively) with unforgettable dialogues and discussions that are present almost at all times in their joint performance.
Another ingredient magnificently introduced is his soundtrack, with great themes, besides the mythical title song, including pop, rock and soul themes (I find especially elegant Travolta's dance song with Uma Thurman, by Chuck Berry).
In short, I can only say that I find no fault with this film and that I do not bring anything new that anyone already knows about this work. Unless Tarantino does something of this magnitude again, this is one of my favorite movies of all time10/10"

blkbag,"Jul 6, 2006",N/A,"Try this experiment : Ask any tarhead or Pulp fiction fan one thing about this movie, and the first thing they will reply offhand is the incredible number of f words (271) found in this, and of that being the largest amount in any movie in history. So it may not seem unreasonable to conclude that this movie's incredible popularity stems from preteens and teenagers who think that the f word is cool and hip. Doesn't paint moviegoers in the best light does it? While I liked Reservoir dogs and Kill Bill 1 and 2, I simply cannot understand how this movie was voted into the top 10 or maintains such a huge fanbase? Dogs and Kill Bill were both groundbreaking and Tarantino flicks themselves may be a kind of acquired taste but there is enough offensive material in this movie, totally wanton, to put anyone off. Overall it is nothing special and outstanding.Now since some of his other movies were really good, Tarantino must have obviously done something right in Pulp fiction. So what could have possibly been that makes this movie so popular?Realism - Like all his other movies, this movie is very realistic. But there aren't enough outstanding scenes where realism adds an extra touch. There are only scenes of violence, extreme and explicit drug abuse, sodomy and boring conversation. The open use of racism can be considered realism but it is simply so easy to implement if one wants to.Dialog - Mostly long and highly trivial. French McDonalds, killing people, coffee...wtf? You can only make something great out of it only if you overanalyse the dialog and then put your self in a delusion of being a great analyst or philosopher. Too many f words, n words and racist lines. This is not cool, kids. Its garbage. Or I guess that a lot of people converse on trivial lines and it is uplifting for them to see the same type of boring talk in a big movie?Acting - Pretty good but once again, there are too often uttering long and trivial dialog. None of the characters are likable or even dispiseable to the extent that they have such depth. They were all pretty shallow.Plot - Mostly nonexistent. You could probably extract a story of redemption from it but too many people put all sorts of philosophical angles which were simply not intended. A bunch of different chapters intersect at one point. Harvey Kietel's character is pointless and is just thrown in as a deus ex machina. Tarantino's character and dialog are also pointless.Actions scenes, special effects, twists and all that - None. Most scenes are well done but they simply boring. A simple scene well done but nothing special happening in it.One teenager probably goes and tells another teenager how cool this movie is for nothing other than its explicit use of offensive elements (drugs, violence, sodomy, bad language) and he tells his friend and so on, the chain reaction makes less than mature minds fall for this movie. When someone speaks out against how bad this movie really is, they are labelled as idiots so are afraid to speak their mind. I'm glad that 225 reviews here were at least accurate. Screw the peer pressure and speak your mind, kids.Sorry, this anti-movie just leaves more of a negative impression than any positive. It also drags too much. Its quite revolting although some scenes are quite memorable."

terryzhangtianrun,"Jul 22, 2020",10/10,"The film written by Quentin is truly an astonishing masterpiece. This story is divided into four parts which is hard to conclude it with several sentences. Mr. Tarantino did an perfect job on characterization. Every person was vividly portrayed. For example, at the begining of the film, Marsellus Wallace didn't show up, but we could know from the conversation between Jules and Vincent that he is such a powerful gangster and nobody who knows him dare to mess with him. And Vincent was also shaped in different angles and details. In the movie, he is a man of humer, a good partner, and the spot in this movie which is dramatic when he killed by Butch. The movie was full of black humer and it might wants to say, nobody would be the 'righteous man' in the world of violence, but their character is vividly brought to your attention by Quentin, which makes up this high-scoring movie"
gabornagy81,"Aug 12, 2019",10/10,"Recently I've managed to watch this movie and I have to admit, that the experience,it gave to me, was unique. However, the plot is a bit complicated, because of the timeline, the unexpected actions and twists make this film truly unforgettable. I can honestly recommend this film to anyone, who loves Quentin Tarantino."
xxxxxdarkmoon,"Jul 9, 2020",10/10,"Perhaps the greatest movie ever made.This is Why:Pulp Fiction has the funniest and coolest dialogues and scenes with the most perfect actors of any movie that I have seen so far in my life.Tarantino creates the most hilarious situations. Examples: the toaster scene - my favourite scene without any words..., that scene is incredible. Another one: Butch and Marsellus meet coincidentally at the traffic light. And everything that follows. Unmatched. Another one: the gimp scene. This is perhaps the best scene of the movie. I was on my knees laughing when they raped Marsellus and he was about to think about revenge. .If you don't get the coolness and fun and the perfect story on the 1st watch, give it another try anytime later on. It is mostly about the scenes and the atmosphere and these hilarious situations.But the story is perfect as well. Some ask: What's in the suitcase? It doesn't matter! All that mattered: It is something really valuable. That is the only thing that matters. It doesn't matter If it's money, drugs or jewels or anything else. It is something they kill for. That is what matters."
GriffSwag,"Apr 24, 2022",6/10,"This is a very boring movie. The way that the storyline is cut up into 4 different parts makes the movies feel all very disconnected. The film basically just showcases the lives of your average mobster type criminals. Many people say that the ""everyday life"" kind of feel of the movie is what makes it great; I say very plainly that this is what makes it dull. It certainly a well made movie, this is why I give it 6 and not less."
Wakuwaku,"Sep 25, 1999",1/10,"This is what I call a fad movie.  People say it is a great movie because other people said it is great.  People are afraid to express their true feelings because they don't want to be ridiculed by their friends, especially if one is a member of the so-called X-generation.  I would imagine that the number of people who rented the video or saw it on cable that stopped watching the movie because it was so bad is fairly high, especially for a movie that is considered a great movie.However, I concede that a number of people truly like it.  However, I find that there are just as many people who are repulsed by this movie.  They just don't express their feelings in this type of format because a bad movie isn't worth the effort of making a negative opinion."
kwingate,"Mar 12, 2003",N/A,"I have only seen this movie once, during the original theatrical release, so maybe I'm due for a second viewing, but I just don't get it.  Yes, it's misogynistic, racist, hyper-violent, and near as I can tell --devoid of any redeeming social value: but these seem to be the high points!  Yes there were some funny bits, particularly Christopher Walken and the thing about the watch.  Yes Mr. Tarantino coaxed some very good performances out of some fairly mediocre actors, and yes they were aided by one very capable actor (Samuel L. Jackson).  What I don't get is the way everyone seems so enamored of the dialog.  As I recall, it competed for an Oscar that year with Much Ado About Nothing, starring a guy named Denzel Washington, written by a guy named Bill Shakespeare, and the best line from this 154 min. glamorization of our baser instincts seems to be ""What do they call a quarter-pounder with cheese?"" !!!????? As for interleaving plots, I'm wondering if any of the folks so taken with this have ever seen anything made by Robert Altman?  I wouldn't object to the violence so much if it made me think (The Matrix, Memento) or feel (Road to Perdition) something, but unfortunately, this film offered me neither."
helpless_dancer,"Apr 10, 1999",9/10,"I loved this madcap yarn about 2 hitmen for the mob, a mobster's nutty girlfriend, a punch drunk boxer, and 2 ineffective bandits. The story was told in flashback form, a technique that I have always found interesting. The lives of all the players criss-cross with each other forming a collection a mini-stories guaranteed to captivate the viewer. Unusually done film, very entertaining."
JasonSaikaly,"Apr 8, 2020",10/10,"Perfect movie, I'm celebrating my 100th time watching Pulp Fiction, Best dialogue ever written and said on the screen, this movie inspired generations to do movies, I really love this movie, QT is a Master, all the acting was great."
DaveDiggler,"Aug 16, 2008",9/10,"""Pulp Fiction"" is considered Quentin Tarantino' masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although it's not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, ""Pulp Fiction"" has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny"" as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and we're seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- he'll drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasn't been working on the level of ""Pulp Fiction.""Uma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallace's (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date that's not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When he's on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I don't know why it never gets old, but it doesn't. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with ""The Bonnie Situation."" The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincent's heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle that's cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence.Tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of ""Pulp Fiction"" has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" you won't see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesn't quite flow like a Tarantino film that we've become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. He's not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor.The section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is ""The Gold Watch"" section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his ""Die Hard"" facial expressions, especially when they're not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we won't care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard it's pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. ""The Gold Watch"" has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family.""The Bonnie Situation"" may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet ""The Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally ""shot Marvin the face."" ""The Bonnie Situation"" offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he ""walks the earth."" Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesn't make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be ""Pumpkin"" and ""Honey Bunny's"" last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways."
JonanthanNewOrleans,"Jul 8, 2020",10/10,"If this movie is so famous and so many people rank it among their top 5 or top 10 there is a very good reason, it's absolutely awesome!!!!10/10"
avik-basu1889,"May 2, 2017",10/10,"This is a tour de force of brilliantly precise screen writing, perfect acting, precise camera-work, perfect directing and world class dialogue writing. 'Pulp Fiction' is Tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. This is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. Tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. The characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. There is a method to the madness. Tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. However while doing all this, he never stops having fun. There are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through Tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality.Some people tend to trivialise the structure of the screenplay by calling it a gimmick. But as far as I'm concerned the structure of the screenplay is essential and indispensable in the context of the narrative and in the context of how Tarantino wants to drive home the themes that he is exploring. In a nutshell........ yeah, 'Pulp Fiction' is a masterpiece, it's a bad mother#*%@er."
sithlords-21459,"Feb 13, 2024",6/10,"I've watched this movie twice and I don't get the hype. I really don't. It's not a bad movie but it's not great either. It's not that i don't like Tarantino movies because I love the Kill Bill movies.This movie is pointless unless there is some subliminal point to it that I overlooked. It's like a joyride to nowhere. Sit back and enjoy the ride I guess. There is a lot of star power in this movie too.Frankly the only star worth watching is Samuel L Jackson. The other stars like Travolta, Willis, etc are just meh. The whole scene between Thurman and Travolta is laughable. Maybe it's not made to be taken seriously."
rowmorg,"Dec 18, 2005",1/10,"The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.""It's only entertainment,"" I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two."
Zando777,"Apr 13, 2007",N/A,"Seriously. I mean, this film is mildly amusing, and I saw it at the theater when it first came out. But I really can't watch the whole thing repeatedly, like with some true classics. It certainly doesn't deserve to be ranked in the top 5, or even really the top 100.Both Reservoir Dogs and True Romance are better films, even just examining the Tarantino Ouvre. The Christopher Walken / Dennis Hopper scene (and the Pimp-fight scene) from True Romance alone blows this film away.In all, I think this is ultimately a case of the emperor not wearing any clothes. If you watch these three films in one weekend, you should clearly see that PF is the weak link of the bunch. Its success appears largely a product of buildup from the earlier films, along with the desire of people to appear hip and cool, both then and now."
SpelingError,"Dec 2, 2015",9/10,"Going into this for the first time, I knew this would be a good movie and I would enjoy it. However, I had no idea that it would be this good. It practically blew me away.This movie follows how 6 people's lives are all intertwined in an action packed tale of gun violence, drug-use, and murder.What this film is most famous for is its twisted timeline which is never too confusing but also very impressive. When I first saw the beginning, I didn't think much of it and as the film progressed, I forgot about it. But when it comes back at the ending, I knew I was in for a treat. The movie has several of these surprises which will knock you out cold and they are made brilliant by its twisting plot. I was in awe when the credits first started to roll.Also, this movie has an outstanding soundtrack which is actually pretty recognizable and iconic. It is also very well-done too. I honestly feel that it perfectly fits the movie. Like Jaws, when I think of this movie, the soundtrack which played during the end credits instantly plays in my head. It may not be as iconic as Jaws's music but it definitely is of equal quality.Also, the acting couldn't be much better. In my opinion, John Travolta, Samuel Jackson, and Bruce Willis all gave perfect performances. They are all able to convey so many moods at once with their facial expressions and they couldn't do any better.This movie also has very great repeat watchability to it. The first viewing of this masterpiece is unforgettable. But just like Fight Club, this movie gets better and better every time you watch it. Mainly because the fact that you know what's going to happen and that you know all of its surprises, makes several scenes even more engaging. Also, this movie has so many iconic lines and scenes. It's super rare for a film to have 2 iconic scenes but this movie has several of them which have been retold and parodied so many times in pop culture.So in conclusion, this movie is in fact a masterpiece because of many reasons. It has changed cinema so much and it has shown the test of time for over 20 years. I think that this film is going to be remembered for many more decades also. I think that this is Tarantino's best film and I also think that it is one of the best movies ever made. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys action and complex plot structures to movies."
z-07842,"Apr 13, 2020",8/10,"It resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genresI think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong."

akdjreview,"Dec 25, 2021",9/10,"After hearing so many great things about pulp fiction I was intrigued. A story consisting of a bunch of smaller stories that interweave is an interesting concept. And Quentin Tarantino absolutely doesn't fail to make it great.The story is driven by multiple but few characters characters that all serve their own purpose. Pulp fiction is filled with incredible action scenes while also keeping a realistic feel with personal conversations, regret, and emotions.With great performances by every single actor involved especially Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta who both do amazing jobs in keeping the movie realistic while also showing a lot of emotions.The movie is also incredibly filmed. With amazing angles and shooting scenes that make Pulp fiction a beautiful film with beautiful scenery, it's truly one of the best films from the 90s.I highly recommend you watch Pulp Fiction, it's a beautiful film with amazing acting and actors that all perform incredibly."
syqcs,"Apr 12, 2020",9/10,"The representative works of non-linear narrative films. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, and the dialogue is wonderful. Everyone in the film has a good quality, but they are hopelessly towards the dark and confused. Each paragraph is not divided into the beginning and the end, complementary structure, the beginning and the end of the connection, suggesting that the reality of similar movies in the plot is always happening, never stop. Line: why do we have to keep talking nonsense to maintain the atmosphere? Only when you find someone really special can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence."
leonardocellino,"Jul 27, 2020",9/10,"I really like the way this film was orchestrated: from the way the story is told to different camera shots, you can tell a lot of time was put into making it. I watched this film as it is a cult movie (one everybody should watch) And it is arguably Tarantino's best film. The overall experience was great as you can really connect with the different characters and quickly get sucked into the movies plot. I recommend this to any aspiring movie nerd or Tarantino fan as it is very enjoyable.And you yourself will still be wondering... what was in that brief case?"
jefadlm-1,"Jan 2, 2021",10/10,"I submit this film is actually ( albeit crime ) actually a redefined renewed genre ! As in R D this narrative takes risks in its
style of of story telling which is virtually a Tarantino invention ! yes it is true of course, every director has his or her unique
style of moulding and honing their story , Tarantino aims his tails in a unique mix of his own well thought out concoctions .
I cannot think of any examples , but anyone who loves cinema will have seen some films that failed in their attempts to
copy Tarantino. Therefore, that statement , it seems to me , is clearly indicative that this director has always triumphed
over all attempts to either go one better than him or out fox Tarantino in the hope of overpowering his style of sculpting .
That is how uniquely brilliant Tarantino is, similar to Gaugin or Michael Angelo he is a true artist in his creations
As has already been said, to try and get some level of comprehension of this film , it needs to be seen a number of times.
The same appreciation and more clarity of understanding is precisely the reason we continue to learn more and acquire
more depth of real academic learning every time we return to the National Gallery in London or the equivalent American ,
Italian or French art galleries . Every viewing of the Mona Lisa we see something previously overlooked, or did not previously
fully understand ! The first page of training for a successful film director comes from his or her hours and hours of intimate study
of form, substance, and colour , of photography also. Kubrick began his career as a monochrome photo journalist , thereby learning
about framing and all the artistry that follows that ! Tarantino i suggest either had a natural eye and sensibility of form, or ( possibly and )
studied from a very early age, as much as he was able with regard to form, framing and colour hues ? And only at a slightly later time in his younger days started writing story lines and ideas ?"
coombsstephen,"Oct 20, 2020",9/10,"Saw this at the cinema as a rerelease despite having seen it many times it's still worth a watch on the big screen.One thing I love about this film is you always notice something new, tonight I learned Steve Buscemi is it!Still brilliant and still worth a few hours of anyone's time"
filipemanuelneto,"Jan 21, 2023",6/10,"This was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino's career and made him one of the ""superstar"" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don't think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn't call it regular, a ""safe bet"", but we can't deny it, it's original, true to his style and doesn't seem concerned about pleasing anyone.The film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.For many, this film is one of the best of the 90's. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It's reasonably good, it's gained cult status, it has fans, but it's not a masterpiece, not for me. It's not a boring film, it doesn't tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There's a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it's something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn't matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).These are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the ""pulp"" literary subgenre. I'm not, it's not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn't like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn't... watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible... it's the kind of ""literature"" that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn't know by heart.The actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn't bad, but he's just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I'm sorry she couldn't go further, but that's life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn't. He's a ham as an actor.Technically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well."
possum-3,"Jul 21, 1999",1/10,"I personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of American society.This is a film in which paid murderers are our heros, who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits.  It features such entrancing scenes as countless murders, S&M rape, drug overdose, and other fun things to watch (it's a wonder Six Flags hasn't opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience).  It features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel, inhuman, or brutal things to each other.  Is this entertainment?The last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes--  the big problem posed by this is 'how will we clean out the car?'  What can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply (hit men or no)?  What can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment?The characters here are completely dehumanized, uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another, and ironically, much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the 'good guys.' If Tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe, that would have to be his point, wouldn't it--that to enjoy this movie you would have to be, in some way, sick?"
bob the moo,"Jan 28, 2004",N/A,"Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable."
pdortic,"May 11, 2018",8/10,"Well my first review just accidentally got deleted so here is for a second go of it.. Pulp Fiction has an excellent ability to interweave multiple dissimilar narratives into one cohesive story. It has a knack for balancing tense, dramatic moments with witty, comedic relief. Scenes such as the pawn shop basement with Zed, the hit men's clothing change after hiding a body with the Wolf, and Captain Koons' monologue showcase Tarantino's warped sense of humor."
DemonKiki,"Apr 16, 2020",10/10,"The postmodern discourse of the film, because it is in the post-industrial society era, is driven by the commercialization of the consumer society, thus embodying commercial, game, and popular colors. Jameson pointed out that the old (essentially advanced modernist) boundary between the advanced culture and the so-called popular culture or business culture has been abolished, and new texts have emerged that are full of forms, categories and contents of cultural industries. Bourdieu believes that the film has got rid of the shackles of classic art and has become a popular culture or a postmodern culture and has become a cultural capital. The purity of aesthetics and the self-discipline of art have been impacted. The tower of pure aesthetic ivory has collapsed under the impact of popular art and its aesthetics. The ensuing is the appearance of popular aesthetics, and it has increasingly gained its own aesthetic legitimacy.
Attracting audiences with popular themes, flattening the depth, everything is flat, this is what distinguishes the serious attitude of postmodernism from modernism. The result is to give the audience leisure, fashion, relaxation, surprise, and no tears. Violence, crime, sex and other generally considered vulgar themes are the themes of postmodern movies. Especially in terms of violent style, Tarantino became a single family. Violence has always been the unshakable theme of Quentin's works, and formed his black violence aesthetics. Violence is bloody, cold, game, and does not carry any moral and political responsibilities.
""Pulp Fiction"" thoroughly stylized and gamified violence. It makes the audience realize that at this moment, you are watching movies for entertainment, so Tarentino will turn violence into joke, sex into joke, politics into joke, and history into joke. It does not ask about the meaning, does not reflect, does not touch politics, not to mention resistance. The ""Bible"" quotes before Jules' killing were not intended to legitimize his murder. Similarly, the scene of Mia's overdose did not have any intention of exhorting drug addicts. ""Black"" has also been treated as a piece of joke. Both Vincent and Jules drove around the city in a car full of brains and blood. In order not to let the police find it, but also in order not to add trouble to their friends, they had to do it within 40 minutes. Cleaning the car is a very technical task, so that they have to hire a special problem-solving expert from the headquarters to guide them in their work. When the two big-hearted men finally washed themselves and the car Afterwards, while wearing two exaggerated and somewhat funny T-shirts standing in front of the camera, a scene full of blood and terror was transformed into a humorous sketch, and the popularity and gameplay are most vividly displayed here. So some people say: ""Pulp Fiction"" completed the transformation of violent movies from modernity to post-modernity, showing that post-modern violent movies have completely lost the power of social criticism, the depth and the profound connection between old movies and the real world. No longer carries the meaning of cultural symbols such as national mythology, heroism, social resistance, political complaints, etc. Some other similar cultural commitments are also taken out, leaving only the image itself. ""And the frequent scenes of violence in the film are echoing Its ""circular structure"" clearly states that the occurrence of violence is cyclical and never stops. ""Pulp Fiction"" tells us: In life, violence, including wars and boxing, is omnipresent. There is no justice in life and death, right or wrong in front of it.
Although Quentin Tarantino has never talked about postmodernism, he knows its essence. He seems to tell us that life in the 20th century is developing rapidly, changing fast and worthless. No one is immune. No matter whether life or death is unreasonable and fair Is a ""vulgar novel"", and this is where the subversive power of postmodern cinema aesthetics lies."
Timofey1980,"Jan 12, 2021",10/10,"Good day, dear friends and dear readers of reviews! Today I want to write about one of my favorite and many times revised American crime thriller 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"". The director of this film is the incredible Quentin Tarantino. The duration of the picture is two and a half hours, they fly by as one minute. The cast is very strong: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis and a lot of other great actors that I love and respect. A bouquet that is necessary! I really like the work of Quentin Tarantino, his style is always very different from others, it is difficult to confuse with someone else. Perhaps this picture of all his most cool. The film has everything you need to have fun. Bright actors-stars, atmosphere, humor, dynamics, music and much, much more! This film is memorable from the first time, but you still want to review it. Everything is unrealistically cool, romantic, unusual and interesting. I look and take my breath away. I know all the dialogues by heart for a long time, they are simply incomparable! All the movements of the dance Uma and John have long learned and danced. Who hasn't tried to repeat them? In general, it is very difficult to find fault with something in this film. In my opinion, the picture is perfect! I don't see the point in retelling the plot, everyone knows it anyway. And if there are those who have not seen the picture yet, then I strongly recommend it to raise the mood and get pleasure. I hope that those who love this film very much, I just decided to remind you about it just in case. I wish you all a great mood and a lot of positive emotions. Thanks for your attention."
lutzkevinandrew,"Nov 18, 2015",9/10,"Brilliant! Quinton Tarantino has out done himself with this film and its a must buy. His ability to place the audience in the middle of a crazy story and wrap it up at the end deserves recognition. This Film is full of amazing actors who make everything work beautifully. It is so hard to choose which character did the best job because their was so many. Uma Thurman, John Travolta, and Samuel L. Jackson in my opinion did the best. Watching this film for the first time requires a lot of attention as well as applause. The Cinematography was excellent and the ability for scenes to flow in such a way really is a work of art. Definitely a 9 out of 10 if not a perfect 10. Nothing can be changed to make this film better."
ryansmith-97575,"Nov 23, 2015",9/10,"It is a good movie, Action packed and interesting use of time. If you like Fight Club you will like Pulp fiction. I found the acting to be well done with an amazing performance from Samuel L. Jackson, and John Travolta. This movie can be comic and sad at the same time and contains very many different view points about how life works. I found that this movie is not at all rated for children and should be avoided by those who are easily offended or have weak stomachs. Drug use is prevalent in this movie. I am very pleased with the overall final result, great flick. I recently had to pick my top five movies of all time that I enjoyed and this made the list, following Fight Club and many great films to the same strength and fortitude."
brambilar,"Sep 27, 2019",10/10,"This movie without a doubt has never had a dull moment, there is always something bizarre or interesting happening around every corner. The cinematography is a masterpiece. Tarantino's style makes the audience feel like they're in the movie by the camera movements, and the way the story is told, is also one out of the many unique things about the film. The first time I've seen it, I was so confused on how the story was basically out of order but the more times I watched it, the more I caught onto Tarantino's style and the more I appreciated it. This movie was ahead of its time, and in my opinion considered a masterpiece."
dkaznelson,"May 9, 2018",9/10,"This movie is ass and doesn't deserve the critical acclaim that the other reviews is giving it. I thought Vin Diesel really sucked as that boxer sucked, and i thought they should have used The Rock instead. Also it was a huge stepdown from the other Travolta classics. This movie definitely should not be watched by anyone in the future."
rjrozen,"Jun 16, 2000",6/10,"I saw this movie on video, after hearing all sorts of movie critics praising Tarantino's masterful use of ""multiple narratives"" in this film.  I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of ""Rashomon,"" which was probably setting my expectations too high.  There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis.  And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie.  The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino.  The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes.  Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the ""banality of evil, but the ""hard-boiled"" dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence. As for the multiple story line concept, it's wasted here.  Tarantino actually did a better job with interweaving multiple story lines in ""Reservoir Dogs"" (another flawed film, but for different reasons).  And regarding what's in the briefcase--ultimately, who cares?"
zuma777,"Mar 7, 2013",1/10,"Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap.This is the most overrated film of all time. I'm even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didn't like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothing's wrong. It's a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were ""OK"" movies but didn't deserve the huge credit they received.I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. I'm not going to tell those of you that haven't seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Don't listen to anyone's opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then you're COOL!"
eastcoastguyz,"May 15, 2005",N/A,"It seems that Quentin Tarantino must have written this movie, by writing down some gross scenes he wants to play out and then almost as a jump-cut tries to string those scenes together. It doesn't work, what does work are the big stars in the movie to bring people to watch it. They think, a collection of stars, so it must be a great movie. Sometimes it is, but this one isn't.The dance scene was nothing special. People continue to believe that John Travolta is actually a dancer because of the movie Saturday Night Fever. He ""played"" a dance, which isn't the same as being a dancer. He looked overweight and stiff in the dance scene of this movie, although this scene was promoted heavy when the movie first name out. Quentin Tarantino must have thought, that since Travolta played a dancer in another movie, we should have him dance. While Christopher Walken who in addition to being a fine actor is also a real dancer, doesn't dance in this film, which is a shame. While Travolta was great in Get Shorty, this script isn't a mature work. The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. It tries to conceal this fact by showing gross scenes which you get bored with seeing at the first sign of blood. The bad guys aren't just bad, they are stupid. If crime is your business, and you intend to kill someone, just kill them, no sense in lecturing them. It isn't like they are going to improve from this lecture. Maybe Quentin Tarantino wrote this script and then realized it didn't have enough gross stuff, so he put more of it in. The shock value doesn't last long. There are many characters in the story which could have developed into a wonderful story, showing the interplay and relationships between them all, which it could have easily done consider this bore is 2 and a half hours long, but they decided to go for the undergrad film school approach to long scenes which make you wish for a TV ad to break it up. Last and certainly not the least offensive of this movie, is how horrible music was used incorrectly. Nothing but songs tossed in which have nothing to do with anything. This shows he isn't a mature filmmaker who knows what the power of music can do for films. Quentin Tarantino needs to watch more Hitchcock films for starters. Tarantino needs to study characters since all those in this film were pretty much one dimensional. The people who claim this is a master piece don't know what a real master piece is. They have not studied films, they have not lived, and most of all, they don't really think for themselves. The marketing of this film tells them it is hip, so they look at it to be hip."

This is a very great movie."
Trey_BigTime_Film_Crit,"Jan 4, 2021",10/10,"Let me however extrapolate, embedded in a Pulp Fiction review which I couldn't care less for - on my film review style - from someone who has a media degree in film studies, and began their career wagging school at fourteen to watch French Cinema; and you know what they say about people who have experiences at an impressionable age - it sticks! I gave up on Hollywood in approximately the early seventies after Easy Rider and Zabriskie Point. I even walked out on Five Easy Pieces, even though in retrospect, that wasn't the film's fault, in those days we were keen on life and not on introspection and reflection. Though retrospection, tells me that was a good film. In fact it is the kind of film that the baby boomers now crave, good writing, and good characterisation from a period in history when just being alive was an entertainment, and not bogged down with crazy little computer screens and cowards with their wise-arse messages tweeted because they are too afraid to speak, possibly because even the modulation of the voice has been colonised by trendoids, who are so post-modern and wise-arsed they know everything; but at the head of the pack are a bunch of no-talents who have clamoured to the high ground. And that list is endless in entertainment, now: Quentin Tarantino (highlight-dialogue in Pulp Fiction, ""In Holland, they have mayonnaise on their fries."" - conclusion - lame) Johnny Depp (the guy can't act, get it? That's why Australians get Oscars now, as Hollywood is beyond knowing, who can act]; Russell Crowe (just because Hollywood couldn't get anyone else to fill out a Roman general's tunic except maybe some wooden ex-wrestlers), he wins the Oscar-but in his next movie, A Beautiful Mind, everyone gets an Oscar except him, because basically, when you play a screw-loose professor, exchanging walking around in circles for walking around in squares, it is not acting! It is a guy walking around in squares cos he worked out that was a riff on walking around in circles]; Saving Private Ryan, though I hate to admit it is a brilliant film - through its depiction of my grandfather's generation, who when I was growing thought wasn't cool; but mine who made every piece of furniture in their house to a French polished standard; as well as, the P. A. system for my Uncle's successful band including the foldback cabinets-which even The Beatles didn't have-as well as keeping a 200 acre dairy farm as a hobby. Cool, I don't think I knew the meaning of the word; but the Juden angle in Saving Private Ryan which is shoved towards the POWs by a man brandishing - a Star of David (on his dog-tags?)-as the POWs march past-I'm not buying because usually and in that war in particular - it is the politicians, the military hierarchy and their bureaucratic underlings who systematically entrench racism as a tool of their propaganda and the common soldier is generally ideologically neuter as they have to follow orders or get shot - otherwise on the western front in 1915 both sides would have turned around and marched home. But that was the only glaring error in my opinion but this ethno-stereotyping, though understandable has spilled into other films, especially the Star Wars epics, by George Lucas, wherein Cowboys and Indians in Outer Space in the early films becomes metaphoric American foreign policy in latter films... to be continued..."
nomita-47552,"Mar 28, 2021",10/10,"One of the best movies ever. It's a perfect example for the use of a MacGuffin. It's not free of violence, but i mean it's a Trentino Movie."
MovieAddict2016,"Apr 3, 2004",8/10,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" is the quintessential example of great movie making, assorted using various constructive techniques that elevate the film to the highest possible level, stretching the boundaries and pushing upwards. Like all great directors, Q.T. lets the film and its subsidiaries stand on their own. A lesser director might employ cheap gimmicks and plot devices to move the story onwards at a brisk pace, but ""Pulp Fiction"" is a dark action, comedy, and/or drama that clocks in at two hours and thirty-four minutes. And not a single minute is wasted on material we think could have been shortened or cut. It's one of those rare motion pictures that leaves you wanting more, which only welcomes another immediate viewing to let everything sink in a second, third, or even fourth time.A lesser director than Tarantino might also force his characters into saying things they would not normally say, or into actions they would not normally act out in real life. Instead, Tarantino does something brilliant and seldom executed: He actually lets his characters evolve on-screen, and actually engage in every day conversations. Most critics interpret this as Quentin stopping to insert unnecessary (albeit entertaining) dialogue segments. They're wrong. The dialogue is strong, but it's there for a purpose. The difference is that dialogue in a movie such as ""The Presidio"" isn't real at all. The characters enter, move the plot forwards through speaking or acting, then proceed to repeat this in following instances, as if they're following the back of a mouth wash bottle (""rinse, spit, repeat""). Quentin does something else, by eavesdropping on his characters when their dialogue does mean something. No doubt Jules and Vincent have much to say about many things, but most of the time it is not relevant to the story. One must keep in mind that we actually hear little about Jules and Vincent, and even less talk between them. But when we do hear these things, it's strikingly true and purposeful. And this is what so many people miss when viewing ""Pulp Fiction"" -- the witty dialogue has become universally regarded as the strongest ever written, and while that may very well be correct, the idea that it is pointless is absurd. Quentin is subtle in the way he introduces his speeches; when Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) spend some two or three minutes discussing how the French translate the term ""Quarter Pounder with Cheese"" due to the metric system, it is amazingly deliberate: Quentin later uses this same reference for Jules before he and Vincent assassinate a group of young crooks who have stolen a briefcase from Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), one of the town's major kingpins.There are essentially three stories in ""Pulp Fiction,"" intertwined between one another. It opens with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and her boyfriend (Tim Roth) hatching a plan to rob a restaurant. By their reasoning, no one ever bothers with restaurants, just banks, so why not take advantage of them ""with their pants down""? The stick-up proceeds, which is when the famous titles roar forward and we find ourselves following Jules and Vincent, who work for Marsellus, who has paid championship boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) to fall in his upcoming match. But Butch has a better plan: Bet loads of money on himself, beat the other guy to a bloody pulp, and run away with his money. He almost gets away with it when he accidentally crosses paths with Marsellus once more, resulting in a rape scene to rival that in ""Deliverance.""Back to the dialogue. It is the driving force of the film, complementing the plot and allowing its characters to grow on us in ways we never imagined they would. It's the way in which the dialogue is deliberated that varies from most other examples of deliberation. For example, is it coincidence that we just so happen to overhear Jules and Vincent discussing the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese? No. But our instincts tell us that it seems very real, as if Tarantino went around filming real people, then edited together scenes where the dialogue could bear some sort of importance to the plot. There are different levels of dialogue -- plot-driven, and realistic -- but all dialogue is in service of its plot, just as all of what we say to our friends or family has a deeper meaning and will no doubt relate to the matter at hand. All dialogue relates to a larger scheme, and so does the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction."" It's just more casual and subtle than most movies. It's not pointless, but it's not deliberate, which is a fine line to try and balance on. Quentin does so successfully, crossing the finish line with enthusiasm, which is no doubt part of what elevates ""Pulp Fiction"" above so many other motion pictures of its genre.5/5."
saadanathan,"Apr 15, 2020",8/10,"First thing's first, this is tarantino's most original and famous script ever written. the diffrenet storylines of the characters in the movie are so great you would watch them again and enjoy them just like the first time. all diffrenet story arcs clash togeter in unexpected ways. one of the main advantages of the film is the narrative that goes all upsite down, the narrative doesn't go from start to finish and it's better that way, it's a way of tarantino to tell his story in all sort of ways and directions. the characters were well written and my favorite character has to be jules, he had most of the unforgetable lines and was a key member in the movie. the soundtrack was terrific and definitely great for the tone and genre of the movie. the actors were fantastic with samuel l. jackson and john travolta at there best in thus masterpiece. so if the movie is so perfect why give it a 8? maybe it's not perfect in all categories and maybe some people consider it only to be one of tarantino's greatest but not THE greatest. I for once disagree cuase it is perfect and surtely the best of all."
owenmaze-37828,"Dec 29, 2020",10/10,"A simple film, yet so intricate at the same time. Tarantino's dialogue is absolutely genius. If you haven't watched this already you're doing something wrong with your life."

gr8ful2u2,"Aug 24, 2014",6/10,"Quentin Tarantino is a good director who has a knack for combining wildly imaginative music selections for his movies that seem to work so well you have to laugh with joy.He also is known for dark comedy, combining unexpected twists that dismay audience members to the point they often refer to him as a ""genius"".The problem with ""genius"" is that what is genius to some is mundane to others.Tarantino is also known for his plot twists. However the excessive focus on plot twists creates an expectation from the audience, which opposes the basic appeal: the element of surprise.In Pulp Fiction, twists are introduced with little finesse. Tarantino has improved with the years, but Pulp Fiction, an early film, becomes boring before it is over.Certainly worth watching, but early and raw compared to Tarantino's later films."
Vegie,"Jan 4, 1999",1/10,"""Pulp Fiction"" has two things going for it; Sam Jackson(robbed at the Oscars) and Christopher Walken(who has the film's funniest sequence. But that's all. The Tim Roth/Amanda Plummer scenes are irritating and too profane(swearing's great, but not like this). The Bruce Willis ""Gimp"" scene is memorable but a little sicko, and The Uma Thurman sequence(you know the one) is absolutely unbearable. She and Travolta(too fat to dance and never a terrific actor) almost ruin this 1994 Tarantino film single handedly. But no, it is Tarantino himself that ruins the film; everyone is nasty, it's excessive, the way the three stories are told is confusing, and...that's about it. Some of it is funny, and Ving Rhames is good as Marsellus Wallace, but this is too much for me. I know many like Tarantino, but I think he's a show-off in the grand tradition of John Woo(one of his heroes apparently)."
Chrysanthepop,"Nov 3, 2008",N/A,"It's no surprise that 'Pulp fiction' is a movie that made cinematic history and defined the pulp fiction genre. It features a series of conversations and events coherently, but not chronologically, told. Tarantino tells three different but intertwined stories. Each of the stories are clichéd and have a noir feel but Tarantino gives them a different and unique treatment and adds sharp witty dialogues full of truth and irony (and references to many classic movies and popular TV shows). He uses a lot of warm colours and the film is slightly sepia tinted. Also there's a lot of attention to intricate detail and it is a finely layered movie such that one discovers something new with every subsequent viewing. There's also a certain ambiguity about it. It's not certain in which time the film is set or what was it in the briefcase that stunned Ringo...lots of questions and the answers are open for discussion. The cinematography is slick and sharp and the soundtrack is a classic. Then there's the outstanding cast that includes, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Rosanne Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeires and Amanda Plummer, all of whom have a magnificent presence and memorable dialogue delivery. There are so many classic scenes that people discuss, even today. My personal favourites are the date sequence (and the scenes that follow) with Travolta and Thurman and the series of conversations between Travolta and Jackson. I doubt there's anything to say about 'Pulp Fiction' that hasn't been said. Whether one likes it or not, this movie is here to stay and even today it is among the most talked about movies. I have already seen it at least four times and it still amuses and fascinates me just like it did during first viewing."
klastaitas,"Oct 7, 2020",10/10,"After Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarantino was asked to direct Men in Black, Speed and numerous other titles, however he refused all so he could concentrate on writing the masterpiece that has now become the daring, hilarious and beloved Pulp Fiction.
Pulp Fiction was originally planned to be three separate stories all written and directed by a different person. Tarantino got Roger Avery and Tony Scott on board but after a few months of writing Tarantino realised that he had to direct the full thing. He adopted novelistic techniques such as non-linear structure and intertwining narratives to craft the astounding story of two robbers, two gangsters, a gangster's wife and a boxer.
The film is a glorious ""F you"" to conventional storytelling, there is no plot but somehow it manages to pull you into a world of witty dialogue and horrible violence. There isn't a moment in this film when I fell bored, after each rewatch it always retains the same joy I had upon my first watch.
Not only is the film great in of itself but opens up a whole different world of cinema I had no idea existed. It's because of this film I discovered Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini, it's because of this film that I found the treasure trove of Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe adaptations which then led to me finding the cult classic Faster Pussycat...Kill Kill! This movie managed to have so many references, without every feeling contrived, that there's probably still some ones only known to Tarantino himself.
Although the directing is top-notch there is no doubt that writing is the star of the show, Tarantino manages to go off on tangents about burgers, feet and five dollar shakes without ever making a dull moment. Tarantino says the Sicilian speech in True Romance is the best of writing he has done, but for me every line of this film beats that speech.
Not only did this film have a profound impact on audiences, but it also greatly affected directors and writers at the time. Pulp Fiction did for 90's and 2000's what Easy Rider did for the 70's, stuck the middle finger up to ""normal"" films and decided to go in a completely opposite route. Pulp Fiction completely changed movies after that. Guy Ritchie came about,adopting the same intertwining story technique and the same sense of humour and we must not forget Amores Perros and 21 grams all amazing films influenced by Pulp Fiction.
The affect this film has had on the audience and film in general is why I value it as one of the greatest movies ever made (and is also why I watch once a month, I just can't help myself)."
enriquelr-50976,"Aug 8, 2020",9/10,"I think the genius of pulp fiction comes in its ability to take multiple unique stories and weave them together perfectly through unconventional means. It can be argued that the chapters of the film work independently, but when put in an ensemble, each one gives us a peak into a world that feels lived in and larger than what we're presented with, at the same time, Pulp Fiction still changes the audiences perspective of the world it takes place in with each subsequent chapter while still feeling like the world we were introduced to in the very first scene. The chapters are famously unchronological and I believe it's a testament to Quentin Tarantino's creative genius and skills as a writer that a lot of its potency and impact as a film can be accredited to its unconventional sequence. Its a film about perspective, at least that's what I took from it, and I appreciate how the only real ""point"" or ""message"" it has is precisely that anyone can come to a conclusion about it, much like the theories revolving around the contents of the briefcase that pushes the plot forward in the first place."

Emmajoy93,"May 13, 2016",10/10,"Pulp fiction is one of the best crime/ dramatic movie of my time. The movie had such a great cast, and some intense dramatic scene pretty much through the whole movie. I remember not liking this movie when I was a kid, but now that I am older I really enjoy watching this film. There are a lot of great scenes in this movie but the most memorable scene I think was when Uma Thurman and John Travolta are dancing on stage at the restaurant to "" You never can tell"" by Chuck Berry. Another famous and great scene is Samuel L Jacksons speech hes giving to the guy while shooting every one else. A lot of action shots in this film, drugs, guns, and violence. A very brilliantly shot film."
Nick S,"Aug 7, 1998",10/10,"This is indeed the best movie I have ever seen. I don't know how people actually hate it. It's a totally original movie, its got everything from violence to extreme profanity. this in my opinion gets a 10/10 for sure."
i-fraher,"Dec 18, 2015",10/10,"This movie is amazing. I love Tarantino. I love violence. I love this movie. This movie is so freaking good that i could talk about it for hours. It was not the first Tarantino movie i saw, nor the 2nd,3rd, or 4th but it should have been. I now know why this movie is so well known. The cinematography is awesome and the whole look of the film in general is an experience to see. The really cool thing about this movie is that its shot out of chronological order. The scenes are completely all over the place. They do not go in order. Its different and could confuse you but i was still able to pick up on the movie and what was going on because all though none of the scenes were shot in order they all connect to each other a little bit in a way. I think that the way its shot out of chronological order makes the movie awesome and unique. I've seen a number of movies shot out of chronological order but this one is the best in my opinion. Im not lying when i say everything about this movie is a freaking trip! Its got an insanely good cast starring in it and it has a lot of violence. Love this movie. Tarantino never disappoints me."

Are there really any other films out there with legendary scene after legendary scene after legendary scene? Maybe, but not on the same scale as Pulp Fiction.Who hasn't seen this already?

CalDexter,"Jul 17, 2008",1/10,"I will never understand why Pulp Fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. Quentin Tarintino's first film Reservoir Dogs was amazing. It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.Oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh.So i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it.Quiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes. Pulp Fiction is one of the worst movies I've ever had to endure, its a long boring ride to a sore head."
ringspeed,"Jan 4, 2021",10/10,"Some films date due to technology, fashion or political message. This film has none of it, just a unique combination of scenes bringing the best out of the characters. Yes some scenes drag, Walkens cameo is overly long, the scenes between Bruce Willis and his girlfriend unnecessary to the plot, but everything is spot on from the soundtrack to the pacing to the directorial skill."

jackamccallum,"May 29, 2019",10/10,"Pulp Fiction is clever, funny, well acted, well directed, thought provoking and extremely entertaining. Best performance of Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta's careers as well as an amazing addition to Quentin Tarantino's Filmography. The film is darkly comedic and makes you laugh hysterically over moments that you would otherwise not find amusing. The dialogue is sharp and witty yet feels very realistic for most of the film (occasional monologues aside). The film can make characters seem like total bad-asses just by having them eat food (in this case a burger) and can make you sympathize and care about horrible people. The film is extremely entertaining with no scene feeling like it goes for too long and every moment serving a purpose in the overall narrative. It is widely inventive and there is a reason people give this movie so much praise. All fans of movies and general cinema goers need to give this film a watch at some point in their life."
bcaulford,"May 1, 2013",N/A,"for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince's heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lance's house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film."
krips-from-iit-kgp,"Jun 30, 2009",9/10,"There are movies that open you up, and make you feel relaxed. Some of the movies can give you strength and make you feel hopeful. They are full of messages. But there are some movies, which are just the opposite. They cause a violent feeling within you. After watching those movies you may say to yourself 'shit! what did I see?' 'That is so vicious!' or something similar.It is obvious that I am referring to Pulp Fiction to the second type. I am sure everyone must be shocked by the way the film progressed. The executions, drug consumption, the lifestyles of thugs, conversations etc. are shown in such a raw way that it will make you think for days about the movie and make you say to yourself 'shit! what did I see?'. The movie gave no explicit messages and just had shown lifestyles of certain kind of people. But this no-message story, is shown in such raw and real way that it will make you see and think about this movie again and again. Hats off to direction.That's why the name :""Pulp Fiction"""
margineanvladdaniel,"May 23, 2022",7/10,"I thought that the ""best"" of Tarantino's work is this one, considering the fans and the rate, but it was not far from the others. I expected a better violence cinematography, but was bellow Once upon a time. It was better and it was the only thing I liked about it: the storytelling, but that's it. Most of the plots were predictable. I think most of the fans loved Samuel's character journey, but for me wasn't enough and impressing, a bit dull even. He almost deserved that Oscar nomination, Quentin too, but Uma and John weren't worthy. Their screen time were too short and inconsistent to be that praising as everyone does. Hateful eight, still my favorite and best of all. Change my mind! Peace!"
Hunca,"Jan 31, 1999",1/10,"Well, I finally saw 'Pulp Fiction'. Hadn't after all this time, but I've heard *so* much ta-doo over it, so I rented it.UGH.I guess I must not be film critic material, because I didn't appreciate the 'art' of this film, or its 'brilliance', or any 'statement' it might have made. It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing about, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.When the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer.I worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.Time to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of 'em."

JamesW1967,"Oct 22, 2015",9/10,"Inspired by true events, a true story, masterful, twisted and bent Quentin Tarantino with a crowd of brilliant talent that destroys essential life to promote egotistic nepotism; in short stunning and sensational.Pulp Fiction has a timeless addiction that pervades the veins and makes the heartbeat faster... Why 9? Whine and wine again... there's something special about being inglorious... and years later Quentin is still pumping the fiction and mashing the pulp. This film has insights looking both backward and forward ... a reel show of American ideology that alludes to foreign infiltration of the system.How can one not love Pulp Fiction? From one of America's most controversial film directors who does not shy away or shudder in fear, a man who tackles complex thematic material head on, in overt gritty chains... and has managed to unchain the bleeding heart flicker by flicker."

I'm sure everything has been said already, so I'll keep this review short.'The Twist' scene with Travolta and Thurman was courageous film-making from a young director, and it took even more courage to include it in the final version of the film. At the end of the day, if we don't all agree that 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) was genius, then Tarantino looks arrogant and we all point to that scene as an example of a has-been actor and an over-rated young director. Instead, I watch that scene and hold my breath, because even without dialogue, Tarantino used two cameras to make magic on the screen for those few minutes. That scene is a microcosm of the entire film - bold & brilliant.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

cartesianthought,"Dec 20, 2015",8/10,"Pulp Fiction put non-linear out-of-order films on the map. With all of the films that follow a formula, it's good to see one that's essentially a puzzle you have to piece together. Each of the characters have some way of bumping into each other. As a departure from the grave tone of his first film, the indie hit Reservoir Dogs, this started Tarantino's signature style of excessively gory dark comedies with humorous observational dialogue.This film is bizarre, has some tense frantic moments, will make you laugh and is overall unlike any other film out there. It's biggest advantage, aside from Samuel Jackson and John Travolta having philosophical discussions about hamburgers, is the fact that it's volatile and it's completely impossible to predict what's next. This was a benchmark movie and, in some ways, a paradigm shift for the industry."

yiwanir,"Apr 26, 2020",10/10,"I don't think I can describe in words the immense impact Pulp Fiction (and as a matter of fact, all of Tarantino's work) has had on me both as a person and a filmmaker. It's brilliant, it's exciting, it's fascinating and extraordinarily executed - it's everything a film should be. Watching Pulp Fiction just brings me true joy, in a way that no other film is able to - it fulfills the purpose of art, in my opinion, to the highest degree."
anthonywltrs,"Sep 24, 2022",7/10,"Throughout the years I often heard how Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all time. It wasn't until today I finally had taken the time to sit down and watch this for the first time from start to finish to see what all the fuss is about. Needless to say, this is a very mixed bag for meWhat I like about Pulp Fiction is the plot being all jumbled up and not straight forward like many other movies where you see how everything begins and ends. Pulp Fiction doesnt do that. It's back to front so to speak starting at the end but going backwards. It feels disconnected and out of place as it tells different stories but they are actually are all connected in a wayI also liked the deep themes and talks of existentialism, nihilism and philosophical talks of God with some of the characters. It also helped the movie had a great star studded cast to give Pulp Fiction and extra umph to itWhat I dont like is the subplot for Burce Willis's character that involved him and a mob boss being tied up and were about to be raped by two guys with the mob boss getting raped. I hate rape and I hate how it's used in media. It's just awful and always feel sick about it. If I had known rape was a factor in Pulp Fiction I would not have bothered at all. Thankfully though the rapists get what's coming to them in the endI also didnt like how some scenes and dialogue with the characters fell flat where nothing really happens and it just drags on and on. I actually didnt start to like or get interested until Bruce Willis is in a shootout with the mob boss character but then the rape part comes ugh.Overall this movie was decent and I have no regrets in taking the time to watch this for my Sunday morning. It's definitely not a movie I'd be considered in watching again, once is enough for me and not to add to my ever growing DVD collection."
Lil'Girl,"Aug 19, 1999",1/10,"I must be one of the few individuals on this planet that totally detested this film. I left the cinema feeling extremely ill. I went along to this film on the recommendation that it was highly amusing but I guess their idea of ""humour"" isn't quite the same as mine.Sure, it had some clever moments but why belabour the point."
Grimbleton,"Jan 16, 2021",9/10,"Probably Tarantino's best film, Pulp Fiction is a self-sidetracking and highly combustible film that out-does itself at every turn. Centered around several people who's individual arcs all meet at the fork in the road, the film does a masterful job of developing characters and telling a story about people striving to keep and flaunt their power. The performances by the star-studded cast are absolutely stunning and are only augmented by Tarantino's whimsical dialogue, with almost a twenty-minute sequence with just Vincent and Jules talking about nonsense. Every scene only enhances the depth of these characters, providing great insight into the personalities that make up people like Butch or Marsellus by providing a window into the way they think and interact with others. Although the jumbled time-frame can cause confusion at first, it all eventually falls into place and wraps itself up in the end, making for one interesting film. Probably my favorite aspect of the film is how it treats every character like a normal human being, foregoing the heroics and the pretense of a ""primary protagonist"" - this leaves the viewer with a film where they observe the initial position of a character and watch that character go through a set of struggles completely unique (and in some cases absolutely mental) that put their personalities and beliefs to the test. All in all, this is Tarantino's best film and shows how ditching the traditional film setup creates a film with an unprecendented form, all only to aid in its success."
davidjohnson-27-97514,"Jun 14, 2014",9/10,"Tarantino might not be the best actor in the world and a lot of people just don't like him and his movies full stop but I really do think he has created a master piece when it comes to pulp fiction and if you ever get the chance to watch it in a movie theater take that opportunity with both hands.I think the real reason Tarantino has been able to make such a classic movie is because he is a film fan and only a film fan could have ever put together the pulp fiction movie and made it work, I watched pulp fiction on my 50"" plasma screen last weekend probably for the 20th time and it has everything, gangsters, hit men, drugs, comedy, extreme violence but most of all it has ""COOL"" this is the movie that makes you feel like smoking or giving up your day job and being someone more interesting...in reality cool is not very cool at all and you most likely end up dead but as far as movies go this is cool."
Marx Marvelous,"Aug 4, 2001",10/10,This is one of those extremely rare movies that leave you depressed at the end -only because you don't want it to end.
Lukec1229,"Dec 14, 2015",9/10,"This film was a wild one. Definitely blew my earlier expectations of it out of the water. The way in which it is told is brilliant, with non-linear, seemingly random, disjointed plot lines, that all come together and manage to tell a story of their own. It's an extremely violent, drug filled, dirty, gritty, crazy film about crime, but it's also full of great, witty, and intelligent dialogue and it's full of minute things and details you may not pick up on at first. It was an entertaining and darkly humorous film, but it's also an intelligent and revolutionary one that broke new ground, that I'd definitely recommend watching it at least once."
thenameisjj,"Jul 13, 2020",10/10,I've heard about this film for years. I always pushed it away because I thought old films weren't really my thing. They were always so raw but too long for me. But pulp fiction has to be one of the best films. I have never seen such a comedic and raw movie that would keep me at the edge of my seat. The fact that the first scene fitted so well with the last scene is amazing.
ngafny4,"Oct 29, 2020",10/10,"""Pulp Fiction"" is the classic of classics; Tarantino truly possesses the Midas touch. This 1994 masterpiece is brilliant in all aspects; from the ingenious writing to the wildly witty dialogue to its captivating character creation; the overall excellence of Pulp Fiction makes it not only among the best, but maybe the most rewatchable movie of all time. Nearly every scene is gold and crafted to divine perfection. Pulp Fiction is truly a remarkable feat in the art of filmmaking."

Shilo_R_A,"May 20, 2024",7/10,"Relatively close to the beginning of my deep-dive into cinema - you know, writing reviews and all - Quentin Tarantino managed to become one of my favorites almost instantly. Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained - all of these really blew me away, and even when watching some of his still-popular-but-not-as-much films, he never missed for me. Needless to say that for several years now I've been wanting to watch this movie, but I haven't, because I wanted to make my way towards it up the IMDb poster. And well, look at that. Here we are, on the second feature we're watching from the top 10. Let's get to it.Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's second film, and it's honestly quite a tough one to explain, plot-wise, without getting into spoilers. Let's try to approach it like this: Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) is a ruthless, cold-blooded mafia boss. Throughout the film we have three stories, each of them related to his shady business. Our three main characters are Vincent Vega (John Travolta) - a smooth, charming agent under Wallace, Butch (Bruce Willis) - a boxer who has made a dangerous deal with Wallace, and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) - a theatrical, dramatic agent of Wallace who operates alongside Vincent in some of their tasks. Three characters, three interconnected stories.When people think of cool cinema, many of them think of Tarantino, and especially this movie. Tarantino has his way with cool writing, he sure does. Every movie of his I've seen had at least several moments that were really memorable and badass. I wouldn't say that this movie per se is where it shows most - maybe he's still trying too hard, at times, here, considering it's a rather early movie of his, developed from early ideas- but generally, yeah, this movie has some moments that will definitely make you appreciate Tarantino's badass-ness. Something about the casualness of all the violence here (like the old comedy song says, cool guys don't look at explosions) has both comical and awesome nature.The dialogue here plays into this idea of being nonchalantly violent and in danger - characters in life threatening situations can talk about foot massages or coffee like it's nothing. It creates some iconic moments for sure, and this movie is indeed very quotable. Only two significant characters here are poorly written, in my opinion: Winston Wolf and Mia Wallace. Without getting into spoiler territory, I'll just say that the actors (Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman) can do so much better, and pity that they weren't given characters that are fuller, less amateurish.Talking about rough-around-the-edges: the term ""pulp fiction"" refers to books that were provocative, full of sex and violence, but also not so good - only made to sell and entertain. Despite this movie being good, I think that the title does fit it. Just look at the poster - it's like a cover for a book that's supposed to lure you in, stories that teenagers will read and hide because they're supposed to only be for adults. The short-story structure, the general violence and crudeness, how it tries to appeal to guys more than to gals. In the end of the day, it is what it is - a fun film, an entertaining one, but far from being a life altering experience for me.The soundtrack is great, as always. Tarantino has some of the most iconic soundtracks out there, and not only because he picks good songs, but because he knows how to make it fit to the scene perfectly. Usually they have some cool subtext, and they just turn the iconic-meter up almost every time. Always memorable soundtracks.The structure of this movie is unusual, and it's definitely one of the things that it's famous for. It's a cool idea, and though it disturbs the momentum of the movie a little bit it's nothing serious. I do feel like it makes everything a little messier, less consistent, but it's not necessarily a bad thing - this is sort of the point, and I can appreciate that, for better or worse. I also feel like the gold watch story was better than the other ones, btw, but it's not that big of a gap in quality.To sum it up: Pulp Fiction fits its title very, very well - just like a pulp magazine, this movie is a little rough around the edges, but fun and entertaining nonetheless. From the classic poster to the dialogue - everything is screaming violent, crude, hot pulp fiction, and I kinda like it overall, despite (any maybe also because of) its roughness. Feeling a 7.6/10 on this one."
Tecun_Uman,"Jul 17, 2005",1/10,"You want to do something really neat? Take the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" and re-cut it, so that, instead of being out of sequence, it is actually in proper sequence. It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on! OK, I know that Travolta is cool and Jackson is funny. However, let's reserve the greatest films of all-time category for real masterpieces and real stories, and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks."
Top_Dawg_Critic,"Jul 11, 2017",10/10,"This is Quentin Tarantino's legacy. I have never seen such an ensemble all star cast come together so well and perfect in any one film.

zeemaza,"Jul 20, 2020",10/10,"Not one movie can claim to have half the entertaining dialogue that this movie has. From beginning to end, not one word is out of place, or boring. Many movies may have one piece of dialogue that elevates the movie enough for you to like it, but Pulp Fiction is sheer joy of conversation, paired with situation after situation of pure excitement.I am sure I will never seen a movie that will be this much fun again! In fact, this movie alone has convinced me that Tarantino has to be the greatest movie maker of all time. This is my go to movie when I can't make up my mind what to watch; I am guaranteed satisfaction!The movie has no plot! It is a collection of out-of-sequence stories that make up the last few days of the life of a hit man, played by Travolta. That's it! He and his partner are simply taking care of an errand and it goes wrong, while he also has to take his boss's wife out for dinner to keep her entertained while he (the boss) goes out of town for the night. That, too, goes wrong. Every single thing in that movie just goes horribly wrong and it's just fabulous.The acting is compelling. The cinematography is masterful and just sets a nostalgic mood that makes you want to return to. The direction is ... oh well ... Tarantino. And the dialogue is the best ever. Really.Please see it."

s0apt0ken,"Jun 7, 2022",10/10,"Pulp Fiction doesn't have a plot. Or, it doesn't have a linear and evolving plot. Instead, it is just a collection of relatively unrelated stories that include some of the same characters. However, what makes this crime movie special is these stories aren't about the dangerous life and business of a gangster, but instead about just the day to day life of people who happen to be employed by the mob. Now, at first this may seem boring and pointless, but after a closer look, you'll realize that there is one thing about these stories that stands out. The dialogue. Every conversation is unrealistically realistic. People will go on long debates and monologues about everything from french burgers, the metric system, foot massages, tasty burgers, refreshing beverages, why some guy got thrown out of a window because of a foot massage, divine intervention, good coffee, comfortable silences, and just walking the Earth. Every conversation seems like an exaggeration of a conversation you might have. This is only made better by the intermittent action and violence that occurs, which only adds to the complete absurdity that makes this movie so great.Pulp Fiction is one of funniest, most interesting, and most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. 100/100. An absolutely necessary watch."
rockstararpita,"Jul 21, 2020",10/10,"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace.

The reason why it took me several sessions over several  years to finally assimilate this boring piece of filmdom crap is simply because its silly story and peculiar characters are one dimensional sensationalistic nonsense which almost anyone could have created and I personally found them boring...not unlike Sunday morning cartoons. Of course that criticism flies in a face of incredible popularity by the public and critics alike not to mention an Oscar and countless other awards. Go figure. Bottom line, ""Pulp..."" -is- pulp fiction brought to the big screen with all the gratuitous filth and violence of a dime novel but without the one thing which could really have made it interesting. Why no T&A???"
cfcpg,"Nov 18, 2005",2/10,"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!"
mohamedramdanmohamedshata,"Oct 6, 2020",10/10,"For me this is the best Quentin Tarantino's film ever. Blood ,madness and music make this film a masterpiece. Even some scenes are took from another older movies but still you feel this scenes and enjoy it. In fact this movie makes a new line in the cinema which is a collection between gangster's movies and dark comedy .It's different in his style and we can see this through it's intro and it's chapters that make you confused but still enjoying the film. No wonder that this film nominate for 7 Oscars and won one of them which is best original screenplay for Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino . If any one doesn't watch this movie yet. I recommend this movie to watch now ."
theoledoux,"Nov 1, 2020",10/10,"Every time I watch this movie, I get reminded why they call Quentin Tarantino a master of dialogue. It is a shockingly smart and original movie all the way through. Every actor does a tremendous job at delivering quotable yet realistic lines. It is very tough to decide which scene is the best. The burger scene? The ending scene? The overdose? The escape from the rapists? I guess I will never know which one I prefer, and that, is what makes this film truly iconic."
reynoldslewis-96294,"Dec 14, 2020",10/10,"The greatest movie ever made. It is one of my favourite movies, and i love everything about it."
SulphurMan,"Sep 30, 2003",N/A,"Ill go on record and claim that Pulp Fiction is probably the best motion picture Ive ever seen. After you have seen Pulp Fiction, things are just different, whether you like it or not.Other films seem empty, boring, un-creative, formulaic, and bland compared to this monster. What happened with Pulp Fiction is more or less a pop culture phenomenon. This film single-handedly set the blueprint for every other film that followed it. Everything from high budget epics to teen romances draw on aspects of this flick. Some incredible things came with Pulp Fiction, and almost 10 years later it is still sending tremors throughout the motion picture industry.Compelling and comedic dialogue, brilliant editing, top notch acting, bravado directing - this film encapsulates everything good, fun and clever about the filmmaking process and audience interaction with a film. Tarantino gets career high performances from John Travolta, Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman. You put these people under any other director and look what happens...not a whole lot. What happened with this movie was nothing short of pure genius on all counts. What you get here is a collection of entertainment, shock and disbelief. All of these things swarm into your mind as you watch this, and surrendering to them is enjoyable. How many movies could you just listen to? Ive had this movie on in another room as I did other things, and it was still pretty entertaining. The dialogue is obviously what sent this movie over the top, and with good reason - it is quite simply incredible.Its hard to summarize my thoughts coherantly on this one...It is THAT good. If you havent seen this, rent it, watch it and enjoy it. Its one hell of a ride.***** out of ******"
Maniac-9,"Aug 5, 1998",10/10,"Quentin Tarantino has proven to be the best director since Martin Scorsese came on the scene in the 1970's.  The movie stars some of today's biggest stars, e.g. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, and Ving Rhames.  Plus the absolutely hilarious and cool scene with Christopher Walken telling Young Butch the importance of a gold watch."
jamiedarlow-37510,"Apr 19, 2020",10/10,"An absolute classic in every sense and a must see for anyone even vaguely interested in films! A non-linear narrative following various characters including two hitmen Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson) a mob boss Marcellus Wallace and his wife Mia (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a boxer named Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). They all have stories that are seemingly unrelated but come together subtly through their lives intertwining. It's masterful cinematic story telling, holding buckets of style while also making time to explore its characters and delve into their personalities underneath the crime plot lines. The dialogue is insanely good and the lyrical flow of it keeps you enthralled throughout. I remember when I was a young kid fascinated by the grown up world of Tarantino's films. My fantastic mother let me watch all of his catalogue apart from this one until I was older (due to the distressing gimp rape scene) and there was so much built up for when I became of age to finally watch this masterpiece. It certainly didn't disappoint and it was my favourite QT picture to date. It's rightly become a huge staple in pop culture while also maintaining serious rewatchability and classic status. 'Zed's Dead, baby. Zed's Dead.'"
slightlymad22,"Aug 11, 2019",9/10,"I just finished watching Pulp FictionTarantino nails his screenplay again. This type of talent is not taught at a screenwriting class. You either have it or you do not. Sadly too many people are making movies today, who do not have it, and there are too few talents like Tarantino.Too many movies these days just seem to say things to advance the plot. The dialogue here is genius, brilliantly funny (you laugh at the dialogue, even though he does not seem to be going for a laugh) and no two characters sound the same, everyone has their own way of talking. I'm appreciating the dialogue so much more watching them again.I think this was the first time I watched a movie that was so non linear. I think everything I had watched before this went from A to B with possibly a flashback explaining something. This changed everything!! After this we had great movies like The Usual Suspects and Monento. But it is not just the structure to Pulp Fiction that makes it great, it does not put a foot wrong.Whilst this movie revived John Travolta's career, it's Samuel L Jackson who steals the show. Every time I watch the movie I think he should have won the Oscar. Then I watch Ed Wood, and think Martin Landau deserved it. My opinion on this one, really comes down to which of the two movies I last watched.Harvey Kieren (in his second Tarantino flick) is great as Winston Wolf (I really wish he did not parody this role in tv ads) Tim Roth (also in his second Tarantino flick) and Amanda Plummer fun and I can not believe I never noticed it was Steve Buscemi (also in his second Tarantino flick) as the waiter Buddy Holly at Jack Rabbit Slim's.Pulp Fiction was a massive hit. It grossed $107 million (against an $8 million budget)
At the domestic box office to end the year, as the 10th highest grossing movie of the year."
lonsdalegeezer,"Sep 1, 2002",9/10,"PULP FICTION is a singular show. The best way to describe it is that it is as if you sit down in the living room with the television and are immediately transported to a roller coaster going full speed through a fun house of ghoulish images. This is complemented with one of the funniest, smartest, and filthiest dialogs I have heard in a long time. There is no other movie I can compare it to. It has the adrenaline flow of SPEED, the intelligent dialog of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, the violence of the goriest part of the GODFATHER, and the comedy of AUSTIN POWERS. All that having been said, it is like none of the above other than the superficial aspects I just mentioned.If extreme violence (e.g., brains blown on car windows) is something you can not endure, if 700 uses of the F word is something you can not tolerate, if heavy drug use is something you care never to see (cocaine is passe we learn, all of the in-gangsters now do heroin), then do not pay your money to see PULP FICTION.On the other hand, all of the above really works in this show. This is a parody of criminal life and a really funny one. This is a show that takes one chance after another. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are nothing short of terrific in it. Oscars are possible here. They play the hit men for a major bad guy (Marsellus Wallace). The bad guy is also paying a boxer (Bruce Willis) to take a dive. Harvey Keitel plays a fixer of problems for the bad guy. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer play a couple of two-bit crooks who like robbing restaurants because nobody else does that. Eric Stoltz plays a low class drug dealer and Rosanna Arquette plays his girlfriend who has rings in every part of her anatomy (yes, there too). Christopher Walken shows up in a single long important scene. Uma Thurman plays the major bad guy's wife. Whew, and I probably missed a lot of other people who did some great acting.The major hero and the one who took the most risks in this movie was the scriptwriter. He was also the director - Quentin Tarantino. The script went from funny scenes like a restaurant where all the staff were 50s famous look-alikes to a scene where the two hit men were first discussing what a McDonald's quarter-pounder is called in France and why to a discussion of whether it was okay to kill someone for massaging your wife's feet.This is a movie that to describe it will only make you want NOT to go see it, yet it is mesmerizing and wonderful. The intensity level of the movie is off the scale. People were laughing like crazy in the theater and to intelligent dialog too. Other scenes had the audience gasping for breath and uttering out loud ""oh, my god"". Several scenes were worse than the finger cutting scene in The Piano.The camerawork was mainly standard stuff, but there are several scenes where it got pretty experimental. The best example is the long scene of Wills staring into the camera without moving while he listens to the major bad guy, whom we have not yet seen, delivering a long lecture. It then switches to a view of only the back of the bad guy's head with everything else out of focus while Willis listens for quite a while more."
Det_McNulty,"Jun 18, 2007",7/10,"Following the success of 1992's Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino released his finest film to-date, the self-proclaimed masterpiece Pulp Fiction; a film which is arguably the most influential of the last few decades, and one which stands alone as a ""to-be"" classic. Pulp Fiction remains widely regarded as one of the essentials in modern cinema, which has established itself as a film for the lovers of cinema, as those are the people it gets its greatest amount of admiration from.Pulp Fiction marked the new-wave, avant-garde cinema, it became recognised for its vigorously exciting flavour and unfathomable cool. Revolving around a deconstructed narrative, composed of three stories, which are all insanely surreal, Pulp Fiction brings you inside a world Quentin Tarantino has successfully crafted through individuality. The film starts with a lavishly entertaining conversation of tension and wit between two robbers, one being Tim Roth and the other being Amanda Plummer, who kick-start the film with furious energy. This scene is then followed by the infamous conversation of Amsterdam and burgers between the justifiable ""cool"" of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). From here on in you have entered a world fuelled by greed and missing-morality.Sure, Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the ""coolest"" and ""hippest"" films around, nevertheless it holds much, much more than that. The film stands as a piece which depicts the psychology of normal people who have been thrown into extreme circumstances, meaning their personalities have changed along with their situation. It is a film which is much than amusingly clever on the surface, as in fact Pulp Fiction juggles allegory, such as the ""freedom"" of Amsterdam being a counterpart for the film's non-conformist, disobedient nature. The film has countless recurring themes, such as redemption, vengeance, spirituality, morality, individual morals, and a person's mannerisms.Even behind the film's humorous anecdotes there is still a lingering sense of haunting poignancy the film throws upon its viewer. The inviting environments are simply an innovative showcase for a study of one's ethics and the dealing of horrendously problematical situations. The characters are all vigorously layered, with multi-dimensional emotions and spontaneous behaviour. When I say that every actor performs with undeniable perfection, I mean it. From Christopher Walken's cameo as Captain Koons, to Bruce Willis' alpha-male, yet kind-hearted ""boxer-thug"" performance. Everyone in the film sets themselves a back-drop for their character, letting every character differentiate between one-an-other. Yet, as Harvey Keitel states in the film, ""of course you're character, but it doesn't mean you have character"".Dense script-writing, and what might seem like entirely irrelevant dialogue lets Pulp Fiction become its own piece. And rather than being driven by plot, the film is driven by its variety of surreal characters, who all talk in a way which seems so real. Yes, the conversations may not to be the same topic you talk about with another person, but the way in which a conversation branches off to an entirely different topic is something we all do in everyday life. Few films are able to portray dialogue through such a method, which is one of the countless reasons as to why Quentin Tarantino's script is the key instinctive foundation behind the film, since it lays the rules of what is to occur in a latter scene. The script crafts the comedy, as there are no comedic set-pieces in the film, nor is there a comedic narrative. However, the actors' delivery of nerve-biting, ego-driven lines, which brim with humour and emphasised body language, gives the film its distinguished tone of dark comedy.One of the reasons Pulp Fiction has become so iconic is due to its diversity in film-making, which is comprised of influences from French new-wave cinema, to Asian crime flicks, yet the film is still entirely original. Quentin Tarantino ultimately creates his own sense of ""bravo-film-making"". The use of tracking-shots, dolly-zooms, variation in lens focus, quick-cut editing, slow-motion sequences, lyrical camera positioning, steadicam tactics and close-up camera shots, the variety Pulp Fiction has is not just held within inside its narrative, but within its technical side too. Then you have the dynamic use of music, which has clearly been hand-picked by Quentin Tarantino himself and suits the film with a simplistic level of ease. The set-pieces are also crafted with scrutinising detail, such as the notorious lair, involving two hillbillies, a gimp and two of the film's protagonists.Pulp Fiction is, quite simply, a hard-boiled, noir-toned masterpiece of modern cinema, comprised of film-making which deserves to be dissected frame-by-frame. The sheer unadulterated consistency of greatness Pulp Fiction follows means it is a film which should be watched again and again. Yes, all the characters might be ""sinners"", yet there is no denying that you will be rooting for a certain character(s) by the end of the film, as surely, with characters as diverse as these there must be someone you share the same belief with, right? Devine-intervention is what Pulp Fiction is, a miracle and one which justifies vast acknowledgement. Take for example Jimmy's (Quentin Tarantino) brief conversation on the ""gourmet"" of coffee, it sums up the magnificence of Pulp Fiction perfectly, not forgetting the addition of ""lots of cream, lots of sugar""."
Skeletors_Hood,"Jan 20, 2003",N/A,"How this movie even got filmed is beyond me.  It is nothing but glorified crime wrapped in a lame attempt at philosophy.  I watched this at the recommendation of my friends, who both said that it was a brilliant film, and that it had very hilarious scenes.  I found no humor, no plot, and no point to this trash.  Shame on Sam Jackson for starring in this piece of trash, as well as everyone else who appeared in this film.  Tarantino should never be allowed behind a camera again!Avoid at all costs....you may lose respect for the actors involved. I sure did."
SnoopyStyle,"Dec 18, 2015",10/10,Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) robs a diner. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are thugs working for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). They pick up a mysterious briefcase but an incident requires cleaner the Wolf (Harvey Keitel). Marsellus is paying Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a boxing match. Vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman Mia (Uma Thurman).This is Quentin Tarantino's big breakout. I saw this in the theater and probably even before 'Reservoir Dogs'. I definitely saw 'True Romance' before this but I had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until I put two and two together. This is a cinematic explosion. Many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. It is super cool. It's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. Again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this. It has to be one of the iconic movies of the 90s.
ChubbyChecker,"Apr 9, 2020",10/10,"I like to think that any Hollywood director who dedicated their life to making movies can look back at one film and think ""At least I made my mark"". Kubrick had 2001, Scorsese will have Goodfellas and Tarantino, well, he'll have Pulp Fiction.I watched this film on release, when all we really knew about Tarantino was Reservoir Dogs. It's hard for me to think what someone viewing it more than a quarter of a century later would make of it. Hopefully it can be viewed in context and see how revolutionary the film really was.One striking thing, which was quite novel at the time, is how the scenes aren't shown chronologically. What at first seems like a gimmick makes more and more sense as the film progresses and on repeat viewings. The impact of the storytelling would have been nowhere near as great if told in a more traditional way.If you're new to Tarantino then lucky you, you've got some great movies to watch. You won't go wrong by starting with Pulp Fiction."

adampnsh5,"Feb 16, 2011",9/10,"As with most Tarantino movies, each time you watch it it seems a bit different. Now, I don't't think that it's the best movie ever and I don't think that everybody has to like it, because it can easily be disliked. What I don't understand is this- Why does this film have such a bad reputation. Just think this over, please, all of you people who wail and complain about how horribly violent it is.How on earth are you so isolated as to think that this is the most violent movie out there? Have you not seen any movies since 1994? Because believe me, this movie could practically slide by with a PG-13 today (well not really) But honestly, if you don't like the move, then sure, fine, you don't like it, but why would you attack it's content when there are so many other movies that are MUCH more violent?"
xoxascott,"Nov 14, 2019",7/10,"The movie is a classic, without a doubt. Its very entertaining and features fantastic acting and writing.

cojosh,"Sep 9, 2006",1/10,"Wow, a lot of people have been fooled into believing that this was a great film. I've never seen anything like it, and I hope I never will again. This is one slop of a film, and I'm disgusted to know that it has so many high reviews. It was a confusing ball of goo that amounted to nothing. I didn't care for the characters and never will. What a hopeless bunch of freaks. I don't jump on the ""freak bandwagon"" unless they're natural ones, not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment. The glorification of smut is worse than the smut, and that is exactly what this movie is. The sad thing is, I don't believe that some of these actors were acting at all. They were just being themselves. Travolta and Jackson in wigs??? That was scary! The only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events. I like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same, but dislike everything in between. The problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews. It uses the ""peer pressure"" method. You know, ""this movie is for intelligent and cool people"" CRAP!! Well, I'll gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a ""shock flick"". It was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further. Unfortunately, it drags what little respect that Hollywood has with it. I'm afraid that this is one of the major stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films for vulgar lust.There's my two pennies, don't spend them all in one place!"
Michael_Elliott,"Aug 19, 2011",N/A,"Pulp Fiction (1994)**** (out of 4)Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough about the underside of the L.A. crime scene and focuses on stories involving a couple hit men (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson), a down and out boxer (Bruce Willis) and the big man's wife (Uma Thurman). Over the course of a matter of days their lives all get connected in this roller coaster ride of a movie. If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the ""real"" ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that ""Bad Motherf&*&er,"" which perfectly sums up his performance. Both Thurman and Willis do a great job with their roles and the supporting players are all extremely good as well. PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own. PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age."

Jakemcclake,"Aug 5, 2009",9/10,"SpoilersThis movie says that life sometimes sends a message from God so we should listen. This plot moves in and out of several related stories and the time-line jumbles around so that the way it is presented, it enables us to see the hand of God. We see justice served and spirituality wins out and the evil gets killed, and/or embarrassed and/or other nasty things.We start the movie in a restaurant and watch a husband and wife robbery team begin a robbery. There are two hit men in that restaurant. We move in and out of a story of the two hit men who work for a mobster named Marcel. We watch the hit men pull off a hit and get the money that the victim (played by Frank Whaley) owed the mobster Marcel. I got a real kick out of Whaley repeating ""What?"". The hit-man points his gun and says: ""Go ahead, say ""What"" again! I dare ya! I double dare ya! Then Whaley's character says ""What?"". BLAM! He is shot in the leg.We watch as one of the hit men Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta) takes Marcel's wife out on the town, per Marcel's orders. Vega fears his boss Marcel's jelousy. Additionally, Marcel's wife ODs. Then we watch a frantic rescue effort bring her back.We watch as a boxer (played Bruce Willis) is told and paid by Marcel to throw a fight. Instead this boxer pummels his opponent to death in the first round. Then he attempts to gettaway with the help of a lady cab driver, who was turned on by the killing.There are many more surprises in this movie and a reason why I called this ""Evil Blood and Guts Meet Up With Spiritual Redemption; and WHAT?"". Every minute of this movie should make you look at the screen with your eyes opening very wide and quote Frank Whaley's character ""What?""This is easily one of the best movies ever and many have tried to repeat it, but never come close."
braddugg,"Sep 19, 2014",10/10,"It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture.It's an important film and no doubt one of the most important ones to have come in the last 20 years. Not many films, threatened to change the rules of the game, as this film did. In terms of writing, it's non-linear, now non-linear in the real sense, it does not have a proper line of scenes or proper interpretation either, but they are connected by characters. This film has some iconic scenes which you will never forget. Like that, adrenalin shot scene to Mia (Uma Thurman) or reciting Bible's Eziekel 25:17 by Jules (Samuel Jackson).Though, it's nearly 2 and hours, its not long and seems short as they are many questions unanswered. So, is Vincent dead or not? What is there in that briefcase to Marseilles? And these are left unanswered. With just 7 scenes, you make a 2 and half hour movie that redefines in it's own way the perspective of the audience. So, I am amazed more than anything even as I watch it for nearly 10th time and the surprise keeps coming each time I see this. There is something that always works in PULP FICTION. But, what makes this film work is it's writing. It's writing like madness, there is no proper thing called this is it. It can be referred to anything and you may be right. The righteous man and the evil man interpretation is just a tiny example that can be taken out for how we can interpret a character.If I want to write one favourite scene here, it's gonna be the whole movie coz I like everything in it. Technically, I like the cinematography, sound design and costumes. But above all, I liked performances and dialogues.Thanks to Quentin who has given us more memorable movies in the last 20 years that are far superior in writing than anyone else. But for me, this is is my favourite Quentin film and I will stick with this till he out performs himself by writing something much more weird than this.A sure 5/5 for one of my favourite films, no less ever."
Sunny_Kumar,"May 5, 2019",10/10,"Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. . Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film."
SomaQuest,"Oct 9, 2018",9/10,"I saw this movie nine times in the theater when it came out; it resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genres.The second directorial effort from then fairly unknown Tarantino but it was a brilliant sophomore effort hitting the proper notes on all the main categories; directing, score, cinematography, acting / casting, plot, writing, etc. I cannot suggest this film to everyone; you need a certain sense of humor and a certain means of looking at a plot-line to truly enjoy it, but for those that have those prerequisites this is required viewing.This film in my top tier and one that can be watched at any time. An extremely well constructed piece of film-making that is worthy of a viewing."

I definitely don't think it's bad maybe it's just not my cup of tea. I walked away and took away a whole lot of nothing I'm sitting here trying to think of maybe what was the big thing that I'm supposed to leave the movie with like the message or even just what it wanted to say and to be honest idk it was just a lot of stuff. A lot cool stuff and stuff I enjoyed watching. I just don't get it. Maybe I'm supposed to rewatch it and I'll get it then but that in it of it self takes away some points for me cause I should at least have something the first time around something more to motivate me to watch it again then just confusion cause tbh as I said I just don't get it.Now I just read some stuff explaining what the movie was trying to do more. Tbh I think it's cool and all what it's trying to do sure but it's just so confusing and sure movies that make you think are cool but at least for me it's trying to make you think too much. Like I think it's cool and all but when I'm going to watch a movie I don't wanna have to leave needing to read some explainer articles like i don't wanna have to be a massive film buff to enjoy a movie I should be able to enjoy it whether I know a lot about movies or not."
Matchboy,"Sep 25, 2000",1/10,"This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent. This was a BOMB."
Li_85,"Jun 23, 2006",8/10,"Pulp Fiction is the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Reservior Dogs had released and was the talk of the town. Average movie that talks a lot and is set in mainly one place. Pulp Fiction is another movie that talks a lot, and doesn't do much else. It is a 2 in a half hour long movie and calls itself a action gangster movie. There is hardly any violence in this movie, its just talking talking and more talking. No where near comparable then Goodfellas, Scarface, Godfather or Casino. Only a few jokes like Bruce Willas and Ving Rhames in their worst nightmare. This is more of a comedy gangster related movie like Lock Stock and two smoking barrels. That was funny."
TxMike,"Nov 15, 2000",N/A,"Read the external reviews, like Ebert's or Barardinellis', if you want to know more about ""content"" of Pulp Fiction. Following is my personal take on the film.Many have praised this film for ""interweaving 3 different stories."" Ever watch the TV series ""Northern Exposure?"" Every episode consists of 3 different, interwoven stories, and done much better than Tarentino does here. What this film does well is poke fun at the gangster movies, and does it with very witty writing. I especially liked the way these sordid characters got into various ""philosophical discussions"", like why in France a quarter-pounder cannot be called that, because of the metric system. Or why Jackson's character would not eat pork, because it is a dirty animal.To really enjoy this film, you have to numb yourself to all the filthy language and the gratuitous violence. However, it is neither an innovative film nor one with lasting meaning. That is why I rate it 5 of 10, and only that high because of the clever screenplay and direction.That reflects my own preference in movies. I give my highest ratings to such films as ""Longitude"", ""Nixon"", ""Apollo Thirteen"", ""Amistad"" - films based on great true stories. Or just entertaining but inoffensive ones like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Matrix"". Or thought-provoking ones such as ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""American History X"", ""Lone Star"", or ""Good Will Hunting"".I give low ratings to such films as ""The Game"", ""The Usual Suspects"" - films which on the surface seem to dazzle, but in final analysis simply try to fool us into thinking they are something special. I don't think ""Pulp Fiction"" exactly does this, but its fans have given it high praise that I'd bet even its creator would hesitate to do."
digdog-785-717538,"Jun 24, 2011",10/10,"It took me next to twenty years to review this film appropriately; i should say, it took me the best part of ten years to realise that not everyone might see it my way. Under close scrutiny, the world of cinema goes this way, more or less: Kurosawa, a Japanese, and two italians, Fellini and Antonioni, subvert just about every rule that Hitchcock laid down; then nothing else happens for thirty years, with Hollywood slowly draining the life out of world cinema (see Transformers 2), until a guy called Quentin Tarantino released this second film, after the poor (or great, if you are a traditionalist) Reservoir Dogs, called Pulp Fiction. And it obliterates every rule that every filmmaker across the civilised world ever tried to establish.John Travolta takes flight to a role so high across the sky that no reviewer is ever going to be able to demolish it, no matter the angle. This is the role that will inspire humans for the next two hundred years; this is the Shakespeare of the modern world. The first director to utilise black actors effectively. The first example of 100% quality production after the dust and sweat of traditional Hollywood arenas.Pulp Fiction is a film of such incredible intricacy that it's unfathomable to anyone but a big-brain film school student, and even than, who knows. Do not feel ashamed if you miss its finer points. But for history, this is the one, the only, the film that takes over from Yojimbo, from 8 1/2, from La Nave Va, from Shichinin no Samurai, and more ... and just moves on forward. There is more film in twenty minutes of PF than there is in the whole of a typical Hollywood production of the 70's. So there are those films above this one. Space Oddissey. The Godfather. These are just targeted products. You will never find someone who has a coherent film critique of Pulp Fiction. Mastery in work, spark of genius, there is no way that this film can be any less than10/10 and the best film ever made."
Marc_Israel_365,"May 27, 2012",9/10,"The first gangster film to make inane yet paralyzing dialog the star of the movie. Brilliant and engaging, endlessly quotable and visually alluring, PF made all the top lists, regenerated John Travolta, solidified Bruce Willis, centered Samuel L. Jackson as a leading man and cemented Christopher Walken among creepiest of cameos ever. The side characters are more accessible and reminiscent as friends of ours then they are as plot worthy points of interest. They discuss everyday trivial matters intensely while the viewer is wondering about the ramifications of the events just watched or know is around the corner.... and we actually see very little violence play out! Tarantino's use of the chopped up time line only added to the Pulp mystique as well as it's charm. Imbecile gangsters charming? Regressive American social interaction cinema worthy? When combined , it remains a perfect storm for Quintin & company."
mlk960,"Nov 3, 2013",10/10,"Sorry to degrade from the structure of how things go, but this is a hybrid between a review and a defense of the film.As far the movie itself, I could be locked in a room for a few weeks with it. It's what movies where made for. It is entertainment- sure and simple. I'm not gonna dive really into what the movie tries to do, because I see that more as a viewer's perspective. I can say, however, that whatever it it tries to do it does well. The acting, the dialogue, and everything else about it is gripping. The most overarching thing about it to me, though, is the absurdity. The absurdity is concocted at just the right angle so as to create a strange world, but one we can dwell our minds in. Reality itself is absurd in itself, is it not? This is what particularly draws me into this movie, and makes me like it so much.This is also the reason I think a lot of people hate it. The main insults toward the film regard it's ""lack of plot,"" ""lack of core,"" and ""lack of meaning, or anything at all."" Did I miss some section of the Geneva Convention that mandated how a movie had to be made? Yeah, typically a more linear and mountain shaped plot/ story line give that feeling of satisfaction at the end, but leave that to other movies. There are plenty to spare.People accuse it of being hollow as far as spirituality and meaning go. I find this kind of funny and ironic because I think that is exactly how it emphasizes these two subjects. The interactions and experiences of the characters in this absurd reality are what make it so real. We really don't have lives much different from Vincent and Jules. We're all figuring it out as we go, , under pressure of constantly changing circumstances, making decisions for ourselves in a place where we don't have much direction.If you can't find in this movie what others do, I guess you just aren't catching with them. It's really a matter of choice. These are all things that make Kurt Vonnegut novels what they are. Lack of tangency with seemingly pointless digressions. But that is what makes them brilliant. They place a film on life to view it with a new perspective. It's up to you how much value and entertainment there is in something like that."
robsta23,"Nov 23, 2015",10/10,"This film may play with its use of chronology, and it may be episodic, but people generally claim this movie to be great because it is the first to do so. It is certainly not the first film to do either of these things. It is inspired by many films before it, such as Rashomon - which tells the same story from four different perspectives - as well as ""My Life to Live,"" a neorealist film which is told in twelve distinct episodes. However, Pulp Fiction was the first film to play with chronology in this manner in many years, and it is because it does so with great purpose which helps to make it my favorite movie (among various other reasons).Some complain about this fiddling with chronology to cause confusion, yet the story only goes out of the linear time line in two spots in the film, and I always found it easy to follow. As for the BIG episodes in the film (the ones Tarantino actually gave titles to) the first two are played in chronological order, and the third episode shown jumps back to a spot before the other two stories. I will not got too in depth with my next comment as it would give too much away if I did, but Tarantino's choice to show Butch Coolidge's story (Bruce Willis) before Jules' story (Samuel L Jackson) has a huge impact on the way the audience views Vincent Vega (John Travolta) by the end of the film. It is this fact combined with the way Jules' story ends that left me mind-blown when I watched this film for the first time.I understand that in the context of 1994 when this film was released that it was an extremely violent film. If you're still going to complain about the violence in this film today, I would laugh and tell you there is no way you could handle more contemporary films like Mongol, 300, or Gone Girl. Hell, I hope you can make it through Django Unchained, Tarantino's most recent and by far his most violent film to date. What people forget to say about the violence in Pulp Fiction is that most of it actually happens off screen, leaving the violence up to the audience's imagination (maybe this is why people remember it to be more violent than it actually is).What I realized and loved about this film after watching it for a few times is that the three stories of this film all have a common connection - they deal with loyalty to a father figure, each one more intimate than the last. We have Vincent Vega struggling to be loyal to Marsellus Wallace (the crime boss), we have Butch Coolidge honoring his father, and we have Jules Winnfield rethinking his relationship with God.Other than the chronology of the film, what is easily the most notable thing about Pulp Fiction is the dialogue. Tarantino has arguably written better scenes after this film (in fact, I agree with his choice of the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds as his favorite thing he has written), but this is the movie by Tarantino that EVERYBODY quotes, especially the famous scene when Jules dominates the conversation about breakfast and what Marsellus Wallace looks like (trust me, even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably heard a friend quoting this scene). Tarantino is a master of dialogue - he writes conversations that people might actually have with each other. The topics may seem random, but that's how real-world conversations work. You discuss events, make analogies, disagree and argue - you don't simply talk about what is going to happen or what has happened, which is unfortunately how a lot of dialogue in film goes. Tarantino always creates distinct and well-developed characters through his use of dialogue.This movie is a roller coaster of an experience, and it gets my highest rating.4.0/4.0"
steve-easton,"Jul 9, 2003",10/10,"This is as near to flawless as any movie I've ever seen. Everything is excellent, but it's the script that elevates this movie to masterpiece status. No other movie is as quotable as this.If you haven't seen this movie do yourself a favour and do so - today!"
Swolzee,"Jul 28, 2021",6/10,"Certainly worth a watch, but this movie didn't reinvent the wheel like a lot of fans would have you believe. Like most Tarantino films it's self indulgent to the point that it divides viewers into camps of those who think it's genius, and those who remembered they had some paint drying somewhere they needed to check on.Oddly enough I fall into the camp that's somewhere in-between with this title."
IcyRoses,"Dec 25, 2009",1/10,"Pulp Fiction is often considered the coolest and greatest film of all time. But, the people who usually say this are pretentious film snobs and people who think this is something extraordinary. Excuse me, it isn't.First of all the film has NO plot. If a film has no plot, then why should we care about the unlikeable characters? Second, the diagloue is so....BAD. Does the director think people actually talk like this, because, well they don't.Third, the grossly, glamorous violence, is disgusting. This isn't a horror film, so why do we need such violence popping in and out of the movie? So, I urge everyone to avoid the hype of this pretentious, terrible mess."
thomasroffe,"Dec 6, 2014",10/10,"Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film directed by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Quentin Tarantino. It won an Oscar for best dialogue and was beaten for best picture by Forrest Gump.Pulp Fiction tells the story of two mob hit men played by John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson, a mob boss played by Ving Rhames, the mob boss's wife played by Uma Thurman and a boxer played by Bruce Willis. Every single actor/actress in this film plays the role brilliantly especially Samuel L Jackson.The part which makes this film so good is its dialogue. About 90% of this film is just people sitting around talking, but the dialogue is so well written and interesting, you could sit and watch them for hours. This film deserved its Oscar by miles. All those who go into this film expecting lots of shoot outs and explosions, are not going to be impressed due to its long, dialogue heavy scenes.It has no philosophical messages or parts where you need to ""read between the lines"", if you want a film like that, then I suggest you go and watch something directed by Stanley Kubrick. It's a straight up entertaining film which you don't even need to watch all the way through once you've watched it a few times.This film will go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion, it is the greatest film of all time along with Schindlers List."
ryanflynn,"Nov 11, 2013",10/10,"I am not much for writing reviews, so this will be brief, as well as the polar opposite of profound. I saw this movie when I was 17 and it changed my life. Up to that point, movies I watched were one dimensional action flicks with cliché characters and predictable plots. Pulp Fiction made me laugh, cringe, yell out loud, cover my eyes and get nauseated. It was the first movie that I saw that I couldn't stop thinking about for days after. I watched it again and again, picking up new details, and connecting the dots. This film opened my eyes up to a whole different genre of movies and a whole new appreciation for storytelling. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen, and in some ways, still is. It is full of memorable characters, scenes and quotes. Simply awesome."
cathaven,"May 17, 2002",10/10,"I approached this film with some trepidation. You see I am one of the seemingly very few people who really hated Reservoir Dogs. I found that movie to be extremely tedious. This however deserves all the plaudits it has received. Breakneck pacing & some of the funniest one-liners in movie history left me gasping for breath by the time it was over. Characters in a total panic as things go more & more wrong is a staple of film & TV comedy, but when overdone it can be really irritating. It's a tribute to both the actors & the director that this movie is never that."
schroeder-gustavo,"Dec 9, 2015",10/10,"Pulp Fiction made Quentin Tarantino who he is today. He showed us what he was capable of with Reservoir Dogs, but with Pulp Fiction, he made his mark in cinema and it will stay there forever. I love Pulp Fiction, I love it so much. It's just one of those movies I could watch on repeat for the rest of my life and I wouldn't mind it. But what makes it so great? It's basically just a bunch of people talking, the entire movie. But it so well scripted and directed, the Pulp Fiction script is perhaps the best script ever written. Royale with Cheese? Hell yeah! Everyone in film school should read the script to this masterpiece. Needless to say, all the actors in the film have reached iconic status and deliver great performances. Pulp Fiction is one of the most iconic movies of all time. What makes it so great for me is the fact that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of random stuff that happens and it has a great script, that's it. But to make a movie about nothing and make it one of the greatest, most entertaining films of all time, is an achievement. Thank you, Quentin Tarantino. Thank you.Written and directed by Tarantino, it's considered by many to be one of the most influential and best movies of all time. In my opinion, it is the best written film of all time. Pulp Fiction is a film driven almost completely by its dialogue: It's two and a half hours of mostly people talking and one would think that's a negative but the dialogue is extremely clever and engaging. The performances are brilliant as it features a pitch perfect cast. The directing choices are awesome, the cinematography is perfect for what it needs to be and you can't talk about Pulp Fiction without mentioning the soundtrack. Possibly the greatest soundtrack in a movie ever. The dialogue is so good it features so much quotable dialogue.I'm a big fan of structure in most movies but the beautiful thing about Pulp Fiction is that it's not really about anything. It's just a bunch of stories mixed together to create an entertaining film about gangsters, dancing the twist and foot massages. There is only one scene in Pulp Fiction I dislike, because I really feel it does not advance the plot and it feels like it slows the movie down for me and that is when Butch and his girlfriend are in the hotel room at night. The scene lasts like 5 minutes only at it feels like it could have been trimmed to two. However, this is really a minor detail. Pulp Fiction is one of the most entertaining movies ever made and it is an essential viewing for any film lover in general.9.7/10"
mikayakatnt,"Feb 20, 2020",10/10,This film is amazing. Hands down. There is a reason why Pulp Fiction posters remains a constant staple in college dorm rooms.5/5. Quentin Tarantino's finest work. Damn quotable too.
m-meehan-28239,"May 13, 2016",10/10,Every Terintino film I've ever seen has been awesome. This is no exception. The movie is so good and just interesting he has like four stories and ends up connecting every single one. The movie is super intense at parts and then really funny at others. The part where Sam L. Jackson takes that guys big kahuna burger and is questioning him is so tense since you know he isn't making it out alive. Also one my hands down favorite parts in a movie ever is when John Travolta's gun goes off in the car and he's just like ah man I just shot Marvin in the face like it was just a little slip up. The guys head exploded h=in his car! Anyway incredible movie definitely watch.Also if you didn't know there is a theory that was confirmed by Terintino That all his films are connected.
Dannov747,"Jun 22, 2022",7/10,"I can certainly respect this movie. As a form of art it is fantastically unique and masterfully eclectic. It is the epitome of a postmodern film - with no conventional story structure, no central conflict, no clear moral, achronological 'storytelling', and so on. It definitely needs to be appreciated for its incredible style.But as with most postmodernist art, tossing aside everything that makes traditional art good sure stands out as bold and unique, but it comes with its negatives. And unlike most reviewers I don't think being 'unique' is a sufficient substitute for being devoid of the traditional things that make a film good.For instance, this movie does not have great pacing. Partially a result of the lack of (conventional) plot development and story structure, but also partially a result of the often (deliberately) mundane dialogue. I realize postmodern art can often be very self-referential, but I personally can't see why a lot of this dialogue had to exist. It doesnt immerse you, it doesnt engage you, or advance the plot... its usually not even funny. So whats the point?But what is the point in general? Pulp fiction meanders around without really giving any core messages. Perhaps right at the end in the epilogue scene, it says something meaningful and ties at least some of the themes together quite well. And masterful as Tarantino is, the scene is just ambiguous enough to keep people talking about what exactly it means.So yes, this is a great movie to analyze and critique, but its missing too many ingredients that make a story great to experience."
mtthwibrahim,"Jul 28, 2012",1/10,"As a 13 year old just getting into cinema, this was the best film ever. How could I not be blown away by all the clever dialog, great characters, fantastic storyline, and gripping violence. It was just pure heaven. I saw this movie three times in the course of one year, and I still have such fond memories of watching it. It was around the time I got serious about cinema (about two years later) that I felt I needed to give this another go. I'd discovered the works of Bergman, Tarkovsky, Godard,etc, and felt a connection with film in ways I hadn't before, and I wanted to see if the movies I loved before still held up. I had every intention of loving ""Pulp Fiction"" just as much as I did back then, but I didn't. There was nothing there, no core. All the things I'd loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that can't decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence? It's violence that's harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe, safe enough as to not offend.It's a dead film with no ideas. A common argument I hear in it's favor is that it's somehow objectively entertaining. Why? Because it has guys with guns and monologues about McDonalds? Sorry, but that's not entertainment in my mind. Entertainment is being engaged, having to think. A film like ""Andrei Rublev"" is entertaining because, while I watch it, it evokes thought and feeling, it has something I can sink my teeth into. I can still think about it, interpret it in different ways. ""Pulp Fiction"" is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a God complex strokes his ego.Basically, I can understand to some extent why it is so popular. It's very good at pleasing the masses, something Tarkovsky could never do. It's so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in. But it's paper thin. This is exactly what I don't want in cinema"
UniqueParticle,"Sep 1, 2019",10/10,"Always a phenomenal experience especially the music and extremely well done acting! On par with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Kill Bill - Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies ever made! The scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta are so damn good plus the suspense bits give me goosebumps in the best way possible. The few parts with comedy are superbly marvelous, I'd love to be a famous writer one day even if its not as genius as Quentin Tarantino - He's top notch."
ivony,"May 26, 2003",10/10,"There is just so much to say about this movie that I don't know where to start!I had no idea what I was ""in for"" when I went to see this movie.  I really hadn't seen the previews for it, and had read nothing about it at all. Usually, this is the best way for me to go into a movie...otherwise I have too many expectations.  Well, even if I *had* known something about Pulp, I don't think I would have expected what I got.  Not that I'm complaining.Pulp Fiction takes you on a roller coaster ride wherever Tarantino feels like taking you.  And what a thrilling ride it is!  From the opening scene we're left scratching our heads wondering exactly where Quentin is going to lead us on this one.  Is it another Natural Born Killers?  Another Reservoir Dogs?  Although there are nods to his other films, as well as several others, Pulp Fiction stands on its own.  From shocking to downright hysterical...this movie has it all.Samuel Jackson is incredible (although I'm quite partial to him anyway) as the Bible quoting Jules.  John Travolta is tremendous as Vincent and is purely delightful to watch as the story unfolds.  The cast could not have been more perfect and Tarantino brings the best out in each and every one of the actors and actresses.Is there excessive use of the ""f word""?  Well, sure.  But c'mon!  We're talking about ""gangsters"" here (not to mention the 20th century)...for reality sake the ""f word"" really has become a part of everyday language for many people.  Aside from that, it *is* a Tarantino film and, well, he's not exactly known for being a prude.Glorifying violence and drug use...   Oh boy, don't even get me started. The LAST impression I got from this movie was some sort of message stating: ""it's ok to do drugs and kill people"".  Ummm, no.  Ok ok, so there may be teenagers who see this, you say.  Well then here we go on the ""it's the movies fault that there are problems..."" tangent.  I'm not even going into that one.  Bottom line regarding the drug use and violence:  if you are *that* impressionable, you probably shouldn't be watching anything beyond a G-rated Disney movie...and even that is questionable.All in all, Pulp Fiction was a fantastic film.  With its fabulous acting, perfectly cast crew, and hilarious moments, Pulp is one thrill after another.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to see it for what it is and can focus on the movie...not the bits and pieces taken waaaay out of context.  10 out of 10 stars."
usedtobeamovieguy,"Jan 4, 2012",10/10,"So I've been a fan of Pulp Fiction since I was in High School. I watched the movie last night for the first time in awhile and was struck by never really knowing what was in the brief case, so I watched the scene in great detail. I noticed the apartment number was #416. So thinking this is probable related to a bible verse I looked up one starting with Matthew 4:16. I don't read the bible often if ever but since the Movie has the lighting up brief case locked at 666, and Jules set for a path of salvation on seriously changing his ways from a gangster to walking the earth in the path of the Shepard I thought to look it up. So Matthew 4:16 reads ""the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."" I think this relates to the brief case, the people who had it, to Vincent which stayed in the land of the dark and ended up dead, and to Jules which turned to ""the path of the Shepard"" as he says. A great light was shone to Jules (which was currently living in the land of the dark) after the bullets whizzed by him and a light dawned as it did for all the others in the room which where also all living in the land of the shadow of death. Just a theory but better than anything else I've looked through yet."
rodnie,"Jul 11, 2002",10/10,"This is independent film-making at its finest, with the best ensemble cast to have possibly ever graced the silver screen.  Tarantino will never equal this.

cosmogirl_185,"Jul 5, 2009",10/10,"I've seen Pulp Fiction many times and i love it more and more every time i watch it. The content of the film is truly unique for its time. The plot has dimension which makes you notice something new every time. Characters are wonderfully developed and are believable. There's plenty of drama, a good amount of action, and a few laughs that lighten the mood of the film. the script is well written, dialog among the actors is amazingly natural and realistic. the story is not hard to follow unlike some films similar to this one, and offers an interesting presentation considering scenes are not in the standard chronological order. I would recommend this movie to anyone viewing this page unless drug use and violence offends you. Pulp fiction is a must see for action movie lovers, and great movie to enjoy on an evening in."
cinemastupid,"Jan 15, 2012",10/10,"There is a world of many, many motion pictures, from Roundhay Garden Scene in 1888, to the films of Charlie Chaplin, Ingmar Bergman, to the Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind, and Casablanca. There is Titanic and Terminator, there is Night of the Living Dead and Gigli. There is The Godfather and Space Jam. In a world of several hundreds of thousands of movies, the most familiar and yet still original is Pulp Fiction.Perhaps life long cinephilia breeds a great filmmaker? Perhaps ""veteran"" actors are better than more contemporary actors? Perhaps dialog can be one of the most memorable parts of a film? While only a handful of films top Pulp Fiction in terms of quality, and craft, at 154 minutes, it remains cool, cocky, and deeper than what is led on during the first viewing.Not telling you about the plot is probably best for those unfamiliar with it. To call it a film with out a message is incredibly arrogant. Reading between fairly thick lines is a story about human redemption and choices. No mainstream movie maker has attempted what Tarantino does here.The characters are interesting, along with the acting in terms of greatness, and deep, along with the dialog, cinematography, storyline, and direction. Compared to Tarantino's Jackie Brown, it is very in your face, in a good way. You'll actually get to appreciate movies more after you see Pulp Fiction.The violence presented in minimalist, and very tastefully done. But best of all, it is, well, cool. It leaves me feeling shaken, like a powerful wave comes over me.Don't go in with any expectations however, experience it pure. Then you realize how fantastic it truly is. My hat's off to you, Quentin Tarantino, and if you haven't seen this movie already, see it. Twice."
chervenkov,"Jul 13, 2021",7/10,"Quick disclaimer, I am 24 and have generally not seen tons of 90's movies. I read somewhere that this film is a landmark of modern cinema and has influenced many other gangster flicks after it. That certainly makes sense, has a unusual plot line(if you can call it that) for it's time, has grotesque violence and obviously not taking itself too seriously.Moreover, no subject matter, to me it felt the scenes were purposely constructed to give off artsy notion and not develop the story. It seemed like ''art made for the sake of making art'' which is pretentious in my eyes, however many people obviously find it riveting.There is this sequence of scenes which is so completely out of left field that will most likely make you feel emotionally disturbed (don't want to spoil it). Again, it is completely random, however made me chuckle. You can't help but admire Tarantino's audacity to put the most shocking things in front of the eyes of millions. Did not like him as an actor though, the incoherent digressions were a bit too much at a certain point.If you are expecting something meaningful, skip this one. It definetely leaves you with sense of emptiness when over. The thought ""What on earth did I just watch'' was swirling in my head for some time after. Don't think I would consider rewatching it."
B RUBBLE,"Jul 8, 1999",1/10,This movie is one of the few that I nearly walked out on it was so bad.  It was too disjointed and I could not understand the point or plot.  People were killed in one scene and then popped up in another.  Lots of gratuitous violence and brutality that did not seem to have much to do with the plot.
Piko13,"May 17, 2003",10/10,"Pulp Fiction is a real boom in action movies,unique style of Quentin Tarantino made this movie what it really is-a legend!Of course let´s not forget the great business that the actors did.Even now,after  9 years I like to watch it.It´s a first class movie for sure!"
akhilkottaram,"Dec 13, 2015",N/A,"The movie pulp fiction is the best movie i have watched till now in my whole life.It it an all rounder as it includes extreme drug use,mild sexual content,mild humour & intense violence. I say that most of 18+ teens would certainly like.The movie, which was a surprise Grand Prize-winner at the last Cannes Film Festival, is shockingly violent, provocatively obscene and profane. It won't just offend some audiences; it will offend the living hell out of them. Tarantino intends to rile people up.After the boxer story plays out, we slide back in time to the previous day, when we learn why the hit men showed up in strange college-guy clothes. It's because after the first hit, they took one of their spies home with them. While gesturing dramatically with a gun, Travolta learns why the first rule of gun safety is never point a gun at something you are not willing to destroy. The gun, as guns do, goes bang; the young man, as young men do when hit by bullets, goes ker-blooie. Thus follows a bizarre adventure in post-shooting hygiene, in which the two hit men, a suburban buddy (played by Tarantino himself) and an elegantly mysterious fixer (Harvey Keitel) deal with the problem of scrambled brains all over the upholstery."
charlie_cheswick,"Aug 27, 2006",10/10,"After being in the Sundance Film Festival with the violent and brutal film ""Reservoir Dogs"", Tarantino came back with one true awesome movie that had everything to be perfect. Pulp Fiction, considered to be one of the best movies ever made. In this violent movie there was very good acting, superb screenplay, great photography and of course, GREAT music. Everything a movie could ever need. Pulp Fiction won the Golden Palm at Cannes and the best original screenplay at the Academy Awards. For me, it has been the best movie ever made followed by Amores Perros. A film with very deep and strong content. Pulp Fiction is all about two hit men, their boss's pretty wife and a boxer. They get crossed while the movie advances, and the pieces of the puzzle begin to get together."
the_mad_mckenna,"Aug 18, 2002",10/10,"I first saw Pulp Fiction on a bootlegged copy on VHS while it was still in theatres, which was funny due to the fact it still had the segment where Mia Wallace ""interviews"" Vincent before their date on a video camera. How surprised I was to see it in a theatre and see the scene missing. Quentin tacked it onto ""collector's edition"" VHS copies later on.The reason I watched it on video first was that I was sure I'd hate it; instead, it's unique, funny, touching, profane, cringy (hello, zed!) and flat out a great ride all the way. This movie is Also Bruce Willis' BEST performance by far. Most people talk about Travolta who is wonderful, but Willis pulling off a truly sympathetic and likable character is amazing. Sam Jackson also pulls off a career best performance - not everyone could deliver those lines from the Bible and make them sound as menacing and convincing."

Vicent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L.

chris65203,"Oct 18, 2002",10/10,"OK, first of all we all know that ""Pulp Fiction"" barrows heavily from other films (check out IMDB's movie connections link), but what really is the legacy of great films (""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", ""The Godfather"", etc.) is the way it influences all of its movie descendents.  With movies ranging from ""The Usual Suspects"", to ""The Matrix"", to ""Boogie Nights"", to ""Dogma"" it is very evident that such an impact has occurred.  When it comes to people, we say they will ""live forever"", in my mind this movie will be the same.10/10"
monsterluv69,"Aug 13, 2002",10/10,"I love the screenplay of this film.  Some people say that All About Eve is the greatest screenplay ever, I beg to differ.  Q takes us on a roller coaster ride with his words.  After the film has ended you'll find your self going back, just to try and memorize the amazing one liners.  His characters are extremely likable despite there flaws, and there are some moments in the film that will stay with you forever!A testament to great writing and other movies had tried to copy the style of Q's film..........some have succeeded, but most have failed because there is only one PULP!"
kyle_c,"Sep 2, 2002",10/10,"Interweaving three stories about small time gangsters, ""Pulp Fiction"" proved to be one of the most interesting, original, and entertaining films of the last fifteen years.  Using Tarantino's characteristic dialogue, in which the characters speak about everyday things rather than just the plot, the movie creates a light atmosphere, counterpointed by moments of extreme violence and intensity.  An infusion of many classic genres, such as noir, it manages to put a new spin on many old cliches.  A must see for any  appreciator of cinema."
bhcpc,"Feb 19, 2003",6/10,"It has action, humor, tension and plenty of drama. In addition, lots of cool, off-beat dialogue. Unfortunately, the almost non-stop foul language takes away some of the power and enjoyment. One great thing about this type of movie is the intentionally unintentional humor out of genuinely bizarre situation. Some may find the scene of Jimmie in the kitchen hilarious, but I feel it's ruined by the over-acting of Tarantino and the expletive-filled rant which sounded forced and fabricated, losing the edge of unintentional humor and genuinely bizarre situation. Luckily, the scene of Jules in the diner with Ringo and Yolanda had very little foul language, but it's the most powerful scene. There are other places where few or no expletive could make the humor and/or drama just as gripping if not more so. Overall, a 7 out of 10."
garykbell,"Dec 3, 2005",1/10,"I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do."
vaibhavatyagi,"Nov 18, 2017",N/A,"**I really don't understand why this movie got 9 Rating on IMDb.**I think this can be put in the list of worst movies ever made. **No plot, no sense. what was that ? **i""m still thinking.

Lars-mustaine,"Oct 8, 2002",10/10,"This is without a doubt, one of the finest movies ever made. It has an oscar winning script, great characters and some career performances from Jackson, Willis, Travolta and Thurman.This movie is so clever and well thought out. Some people find it confusing. Rubbish!. The structure of this film is one of the things which makes it so good and original. when put in chronological order, the story makes complete sense, the stucture is not a gimmick.The cast of this film is truly excellent. Travolta got nominated for best actor at the Oscars but lost out to Tom Hamks (who was truly deserving as forest gump but, IMO, not as much as Travolta was as Vincent). The character of Vincent is a scumbag but Travolta's performance makes him lovable and funny and likable. Sam Jackson also puts in a stunning performance (The scene in the diner is truly stunning acting).I could talk this film up all day but i wont. Just go see it and you'll see for yourself how films should be made."
Boba_Fett1138,"May 31, 2004",10/10,"Quentin Tarantino had done it again. If you thought he would just be an one day fly after ""Reservoir Dogs"", you couldn't be more wrong.Once again just like in ""Reservoir Dogs"" the storytelling is unique. The movie has several different story lines that are all in some way connected and to make the story even more complicated, they are not told in the right order. It sound like the story is hard to follow, how ever this is not the case. The story is easy to follow, so everybody should be able to see the brilliance of it.The movie is filled with sex, drugs, violence and bad language. All of this combined makes the movie one of the most kick butt movies.All of the stories are great and wonderfully written. It's amazing to see how they are connected. The stories are not typically Hollywood like, meaning that they are not predictable and don't follow the Hollywood movie rules. What makes the stories even more great are the dialogues. The movie is filled with the famous trademark Tarantino dialogues and is a true pleasure to listen to, they are very raw and realistic, just like the characters. Brilliant dialogue!There are countless classic scene's and some of them are up there with the most classic out of movie history.The movie is filled with some great music that sets the movies mood.There is a big all star cast with actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Phil LaMarr, Frank Whaley, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel and Christopher Walken. Having such a cast is already a signal that this is more than just an ordinary movieA must see unique movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
Tommydevito,"Nov 3, 2002",10/10,"While I don't think its better than Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction certainly comes close. PF is definitley one of the 5 best movies of the 1990s and established Tarantino as an accomplished filmmaker. Everyone knows the screenplay, acting, and direction are top notch, so I won't get into that. Bottom Line: Classic film that everyone should see. 10/10"
Tom_Salmon,"Apr 20, 2006",10/10,"Before I write about this movie, I'd just like to say that this would probably be my favourite movie of all time. The dialogue is witty and the acting cool and slick.Pulp Fiction is a brilliant story split into three tales about different groups of people and how they're lives become intertwined. The events though, do not appear in chronological order. This makes the movie much more interesting. Tarantino arranges his first scene to merge with his final one in a remarkable way. Those confused by the structure will see everything clearly once the final line is spoken. The first of the three stories starts off with Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). They are making a hit for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). On their way to this hit Vincent tells Jules that about his upcoming job for Marsellus and how uneasy he feels about it. His job is to take his wife, Mia, out and show her a good time (nothing sus). This story goes on to show us the time had between Mia and Vincent. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and a finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."" This is Jules' (Samuel L. Jackson) version of Ezekiel 25:17. And it is this that he recites before he kills. But the rest of the story is about Mia and Vincent and their time together. The Second story, ""The Gold Watch"", is about a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis). It starts off with the story of his gold watch that his dad gave to him. All of the trouble that he went through to giver him his watch. After this reminisces, it comes to the present where Marsellus is paying Butch to throw the upcoming fight. I wont list the events that happen in this part of the movie, as I don't want to spoil anything. The third and final story, ""The Bonnie Situation"", clears up a few things. This chapter ties up the start of the movie and tells us how it got to the point in the cafe. It also introduces Jim (Quentin Tarantino. Vincent and Jules take a dead body to his place in order to clean up the car and so forth. This is where the Wolf is called in. (Harvey Keitel). This last scene is a great example of closure and how the characters lead up to the events already shown in the movie (hope that made sense).An excellent movie. Again, the dialogue was witty and everything in it had that feel that come when watching a Tarantino movie. 10/10. Fantastic. Will be next to impossible to beat"
susbruno,"Nov 25, 2020",10/10,Tarantino's story telling and dialog are legendary in this masterpiece.
lazhuward,"Nov 10, 2002",8/10,"When Pulp Fiction first came out, I thought it was the greatest movie ever made and was sure that it would become a classic. Earlier today though, I saw it again after not viewing it for several years and my opinion of it is now a bit lower.It's still a good movie and there are aspects of it that are certainly great. The plot is well constructed and the story lines are compelling. There are a variety of interesting characters and many humorous and dramatic scenes. Several actors (who were at their peak at the time) have juicy roles and give excellent performances: Uma Thurman, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, and Christopher Walken. Overall, the movie is unbelievably entertaining.After seeing Pulp Fiction again though, with several more years of movie viewing experience now under my belt, parts of it look amateurish. The shots don't always work; composition is bad, stuff is out of focus, lighting is bad. Although the banal conversations are fantastic, the dialogue doesn't work all the time either, particularly for Samuel L. Jackson's character. When I listened to him, I couldn't help but think that this is how a white dude thinks a black gangster should talk. There are also a ton of obvious continuity and factual errors in the film that are distracting (check the ""Goofs for Pulp Fiction"" page here at IMDB for an incomplete listing of them). In most movies, I don't notice these kinds of errors because they're so subtle, but in Pulp Fiction they're glaring.Pulp Fiction is still cool and enjoyable, but it seems like I can look at it in a more critical light now. It's been almost ten years since it was made and the hype is finally starting to die down. It's a good (maybe great) film, but it's not a classic or a masterpiece."
blainephillips,"Jul 30, 2016",10/10,"Pulp Fiction has a little bit of everything in it. There's brilliant action scenes with John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson. There's romance with Bruce Willis and his significant other. There's crime in the opening and closing scenes with Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer. John Travulta and Samuel L Jackson are hilarious throughout the flick. On top of all this, the way the four stories intertwine in conclusion create a wonderfully thought out and executed film that I could just watch over and over again. I wish there was more movies like this. Perfect cast, perfect acting, brilliant dialogue, interesting story line. This is the movie that all other movies should be judged off of. ""It was a good movie, but not Pulp Fiction good."""
maawan,"Mar 17, 2005",6/10,"Well I had heard a lot about this movie earlier but after seeing it I can only say that it is a below average movie. I mean the only thing I enjoyed was some dialogs (although most of them were out of context)and nice editing job.But the story ,if there was one was plain boring .Acting was OK except Samuel who was great. I am very much surprised because it was nominated for 7 Oscars and got ""Best Screenplay"" award which was a big joke. Also Bruce Willis part was half baked and had very little significance for the story.So overall this movie which is a ""so called classic"" disappoints because bits of comedy like the Bonnie situation are not enough to make a movie classic."
Goon-2,"Oct 29, 1999",1/10,"That was to lower it's stupid ridiculously high average, but to put it quite simply, I hated this movie. I didn't expect to like it, I was only watching it for Frank Whaley, but I hated this movie, really hated with it with it's various plot holes that do not make sense(watch ""Short Cuts"" if you want to see a decent movies about the interrelating lives of people), obnoxious, unsympathetic characters(I wanted to cheer when John Travolta died, or did he die? I had no idea since the film epitomized non-sense making. Someone died, and I didn't like any of the characters, with the exception of Whaley's, so I would still have wanted to cheer), bad writing, with obvious attempts at being ""cool"" and trying to have ""catch phrases,"" etc etc etc! I found nothing good about this film in the least. So why did critics? I hate when violent, immoral films are regarded as ""daring"" ""good"" film making. This one sure wasn't, and nominating John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson for acting awards?! The first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act, but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious. This one is up there with ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Do the Right Thing"" for my least favorite ""good"" movie."
DomNickson843,"Feb 1, 2015",N/A,"OK first of all I saw this a little while ago and I don't see how anybody could like this film except for the stars: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Peter Greene, Bruce Willis, and Ving Rhames. The plot is all messed around and unorganized making it very difficult to understand. The Characters are all technically bad guys. Like I said the only good thing this film has to offer is the acting. Overall the film makes very little sense the way it is told, the characters are all unlikable. I really believe that if any film should get rated way lower than a 0 out of ten, this is it! I mean just how it got as high as an 8.9 out of 10 is beyond me. I'd continue on ranting about how bad the story is written but this film just isn't worth anymore time. Please if you're wanting to see a great crime film go watch Goodfellas(1990) and if you want to go see a good action film go watch the Hunted(2003). This film rated from me is only a 1 out of 10 since it did have many famous and good actors but Mars Attacks is way better and that was a comedy film!!!"
bowmanblue,"Aug 20, 2019",10/10,"It may sound odd finally getting round to 'reviewing' 1994's 'Pulp Fiction' as there's really little that can be added to everything that's been said about it over the years. Yes, it's a true masterpiece which has - and will always, I would imagine - stand the test of time. But is it for everyone?It's Quentin Tarantino's second film as writer/director and, even with all the greats he's turned out since, most people will say that it's probably his best (and I'd agree). However, if there's actually someone out there who hasn't seen it and doesn't even know anything about it, how would you describe its story? I guess you could call it a 'gangster' film with various stories which span different characters which are skillfully (if loosely!) woven together. It's also filmed out of 'chronological' order, meaning that a character may die halfway through, only to return later on in the film simply because the end of the film is technically set before the mid-way point. Confused? Stick with it. It's worth it.If you check out the main poster associated with 'Pulp Fiction' you'll see the - now iconic - image of Uma Thurman's character to sell it. Even though she is indeed a 'central' character to the plot, you'll notice a whole load of famous names in the small print, including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and - of course - Samuel L Jackson (in what was totally his 'breakout' role). This is definitely an 'ensemble' cast and, due to the multiple story threads, not all these names will be on screen for as long as you might like them to be. However, that doesn't mean that anyone turns in a bad performance.'Pulp Fiction' has made it's mark on not only the Box Office and takings, but also on popular culture. It's either quoted or lampooned to this day and most people will 'get' any references made to everything from the numerous quotable lines to the crazy outlandish settings the characters find themselves in.Due to the extreme circumstances involving very 'adult' themes, this film is not for children. And it's all the better for it. This is because it will - hopefully - limit those who just don't 'get' it. For all its greatness, it's not an easy watch. You can't just have it on in the background while you idly check your Instagram account on your phone. You really need to invest your time into your viewing to get the most out of it. Because of that it's not for idle viewers. It's made to be watched properly (and then debated afterwards, no doubt - people still wonder what was in the briefcase to this day!).If you're not a fan of violence, bad language, drug-usage or films that play with the element of storytelling in order to mix things up a little, then you may find much of 'Pulp Fiction' a little hard to watch. However, even if you're not sure about it, I would advise at least giving it a go, simply because it one of those rare films where audiences and critics actually agreed that it was a 'true' masterpiece. Plus, as I've eluded to, Samuel L Jackson's performance is worth a viewing on its own, let alone with all the other amazing performances as well. They don't make them like this any more. Even Tarantino has never - quite - managed to recapture what he managed here."
brendancarlisebranch,"May 8, 2018",9/10,"Love this film for it's storyline, acting and cinematography."
Marvin Oatmeal,"Jul 19, 2000",10/10,"With his 1994 film Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino perfected his unique style of fractured narrative, explosive film making. Whereas the earlier Reservoir Dogs contains elements of the corrupted, overlapping narrative, it delivers its stories clumsily, only hinting at the overwhelming, challenging style that Pulp Fiction would eventually bring. His influence is evident in the way that so many young emerging film makers have emulated his rapidly delivered story lines and fractured narrative structure, from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels through to Go, or Run Lola Run. He remains one of the world's most influential and gifted film-makers, and Pulp Fiction is clearly his most impressive work to date."

drystyx,"Apr 11, 2006",6/10,"Pulp Fiction is mildly amusing in parts, and in all honesty relies completely on the scene that makes the movie, from where Bruce Willis walks past the clothesline to where he makes up with the hilarious crime boss. Much like the log scene makes a King Kong movie. The scenes with Willis are livelier than the scenes with the two dull, obnoxious hit men who get way too much screen time, and put the viewer to sleep. The surface plot of this movie is pretty dull, and it's tough to care with the poorly written characters, but it relies on its ""iconic"" style of trash talk and actions. The hidden plot of this movie is the title itself of ""Pulp Fiction"". This movie has mixed allusions to different eras. Sometimes, it is the late eighties and early nineties, but more often it is the late sixties, early seventies, with the rotary phones, clothes lines, rarity of billboards, and the songs people tapped fingers to in those days. What we have is essentially a make believe world in which kids from the seventies think the world is like outside, where everyone carries a gun and is either a boxer, gangster, killer, or lunatic. The ""modern"" images are all imagined by the seventies kids thinking they'll be in such a world when they grow up. A decent idea, but it could have been done better with more interesting hit men. The Bruce Willis character, and his performance, help salvage this, though."
Wong_Fei_Hong,"Jan 16, 2003",N/A,"i saw this when it first came out and i didn't like it then.  i figured i'd give it another shot.  once again i don't think it's a very good movie. like most Tarantino films, it could have been great, but it just never fulfilled it's own promise.  had the entire movie been about Jackson's and Travolta's characters, i would probably have really enjoyed the movie. but the whole Uma Thurman storyline was just a waste.  i found myself wanting to see more of Jackson and Travolta.  the Bruce Willis storyline was bad, the whole ball gag scene had no point and offset any ""genius"" in this movie. when the hitmen were on, i enjoyed it, anything else was completely boring and pointless.  and the whole disjointed storytelling was certainly not anything new."

Anytime the movie would come on TV or HBO or any channel over the years I would have to watch it again. I can safely say I be seen this movie well over 250 times and it never gets old. What Tarantino accomplished here is cinematic masterpiece by its very The Godfather, Goid Fellas and there's Pulp Fiction. That's it. That's the list.

the-fearless-america,"May 12, 2016",10/10,"This is one of movie that raising Tarantino to an apex level. He was so young that day, but already mobilizing his career expeditiously. Reservoir dogs, his first movie, is one kind of movie, using a similar 90s retro theme. Those style was an inheritance of Tarantino, it was his original natural-touch. His 90s movies severely enjoyable for young and mid-aged people. Nowadays, his 90s movie prevalent considered as trend-setter which used by so many directors nowadays, for example lets look at kill bill. Stylish but harsh with slow-mo action shot and consider the raid 2 and kingsman : secret service as its descendant.Pulp fiction is a film which considered as classic. Lets try to analyze it distinctly. First thing first, i am gonna highlight the performance of Samuel L Jackson. Indisputably, Jacksons performance is potent. You cant contest this level of characterization without any serious contemplation, because in this movie, Jackson ranked highly in top performance of all time category. Even an amateur audience could say this level of acting is above average. I even feel scared by his act (interrogating scene), its like I've been really charged by a verdict and witness him ready to gut me was really haunting and obnoxious.Secondly, the writing. Honestly, the plot could drive me from not in a mod into a freak. The joy element implicitly delivered from the writing to the audience. The interrogating scene, driving scene (in early duration), and of course the magnificent dancing scene. All these scenes were devoted by great screenplay technique. For example lets take a look and analyze the interrogating scene. Watch and remember Jacksons movement and watch the camera position carefully. At early, Tarantino using some establishing shot and some full-shot to all characters inside. It brings an introduction message while giving suspense to audience. Jacksons movement from outside the door to in the middle of the room to in front of sofa is a support to these shots. It sends horror expression to the interrogated characters. Then lately, while berating and punishing Tarantino using close-up shot and extreme close-up shot to execute. These give a huge pressure and impoverishing the morale of interrogated person. The force of pressure intensified by slow-paced play as Jackson moving. Those was an example of incredible screenplay and writing technique. This technique also used by legendary director Sergio Leone to his western movies.The 90s euphoria direction was the highest aspect of this movie. It shape the whole film with joyful nostalgic of 90s, such as the music and pop culture. The nostalgic invention of this new movie in 90s permeated to the whole audience until now. It persist as a classic nowadays. Tarantino was a terrific boy these day."

NaruemonChaingam,"Oct 14, 2022",9/10,"A hilariously violent and extremely well written script. ""Pulp Fiction"" is built in such a nonlinear fashion that you could watch it a dozen times and still not remember what happens next. It doubles back on itself, telling a series of interconnected stories about characters who live in a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses, and loud desperation. The title is ideal. The film, like the old pulp magazines ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" and ""Official Detective,"" creates a world with no normal people or days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom."
Sergeant_Tibbs,"Nov 9, 2008",8/10,"I don't deny that this film is 100% entertainment and the dialogue is solid gold; but that would be nothing without the terrific actors. To be honest, I think the screenplay is massively overrated (although it is commonly cited as one of the best of all-time). It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it must've been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesn't disencourage them. I can't help but resent the film for the fact it's usually the film that gets people into film (can't disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesn't have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that I'd like to know, to be honest. If it wasn't such a cult film none of the images would recur. It has a pretty flawless soundtrack though. However, I cannot discredit a film for being overrated and what this film does preach does not offend me. I completely understand the acclaim it gets.8/10"
