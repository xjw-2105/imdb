*DATo*,"May 16, 1999",10/10,"Whether you are a professional or an amateur it is always wise to avoid superlatives with regard to a movie critique ... but I cannot. 'Cinema Paradiso' is simply the finest movie I have ever seen. Like many who have posted at this site before me I have seen it many many times. It reaches within me to places other movies have never reached and I have often wondered why. Perhaps it is because of it's simplicity. It contains no expensive special effects, it has no gratuitous sex or violence, it has no ""multi-millon dollar per performance"" actors that I know of, it is arguable whether it even has a story line, and yet it soars far above the nonsense that film makers are producing these days. It's characters are portrayed by each and every actor in award winning style and the music is not only beautiful but absolutely perfect for this film.It is quite simply the story of a human life and it's tragedies and triumphs within the context of a vocation. A young boy matures and gradually learns the lessons of life, cultivates his passion for the cinema, and is rewarded with professional success; however, he remains unfulfilled for true love has escaped him only to return in the form of a gift of love which transcends time, space, and death to reveal at the closing of the film Toto's one true mistress.A staggering triumph of both the cinematic art and of story telling and yet there may be found people who do not like this movie .... I tend to keep such people at arms length and  maintain a wary eye fixed upon them at all times."
darkside2003,"Jan 30, 2005",10/10,"I seldom watch Italian movies, (i saw it today for the first time) being Italian maybe i'm biased, but this one really stands out. A real masterpiece; i can't remember another movie so moving like this one, maybe Schindler's list; it makes you laugh and it makes you cry, yet it is so simple and straightforward. Maybe there lies its magic: no Hollywood superstars, no special effects, just pure emotions and feelings, love, fear, grief and regret, nostalgia for childhood and youth, memories of places and times that will not come back, memories of the loved ones. Some movies are there to entertain, some to scare, some to question. This movie is there to affect your feelings. Definitely to be seen."
rappy-68741,"May 25, 2021",10/10,The final scene is probably the best in the history.
michaelsjmurphy,"Nov 29, 1999",10/10,"Movies can wield a strange power over those who sit in the darkened seats of a theatre.  The truly great ones manipulate your perception of reality, suspend your disbelief, and ultimately either alter or affirm your view on life.  NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO is just such a movie.  It is the near-perfect melding of direction, acting, script, sound track, and cinematography. Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio give the kind of performances usually associated with much more recognizable actors.  The supporting cast looks like they could all be full-blooded Sicilians.  The location shots add depth and realism to the entire production.  Ennio Morricone's music is simply the most appropriate and emotive I have ever had the pleasure to hear in a theatre.  Tornatore's script and direction are a joy, a breath of fresh air.I will not spoil this story by repeating it, nor will I give away the ending, although it matters not a whit.  I could disclose fully everything in this movie, and in seeing it, all my words would evaporate.  There is nothing like the experience of sitting through it, becoming engulfed by it, and in the end, being changed."
ccthemovieman-1,"Mar 21, 2006",8/10,"After seeing this special edition DVD which shows the entire 174-minute film (in addition to the 121-minute one that most of us had seen over the years,) my rating of this film was elevated. This review is of the longer ""director's cut.""Most of the new footage involved the main's character's romance while he was a young man. The story then is continued years later when that character comes back to his hometown for a funeral and runs into the woman he was in love with but never was able to get for his own. It turns out to be a somewhat tragic love story.The first part of the film, with Salvatore Cascio as ""Toto"" a young boy is a love story about two people sharing their love of movies: the kid and an adult ""Alfredo"" (Phillpe Noiret) who runs the local movie theater. Their love of film bonds them for life.The word ""love"" is used repeatedly in this review because that's the dominant theme: the love people had for others and for the world of film, something all of us on this website share.The second and third parts of the film are the above-mentioned love story of Toto (Marco Leonardi as an adolescent and then Jacques Perrin as an adult) and ""Elena"" (Agnese Nano/ Brigitte Fossey). The first third of this director;s cut edition is much livelier and interesting, frankly, than the last two-thirds. Although not boring, it does drag in a few spots but the longer version is better in the long run because it makes the whole story much more meaningful.It's very nicely filmed and you get a real feel for the Italian people and their little town. The director of the movie, Giuseppe Tornatore, went on to make other great visual films, two of which I also like: Malena and The Star Maker.....but Cinema Paradiso, I believe, is considered his ""masterpiece."""
rdmcflyers-95247,"Aug 7, 2019",10/10,"Absolutely one of the most beautiful, touching movies I've ever seen. Superbly acted by everyone and totally touched my heart. When he's watching the movie reel at the end I felt an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia, love and happiness for a time gone by when movie theaters were special places to go to lose yourself for a short time to something wonderful. A must see film."
boblipton,"Mar 19, 2020",10/10,"Is there any way for someone who has chosen the movies over life to write anything sensible about this movie for an audience who have made the same choice? I could talk about the way that Philippe Noiret's performance dominates the movie, but he is the only actor who plays his role from start to finish. Certainly, if Giuseppe Tornatore had set out to make a feature intended to win a Best Foreign Picture Oscar, he couldn't have plotted more cannily.It is, after all, a movie about how we start out as small children, trying to make sense out of the world, with nothing to guide us but stories in the dark.... and in the end, we end up that way, nostalgic for a time when we were confident that some day all would be revealed.Well, it hit all my buttons. Still, as I noted at the start, I chose the movies over life."
paul2001sw-1,"Oct 8, 2012",7/10,"To those of us who live in places less beautiful than Sicily, and which have lost connection with their peasant heritage much longer ago, there's a natural appeal to stories from that island. 'Cinema Paradiso' provides a nostalgic look at post-war Sicily, and also of Italian cinema during that era; in the story of how progress led to television, the death of the cinema as a social institution and the individualisation of people's lives, it recalls 'The Last Picture Show'. There's similarity as well in the conflict between attachment to one's community and the desire to escape, although it lacks Peter Bogdanovich's film's sense of overwhelming claustrophobia. Indeed, the emotional temperature of the film is actually quite muted, in spite of the surface colour and vigour. I enjoyed it, but (especially in a setting with such a complex historical and political backdrop) it could have benefited from a shade more intensity."
PIST-OFF,"Mar 14, 2021",9/10,"This movie is wonderful. It really captures a sense of nostalgia many of us harbor in our own lives. I don't know why I put off seeing it for so long. A little boy grows up loving movies (movie people in their narcissism love movies about movies) and is mentored by an older guy who sees big things in the kid's future. A rose tinted view of youth, love, and times that never seem to stop changing is what follows and a wonderful story it makes for. One of the few movies to get a grasp on childhood along with Stand By Me, The Sandlot, and a few others. Another movie that could benefit greatly from an English dub, as too many people are too likely to avoid subtitles at all costs."
Falko_h1,"Jun 7, 2024",7/10,"""Cinema Paradiso,"" directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, is a heartfelt tribute to the magic of movies and the power of nostalgia. The film follows Salvatore, a successful filmmaker, as he recalls his childhood in a small Sicilian village and his relationship with Alfredo, the projectionist at the local cinema, Cinema Paradiso.The story unfolds through a series of flashbacks, capturing Salvatore's formative years as he falls in love with the art of filmmaking under Alfredo's mentorship. Philippe Noiret delivers a touching performance as Alfredo, while Salvatore Cascio and Marco Leonardi beautifully portray the young and teenage Salvatore, respectively. Their on-screen chemistry is both endearing and poignant, driving the emotional core of the film.Ennio Morricone's evocative score complements the lush cinematography, enhancing the film's nostalgic atmosphere. The narrative is a bittersweet reflection on the passage of time, the evolution of cinema, and the impact of cherished memories. While some may find the pacing leisurely, the film's charm lies in its affectionate portrayal of a bygone era and its celebration of the communal experience of movie-going.""Cinema Paradiso"" is a touching homage to the transformative power of cinema, leaving viewers with a warm, wistful feeling and a renewed appreciation for the stories that shape our lives."
ali-38,"Dec 21, 1998",N/A,"I have seen this film at least a dozen times and each time I am carried away to a small village in Italy, where the dreams of a small boy come true and we can join his spellbinding journey.  The Italian language (it is subtitled) adds to the film's beauty and music, the characters are so real you can almost smell them.  I am absorbed into ""Paradiso"" each time I watch it, so that when it is over, I am shocked into the realisation that I haven't actually been anywhere except right there, in my theatre seat. I am not a huge ""art house"" film fan or indeed enjoy subtitled films (it is hard on the old eyes!) but ""Paradiso"" is a gem and is worth seeing again and again."
caspian1978,"Feb 12, 2005",10/10,"Giuseppe Tornatore's Nuovo cinema Paradiso (Cinema Paradiso) is everything good about the movies. It is a story about love. The love between a Father and Son, an Individual and his home, and the love for the movies. Even if this is not your favorite film, if you are a filmmaker, you have no choice but to say this is your all time favorite film (if not one of the greatest films ever made). If only for the movie's ending, this is a great film. The ending answers all of your questions and completes the story. The missing love from a Man's life. The missing pieces to all the stories (movies) found and made into a whole. The final message from beyond the grave, the ending is perfect. If the musical score doesn't put you in tears, the amazing visuals will push you over the edge. This is what all movies should be about. Terrific."
stevelivesey67,"Feb 7, 2021",10/10,"Genius, masterpiece, (insert superlative here).
Tornatore's finest achievement is nostalgic and romantic in equal measure.
Watch the long version, it adds a more perspective to the heartbreaking ending."
preppy-3,"Jul 1, 2002",10/10,"This 1988 Italian film (released in the US in 1990), is back with a full 51 minutes added on. This seemed like a stupid idea...there was nothing wrong with the original. The directors cut (which was 1/2 hour longer) was considered a mess. Also, for this release, an extra 1/2 hour was added! I expected the worse. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that this 3 hour version is better than the 2 hour one.This story follows the life of Salvatore. He's born in a tiny Italian village and we see him as a little boy in the 1930s, an adolescent in the 40s-50s and an adult in the 80s. It basically is about his love of movies and the one true love of his life--Elena. They are in love but she comes from a rich family and he lives in poverty. How can they be together?POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!!The cut movie in the US excised a lot of the Elena subplot and concentrated on Salvatore's love of movies. There's nothing wrong with that, but Elena disappears quite suddenly. This full version explains what happened between them and fleshes out the characters more. It also reveals a crucial surprise at the end.The performances are all fantastic--especially by the gorgeous young actor playing Salvatore as a teenager. Elena is also stunning. The film has beautiful cinematography and a haunting music score. The 3 hours flew by for me. I didn't want it to end!So...beautiful music, attractive stars, good acting, compelling story and some incredible romantic sequences. A must-see!!!!Bring plenty of Kleenex though--I cried a least 5 times!"
phaneendrakumar,"Feb 5, 2005",10/10,"This movie definitely is one of my all time best movies. Director Giuseppe Tornatore placed himself in the list of the best directors. The usage of an excellent background score is a trademark of his movies and this movie is not at all a different case.He is also a master in getting best performances out of children and adolescents. Marco Leonardi was the pick of the whole cast. Also watch Melena for those trademarks of Tornatore.The character of Alfredo is one of the most unforgettable characters. The way emotions captured in a camera is way beyond naturality.Overall, this is a great movie with ultimate teamwork with everyone contributing. I just loved the movie very much."
Xstal,"Jan 10, 2023",8/10,"The centre of attraction in the town, a screen where everybody gathers round, showing films in black and white, bringing joy, pleasure, delight, as the reels rotate, the story is unwound. Toto's mesmerised by all he sees and hears, the picture house is where he flees and cheers, getting in Alfredo's way, mischievous eyes so full of play, Father Adelfio, still collars him for prayers. As he gets older more distractions then appear, conscription, briefly ends all premieres, a girl captures his young heart, sends his pulse right off the chart, then comes the time, when he moves on, goes overseas.Toto's growing up in a small town in Sicily, with the joys of cinematic adventure, amongst a group of characters destined to remain as set in their ways as those captured in Pompeii. But there's always someone to help you change direction, point you at the stars and help you on your way, you just need to find them and then listen.Still as beautiful and as elegant as it ever was."
ma-cortes,"Mar 5, 2014",7/10,"Colorful and moving flick dealing with a wonderful friendship between a little boy and a solitary projectionist . However , being overly nostalgic , too sentimental and overwhelmingly sweet . Attractive and sensitive picture with stirring drama , ravishing cinematography and enjoyable musical score . A filmmaker (Jacques Perrin , he subsequently became a notorious director) recalls his childhood (Salvatore Cascio , Toto , who celebrated his eighth birthday during filming) , when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist (Philippe Noiret who said all his lines in French) at Cinema Paradise . The director goes back home to his Sicilian village for the first time after almost 30 years and is reminded of his first love (Antonella Attili) .It is an interesting celebration of youth, friendship, and the everlasting magic of the films . Nostalgic and sensitive picture with thought-provoking drama , ravishing cinematography and moving musical score . The picture contains drama and nostalgia completely wrapped in an agreeable story between a lone man and a boy . The flick relies heavily on the relationship between an older man and a kid , subsequently teenager , but this does not get bored or spoils the tale . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time , the picture is enjoyable and entertaining , but overlong . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility , the intelligent screenplay was written by the same Giuseppe Tornatore . Giuseppe's intention was that this movie should serve as an obituary for traditional movie theatres and the movie industry in general , after the movie's success he never mentioned this again. This excellent and enthralling picture ¨Cinema Paradise¨ was starred by extraordinary actors such as Philippe Noiret , Jacques Perrin and Marco Leonardi . Good acting from remaining cast , just like Antonella Attili , Enzo Cannavale , Leopoldo Triestre , Agnese Nano , Pupella Maggio, among others . Glowing cinematography with scenarios colorfully and stunningly photographed by Blasco Giurato who reflects splendidly the cinema , streets , square , village and many other things . Rousing as well as insistent score musical , including a continuous leitmotif from the beginning to the end ; being efficiently composed by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone . The film won several nominations and awards , Oscar included .This weeper picture was very well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore . He is a writer and director, known for making similar nostalgic films including good actors , such as ¨Malena¨ with Monica Belucci , ¨ The star maker¨ with Sergio Castellito , ¨Baaria¨ with Raoul Bova ; and ¨La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano"" (original title) or ""The Legend of 1900"" or ""The Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean with Tim Roth . Being his English-language debut feature titled ¨The professor¨ with Ben Gazzara . Cinema Paradise Rating : Better than average, well worth watching for exceptional cinematography , first-rate acting and marvelous score ."
Atreyu_II,"Aug 13, 2010",7/10,"This Italian motion picture achieved notorious fame, comparable to the equally famous and more recent Italian movie 'La Vita è Bella'.Like that one, this one is also very good in its first half, but after that it becomes a movie of bad taste. That's really too bad, because this movie (and 'La Vita à Bella') had potential to be something big.'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso' can be considered a homage both to cinema and films. It shows us the pinnacle of the cinema as an industry of entertainment and as an escape for those who go there to watch the movies, making them forget the hard reality of poverty and war. Besides the cinema's success, it also shows its progress, its bankrupt, its decadence and its sad ending.This is a very simple film. However, simplicity doesn't necessary mean something bad. Plus, the brilliant and memorable soundtrack by Ennio Morricone adds lots of emotion to the film, particularly in its first half, which is without a doubt the best part of the movie.One of the biggest charms of this movie is the fascination and enthusiasm of Salvatore (whose nickname is ""Toto"") on the cinema and the projectionist job. He wins the friendship of the local projectionist, Alfredo, who also teaches him all about that job. As you can tell, ""Toto"" is a very intelligent kid and a very quick learner. Plus, he is mischievous, cute and hilarious.Of course, even the first half has its minor faults, such as the pranks of bad taste - for example, that pig who spits to the audience and the prank with a bug on the sleepy guy. Pranks aside, I also don't like at times the behavior of Salvatore's mother: she slaps him a number of times.As for the good of the first half, well, just about most of it. And this without forgetting Salvatore's dumb classmate. He's a poor dumb kid who doesn't know what 5x5 is. Whenever he answers that question is hilarious, as each answer is dumber than the previous one. In the 3rd time, he goes as far as replying «Natale!» (which is ""Christmas"" in Italian) - when he said that, I practically died of laughter!As for the 2nd half of the movie, most of it is wrong and seems quite rushed and forced. Salvatore is no longer charming as a grown up. The love story between Salvatore and the girl of his dreams is frustrating in all ways, not to mention that it's ridiculous that Salvatore spends entire months waiting for her to open the window as a sign that she fell in love for him. There is no comedy or charm as in the 1st half. An animal is stabbed. Salvatore joins the army. And Alfredo's attitude later is puzzling: forcing Salvatore to leave that town forever, never look back, never return (not even to visit, going as far as saying that if he returns he won't receive him in his house), never let nostalgia hit him and never to even write or think about them.I clearly prefer ""Toto"" as a child than as a teen or as an adult. ""Toto"" is far more charming as a child. In fact, the moment he grows up, for some reason the movie looses its initial greatness.Phillipe Noiret gives a great performance as Alfredo, but little Salvatore Cascio steals the show as little ""Toto"".I never saw the Director's Cut version. And frankly, I've got no interest in watching it. It's about 30 minutes longer, making it a too long movie and it certainly makes one view the film differently, as many of the mysteries are revealed (which might not be a very good idea). I saw the shorter version which isn't even that short, as it is nearly 2 hours long. But I can handle a movie of 2 hours."
evilmatt-3,"Sep 3, 2001",4/10,"I appreciate what this this film was trying to do, but I think it's entirely to big, clumsy, and sloppy to be of any real value.  I actually sat through this monster twice and I can say that it doesn't even get any better the second time.The theme of the movie (that is, maturing and allowing yourself to move on with your life, as opposed to the pretty picture movies portray) is admirable and comprehensible.  However, there are some major problems that overwhelm this strength.  First, the film is entirely too long.  It feels like the director just tossed in every single ""growing up"" cliché he could think of and the result is that the movie takes up waaaay too much of your life.  Second, in spite of the first problem, this film has huge story gaps that took place as a result of massive editing (as I understand it, this film was originally well over three hours).  Third, the film makes no real attempt to establish empathy with the audience.  It instead makes the erroneous assumption that we will just see Alfred and Toto and be instantly smitten with these lovable characters.  Wrong again.  I too often found them annoying and ridiculous (especially Toto) to have any real emotional bonds with anyone.The ending is decent, but it would have had more effect had all of the previous clutter not been strewn about the film.  All in all, this was just way to mushy and bloated for me."
Boyo-2,"Oct 4, 1999",N/A,"This movie is very sentimental, so if you are proud of your cynical side, stay away.If you are scared of foreign movies and start foaming at the mouth at a subtitle, stay away.For the rest of us, this is a masterpiece!  Enjoy the movie and enjoy yourself!  The end is so beautiful that it is almost unbelievable."
vuktom,"Jun 16, 2021",10/10,I have seen this movie a dozen times and I've loved it more for every time I've watched it. Today I saw the full version for the first time and I love it even more.I will not spoil it by telling the story but if you have a romantic disposition you will love it. Maybe the music is better than the movie - it's mr Morricone so it is a masterpiece in another masterpiece.I envy you all that will see it for the first time. It's as sweet as true love.
strokemp,"Jan 8, 2020",10/10,"Excellent movie, very funny and emotional at times for all true movie and cinema fans.
Beautiful Italian scenery and spirit, good positive characters, music of Ennio Morricone, good acting...I never watched the movie which grab you so fast and really connect with the characters, incredible how todays movie lacks of that.
The end is very emotional, last scene is superb, thanks to the music, acting of main actor and beautiful mix of romantic scenes from the other movies like a great tribute to the movies itselfs.There is standard (shorter) and directors cut version. My opinion is that the shorter version is way better, not because added scenes are not interesting, it is more like the added scenes ruin the magic which is maded between main two characters and the last scene then doesn't look natural."
myrtols,"Apr 3, 2021",10/10,One of the best films ever made... And of course one of the best soundtracks ever.
TheLittleSongbird,"Jul 17, 2011",10/10,"As a big lover of film, I am still kicking myself for not seeing this masterpiece any sooner. To me, Cinema Paadiso is one of the best films of the 80s and also the most moving, particularly in the final hour.I have seen many visually stunning films, and Cinema Paradiso is up there as one of the most visually ravishing films I've seen. The cinematography and editing are outstanding, and the scenery still looks gorgeous with an epic feel to it. Cinema Paradiso, alongside The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West, also contains one of Ennio Morricone's most haunting scores and it is also one of my favourites of his.Cinema Paradiso is immaculately directed, has an touching, beautifully-written and honest script and a rich, compelling story that while it has an elegiac feel moves swiftly by draws you right in until the ending, which breaks my heart still after 5 times of seeing it.The characters are very well defined, particularly Alfredo, and the acting is outstanding with Salvatore Cascio, Enzo Cannavale, Marco Leonardi and especially Phillippe Noiret particularly impressive. All in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Saanwithhisstupidthoughts,"Jul 29, 2022",10/10,"This epic wave of nostalgia evoking film primarly and most importantly was a coming of age drama with cinema backing the narrative by being at the forefront, centre and background of and playing a huge huge role in the lead's life.Cinema Paradiso was also a heartfelt tribute as well as a tender love letter to the world of cinema, movie halls/movie theatres and the audience of it.The film additionally depicted the changes that went on taking place around the sicilian town as time passed like the modernization, religious ideals (here especially the censoring of cinemas) and later on it's abolishment, theatre renovation, idk if this was common back in the days but mobsters utilizing gun shots heard in the theatre as a perfect decoy for carrying out murder (that might've been added up as an ingenious murder idea during that time period, I guess)
the introduction of television, the downfall of the towns movie theatre, political and socialogical changes etc.There were themes of friendship, family, nostalgia, dreams as well as love in general and first love coming into play which later got extended by full on romanticizing of huge portion of the second half of the movie.The direction was compelling, the performances and the chemistry between the characters and the actors involved were so compelling,engaging, lovable and effectively convincing respectively and the cinematography just amazing and the scores also complimented the scenes oh so well.There were strong emotions and effectivity in all the themes Tornatore explored and showcased in this film for me and thus when looked upon from a casual movie viewer's pov, this felt like a perfect film to me."
Marc_Israel_365,"Jan 2, 2015",6/10,"I so wanted to be engrossed by a film about a filmmakers romance with his villages movie theater and their projectionist. I wanted it to validate my own love of escapism, so wonderfully woven by incredibly directors who take us to such wonderful places that even our imagination couldn't have dreamed of. With such a grandiose name, the (lack of) family, village square, theater and boorish patrons fell short of endearing and, at times, fell short on many levels. Meaningful bits went on too long carried to 1970's made for TV levels by a overindulgent soundtrack. The actors played their parts, but with such inconsistent overdubbing, I felt for none of them. Yes the boy and projectionist bit was sweet, but not enough to carry the film. The older Totos' added no depth to the little boy. Conceptually nice and the scenes reenacting the crowds reaction to the theater and its limitations worked even if they were crude, but did we find a way to connect to movies as a character. I don't believe it was introduced until the final scene evidenced the character shunned from them by the church and I just couldn't relate, just like the film"
christopher-underwood,"May 12, 2022",6/10,"Many years ago I found the film not quite as great as almost everyone seemed to think but watching again today I still find it only just okay. It is wonderful in the first half and the cinema with the boy and his love of the clips, the cuts and the whole of his childhood, the projector, the man and his magic and his helping to as well. The splendid scenes of the cinema and the children and the adults are just as thrilling. As the boy gets older and falls in love it starts to get a bit too sentimental and later as him older it is really not as good at all. I find that the old cinema magic has gone and just too schmaltzy."
xarraw,"Dec 10, 2008",5/10,Shortly as always; Acting isn't too good.. sounds that people produce seem artificial. This is a film about a boy growing up in the vicinity of a movie theater. On the background there is a war ongoing but the episodes of the film don't make much connection to it. Story is a bit boring at least from a Finnish point of view.. Only one or two episodes made me smile a bit but the humor isn't too intelligent. Maybe this film is good for some people that can imagine beyond what is shown. For me; characters didn't matter much. Music is more happy than melancholic and I could probably compose something more touching.. :D. Maybe this was a good movie 20 years ago but today you can see much better films with more atmosphere and with a better script.-WarraX-
SCManCA,"Feb 10, 2020",10/10,"Sitting down and watching this masterpiece again, what a treat.It's hard to believe this movie came out over 30 years ago. But, oh how it resonates. Even today. It is now deemed an older movie, but it is still deserving of the praise and adulation it received when it was released.It melds this incredible sense of beauty, romance, drama, and wit into an almost aesthetically perfect cinematic tour de force.And the performances bring it to life in a most magical and captivating way. It is absolutely enchanting and makes me want to go out and fall in love all over again.Not only does this gem pay homage to the romance of times gone by, but it keeps the romance alive, even today. Every time you watch it.It's a movie about movies at its most foundational level. But it's so much more. It shows us what a film can bring to our lives. What it can teach us about humanity. And how it, quite simply, makes us feel.As I watched this again, I am very surprised that the young men playing both Salvatore as a child and as a young man didn't do more. Unless they have made their mark in other countries to levels of which I'm unaware.Salvatore Cascio....what an amazing performance by that young man. I'm surprised he didn't win more than a BAFTA.And Marco Leonardi....talk about beauty personified. Whenever his countenance graced the screen it took your breath away. Where did he go, and why didn't he become the matinee idol to parallel the successes of Antonio Banderas, Johnny Depp, et. al. Such a handsome young man, and a wonderful actor.Thank you, Italy, and thank you Giuseppe Tornatore for bringing us this artistic treasure."
dreaujyc,"Mar 26, 2024",10/10,"I have been seeing this movie for many times, although it has the runtime of almost 3 hours, I could only review some fragments from the social media nowadays, it's still on my top list for all time. Believe or not, I couldn't help crying as a 41-year-old man to watch the epilogue every time. Yes, that is what I really do. The love theme by Morricone is the real masterpiece and surely gives me the highest emotional value between nostalgia and homesickness by touching me in the depth of my heart. If I want to cry to reduce my mental pressure ,I would watch it again and again .It was never on at the cinema or seldomly shown on TV in China ,but I believe that there are so many fans to raise it folk reputation from time to time."
Galina_movie_fan,"May 5, 2007",10/10,"A wonderful gift for all movie lovers around the world, Giuseppe Tarnatore's deserving Oscar Winner for Best Foreign Language Film has been (and I believe will be) loved and admired by the viewers regardless their age, gender, native language, and the country they grew up and saw their first movie in the theater, be it a huge multiplex or the modest cinema in a small village.""Cinema Paradiso"" takes place in a postwar Sicilian village and tells about a friendship between a projectionist in the local cinema of the title, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret, one of the best French character actors whose career spanned more than half a century and who was equally good in the surreal satire, light comedies, moving dramas or revenge war movies) and the little boy Salvatore or Toto whose father had died during the war. Since his childhood, Toto was fascinated by the movies and spent countless hours in the projection booth with Alfredo who had become the boy's friend and the mentor. After a fire blinds Alfredo, Toto becomes the projectionist, and the Cinema Paradiso continues to attract all villagers and to bring them together on Friday night to experience again and again the miracle of film. The boy's obsession with film becomes a lifelong love affair which will make him eventually a famous and successful filmmaker.Deceivingly simple and straightforward, the film is always moving, tender, touching, full of humor, love and compassion to its eccentric characters but what makes is special and unique, is the fact that we the viewers, all of us can and do relate to the story because we relive our own childhood movie experiences while watching the film. My memory took me many years and thousands miles back to the time when I was 5 and my grandmother took me to the theater for the first time. She later told me that she had been afraid that I would've became bored, restless, and started to cry - it never happened. I was so charmed and fascinated by what was happening on the huge screen that I sat not even moving, mesmerized and not uttering the single sound. Since that very moment, I have been always ready for the miracle to happen again. I expect every new movie to be great; I want to love, to cherish and to adore it. When it happens and the movie becomes mine, I am the happiest person in the Universe. It did happen tonight when I was watching Giuseppe Tarnatore's ""Cinema Paradiso"", one of the best films about the power, beauty, and magic of FILM ever made."
gavin6942,"Sep 30, 2014",7/10,"A filmmaker recalls his childhood, when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist.In many ways, this film anticipates ""The Long Day Closes"" and ""Hugo"". While ""Cinema Paradiso"" is probably not the first movie about enjoying movies, it is easily the most successful and critically acclaimed. Terence Davies was likely influenced, and there is no doubt that Martin Scorsese was.""Cinema Paradiso"" was shot in director Tornatore's hometown of Bagheria, Sicily, as well as Cefalù on the Tyrrhenian Sea. This makes the film somewhat more interesting for Sicilians in Wisconsin, as they largely trace their roots to Bagheria. Myself, though not Sicilian, have extensively studied the Italians of Milwaukee and find this connection fascinating. (The Sicilian roots are explored a bit more on the Blu-ray in ""A Dream of Sicily"", which looks into the life of director Giuseppe Tornatore.)The themes of the film are many, and go beyond the simple love of film or seeing film as a background of our lives (which is a feeling many cinephiles share). We have the role of religion, with some excessive priestly censorship of the films within the film, even cutting out a ""chaste kiss"".There is the theme of the Mafia, which is unfortunately an ever-present aspect of the Sicilian way of life. We see that mob boss ""Don Vincenzo"" has complete control of employment (and an unusual rapport with Edward G. Robinson). Although he is not a major character, he plays an interesting role for being opposed by the village priest, and the way the populace accepts him is striking.""Cinema Paradiso"" has countless nods to Fellini, quite possibly the biggest influence on Tornatore (and many other Italians). Interestingly, Fellini was going for ""realism"" (or neo-realism) in his work, and much of this film covers similar themes but plays them for laughs (at least in the first half). This is homage in its purest form -- taking a source and inverting, subverting it.The film was rightly honored by many, not least of which was at the Academy Awards. What is most surprising is that the Criterion Collection did not scoop this title up years ago. But luckily for us, Arrow Academy is giving Criterion a run for their money and offers an impressive set for ""Paradiso"" fans. Both the theatrical cut and director's cut are in the set, providing an additional 50 minutes of footage, including a crucial romantic scene that is entirely excised in the shorter version.The Arrow set also has ""A Dream of Sicily"", a 52-minute reflection on Tornatore's career, interviews with the key actors, a breakdown of the kissing montage, and more. Yale professor Millicent Marcus, who has authored many books on Italian cinema including ""Italian Film in the Shadow of Auschwitz"", provides a very insightful commentary (in English!), not only elucidating the finer points of the film, but pointing out connections to other, lesser-known works of Italian cinema."

Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Nov 28, 2020",7/10,"'Cinema Paradiso (1988)' is soaked, and I mean absolutely drenched, in nostalgia. In fact, it somehow makes you feel nostalgic for something you never even experienced. Framed as a trip into memory, the movie charts the formative years of Toto as he grows up in and around a thriving small-town cinema and strikes up a friendship with a coarse but kind-hearted projectionist. The picture does a great job in conveying the passage of time, with its eponymous picture-house going through as many - if not more - changes as its core characters. Though it does occasionally drag and, generally, has the tendency to meander, the experience is an oddly affecting one that remains engaging throughout. It has a palpable texture to it, too. Helped immensely by a stand-out (if somewhat repetitive) score from Ennio Morricone, the movie transports you to a distinct place and time in an almost melancholic way. It's by no means dour - in fact, it's often rather funny - but it definitely has more than tinge of regret to it. In the end, it can almost entirely be described as one thing: nostalgic. 7/10"
drgrozozo,"Aug 1, 2007",4/10,"well i really wanted to like this movie, and i was ready for a treat. but unfortunately, it never came.movie starts promising, base for the story is laid down wide, and it looks like it will grow into a masterpiece. but it doesn't. phillipe noiret deserves recommendations for his role of alfredo and young salvatore cascio is nothing short of a brilliant in his role of salvatore as a child. other than that, everything is mediocre at best. story, while full of potential, is presented in an utterly corny and clichéd manner, acting is (besides those two honorable exceptions) amateurish and overplayed, and plot is (as expected) non-existent. filmed 4 years after ""once upon a time in America"", this flick at the moments resonates the great masterpiece, and i kinda expected old salvatore to look through projection booth while recalling his childhood :)while i can always swallow eternal-love type of story, this one is too shallow, too unfocused and watered. i haven't missed any of the movies messages, they are just too obvious and pathetic, and could appeal to me only if i was 18 again. for a 1988 movie that pretend to be something more, i find that inexcusable. there a tons of beautiful films, much older than this, dealing with same subjects in much more profound and original manner. this one settles with portraying love for art with endless clips of old movies, and shots of people watching them. for most passionate lovers of cinema and celluloid magic this might be a great movie as they can find their favorites in every clip featured. i personally don't like cinema as a whole nor it's ""magic"" nor do i respect every ""classic"". what i do like are good stories told in a good way, whether spoken, written or made into movies. and i don't like the way this one is told so i would probably give it 2 stars if there wasn't for legendary morricone that can singlehandedly elevate experience of every movie with the simplest of his tunes. watch and forget."
YourNewAesthetic,"Mar 25, 2003",10/10,"I am going to start this by warning anyone who has yet to see the director's cut of Cinema Paradiso: DO NOT WATCH THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!!  I know everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I am saying this because I viewed both versions of Cinema Paradiso in my film class (123 min. version first, followed by the 170 min. director's cut), and with the exception of one person, everyone in the class wished that they had not seen it.  At the very least, if you must watch the director's cut, I urge you, no, I implore you, to make sure you watch the 123 min version first.  If you watch the 170 min version first, you are robbing yourself of a great experience you will never be able to reclaim; watching the 170 min version first WILL ruin the 123 min version.After we first viewed the 123 min version, there wasn't a single person in my class that wasn't amazed by what they had just seen.  It is an amazing story of the magic of film and the cinema, highlighted by great performances and some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen.  There are very few films that I consider to be near-perfect, but the 123 min version of Cinema Paradiso has made that list.  Some people complain that the 123 min version leaves a lot unanswered, but the beauty of it is that it doesn't matter.  Though love and Toto's relationship with Elena are involved, they aren't the focus of the 123 min version.  The focus of that version is on the relationship between Alfredo and Toto, and their shared love and enchantment with the cinema and film.It is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in the director's cut.  In attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions, the film is considerably bogged down by details and the magic and emotion of the 123 min version is lost.  The focus of the entire story is shifted, and rather than solely being the story of the relationship between Toto and Alfredo, the film takes on the extra task of juggling the story of the relationship between Toto and Elena as well.  In doing so, both storylines suffer, and the power the 123 min version holds is greatly reduced.  The result is a complicated mess of answers (many of which only raise more questions), that after seeing leave you wishing you hadn't. In the end you crave for that initial sense of magic and emotion the 123 min version provided to come back, but for some it is all too late.  I know it's tempting to watch the director's cut, but this is one occasion where you shouldn't indulge your curiosity.  Sadly, the 170 min director's cut version taints the beauty and magic of the 123 min version of Cinema Paradiso, and that is one treasure that should never be lost."
Hitchcoc,"Jan 26, 2016",10/10,"A village comes to life as a man dreams of a character who directed his entire life. He was a projectionist a run down movie theater which formed the center of entertainment in the community. We are introduced to Toto who lives with his mother who waits for her husband to come home from the Russian front. He is a scalawag who disobeys her and finds ways to spend time with Alfredo, the protectionist. He is in constant trouble but always comes to this man for direction, even though the guy finds him to be a pain in the butt. One night, the movie projector catches fire as does the film (nitrate film did this in the early days) and blinds the old man. Toto becomes the projectionist, even though he is but ten years old. He also becomes the eyes of his friend. He stays at the job, ignoring school, and eventually makes some modest films himself. As he does this, he sees a beautiful young woman with whom he falls in love. This whole film captures the essence of the city. We get to know a multitude of characters because their lives revolve around the movies being shown at the Cinema Paradiso. Toto (not his real name) returns to his home when his mother leaves a message for him that Alfredo has died. He has really cut off ties with the place and it is a painful trip back. But it pulls at our hearts. Things are almost magical. One of the best films every made."
Alcaminhante,"May 11, 1999",10/10,"This film is a beautiful cinematic poem.I´ll never understand why this movie in the States is considered an Art House movie. Almost for intellectuals. Why ? Because it is not in English? This couldn´t have been a more comercial normal movie if it really tried to be one in the first place. People who say this is an ART movie, definitely never watched one in their lives. Because they can be awful to watch sometimes. But there are good things too. Anyway...Unfortunely, I bet many people didn´t went to see it because of this classification. You don´t know what you´re missing !CINEMA PARADISO, is, ( along with THE BIG BLUE ), my all time favorite movie ever, ( I can never choose between them ). It has the most beautiful story I´ve seen in a movie so far.Many people don´t like it, but I can bet those people don´t truly love cinema. They´re just ordinary movie goers who consume movies as fast food. Anyone who loves Cinema has to love CINEMA PARADISO !I used to think that italian movies were only those junk crapPseudo-erotic "" PORKYS "" style comedies or else those Art Films that the very intelligent Elite of film critics pretend to like, and so I only went to see CINEMA PARADISO, a few months after his release, because I was thinking that this would be one more of those.I was wrong. This is the most beautifuly filmed love story ever, on par only with CASABLANCA although in a very diferent style. It´s amazing how this movie by telling a love story and a life of a character in fact tells about the history of cinema itself. The use of the theater location as a conection between characters through out the years is magnificently done.And it has probably the most beautiful soundtrack ever !Very emotive and capturing perfectly the story in all its moments.And it has the most beautiful and moving ending ever filmed! No matter how many times we see this film. I bet everybody drops a tear at the end. And more than a tear, I´m sure. I do.This is one of those rare moments in modern cinema that can´t be described. It has to be felt.This movie is a true MASTERPIECE ! Please go and see it. It realy deserves not to be ignored.Do yourselves a favor and go see it.You´ll never forget it. Believe me. It´s that good."
lucio7,"Aug 29, 2013",10/10,"Don't approach the movie with your logic part of the brain switched on.Yes, as someone said there are some flaws relative to how realistic it can be, but that doesn't matter because you'd be missing the point.Just let yourself go and enjoy this celebration of cinema, dream and emotions and this piece of art will bring you on a lovely spiritual trip.I loved it.P.S.: Sorry IMDb, but I was able to say everything I wanted to say without the mandatory 10 lines of text. I really love your website but you should pass this message to the management: quantity doesn't make quality."
lee_eisenberg,"Nov 24, 2006",10/10,"Philippe Noiret's death yesterday brings to mind all his movies, including ""Nuovo cinema Paradiso"". The first time that I saw this was right after I had seen ""The Postman"", and I recognized him as the man who had played Pablo Neruda. Here, he plays an equally great role, of the operator of a camera in a movie theater in an Italian village in years past. His friendship with and advice to young Salvatore proves to be more than the boy could have ever dreamed about. In a sense, the movie seems to be a look not only at what Italy was, but also what going to the movies was. It's definitely a masterpiece that I recommend. There may be the issue of whether or not we should make Italy's past look so idealistic, given that Mussolini was in power at the time. But I would assert that this movie shows that even in times of oppression, people can find ways to escape it. A really good movie."
muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 20, 2025",6/10,"Giuseppe Tornatore's ""Cinema Paradiso"" is a deeply affecting and utterly enchanting film that swept me away with its poignant ode to cinema, childhood, and the enduring power of memory.It's a beautifully crafted narrative centered on the unforgettable bond between young Toto and the gruff, big-hearted projectionist Alfredo. Watching their relationship unfold, set against the backdrop of a post-war Sicilian village and the magic of the local cinema, is an experience filled with warmth, humor, and profound sadness.The film masterfully evokes a sense of nostalgia, making you long for a bygone era and the simple joy of shared cinematic experiences. The final montage, in particular, is one of the most moving sequences I've ever witnessed, a true emotional gut-punch that perfectly encapsulates the film's themes. Its lyrical pacing and evocative score contribute to its timeless appeal.Is it worth watching? Absolutely. ""Cinema Paradiso"" is a beloved classic that stands as a testament to the magic of movies and the bittersweet nature of life. It's an essential watch for anyone who loves film."
planktonrules,"Jul 12, 2006",10/10,"With the exception of a few of De Sica's films during the Neorealist days of the 40s and 50s, I think this is the finest Italian film I have seen. It is highly reminiscent of Fellini's Amarcord, though even better (and that's saying a lot), because it offers a wonderful and nostalgic look back at how life used to be. And, it is told so gently and affectionately that you can't help but love the film and the characters. The film is named after the local theater because it is the focal point for this community through the many years the film encompasses. Gentle, beautiful and full of humor and grace--this is a wonderful film for pretty much the entire family and you can't help but admire all those associated with it."
arrowappledesign,"Apr 2, 2023",7/10,"And the film would understand my sentiment, as that's literally the plot of the movie. Seriously this is a masterpiece on all fronts. Seriously entertaining, seriously riveting, and seriously well shot with a score to die for. Characters are engaging with depth. Movies today can't hold a candle to this cinematic masterpiece. But this is more of a journey in cinematic history than a riveting tale as this is the blueprint for all epic tales in cinema today. Not a slander. This movie is majestic. I don't even know what else to say. Beautiful for a time piece. True to the heart of the film and the message is still relevant."
hunter-friesen,"Apr 6, 2018",5/10,"Emotions can make or break a film. Have too little, and your film has no weight and no importance. Have too much and your film will be unbelievable and schmaltzy. Giuseppe Tornatore's 1988 feature Cinema Paradiso definitely falls into the latter category. It's overflowing with forced emotions that take you out more than they invest you in. Nostalgia may have blinded some people from seeing this Oscar-winning film from what it really is, a manipulative and cliched tale that is never original or worthwhile of your time.World War II is still in full swing in the Italian countryside. The only kind of entertainment in town in the local cinema, Cinema Paradiso. Every night people arrive in droves to escape from the tragedies of reality. Out of all the attendees, the most passionate one is Toto. He's a young boy who has a passion for film and will do anything to learn more about it. Current projectionist Alfredo reluctantly takes him under his wing and begins to teach him the skills necessary to be a projectionist. From this point, Toto and Alfredo begin a lifelong friendship, one that we witness as the film tracks Toto's life from childhood to adult.Cinema Paradiso is a very, very conventional film that never does anything out of the ordinary. Maybe that's why some people love it. It harkens back to the golden age of cinema, one filled with melodrama and two-bit characters. But for me, the nostalgia feels almost politically manipulative. It shows historical clips from old films that are supposed to make you feel good, which in turns makes you feel good about the film as a whole. It's the same technique used by any movie that includes a ton of pop culture references to try and win your emotional attachment. It feels forced and cheap, almost like the director doesn't trust his crew.The film also overplayed its hand when it comes to delivering on the emotions. Nothing you feel is natural. Everything is presented with so much artificial drama and weight that it soon becomes tiresome to watch. It feels like a ploy by the director to get you to care about the film. It also feels so political and awards baity towards the Oscar voters. ""Look at how important cinema is!"" is the main message that is repeated numerous times, each times getting more and more irritating.Ennio Morricone is one of the greatest composers of all time, and he proves it here with a great theme. It has a classical and uplifting beat that perfectly captures the tone of the film. Unfortunately, Tornatore gives Morricone the ultimate disrespect by using so many times that it too becomes annoying to hear.One positive that I can say is that the actors were quite good, especially the pair of Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio as Alfredo and young Toto, respectively. They have great chemistry and are able to carry the early parts of the film with ease.Marco Leonardi does a pretty good job as adolescent Toto. He mostly just coasts off his good looks, but he does bring some complexity to his character. He does struggle with the emotional bits however and comes off a bit too hammy.This is one of the clearest cut cases of what a film did right and what it did wrong. The performances and music are all there, but the directing is atrocious and sinks everything. This would be a must-see film if a more serious director had taken the helm. Unfortunately, hindsight is 20/20 and what we are left with is a film that tries way too hard to make you care about what it wants to say."
filmbuff-05706,"Aug 12, 2025",10/10,"Before I review Cinema Paradiso, which I recently saw for the 2nd time ever, and for the first time in 8 years, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I'm on the autism spectrum, and people with that have interests that they fixate on. For me, that has always been movies.I was also born in 1998- a full decade after Cinema Paradiso came out. And when I see Salvatore, also called Toto, I see myself. And that's why this is one of my Top 20 favorite movies.Toto, as I will call him, loves movies as much as I do. When he is a child, his mother will give him money for groceries, and he will spend the money on movie tickets instead. His mother forbids him to go to the movies, but he works around it, eventually working for the theater.Soon, the manager, now blind from a tragic incident, tells him to get out of town and find something new to do with his life. There is also a struggle with the Catholic church, forcing every kiss in a movie to be removed. But no matter what, Toto's love for movies remains.In movie reviews, I tend to talk about how the acting is, or the camerawork, and so on. It's all very well done, as is the score by Ennio Morricone, who did the famous music for The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.For Cinema Paradiso, I would rather just focus on the movie's theme. Not only is Cinema Paradiso about a movie theater, but it is about the love of movies as well.Cinema Paradiso captures what makes movies so special for someone like Toto or myself. For a person like him and me, movies are not just a couple of hours of entertainment. A story that a movie can tell can reach your soul, and move you in a way that nothing else can. In one scene, Toto is banned from the theater- his heart breaks, and my heart breaks for him.There is also the struggle with the Catholic church, where ""sexual"" content (even a kiss on the lips has to be removed from movies) and foul language can be deemed shocking. As a Lutheran myself, it can be hard to tell people that movies like The Birdcage or Pulp Fiction are among my favorites.I've tried putting to words what makes Cinema Paradiso so special, but I can't think of words that would suffice. In short, it is a film that celebrates what I love, and I see myself on the screen through the main character.All I can say otherwise is that you should see it for yourself. See what makes this movie, and all great movies, so special. If you ever want to know why a person like me loves movies so much, watch Cinema Paradiso and call it a day."
londhen,"Apr 10, 2006",10/10,"This movie will take you to a world of love ..emotion ..affection...believe.. and regret and yeah..lots of hahahahahaha also. Each and every scene speaks out its own importance. I have watched many Italian movies but this is the best. The transition of the scenes were superb. Without special effects and Hollywood spice...this movie makes a special space in your heart. You will feel so close to it. The kid Salvatore is so sweet, full of energy and mischief..and Afredo an epitome of love and affection who always care about betterment of others. The relation between the two is unforgettable!!...If you watch it..you will believe me.... See it or you regret.....!!!"
dbborroughs,"Apr 24, 2004",10/10,"The memory play of a movie of a film director who returns to his home for the funeral of his father figure, is one of the best films about movies ever made. Certainly its probably the greatest film about the love of film the medium has ever produced. It is not a flawless film, the romance in the latter half of the film isn't as strong as everything else and it weakens, some what the rest of the film. Even so I wouldn't change a frame of the film. I love the Ennio Morricone score, which is haunting even now three years since I last saw the film. If you love movies see this film, its a glorious tribute to life in the cinema, as maker, projector and most of all watcher. And I dare any truly diseased film lover to watch the film from start to finish and not cry at the end, that  one sequence says more about what movies do for us than anything else. SEE THIS MOVIE."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 9, 2023",10/10,"I do not generally give 9 or 10 stars to a film. It has to be a masterpiece for me to even consider those ratings. This film not only fits the bill as a masterpiece, it is one of my three top films of all time, along with Lawrence of Arabia and Lost Horizon. The film is perfect from beginning to end with an outstanding musical score by Ennio Morricone to boot. Tornatore is the logical successor to DeSica as one of the greatest Italian directors of all time. The script and characters are unforgettable. Some of the scenes are painfully beautiful. Phillipe Noret is outstanding and Salvatore Cascio is perfectly cast. The older Salvatore is also extremely well-played. This is a moviegoer's delight of a film, and the finale is one you will never forget for the rest of your life."
TheMovieSearch,"Sep 23, 2025",7/10,"Some films transcend the act of watching and become experiences-reminders of why we fall in love with cinema in the first place. Giuseppe Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso, originally released in 1988, is one such film. I had the rare chance to see it in theaters during a limited one-day re-release, going in with no expectations and little knowledge of what awaited me. What unfolded was a sweeping, emotional journey that was as much about growing up as it was about the enduring magic of the movies.At the center of the story is Salvatore, first seen as a boy raised under the shadow of a strict, abusive mother who sees cinema as frivolous and corrupting. Yet his world begins to shift when he meets Alfredo, the kindly projectionist at the local theater, who takes him under his wing. Through Alfredo, Salvatore finds refuge and purpose in the flickering light of the projector-a place where stories inspire, where joy overcomes hardship, and where the young boy learns that movies can be more than just entertainment: they can be life itself.The narrative gracefully follows Salvatore across stages of his life-from an inquisitive child discovering film for the first time, to an adolescent falling in love with Elena, a young woman with unforgettable blue eyes, to an adult grappling with ambition, memory, and loss. Tornatore balances these transitions with masterful pacing, blending romance, nostalgia, and tragedy in equal measure. The story even shifts tonal gears-at one point leaning into the devastation of a theater fire, evoking the intensity of a thriller, before returning to its tender, nostalgic rhythm.Visually, the film is gorgeous, full of painterly images that emphasize both the intimacy of small-town life and the grandeur of cinema as a collective experience. Ennio Morricone's iconic score heightens every emotional beat, from moments of youthful wonder to the aching melancholy of missed opportunities. The director's hand is steady, allowing the story to breathe while keeping the audience immersed in Salvatore's journey.That said, Cinema Paradiso isn't necessarily a film to revisit endlessly. At over two hours, its deliberately slow pacing-particularly in the opening act-may test the patience of modern audiences, especially those accustomed to fast storytelling rhythms. It is, in many ways, a ""one-time watch"" masterpiece: powerful, moving, and unforgettable, but best experienced with fresh eyes and an open heart rather than repeated viewings.Final Verdict: Cinema Paradiso is a love letter to cinema itself, a bittersweet tale of youth, memory, and the power of film to shape our lives. It may not be endlessly rewatchable, but its emotional resonance makes it essential viewing at least once in a lifetime. Beautifully directed, scored, and acted, it stands as one of the great cinematic tributes to the art form it celebrates."
GuyCC,"Jan 30, 2000",10/10,"""Cinema Paradiso"" is an amazing example of a film. If the fact that this film is spoken in Italian has kept you away from this film, disregard that. You'll soon forget about the subtitles as the world this movie draws you into its wondrous world.Anyone who has ever believed in the magic that a movie projector can create will feel a tinge of nostalgic joy as this film shows a love of movies, friendship, romance and life that is simply not represented in every film. The musical score is emotional and romantic, and adds even more to the story. The story itself fulfills every expectation that a hopeless romantic could hope for. The ending has been mentioned repeatedly in other comments, but it's as memorable as what everyone praises it is. It never fails to touch me.""Cinema Paradiso"" remains one of my favorite movies of all time. A very warm and nostalgic movie that touches a person in a way that few films can. A Must-See."

evanston_dad,"Mar 8, 2006",3/10,"I should have known to stay away from this movie when it was recommended to me by someone who wouldn't normally be caught dead watching a foreign language film. The best way to describe the kind of movie we're dealing with here is to say that if you liked ""Life Is Beautiful"" you will like ""Cinema Paradiso."" People who don't like foreign movies like this one because, if you take away the Italian subtitles, this film is as fake and schlocky as the worst piece of sentimental clap-trap churned out by the Hollywood myth-making machine. Not one single moment of this movie rang true for me. Subtlety was passed over on every occasion for the the most manipulative of cinematic tricks, and the love story that anchors the film is boring and completely missing any sort of sexual spark.I have a feeling that this movie is so beloved because people who in reality have pretty low-brow movie tastes can watch it and feel like they're cinematically smarter. A double feature of this and ""Life Is Beautiful"" might just be enough to make me lose hope in serious film forever.Grade: D"

A_FORTY_SEVEN,"Feb 18, 2021",10/10,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MUST-SEE MASTERPIECE ♠A movie about the love of movies. 'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso' or simply 'Cinema Paradiso' is spellbinding and absolutely heart-wrenching that is indeed a must-watch for any and every cinephile who has wondered what greatness in the medium truly means - well, look no further!I continue to be moved and deeply touched by this beautiful film from Italy, and I never tire of watching it. It shares the lives of Toto and Alfredo. It is about Toto who is a small Sicilian boy who loses his father in the Second World War and the older man Alfredo who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in a world of make-believe, movies and adventure. His dreams take him away from the small Sicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredo becomes for him a surrogate father, and the movies, his parallel existence.An emotional journey of relationships, it is iconic cinema of the finest level. Young Salvatore Cascio is a marvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. Phillipe Noiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow up with Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns to the small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral. It is the story of life, lost love, devotion, friendship, and family. It is unforgettable."
xxsheng0977,"Dec 6, 2007",10/10,"Five minutes after I have watched this movie,slowly calming down,I am now writing my feelings down and you must know how much I want to share it with everyone who loves this movie!The movie ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"" moved me greatly and the feelings are so strong that I can't even describe it.As they say,Beauty in terms of human words is meaningless.It is a movie about movie,a story about love and friendship and everything that a living human being can feel.A lovely and smart child ,living with a desperate mother waiting for her beloved husband at war,grew up with movies and finally became a famous director.He once loved a beautiful woman and the woman loved him too.However,as we all know,love is fragile.Love immediately comes to an end the moment it meets with marriage.So,is there a way that makes love eternal,always smiling at you when you open your eyes in the morning? I had guessed the beginning but I didn't get the ""fine"".That's why it's such a great movie.""The soldier stop waiting and go away at the very 99th day,when a day after he would probably have the princess' heart."" Maybe sometimes the best thing to do is to walk away,leaving the memory lasting forever.The last fifty minutes of the movie,particularly I think, is the best part.The climax comes when the man and the woman meet each other again thirty years after their inevitable miss.I cant help burst into tears cause I can't hold it anymore after 2 hours' living together with the excellent characters.It's not until this day,by this movie that I am successfully convinced A man can really hold his love for as much as 30 years!Life is like a movie,but it's harder."
Bored_Dragon,"Sep 27, 2021",10/10,"I don't know if this is one of the best films of all time, but it certainly is one of the most beautiful. From the camera, the direction, the sound, the acting, through the story it tells and the overall atmosphere, to the emotions it arouses, ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"" is simply mesmerizing. There is not too much drama, or humor, or mystery here, no tension, no brainstorming. But there is magic, magic of life, and magic of cinema, which intertwine in the heart of a boy. ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"" is a relaxing feast for the senses, which fills the heart and soul. It is full of symbolism, but it is so lovely that I do not want to analyze it in any way. Just turn off the lights, sit back comfortably and enjoy your own experience of this timeless masterpiece.10/10."
tfrizzell,"Jul 3, 2002",N/A,"Arguably the best foreign language film and definitely one of the greatest films of all time, ""Cinema Paradiso"" was quietly ignored by most in Italy when it was released in 1989. But those in the Academy saw it and it won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for that year in a no-brainer decision. The film starts with a phone call to famous director Jacques Perrin who learns that a dear friend of his has passed away from the Sicilian village where he spent his youth. What follows are flashbacks to his youth in Sicily and his friendship to a middle-aged man (the amazing Philippe Noiret) who happened to run the projector at the local movie theater. As a young boy (Salvatore Cascio) we see the character being given pieces of film that are cut from the movies due to what the local priest believes to be questionable material (people kissing). The nostalgia the young boy feels will directly create a genuine love and respect for the world's greatest medium. As he becomes an adolescent (Marco Leonardi) he experiences love and the possibility of war. Together he and Noiret go through many triumphs and tragedies together, but as much as everything changes the love for movies stays a constant always. Then there comes a time for the youngster to create his own destiny by leaving the village, but he takes more than anyone could ever imagine with him. ""Cinema Paradiso"" is excellent in every way possible. The story is arguably the best the cinema has ever experienced. It is easily the greatest homage to the power and love of movies. Giuseppe Tornatore's amazing direction and writing prove to raise the movie into a classic level. Ennio Morricone also created perhaps the best soundtrack a film has ever sported. There is nothing negative I can say about this magnificent movie. I love it and it is a film that is close to my heart. Beyond excellence. 5 stars out of 5."
ralphf52,"Jan 20, 2012",7/10,"This review concerns mainly the length of this movie.You should check run time before watching. The normal run time is 155 minutes but there is an international version mainly for Americans. They felt an American could not sit longer than 2 for a movie that didn't contain gunfire, car chases or tits. So they made an edited version for us that runs 121-124 minutes.I won't tell you exactly what is missing from the 2 hour version versus the 155 minute one, but just imagine watching Starwars and never learning Darth Vader was Luke's father.I just saying, if you're going to sit down and watch this movie, don't waste your time watching the 121 version."
behnamboogi,"Nov 18, 2024",6/10,"The script of the work depicts three parts of Toto's life in full chronological order; Childhood, youth and middle age. All these parts, while serving the big and general picture drawn by the filmmaker, can also be praised as works independent of each other. In the first part of the story, the audience gets to know Toto and all his interest in cinema, and in the second part, the story of his involvement with a love that is perhaps bigger, more dangerous, more burning and of course more exciting than his love for the gelatin films in the apparatchiks' room is depicted. . The final part is about both of these. About how reaching one of the interests has an effect on the other, and how small and simple creatures are, filled with love. About forgetting many things over the years and of course not forgetting the few things that polish or burn human existence forever. ""Cinema Paradiso"", as one of its best positive points, presents these contrasts and instead of forcing the audience to think about such bitter, sweet and strange things, it leaves you no choice but to think about them in the middle of its engaging narrative."
tom-1203,"May 20, 2005",2/10,"I really don't understand how this film got to be so famous and widely recommended. Two hours of clumsy sentimentality, in which nothing happens; a coming-of-age tale which tackles none of the problems of adolescence; characters who spend most of their time simpering over each other, yet they never bother trying to make them connect with the viewer; child acting so dreadful a wooden puppet with its strings cut would have been a better replacement...I resent the laziness of the film, they thought they could rely on its magic formula of nostalgia, saccharine and being foreign so they thought ""we don't need to bother building up any genuine feeling for these characters"". The story starts with an incorrigible young tyke (who i found extremely irritating) befriending the local projectionist. That's about all you need to know, what there is of a plot that develops from there doesn't really matter - it doesn't offer any interest, it doesn't put any of the characters in a dilemma, it all just dissolves into the steady flow of sap. With a plot development occurring every twenty minutes or so, thank God that we're anchored to the motif of the cinema by lengthy footage of people sitting around in it, making entertaining comments which make us just resonate with the warmth of the Italian people. More sugar anyone? Perhaps if I had a very fragile and elderly relative - I mean several centuries old - for whom trying to follow a plot that wasn't totally linear might get their blood up, who was too mentally impaired to take a character at anything but face value, for whom nuanced was just a seven letter word they weren't sure how to spell, then I might recommend to them Cinema Paradiso. Although the possibility that their heart might stop mid-way through, making me culpable for their death, would make me think twice. In fact I think I've got it, Cinema Paradiso might be a very good film to die to. Especially if you've been incapacitated waiting to die for a very long time, and would like to assure yourself that other people have been subjected to something of what you're going through.The Spirit of the Beehive (La Espíritu de la Colmena) is sometimes presented as Cinema Paradiso gone right, again centred on a cinema in a small town and a child's reaction to it. Sure it's slow, and makes no concessions to commercialism, but it is beautifully directed and in an understated way develops the viewer's empathy for the characters. Exactly the opposite of the crass tedium of the film I've just had the misfortune to see."
whpratt1,"Apr 30, 2006",10/10,"This film touched my very heart and soul from the very beginning to the end. As a young boy I went to the movie theater with my Mom every Friday afternoon at the Lefferts Theater on Liberty Ave., in Richmond Hill, N.Y. and grew to love all the films just as the young boy in this film. It is very easy to see why this film received so much wonderful praise and awards. There was plenty of funny comedy when the Roman Catholic Priest censored all the films shown in the theater that showed any form of kissing or physical contact between a male or female. It was a great down to earth film which words cannot describe fully, and can only be appreciated by people who love to escape into the World of Film and stories. The Actors, Producers and Directors out did themselves with this great masterpiece of JOY. By the way, when I attended those Friday afternoon showing of films with Mom, she also received a free plate or dish to go with her set of matching dinner dishes."
ahmed-samii,"Apr 21, 2024",10/10,"""Cinema Paradiso"": A Cinematic Journey into the World of Memories and ArtThe film ""Cinema Paradiso,"" produced in 1988 and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, is one of the remarkable cinematic works that leave a deep impact on the audience. Blending drama, romance, and nostalgia, the story offers a unique cinematic experience that takes viewers on an emotional journey filled with sentiments.The film tells the story of a boy named Toto, who grows up in a small village in Italy during the post-World War II era. Toto discovers his passion for cinema through his friendship with Alfredo, a worker at the local cinema theater, Cinema Paradiso. He learns the art and magic of cinema with Alfredo's guidance, whom he considers his mentor and spiritual guide.The story evolves over time, showcasing Toto's relationship with cinema and his career path as a filmmaker. At some point, Toto realizes that cinema is not just a means of entertainment but also a way to express deep emotions, memories, and human sentiments.From an artistic standpoint, ""Cinema Paradiso"" is distinguished by its exquisite cinematography and impactful music that enhance the story's effect on the audience. The film presents a series of beautiful cinematic scenes that embody the beauty of memories and the power of human connections.However, the true aspect that sets ""Cinema Paradiso"" apart is its ability to reunite viewers with their own memories, evoking various emotions and thoughts about life, love, friendship, and art.In summary, ""Cinema Paradiso"" is not just a cinematic work; it is a cinematic experience that leaves a mark on the hearts of the audience, much like it did with Toto and Alfredo in their magical world of Paradiso."

eloincinema,"Sep 25, 2025",10/10,"""Life is not what you see in movies, life is much harder""
I'm stuck in every moment of this movie, utterly mesmerized, regretting every day I delayed watching it. One of the greatest and most impactful movies I've ever seen. Every detail lingers in my mind, the people, the places, the music, the unique bond between Alfredo and Toto, the small moments, Elena, and finally... Paradiso. I'm certain I'll revisit it again, and I'll keep recommending it over and over. Cinema at its purest form."
m1_pierogi,"Apr 7, 2024",10/10,"I will start by saying that this is now one of my favourite films, and you will quickly find out why.Before I say anything: do not be deterred by the long runtime. The pacing is done so well that you will not feel it at all.It isn't as much how the film is made (even though that is still amazing), but what it is about, which I'd say is especially these things: life in general, how a love for something can bring about great dedication, and of course, traditional cinema. While this might be quite cliché, it does bring about a feeling for 'simpler' times, although only really at the start when Toto is a young boy and a little less when he is a teenager. In fact, this illusion is shattered when Toto returns for Alfredo's funeral - he says that he doesn't recognise anyone or anything and has experienced life to be hard and complicated, like Alfredo told him. His initial dream as a boy was to work the projector, but as he grows up, he realises he can do a lot more - and he does.Even the most minor of characters are well written. Each scene with the cinema is amazingly lively, punctuated by an interesting action done by some unnamed member of the village: the man who falls asleep with his mouth agape, the man who spits onto the people below him from the balcony, the man who went to see the film while leaving his sick wife in bed. With just one simple action, they are each given more life than if the camera were to pan to a variety of people simply watching the films, even if they were to each have a unique look on their faces. These scenes also add some excellent comedy that even seems realistic. No doubt, after years of being spat on, the men below would retort with what is at its nicest a chocolate mousse to the face. Of course, these kinds of action would be viewed as hooliganism if done in a cinema today, but this liveliness from all of the audience makes every one of these scenes enjoyable. The two biggest characters are Toto and his mentor Alfredo. Even though we know Alfredo isn't the smartest of people, he is kind and passionate when teaching Toto how to operate the projector. This is returned by Toto when he helps Alfredo as a teenager, but now he has also outgrown his status as a student, and is now more like a friend, while Alfredo is more like a father too.This film is also emotionally moving. You could go from scenes of deep sadness to intense comedy and your facial muscles feel compelled to move as if controlled by external strings. This is done throughout, although near the end there is more of a melancholy feeling, with nostalgia scattered in.Just to make this a fair review, I will include some things that were flaws. The clearest of these is the differences between the actors/actresses playing Toto and his mother. I'd say the best of the ones playing Toto was Salvatore Cascio as child Toto, he was incredibly skilled for his age. Another is a lack of focus on Toto's sister, who doesn't do much except hang around in a few frames and speak a few words even though she should have been much more influential in Toto's life. Arguably, this would have added extra runtime and maybe thrown off the pacing, but that's just something I noticed.Overall, this is a wonderful film that is emotionally moving, well made and certainly makes you think about life, and what you want to dedicate yourself to. I'm sure plenty of us could do with someone like Alfredo, or even just his advice."
aleowen,"Dec 10, 2025",10/10,"It's hard to describe a movie like this one, but I feel like I can best sum it up with this question: why can I not stop crying? I'm joking, but I'm also not. This film consistently hits you right in the feels on so many different levels, and you'll never know when or why you'll be crying next. Truly one of the greatest movies ever made, and I implore you to see it if you haven't. There is some theme in this film for everyone. Whether it be love lost, or leaving home, or the love of a father figure, this movie is truly special and absolutely in my top 5 ever."
anonymous124,"Mar 18, 2006",N/A,"Sometimes a film comes along that moves us in ways we don't see coming. Films like Imitation of Life, and Cinema Paradiso. I cried during Cinema Paradiso. There. I said it. Happy? I'm not going to say it again. And mind you, I didn't cry a lot, just a little bit at the end.Just try and watch it yourself and not cry. Because nostalgia is the saddest thing in the world.It has a happier beginning though. Cinema Paradiso begins sometime in the 40's in a small Italian town where the priest censors out kissing from all the imported Hollywood films (he calls it ""pornography""). The theater projector, Alfredo, is the one in charge of cutting the scenes out. And a little boy named Salvatore visits often to ask if he can run the projector himself and maybe steal a few of the edited clips. A bag of them in his room catches fire and nearly destroys his home. His mother instructs Alfredo never to let Salvatore near the theater again. At first, he does. But the boy's love of the movies brings him constantly back, and Alfredo's heart warms to the boy.In one of the more magical scenes in the movie, a small crowd gathers outside the theater when the theater is full, asking to see the movie before it gets too late for them to stay up. Salvatore watches as Alfredo removes the back of the projector and uses a mirror to reflect the movie onto the wall of someone's house, where the audience brings chairs and watches contently.Salvatore grows older. As a teen, he mainly runs the projector, (the theater is no longer censored by the priest - now it occasionally shows porn), takes photographs and falls for a wealthy new girl in town. The film is predictable in plot, but not predictable in the way it makes us follow it s storyline eagerly. The film is scored by Ennio Morricone (who reuses a theme or two from ""The Untouchables"") and is directed by Gieuseppe Tornatore. After a stint in the army, Salvatore comes home and finds the town lonely, desolate. Alfredo tells him: ""Living here day by day, you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people."" Alfredo tells him to leave and become a movie director...and never look back. Salvatore does so, and we cut to him in his 40's or 50's, when he learns that Alfredo died. And so he returns home.Some films are great because they are filled with nostalgia for a forgotten era. Like the popular teen films ""American Graffiti"" and ""Dazed and Confused"" which were homages to eras the directors hadn't forgotten when everyone else had. Cinema Paradiso is so filled with this nostalgia that you feel as if you had lived in this small Italian town yourself. You can almost smell the sweaty theater in summertime. The ""Cinema Paradiso"" screens Jason and the Argonauts, Humphrey Bogart films, and plenty of small, mostly forgotten Hollywood romances. It also screens joy, love, disappointment, sadness, nostalgia, friendship, laughter, and magic.""Cinema Paradiso"" is a film for the ages, and for all the ages."
frankde-jong,"Oct 6, 2023",7/10,"""Cinema paradiso"" is a film about (memories of) a youth in which cinema plays a major role. In this respect it resembles ""The last picture show"" (1971, Peter Bogdanovich) and ""The long day closes (1992, Terence Davies).The first two pictures are situated in a small town and film is not so much an escape from the real world, but much more a window on it (and this not only for the little guy but for the village as a whole).In the film the little boy grows up and leaves Sicily for mainland Italy. At the end of the film he returns to his native village to attend the funeral of the man who had been his father figure. Such visits are unavoidably a disaoppointment, in this instance not in the last place because the cinema turns out to be in total decay. Two years later director Giuseppe Tornatore made ""Stanno Tutti bene / Everybody's fine"" (1990). In this film it is not the son from mainland Italy who visits his father(figure) in Sicily but the father from Sicily who visits his children in mainland Italy. In both cases the visits turn out to be a deception.""Cinema paradiso"" won an Oscar for the best foreign language film. The film is all about nostalgia, but it treats this feeling in a very pleasant bittersweet way."
Soumyadeep9190,"Aug 4, 2025",10/10,"Cinema Paradiso isn't just a film. It's a memory you didn't know you had. Giuseppe Tornatore's masterpiece is a deeply moving tribute to the magic of cinema, memory, and the people who shape us. Set in a post-World War II Sicilian village, the story follows a young boy named Salvatore (Toto), who falls in love with movies and with life through the flickering screen of the village theatre, Cinema Paradiso.What begins as playful curiosity soon turns into a lifelong passion. We learn how films were projected back then - hand-cranked projectors, burning reels, celluloid magic. Through Alfredo, the old projectionist, Toto finds not just a mentor, but a father figure. Their relationship is filled with wisdom, warmth, and deep emotion.Toto also experiences first love, heartbreak, and departure. Alfredo, knowing what the world has to offer, tells him, ""Don't come back here,"" urging him to chase his dreams without looking back. That line, simple as it is, carries a lifetime's weight.Years later, Salvatore returns to his hometown and walks through the crumbling remains of Cinema Paradiso before it is demolished. That scene is more than nostalgic - it's devastating. It's as if a whole generation's memories are being torn down brick by brick. And finally, when he watches the reel Alfredo left for him - a montage of all the kisses and love scenes that were once censored - we're reminded why we fell in love with movies in the first place.Cinema Paradiso is about the beauty of letting go, and the ache of holding on. It's about childhood, love, loss, and the immortal glow of the projector's light.It's not just a film. It's cinema itself."
Philaura,"Aug 27, 2001",6/10,"Not as fabulous as so many reviewers brought me to expect.  I loved Malena and thought that Cinema Paradiso would be a good follow up choice as I had not seen it yet.  I found it difficult to really get behind the characters. Though cute, the young lead did not endear himself to me.  The cinematography was breathtaking, but the story fell short for me and it was slow.  I didn't make it to the end. Maybe it was my mood."
djbeardpaperclip,"May 11, 2025",3/10,"I watched the director's cut of this movie and like most director's cuts, the director's version spoils the film.It's as if they can't bear to leave deleted scenes on the cutting room floor. They add them back and story becomes convoluted, too long, and loses focus. In this case the point of the film is that the main character goes away to pursue his career having lost contact with the girl of his teenage dreams, and he never gets over her. In the revised version the hero rediscovers his lost love living in his home town now married with kids. After a snog in her car she goes back to her new life and all is resolved, which devalues his lifelong idealism.This revised version seemed to go on forever.It took too long to tell a story that didn't quite seem to know where it was going."
Xuelicious,"Aug 2, 2024",10/10,"Giuseppe Tornatore's classic Italian film enthralls the senses with its charming style and deft use of storytelling. The movie is set in a small Italian village where Salvatore, a little child, develops a strong love for movies thanks to his connection with Alfredo, the aging projectionist at the theater.Its capacity to arouse intense nostalgia and admiration for the history of cinema is what really sets it apart. Ennio Morricone's stirring score and the film's stunning visuals combine to create a magical and poignant ambiance.""Cinema Paradiso"" is a beautiful story with well-written characters that will make both young and elderly cry. The movie serves as a great reminder of why we adore going to the movies-it's a place where we can fantasize, think, and feel in addition to being entertained. A film such as ""Cinema Paradiso"" is an exceptional find that lingers in the mind long after the closing titles strike.This is more than just a movie; it's a love letter to the film industry and a poignant reminder that our most treasured moments are frequently the ones we spend with those we love most. ""Cinema Paradiso"" is a wonderful experience that should be enjoyed again and again."

I've seen many a foreign film and some have been classics. But what I witnessed with this film left me in tears. Much emotion throughout the film and at the near end a scene that leaves you weeping with joy and sadness at the same time. No spoilers here. Enjoy for yourself.

Facundo_Coria,"Jul 6, 2022",10/10,"Cinema Paradiso is one of those movies that mark a moment in life, in my case it was my childhood. I saw it without expecting too much in a small movie theater in my hometown, since then its soundtrack and its story were engraved in my head."
bulbulshakib,"Sep 10, 2023",10/10,"I don't know how to describe my feeling for this cinema. Yet, I'll try.Why do we watch cinema? To me, I watch cinema, because it has a story in it, a story of a different life more precisely. We get to live only one life for a short period on this planet. Its cinema that lets me explore different lives through its portrayal. I simply know that I love cinema and I love every bit of it with all my life.Cinema Paradiso is such a relevant film to me because I think I and Toto truly share the same love for cinema. Every cinema is like a new wonderful adventure. Like him, I too have memorized numerous dialogues of different films all over my life. Cinema simply works like magic on us.The film not only shows Toto and his love for cinema, it also portrays his complete life. It's also so much relevant, because it's an ordinary life. ""Life isn't like in the movies. Life... is much harder.""- Life lessons, taken from the cinema, just like Alfredo.I just finished watching this film and sat to write this review. It's getting longer than expected. I think this somewhat explains why it's so special. Stopping it here (may edit later)."
lago-38811,"Jan 12, 2024",10/10,"I rarely cry when watching films, but Cinema Paradiso invoked so many emotions upon viewing that I was helpless when it came to stopping the tears that rained from my eyes. This is a film about love, passion, and time. It beautifully and tragically conveys how life waits for no one, eventually, everything you hold dear becomes a ghost of the past, and all you have left are memories, as Toto's mother so eloquently puts it. I just viewed this with my elderly father, and I couldn't help but see myself in Toto and him in Alfredo, we share a love of films and have watched countless of them together throughout the years, so watching this really made me emotional.This truly is a masterclass in filmmaking, I've always considered that for a film to be great, it must have the ability to make you FEEL, and Cinema Paradiso does just that. I know this movie is hard to find, and if you're not fluent in Italian, it may feel like a turnoff to have to read subtitles the entire time, but I implore everyone who reads this review to watch this movie if the opportunity arises, the ending (which I won't spoil) will leave you stunned, and I guarantee that you will have a viewing experience that changes the way you view life, if ever so slightly."

Better but forever gone.""The cinema has become a memory""It's a story about love. But not just some representation, the movie has a life on its own.

RIK-22,"Mar 16, 2003",4/10,"So, 2003, and I hadn't seen Cinema Paradiso, then I noticed it was on TV, so I gave it a go.I heard a number of good things about this movie and tend to like more non main stream films more and more as I am getting older, but to be honest I was very disappointed with what I saw.Cliché after cliché.  Stupid unbelievable characters and then a fairly tame soap opera story.  Where was the depth, where was the profound message, basically there wasn't one.In the end this could have easily been produced by Hollywood.  There was a real sense of passion missing.  Toto wanted to be a film maker, but didn't really demonstrate his passion for films other than wanting to be a projectionist.  Tag on a predictable love story and a bit of sentimentality, that seemed out of place.  What was the big deal, yes people liked the cinema house, but I can't say they felt any true love for it.  Then at the end you see this scene of great nostalgia, which seemed out of place.I'm sorry I didn't like it, I genuinely thought I would, but the film really missed any maturity and lacked any real sentiment."
leoss-32707,"Jul 17, 2020",10/10,"I can admit that i had big expectations, but not this big. Cinema paradiso has without a doubt served a spot in my top 10 movies ever. Maybe not because of the storyline itself, but the storytelling is just outsanding. The score by the late Ennio Morricone just makes this picture something extroudinary. A must watch for any film-lover, without a doubt."
Budozanshin1,"Oct 18, 2025",10/10,"""Cinema Paradiso"" is a sweet, sensitive, melodic piece of nostalgic storytelling. As a moviephile I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies that I've ever seen. In it are humor, pathos, found and lost love, family, friendship, heart tugging sentimentality and, fond recollections of life and growing up. Oh, and the genuine love of movies. The actors are all top notch and bring a robust realism to their respective roles, especially the actors who played ""Alfredo"" and ""Toto,"" respectively, especially ""Toto"" as an impish, precocious little brat. I found the historical references interesting too...Post WWII Italy, the missing Italian soldiers, Communism and poverty, none of which was in the least bit heavy handed. There are those that may feel that the pacing is slow and I agree. However, for this type of movie and this particular movie the movie moves as it should. The director did a good job on keeping all on track."

Abhijoy-Gandhi-WG05,"Jan 7, 2004",N/A,"CINEMA PARADISO: THE NEW VERSION / Italia 2002  (3.5 STARS)November 2003: While I agree that the New version does bring about the closure that the original lacked I feel that some of the magic of the film is lost with the telling of the whole story - I therefore prefer the original version for the way it tugged at the heartstrings in the face of an unknown and lost world. . Mise-en-scene: It was delightful to watch Toto in scenes that were new - I had grown so fond of him that watching him in new situations was like bringing alive a now dead character and seeing him do things he hadn't ever done. . I didn't enjoy the sex scenes - they took away from the nostalgia and the innocence of the flashback - may be this is cultural but I thought the original suggestions/subtlety was better than the explicit display. . It was heart-wrenching to see Toto's girl as an old lady - the irony of how they missed each other was very moving. However the old lady didn't quite have the charm of the young girl - and her character lacked the same conviction - though her lovemaking was a bold move given her place in life. . The part where the narrative was furthered compellingly was in the director's revealing to us just what an impact Alfredo had had on Toto, when he chose to separate the two lovers - the impact of that decision ultimately made the difference to Toto's life . I preferred the Old version for Toto's old character - he spoke less, was more reflective, had more aura. While the latest version makes him more human, and we can better understand his character, I feel that in sharing his vulnerabilities the director also makes him more common-place  - the old guy was almost mystical."
august_sanders,"Feb 16, 2025",7/10,Nuovo Cinema Paradiso has good message about how the people and films around us shape who we are. I enjoyed seeing Salvatore's life and how his relationship with Alfredo grew. The ending is by far the best part as you get to see Toto reunite with his love. To add to that the romance is also one of my favorites parts and I love how they leave it at the end.The sound track is great as well as it sets the somber tone and is almost consistently playing without interfering with the movie. The visuals also hold up quite well for a 40 year old movie.I watched the longer version and felt that I may have enjoyed the shorter one more as this version felt very spread out and had a few filler scenes but honestly not that big of an issue.A few complaints that I have are a honestly dull first act due to them needing to setup the characters and get you immersed they seemed to forget that the plot of a movie cannot be watching other people watch a movie. I also wish that it wasn't in Italian but that might just be a skill issue on my end. (It was really hard to find a sub for this)Overall would recommend if you enjoy the film process and speak Italian. However this is not a movie that I would consider rewatching or recommend to anyone under the age of 20.
JaydoDre,"Dec 4, 2024",6/10,"Cinema Paradiso leads us through the life of a man by the name of Salvatore and shows the role cinema played in his life and the lives of the inhabitants of the little Sicilian town of Giancaldo. We see the town's cultural and technological transformation through the decades after the war.Some elements of the film work well, like the heartwarming portrayal of the friendship between Salvatore and his mentor Alfredo, and the depiction of local culture in post-war Italy. However, the film falters when it introduces the love story between Salvatore and Elena, a local girl. It is sappy and simplistic. At one point, our lovers are laying on the stones in the pouring rain as they kiss. It looks very romantic, until you realise that this would be extremely uncomfortable and makes no sense.As the story returns to the present day, Salvatore goes back to Giancaldo and the love of his youth is, of course, still there. This is when the movie becomes overly sentimental and a bit boring, as it refuses to wind down yet struggles to find meaningful material. The film is almost 3 hours long, but feels far longer, because the shots are drawn-out and the pacing comes to a crawl, especially towards the end. Cinema Paradiso just refuses to finito when it should.With the themes being what they are, the film will appeal to those interested in Sicilian post-war culture and specifically in the art of filmmaking (Giuseppe Tornatore's love for cinema is probably far greater than yours or mine). Without a strong connection to these themes, what remains is the relationships of Salvatore with his mentor and the love story with Elena, which may not be compelling enough to sustain interest.The standout performance is Alfredo, played by Philippe Noiret. As for Salvatore himself, you can be the judge. A good chunk of the film is set during his childhood, where the role is given to the boy actor by the name of Salvatore Cascio and this kid was probably encouraged to overact. His delivery can be quite irritating but also endearing at times. The teenage Salvatore is alright, but his performance doesn't stand out.The cinematography is warm and cozy, just like Italy itself. Ennio Morricone's score is a major contributor to the film's emotional weight and is recognizable, with its dramatic longing strings. The main theme lingers in the mind. Everything is a bit melodramatic, but that's Italy for you.Cinema Paradiso is a nostalgic celebration of cinema mixed with a sentimental and simplistic celebration of love. If you like the idea of embedding yourself in the culture of the time and don't mind the simple love story, then this film makes for a rewarding experience, but if you are just an average movie goer expecting a compelling story, this film may bore you, particularly in its last act. There is apparently a shorter version of this film. While the critics tend to recommend the full version, the shorter version might provide a more impactful experience."

richard-1787,"Nov 10, 2017",10/10,"I first saw this movie back in 1988 in Italy, when it came out there. Back here in the States, I must have seen it several dozen times, in theaters and on VHS tape. It is not a ""feel good movie"" - thank God - but it always overwhelmed me emotionally.I saw it again tonight on TCM, for the first time in 20-some years, and found that I still remembered many of the lines. I almost always knew what was coming next, what would be said next.And I found that I still find it profoundly moving.It is the story of a man who grows up in love with two people, the projectionist at the movie theater in his small Sicilian town, and later, a beautiful young woman who arrives for a few years in his town and then leaves.Both, in different ways, leave him searching for love in a very idealized form, a form that he cannot, for obvious reasons, find in his adult life.And so he goes from one empty relationship to another, all the while making what are evidently very successful movies, though we never find out what they are about.When he comes back to his small town, after having been away many years, he sees how small-town life in rural Italy has changed. But he does not really seem to learn how his fascination with romantic movies has impeded his own emotional development.That sounds very dour, which this movie is not. It is, in fact, a warm-hearted and wonderful film about life in small-town Italy after World War II.I cannot recommend it too highly. It is one of the most profoundly moving films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.A note: the 124-minute version shown on TCM tonight, which is the version I saw many times here in the States in theaters and on VHS, is substantially shorter than the original Italian version, which was at one point released in this country as the ""director's cut."" I haven't seen that in years, but as I recall, it made certain scenes in the movie more understandable. It's worth searching out, as I recall, but I will admit that I found parts of it too slow."
SnoopyStyle,"Nov 10, 2015",8/10,"Famed film director Salvatore Di Vita has become jaded and unloved. Even his mother has difficulty finding him. He recalls his childhood nicknamed Toto in a post-war small town. The priest would cut out all the kisses in the movies. Projectionist Alfredo at the Cinema Paradiso becomes Toto's mentor. A film catches fire burning down the cinema and blinding Alfredo. Toto runs in to save Alfredo's life. The cinema is rebuild and Toto becomes the new projectionist. As a teen, he would find love and lose love. The adult Salvatore returns to town to attend Alfredo's funeral. The cinema is demolished. In Alfredo's home, he finds an unexpected film reel.I love the childhood Toto. The kid is precocious and charming. His chemistry with Philippe Noiret is wondrous. The teenage years are less kind. The teen Toto isn't as charismatic and the teenage love isn't anything special. Then there is the final film clips. It is some kind of movie magic. I actually cried a little when the film gets going with that beautiful music. It is incredible powerful and poignant."
Doylenf,"Apr 29, 2006",8/10,"This is such a difficult film to describe in words because all of it is heartfelt emotion. However, it must be noted that the three central performances are beyond reproach: the child Salvatore (played with rascally charm by Salvatore Cascio), the brusque projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) and the adolescent Salvatore (Marco Leonardi). All three are masterful in creating the viewer's emotional attachment to these characters. The relationship between the tough but tender projectionist and the little boy is what carries the first half of the film and it continues when the boy becomes a lovesick adolescent. It is only the last half of the film that seems to drag a little with scenes of the adult Salvatore (Jacques Perrin)contemplating returning to the little village where he grew up in the shadows of the movie theater and those wonderful silver shadows on the screen.All of the scenes involving the movie theater and its rowdy audiences are wonderfully realized with crude humor and insight into the kind of characters who thrived on whatever entertainment films could offer. Ennio Morriconne's music is charming throughout, always totally in keeping with the images on screen and the intentions of the story.By all means, well worth seeing and treasuring as one of the great foreign films to come out of the 1980s. I watched the abbreviated version on TCM which comes to a little more than two hours and is the version shown in the U.S. theatrically."
sugarplum116,"Apr 26, 2000",N/A,"Cinema Paradiso is in one word, a masterpiece.  It has been a long long time since I have seen a film that has touched me on such a primitive emotional level.  Certainly, it manipulates your  feelings and glorifies American cinema.  What Cinema Paradiso does is remind you of what cinema was originally intended to do; view film as simply an escape from reality. It does so in a way that people, both young and old, male or female, Canadian or Italian can relate to.  In summary, Cinema Paradiso is a simple, beautiful film."
Degree7,"May 3, 2013",7/10,"Passion inspires great art in a young Toto, but as his age shifts, so does his perspective on his life machinations in a small Sicilian community. With the help of the local theatre projectionist, Alfredo, he is able to recognize his potential and move out into a wider world. But what keeps this film from simply being a sentimental ode to Italian cinema, is the reflection of a much older Toro coming to terms with the sacrifices he has made to become the man he is. Were they mistakes? Or are his past regrets still threatening to cloak his accomplishments as an individual?Despite a somewhat obtrusive score by Ennio Morriconne, this film sends a strong message about life reevaluation, and how past decisions can segue into the present, in often unexpected, but beautiful ways. A small gem of a film."
paulclaassen,"Dec 20, 2019",4/10,"I've wanted to see this film for so long, so was very excited when the opportunity arrived for me to watch it. Sadly, though, I was disappointed.I now firmly believe the reason for the film's high acclaim, is due to the nostalgia it contains. This must be a feast for movie buffs who enjoy yesteryear's films, reminiscing the clips from countless films.As for the story, it really wasn't anything special. The friendship between the projectionist and the young boy, was a wonderful, touching story. Alfredo is a very likable character, and we feel for the young boy with his back story. There were some beautifully shot scenes. However, after the halfway mark, the film plunges into boredom, becoming a soppy love story that never pays off. It became sentimental and uninteresting. The young boy had become a hapless, idiotic fool, running after a girl and disregarding everything else in the process.The final moment was probably supposed to give me goosebumps, but by that time I didn't care for the character anymore. This is purely for sentimentalists and the nostalgic."
Embley,"Jun 18, 2000",10/10,"this film is so lovely, i have seen it countless times and it always makes me laugh and cry..  and it isn't easy to make me do either..  i think the young boy and the old projectionist are perfection.  but you have to see it several times to catch a lot of the humour..  see it see it see it.."
Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Aug 29, 2020",10/10,"Cinema Paradiso is concentrated proof that Italy's love for cinema is not only passion for an art form, but a way of life that's transformative in the best possible ways and can can change the human heart for the better. This film is a fantastic trip into the world of 35mm cinema and its rippling effects throughout Europe post-World-War-Two.It's a great slice of 1980s cinema that you'd expect Hollywood to have remade a dozens times by now: thankfully this is not the case here and this movie is an experience that remains untainted by America's 'remake syndrome'. It's a love story about a little Italian town and it's theatre: the Cinema Paradiso. And like the films they watch the audience themselves all have their own stories to tell. It all centres around Alfredo's movie theatre and his raising of Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita through the magic of movies via 35mm-cinema projection.It's a coming-of-age story about cinema's wisdom and charm rather than the cynicism of the film industry: it's got a heart-warning vibe to it throughout its two-hour+ runtime (depending on whether you've seen the theatrical, or the near-three-hour extended, cut of the movie) and it's one any self-professed cinephile MUST watch!It's an example of European cinema that's artistically expressive and surprisingly accessible to more mainstream audiences. It's a zeitgeist movie of the 80s. 5/5 stars."
albertovico,"Dec 30, 2005",10/10,"Tornatore had a genial idea. He would never have expected such a success worldwide. During the Cannes and international awards he was sincerely surprised. It's very very difficult to get such an international recognition with the poor budget of Italian movies in recent years.What made it big was sincerity, honesty and passion. It's not just another Hollywood billion sponsored movie. This is sincere and true.Sicily can be Australia, USA or Germany as true people share the same feelings all over the world.This movie was not ""built"" but just the passion of feelings of the actors and all of the team. They did just follow their heart, without thinking about money. This is why this movie had such a great international success.I much prefer these movies like this made in Italy, with an heritage of 2500 years of culture, then ""king kong"", a pure matter of speculation and multimillion special effects with a multimillion marketing budget to promote it. I prefer passion to money... sure this movie will give you much more true feelings and brain food. Please, if you have the time rent it. You will not be disappointed... it's in the top 100 movies of all time on IMDb, with an 8.4 rating (based on more than 16000 member evaluations)!"
Darkest-Angel,"Jan 8, 2006",10/10,"I am not exactly that old. I'm not exactly a film buff or anything, but I watch films that my dad brings and tells me are good. Sometimes my sister has something interesting to offer too. When my dad showed me this film, I thought; 'Oh dear, another one?' but proceeded to watch it with him.It pulled me into a world where dreams can come true. The film was fascinating, I watched it with the kind of reverence children save for The Teletubbies. I watched the film and it opened within me a new kind of person, someone who won't give up, someone who is constantly trying to get better at something. But the part of the film that struck me most was the part when Toto returns home and goes into his bedroom and we see his first film reel, the pictures of the young Toto and Alfredo. It's like Alfredo was almost a father figure for Toto. That's the only part of the film that made me cry.Another similar film I saw recently was ""A Touch Of Spice"", a Greek film that my sister brought home. It is also very heart-wrenching film, much like Cinema Paradiso, but with a different storyline. I highly recommend this film; but I won't talk about it any more and spoil it! Cinema Paradiso is honestly one of the best films I have ever seen, something Hollywood has really got to learn from.The thing that makes a good film is emotion, not special effects or famous actors or actresses."
Sylviastel,"Jul 21, 2014",10/10,This film is one of the greatest Italian films of all time. Cinema Paradiso was a place in a fictional town. Salvatore Di Vita has become a successful film maker in Rome and hasn't been home in 30 years. Alfredo was the projectionist for the cinema. He befriends young Sal nicknamed Toto. Alfredo becomes more like a father figure to Toto since his father died in World War II. We watch Sal's life as reflects upon the loss of Alfredo. The film has a great cast and crew. It's absolutely heartbreaking by the end. The cast is superb with Jacques Perrin as the older Sal. I don't cry but I did today. It takes a lot for me to cry. Ennui Morricone provides the magic musical score. He is a genius. The original score is breathtaking and unforgettable.
AleksandrBelenko,"Mar 21, 2019",10/10,"Currently is placed on number 55 of top 250 movies.This is such an impressive movie. Well, Italians are one of two European nations, who produce amazing films. Others are French.
New Paradise Cinema has a sweet and touching story about a boy with a passion to cinematography.
I would love to admit the portrayal of conservative catholic views that censor even a kiss.
The comedy is well done. It is light and soft, as I mentioned earlier, only Frenchmen film such stories. The situations feel real, as they would happen in our lives.
This movie has wonderfully done drama, it doesn´t give you a depressive state, yet you can feel sorrow.
And bittersweet irony concludes the spectre of emotions that film provides.
I think this movie is great for every age. The simple story that present to the viewer important life lesson. And that is the ultimate beauty of Nuovo Cinema Paradiso."
tana_ricky,"Jun 11, 2006",N/A,"i saw Cinema Paradiso about a decade ago. Truly, it is one of the treasures of cinema. i saw many of the classics -- Godfather 1& 2, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone w/ the wind, psycho, etc. I saw all the recent Oscar best pictures -- Gladiator, American beauty, chicago, beautiful mind, Shakespeare in love, crash -- and even those nominated.But for me, none has as much emotional power and heartfelt sentiment as Cinema Paradiso. The director obviously is inspired and imbued his film with genuine love and passion.i have seen thousands of Hollywood, filipino, European, hongkong, Japanese, bollywood Indian & other films but none has touched me as deeply as this low-budget Italian movie. The film has no explosions, no special effects or computer-generated effects, no expensive battle scenes. It is all heart, all passion, all emotions.There is something in the story of a young boy who fell in love with the movies, grew up to be a wealthy & famous director but who made a lot of mistakes and regretted them, which is truly touching. the movie is bathed in nostalgia.Malena, made by the same director Guiseppe Tornatore, is also wonderful but could not equal Cinema Paradiso. Cinema Paradiso should be seen by all who love movies and its magic."
buckmann-1,"Feb 18, 2017",6/10,"Italian movie, with all the lyricism and family life/conflicts, some comedy, typically for this culture. Sicilia is a nice place and the movie let you enjoy the landscapes. The characters are well developed. Alfredo is first class, the priest and the owner of the Piazza also. The plot, beside the originality, is not specially good and develops very slow. Sadness is always present. But... The timing is awful. No reason for such a long movie. They are no stuff to maintain your attention during 3 hours. It could be much better if a Director Cut put it to 100 minutes, no more. Its boring. The advises from Alfredo are unrealistic and the broken contact between the lovers hard to understand. I rate it with 6 points."
luisguillermoc3,"Mar 17, 2010",10/10,"After inroads into the environment of the mobsters with ""The Professor"", and before making this touching human portrait entitled ""Everybody's fine"", the Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore gave birth screens one of the most beautiful films ever with ""Cinema Paradiso"", a homage to the cinema and never forget the friendship.The film tells the story of a young altar boy fascinated with the celluloid and a veteran projectionist prone to spoil. Set in a rustic atmosphere, where it is easy to recognize the typical characters of any province, the ratio of Alfredo and Toto, contains the nuances and leads to an intense and profound friendship.With absolute sobriety and the most charming comic relief, Tornatore taking shape that relationship that will last until the inevitable decline of the old projectionist (Philippe Noiret magnificent), but that will endure in memory of Salvatore di Vito, little Toto become, at present, a prominent filmmaker.""Cinema Paradiso"" is a pleasant and meaningful childhood memory. A profoundly tender and nostalgic film with which it is easy to identify without restrictions, especially if like Toto we have carried since childhood, or blood clutching a fascination for film.The film was winner of Golden Globe, Oscar for Best Foreign Film and was a Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. A pity that the Italian cinema still suffers from the crisis that is stifling the past several decades.Movies like ""Cinema Paradiso"", remind us that Italy always gave us one of the best filmmakers in the world."
witster18,"Oct 8, 2012",10/10,"I knew the film was held in high regard, and I went in with very high expectations.This is an incredible piece of cinema.The score/theme-music is perhaps Ennio Morricone's(Untouchables Etc) best, and that's saying something. It's only one of many fantastic characteristics that tie this whole thing together.""Cinema Paradiso"" seems like such a simple story, but nothing about the questions it asks about fate, love and friendship are simple.And that's what I really love about this story. It's realistic, heartbreaking, and uplifting all at the same time. The audience mimics the characters here. There are many things that you would like to change. How many times have you asked yourself if you would do it differently if you had it all over to do again? Could you? No. It's the way it happened. It's life. You can only piece together the moments of joy and happiness and reflect... hope.what a fantastic film!You'll like this if you liked: A Very Long Engagement(not quite as excellent), Hugo(a clear notch below and it borrowed a ton from this), or Cast Away(not as good, very similar themes in both films' last 30 min).this review is of the 3hr director's cut, not the theatrical release... I couldn't imagine it any other way. Will view it though.Late Edit(after viewing the shorter, original theatrical version): IMO.. the extended cut is far more powerful. The love story and the journey of the lead character is more complete, and ultimately, I find the extended cut to be much better. That's the version I would recommend to the first time viewer - although I seem to be in the minority on this subject."
Mnemosyne15,"Mar 18, 2020",10/10,"The emotions in this movie are especially sincere and never give up waiting and pursuit. I personally like the end of the film: more people watch the childhood showcasings, one by one, and one by one, the ""you are still so beautiful"" in my head keeps echoing. Appreciation of the director's handling, artistic expression and shock are very exciting. In addition, I saw old people, young people, and children watching movies together. The feeling was different. I felt it myself, so I understood the meaning."

ElGerazzz,"Nov 14, 2015",6/10,"There's really not a lot in this movie that impressed me. The movie is decent and the final act is fantastic. But aside from that you wont find anything that will totally blow you away. Not a single scene, shot or piece of soundtrack will make you think ""Ive never seen that before"". If you enjoy making films then you will find yourself identified with this, but that doesn't make it a masterpiece like everyone says it does.The relationship between Alfredo and the boy never feels natural. He didn't seem to teach him that much or show him a lot of appreciation, yet we are told that they love each other. All the other relationships in the movie are the exact same, never quite completed. The good soundtrack and some very good scenes make up for all the dullness enough to give it a 6.So if you say this is one of your favorites movies Im fine with that, but you shouldn't really call it a great movie. OK and enjoyable at times, but nothing else."
ackstasis,"Jul 18, 2008",8/10,"Filmmakers often possess a deeper passion that is noticeably reflected in their work. However, there is one passion that all directors inevitably share, and that is for cinema itself. Films like Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)' and, more recently, Michel Gondry's 'Be Kind Rewind (2008),' exhibit such affection towards movies and movie-making that no film-lover can help but like them. In 1988, Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore released 'Nuovo cinema Paradiso / Cinema Paradiso,' his personal ode to the magic of movies and the humble small-town cinema. After a poor local performance, the film was sheered down to 123 minutes (from 155 minutes), and subsequently went on to win both the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar. In 2002, a 170-minute director's cut {marketed in the United States as 'Cinema Paradiso: The New Version'}, which restored all of the original future, was released into theatres. As the director's cut was the only version to which I had ready access, this was the one that I watched for the first time. The director's cut is notable in that it greatly expands on Alfred's role in Toto's life and career.In the hustle-and-bustle of modern Rome, acclaimed film director Salvatore ""Toto"" Di Vita (Jacques Perrin) returns home to a sad message from his elderly mother: ""Alfredo has died."" During the night, the man reflects on his childhood, when, as a bright and fervent young boy (played by Salvatore Cascio), he used to frequent his small town's local cinema, where the friendly projectionist, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) taught him, however reluctantly, the tricks of the trade. Flash forward several years, and Toto is now a mature and intelligent teenager, falling for the first (and only) time into the throes of young love. Though I have not seen the shortened theatrical version, from what I've been able to gather, the story doesn't delve too deeply into the adventures of the adult Toto. In the director's cut, most of the additional running time is dedicated to his home-town return, as he is drawn almost overwhelmingly into the regretful ghosts of his past. These sequences are, of course, not without interest, but Tornatore is at his strongest in the first act, with Toto as an impressionable young boy immersed in the joy of cinema.Philippe Noiret is wonderful as the warm and occasionally brusque film projectionist, and his interactions with Toto (especially young Salvatore Cascio) develop into a powerful father-son relationship. The director's cut intriguingly suggests that Alfred deliberately mislead Toto about Elena (Agnese Nano, later Brigitte Fossey) in order to preserve his chances of succeeding with his #1 love of all, movies. Alfred suspected that, had Toto married Elena, he would never have been able to become an accomplished film director  as a beloved father figure for the boy, he made the difficult decision that Toto could never have made. The ethical complications of Alfred's decision are problematic, but one can at least follow his logic, and his motives, however misguided, were certainly well-intended. At the film's end, as the adult Toto is doubting his love for cinema, his passion is reassured with a wonderful montage of the romantic moments that the town's prudish priest had once sliced from every film to be screened in his theatre. This is the magic of cinema. It's not just the films themselves, but also the flood of personal memories that accompanies each forbidden screen embrace."
dmayo-911-597432,"Sep 14, 2013",6/10,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***It would be best to see this film without knowing how warmly it was welcomed by critics and viewers at the time, or how many people still take it to their hearts. It does hold many charms in its details, but when it tries to give us a story of Life and Love it becomes banal and contrived. It also takes an oddly careless approach to the aging of its characters.Nuovo Cinema Paradiso opens with a framing story in which a middle-aged man hears that someone named Alfredo has died in his hometown and begins recalling his childhood. In the flashbacks that form the main body of the film, the setting is a town in Sicily in the decade following World War II. A small boy is irresistibly drawn to the local cinema, a world of enchantment, and to its projection booth, the heart of that world. He befriends the projectionist, Alfredo. Alfredo discourages the boy, Toto, from following in his footsteps as a projectionist and eventually encourages him to pursue his love of movies on a grander scale. We're soon prepared to learn that the grown Toto who is recollecting these things has become a famous director.In the first phase of the flashbacks, we follow little Toto in his childish peccadilloes while following the community in its avid response to movie magic (a funny exception being the gritty social realism of post-war Italian cinema, which proves as impenetrable to Sicilians as to much of the world beyond). This phase ends with the cinema destroyed by fire and Alfredo rescued by Toto but blinded for life.The Toto of the second phase is apparently in his late teens, perhaps twenty by the end of the flashback. Childish peccadilloes have given way to amateur film-making, running the projector at the rebuilt cinema, and love at first sight with a girl whose social position poses an obstacle -- in effect, a princess. As always, the life of the community and that of the film are centered on the shared joys of escape in a darkened cinema. Toto's personal life is disrupted by a period of military training, after which he finds that he can't pick up where he left off. He loses touch with Elena, his love, who has moved away. Finally, he takes Alfredo's advice and leaves town himself to make his way in the world.Very well, but it's unbelievable that he then absolutely neglects his mother for thirty years, even to the point of not returning her phone calls, although they were on good terms when he left. The only reason seems to be that the film requires a complete break with home so that the middle-aged Toto can feel he's stepping into a past world when he returns for Alfredo's funeral. Still more unbelievable is the casting of characters at different ages. The twentyish Toto is distinctly short, but the fiftyish Toto towers over everyone else in the funeral procession. Conversely, his mother changes from a tall young woman to a tiny old one. Then there is the aging of characters who are played by the same actors throughout. Alfredo's wife, who was middle-aged in the first place, only turns gray-haired and gray-faced while the transformation (by casting) of Toto's younger mother rivals that of the queen in Snow White. Indeed, slapping gray paint on actors -- while removing an obvious hairpiece from one -- is all the movie magic Tornatore offers in the framing story. Is he trying to tell us that he has decided to wash his hands of film-making as a labor of love?The many delightful moments in Nuovo Cinema Paradiso are really just so many vignettes strung together in the abrupt, sometimes bewildering manner of the 1980s. To the extent that these moments achieve a unified effect, they suggest the benign human comedy of Rene Clair. Yet they are mixed with stink-bombs of bad taste that would have puzzled Clair as to this director's intent. That, too, is a mark of the 1980s.It may be best to look for the appeal of this film in the ways in which it differs from most other films of the 1980s and many since. It does come down on the side of benign human comedy. It does cherish the magic of Golden Age film-making, even as that magic slips through its fingers. It does become an oasis of entertainment if you come upon it in a personal desert of dissatisfaction with films generally. The trouble is that if you have had the good fortune to drink from the springs of Rene Clair and other masters, Nuovo Cinema Paradiso turns out to be a mirage."
ThomasDrufke,"Sep 4, 2015",9/10,"Certain films transcend the pages of the script and the screen and become something greater. Certain films become something that turns your eyes from just watching it play out, to experiencing the film through your entire emotional state. I guess what I mean is that Cinema Paradiso to me meant more than just another film. It made me feel unlike I ever had before. It's one of the best films for pure film buffs. Not only is it a deeply emotional experience but it's also a joy to watch.It tells the story of Toto, a famous filmmaker who looks back on his time growing up at a local movie theater and his deep bond with the theaters projectionist, Alfredo. There are plenty of great unlikely relationships in movies but none really moved me as much as Toto and Alfredo's. Even with the actor who played Alfredo having to develop chemistry with three different actors who portrayed Toto, it works. There's something to be said about that person in your life, family or not, who inspires you to become who you are and teaches you the do's and don'ts of life. Alfredo was that to Toto. As much as I loved that aspect of the movie, I was surprised to see just how well they were able to tell the history of film as well. Whether it was the film that burned, the excessive censorship, or all of the famous movie plus and references throughout, it was a masterful directing job.The film is also complimented by an all time great score and main theme. Most notably as Toto goes through his memories back at the Paradiso. A subtle romance story with Toto and Elena is also worth mentioning. It's just one of those movies that impacts you more than you think. I don't why it took me so long to actually watch the film. It's a great bittersweet story.+Father-son bond+Perfect for die-hard movie lovers+Score+Balances everything really well9.6/10"
WaliedNassier,"Oct 14, 2024",10/10,"Cinema Paradiso is a timeless masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of cinema itself. This beautifully crafted film captures the essence of nostalgia, love, and the bittersweet nature of growing up. The story of young Salvatore and his passionate relationship with the local cinema is a profound reminder of the impact films have on our lives and memories.The direction by Giuseppe Tornatore is nothing short of brilliant, weaving together rich visuals and an emotionally resonant score by Ennio Morricone that lingers in your heart long after the credits roll. The performances are extraordinary, especially by Philippe Noiret as Alfredo, whose wisdom and warmth offer guidance to the impressionable Salvatore. Their bond embodies the mentor-mentee relationship, highlighting the power of friendship and the influence of art.What truly sets Cinema Paradiso apart is its ability to evoke a deep emotional response. I found myself laughing, crying, and reminiscing about my own childhood experiences in the darkened theater. The film beautifully illustrates the transient nature of time and the fleeting moments we cherish, reminding us to hold on to our dreams and the people we love.Every frame of this film is a love letter to cinema, celebrating its ability to transport us to different worlds. It's not just a story about a boy and his love for movies; it's about the universal experience of growing up, loss, and the enduring power of memories. Cinema Paradiso is a film that speaks to the heart and soul of anyone who has ever experienced the magic of the movies.This film deserves every bit of its acclaim, and I wholeheartedly give it a perfect 10 out of 10. It's a cinematic experience that will stay with you forever, a true treasure of world cinema."
aggelilaschar,"Mar 1, 2020",10/10,I just cant express with words how much this movie means to me . There is something about it that moves me to the point that every time that I just hear the beautiful score by ennio moricone I burst out crying like a baby.
Differcow,"Aug 24, 2011",10/10,"I'll start by saying that I am a film lover and a hopeless romantic, one of those weirdos that would be happy to sit on their couch with popcorn and a movie all day. Now as a film fanatic, I see my share of terrible movies (Knight and Day). I see my share of mediocre movies (Kindergarten cop. I see my share of good movies (Pope of Greenwich Village). Then, sometimes, I see a movie that shakes me to my foundations. Usually, I watch a movie and if I enjoy it I'll say so and maybe mention it to some friends. However, when I see a movie like Cinema Paradiso, the next day I find myself sitting in my room, obsessively thinking about and Googling it. This movie (and of course its soundtrack) have haunted me from the day I first saw it (maybe eight months ago). I won't give anything away, but watch this movie! That said, I would like to make one thing clear: DO NOT RENT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT! The director's cut of this film takes a perfect piece of cinema and turns it into a pointless soap opera style piece of garbage. Rent the original cut, it's my second favourite film of all time (behind Amadeus) and you won't regret it. Now why are you still reading this? Go rent the movie!!"
gxjfcmq,"Aug 1, 2024",10/10,"This foreign film was dubbed as the best foreign film and truly lived to its award with a combination of great storyline, great actors and cinematography at its finest. A movie about life, relationships and finding all of them in the eyes of a boy growing up experiencing romance and friendship at the same time. One of the critically acclaimed foreign movies that is a truly must watch for avid foreign movie watchers. At first, I thought it was dragging but the flow and plot rose to extreme heights as the story unfolds. No wonder it won best film and truly it does not disappoint. Watch it given the opportunity!"
ernestotejedorvideos,"Jan 29, 2017",10/10,"¿Are you romantic? If yes you are at the right spot reading this, If not then maybe this isn't the movie for you..I am indeed very much so, and therefore..This is simply my favourite movie.By the way there were two versions of the film originally a longer much worse one and a slightly shorter version which is the final one and the one which is now widely available and the one finally kept by the director.The longer version was a bit of a pity I'm afraid, It made the movie loose all its magic and the director Mr Tornatore, was incredibly keen, smart to cut those non-sense scenes and keep only the ones that where useful to preserve all the magic of the movie intact. and here we are talking about a great amount of magic indeed!This film is quite biographical and talks about important things in life (I lived most of them too)Things that happen in real life , the first love, true friendship between two differently aged persons, and great life learnings and true life situations such as an first special magical love you once unsuccessfully tried to pursue in your life but like in Dante's literature (inferno) that so many times slips away , and when you try to recover it it may well be too late, it talks about career decisions and life ambition and it is also one the most beautiful most romantic movie I 've ever seen.Is also an"" Homage "" to the history of movie making and of the world of cinema in general throughout the years, many people won't remember it but the firm was made and produced in the the difficult late 1980's( 1988-89) when cinema was actually truly dying , cinemas were empty ( I actually first saw the movie in Italian in almost empty cinema in 1990) , when the movie came about the true and sad reality was that people didn't't go to the movies anymore and rather just hired a movie tape at home or not even that..So this masterpiece was like a Hymn like the french revolution's ""la marseilles hymn"" coming to the rescue of all the things that cinema represents to us as humans, the movie therefore appeared just in the right moment and for me it came to engrave in our hearts our love for cinema and tried at that to rescue all the movie movie making and of the magic world of cinema making, that was becoming extinct..To me it came like a first love, a surprise and reminded us all what going to the cinema is all about the experience, the magic feeling you get , the sensations and feelings you share with a crowd of unknown people laughing all together.The film is a poetical representation of love , is about sharing feelings, sharing those special limited, instants of limited time in your life on this planet, and feel with other humans the warmth in your heart , the magic that cannot ever be replaced of the first time your heart actually gets loose and suddenly accelerates and your feelings explode and intensify and you feel love for the first time in your life..This film is about love the love of people, the love of humankind, it is a film about the first love, the one you will never forget and about the great love and passion some people like me feel about cinema in general.Undoubtedly a Magnificent masterpiece and a fantastic timeless LOVE-film made for our souls by Giusseppe Tornatore, wonderful music and Love Theme written by Ennio Morricone and violin played by Itzhak Perlman my most admired violinist creates like in Queen's famous song A KIND OF MAGIC .. few other films have ever matched..This film is a a must see a classic unrepeatable, once in a lifetime cinematographic jewel masterpiece, the kind I love to watch with my wife in a romantic winter evening by the chimney place.. Enjoy!Ernesto Tejedor from Barcelona Spain, Living now in Switzerland"
Gouda-3,"Feb 27, 2003",N/A,"These comments address the recent release of Cinema Paradiso: The New Version (aka, the director's cut).I've been a longtime fan of this film, and as early as 1994 when I lived in London rumors were circulating about an extended version of the film. Imagine my excitement when the DVD was released with both version of CP: the original theatrical release and the one with the added footage.  However, after viewing the longer incarnation of CP, I'm afraid to report that the added bits softens, and in some cases deadens, what was so originally powerful about CP in the first place: the sense of unrequited or unexplained loss of love.This new version sets out to explain much that in the original incarnation of the film was left tantalizingly unanswered.  For example, Alfredo's sardonic speech about the guard falling in love with the princess ended with Alfredo saying he had no idea what the story meant.  Left without a moral, the tale is potent precisely because its moral is uncertain.  In this newer version, we see Toto having an epiphany and boldly declares the story's meaning.  Suddenly, the piquant ambiguity of Alfredo's tale vanishes--as does much of the film's.  We see Toto lose his virginity, and certain familiar conversations are expanded many, many minutes.  Too many minutes, sometime.Exposition and explanations are really the only new additions to this picture.  Most important, and for some most alarming, is a very detailed discovery of what happened to Elena after she left Toto for the last time--the so-called expanded ""third act.""  I was always intrigued by the image of an older woman at the end of the final credits of the original version--I just KNEW that was Elena!  I had always thought I wanted to know what had become of her, hence my desire for this cut of the film.  But now that I know, I think I'm better off not having known.The elder Salvatore seemed more potent to me when his present life was wracked with deeply unsettling what-ifs.  This version fills in all the blanks and leaves little to uncertainty, and to me this robs the film of its very essence: the notion that for many of us, life is filled with questions that will never be answered, can never be answered.  This newer version now suggests the opposite, and makes the older Toto look like a morose stalker.I'll keep this DVD because I treasure this film, despite the additions. Fortunately, the original version is included, so from this time forward I'll keep the DVD platter on Side B.  I, for one, prefer the mystery of unanswered questions because that rings so much truer to life and the spirit of this masterpiece."
jgcorrea,"Mar 27, 2022",7/10,"Giuseppe Tornatore woud be a non-entity, in terms of 7th Art, had he not directed Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, a love declaration to 7th Art. Yet only Morricone's soundtrack is remarkable. Emotional catharsis is induced in a manipulative way, as an exercise in nostalgia. Originally a two-part film running about three hours, it was been reduced by almost a third, though it still seemed to run on forever . No, they don't make Italian movies like they used to, this Oscar-winning production spends the better part of three hours proving it. A little inspiration is not enough to carry a whole feature; along with the tears, it leaves us with an aftertaste of phoniness."
pedrocastillo-06208,"Jun 1, 2021",8/10,A masterpiece! Beautiful cinema in every respect. Good movie The reason we love movies A film that will have a special appeal to lovers of film. Sentimental but very memorable tribute to anyone who loves to go to a movie.
moritzherz,"Apr 13, 2023",7/10,"Cinema Paradiso is an emotional movie about love, cinema and life. The characters are so well written that I even cried in the end because it was so beautiful. This movie is a loveletter to cinema!Over it's nearly three hours this movie manages to keep its fresh style. We get time skips and with that new actors and everyone of them is great. From the great Alfredo to Salvatore and Elena, I love these characters. And well, the ending is quite emotional, at least it was for me.This movie is a true classic and you should watch it immediately, if you did not already! This is not without a reason the favorite movie of many filmmakers!"
vmijic,"May 6, 1999",4/10,"Tornatore wants us to believe that Sicilian small town movie theatres screen exclusively classics like Visconti, Renoir, Ford or Chaplin. Not likely! This film is no breath of fresh air. It's the worst Mediterranean pseudo-poetic cliche, seen so many times before and after, a rip-off from slightly better films of the same kind. Some awful camera work and sloppy editing. This is no imperfect cinema, this is bad cinema."
barryrd,"Sep 17, 2021",9/10,"I watched Cinema Paradiso when first released in 1989. Seeing it over 30 years later didn't have quite the same effect but it was very much worth seeing again. Also not sure what version I saw on TCM in 2021 but it seemed much the same.The friendship between Alfredo, a film projectionist doing a job he loves, and Toto, a child with a burning desire to learn his trade, must rank as one of the most heart-warming Italian films. This is quite different than the 1940's and 50's post-war realist movies that Italy is famous for as it warms rather than breaks your heart. It also shows the raw emotions that are released when a man revisits his childhood.As the movie fast forwards to adulthood, we see Toto the man is living the good life. He is a movie director who has made the grade. When his mother calls to tell him of Alfredo's death, there is some question as to whether he will return for the funeral. His life has changed. No longer does he live in a Southern Italian village but in Rome, the nation's ancient and cosmopolitan capital. He has wealth, women and good looks. Going back home represents another time and place and not something he relishes. When he does return, he is admonished by his mother who feels he is not happy and needs to settle down with the right woman. She is very grateful for his generosity which has helped her materially but now her one wish is for him to be happy.The adult Toto takes part in the funeral, walking with the aged villagers who remember him as a child. He greets, giving handshakes and kisses but sadly, the village no longer resonates with life and the old theatre of his childhood is soon to be torn down. While in the projection booth of the theatre, he finds a surprisingly joyful reel of film that highlights moments in cinematic history put together by his old friend. What his life holds afterwards we don't know but the experience of going back home has clearly registered with him. I'm sure it also registers with viewers of this wonderful movie."
josefmillencramer,"Aug 11, 2022",10/10,"Excellent movie, one of the best ever and my all time favourite.I watched the directors cut recently and it is much more complete than the original.It's such an emotional film and tells the various love stories with such reality.The young Toto is such a good actor and deserved his BAFTA award."
santiagocosme,"Dec 6, 2014",10/10,"Generally speaking, no one can really say what their favorite movie is, but when I am asked the question, the first movie that comes to my mind is ""Cinema Paradiso"".I am not sure whether this is the movie every filmmaker wished they had made, as some people claim, but without a doubt it has to be the most beautiful movie ever made about the love of cinema! The last scene is simply scintillating. Toto, now an adult, is handed a box with film cut outs of kissing scenes that were banned when he was a kid. And Alfredo wanted him to have them after his death. When he plays the video, alone in a cinema, and Enio Morricone's music starts, you feel elevated and invaded by all sorts of emotions. I was at the cinema for the 25th anniversary of this film, and everybody was crying by the time this scene started. Me included.It's just a magical piece of film making that everyone should watch at least once. After Cinema Paradiso, you may find it hard to enjoy the majority of movies you watch. It's just that good!"
alva,"Oct 2, 1998",10/10,"As a film student I am often asked ""What is your favorite movie?""   For the last several years my reply has been, ""Cinema Paradiso"".  It is a wonderful movie that inspires the soul to reflect on our past, our fathers, and the journey we take in life. The movie succeeds on all levels of film-making and it will be tough to replace this one as my number one pick."
stephen-357,"Jan 24, 2005",N/A,"There's something magical and timeless about the movies. The stars that inhabit them are like fixed points in a firmament created out of the imagination; ageless reminders that despite the fact that our bodies deteriorate during the passage of time, in our minds we are forever young. Images projected across the distance and onto a screen like ghosts from far off memories have the ability to take us back through time like bookmarkers for important events in our lives. Giuseppe Tornatore's glorification of the movies in CINEMA PARADISO is really a celebration of life and the limitless possibilities for the individual with determination and imagination. There are really three protagonists in this film; Salvatore, the principle character who's story is told primarily through flashbacks; father figure persona grata, Alfredo, projectionist and Salvatore's mentor; and the theater itself, Cinema Paradiso, that refuge for the weary. A place where dreams, if only for a couple hours, can be found. A place where, laughter, sadness and joy can be shared. Paradise! Salvatore is fatherless and Alfredo childless. The two will form a special bond and remain virtually inseparable until Salvatore is a young man. A bond forged primarily in the projection room of the Cinema Paradiso, and fired by their mutual love for the movies. The years will be marked with tragedy, love won and lost and the realization that perhaps ""life isn't like in the movies."" Alfredo, having lived most of his life through the movies, encourages Salvatore not to make the same mistake, urging him to ""Get out of Dodge"" and direct his own destiny. ""I don't want to hear you talk anymore. I want to hear others talk of you. Don't come back. Don't give into nostalgia."" When Salvatore finally does leave, making it big as a successful and respected filmmaker, it will take the death of Alfredo to bring him back after an absence of 30 years. A trip back in time that will inflame old wounds, but also provide an opportunity for them to heal, and after the final kiss of CINEMA PARADISO's inspirational last scene, any lover of the movies will find it almost impossible not to give into nostalgia."
Hildebrando_Martins_Almeida,"Feb 17, 2024",10/10,"""Cinema Paradiso"" is a love letter to cinema that transcends the screens and delves deeply into the memories of a young man passionate about the seventh art. Giuseppe Tornatore skillfully weaves a tapestry of nostalgia and emotion, guiding the viewer through a journey along the dusty streets of a small Sicilian town.At the heart of this narrative is Toto, a young man full of curiosity and vitality, whose fate intertwines with that of the solitary projectionist Alfredo. Philippe Noiret brings this character to life with a melancholic gravity, while Toto is portrayed at different stages of his life, each bringing unique nuances to his journey.The magic of cinema is captured in the profound relationship between Toto and Alfredo, a friendship that flourishes in the shadows of the Cinema Paradiso's projection booth. Together, they face the challenges of censorship and adversity, defending the art that unites them and transforming a simple cinema into a sanctuary of dreams and memories.Tornatore's stunning cinematography transports the viewer to sunny Sicily, where the aromas and colors of everyday life come to life before our eyes. Ennio Morricone's emotive soundtrack elevates each scene to new heights of beauty and emotion, evoking a sense of longing and enchantment.More than just a narrative about cinema, ""Cinema Paradiso"" is an ode to humanity. It's about the bonds that unite us, about the moments that define our lives, and about cinema's ability to transport us beyond time and space. It's a masterpiece of Italian cinema, a celebration of art, and a reminder that even in the darkest hours, cinema shines as a beacon of hope and redemption."
jamiethompson1,"Mar 27, 2005",1/10,"This is possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I'm quite a big fan of foreign language film, but this gives the ""genre"" a bad name. It's about an annoying little s*** of a boy annoying an old man, stealing things, etc. And it has boys chugging in the cinema, and a couple going at it hammer and tongs.Good films contain things that you might remember positively or which affect you. The only affect this had on me was wanting to never go to Italy and smashing the DVD into little bits with a huge hammer. It doesn't even make sense.I got this free with a newspaper and it's not even worth that. Horrific."
jpdicaterina,"Jul 20, 2024",10/10,"With more than a 100 years of cimema, sometimes you leave a gem like this aside for far too long. I feel a bit embarrassed for watching ""Cinema Paradiso"" just now, but it's better late than never!I'm constantly amazed by how movies can touch a soul deep sometimes. It doesn't need to be perfect, have cost billions of dollars to produce or have big celebrities. As long as it's made by people who cares, the film will turn out great, and this one is a perfect exemple. Nothing more than a great idea, beautifully shot and incredibly portraited by those amazing actors who brought the chacacters to life, made me laugh and cry (
a lot).The simple fact that makes this movie one thousand per cent better, is that it is italian, the language suits it so well, and the scenarios, the villages, the rich and beautiful culture brings this story to life like no other could do. It just wouldn't be the same if it were a big Hollywood production.I intend to rewatch this beauty as many times i can, i felt totally represented by Totó and his obsession that we share: Cinema.Enio Morricone, as aways a master. Did an amazing job in the tracks, got chills just by remembering.Io sono un pazzo come Totó!"
andreaslekander,"Dec 9, 2022",10/10,"I often watch movies that impresses me because of the beautiful cinematography or the great dialogue, but this is unlike anything I've ever experienced. I don't think that I will ever experience a movie having such impact on me.I adore movies that plays with your emotions and makes you feel things on a personal level.Cinema paradiso manages to do that in the best way possible. Other than having a beautiful story about childhood, cinema and love, it plays with every emotion in your body and therefore I will never forget this experience.The soundtrack is perfectly executed and makes every scene stronger and more emotional.Being an Italian movie, I had my doubts. But if this took place in any other country, this story wouldn't make sense. The atmosphere of a small town in Italy makes this story stronger and I believe that this wouldn't work if it was set in America for example.I think that this is a perfectly executed film and it has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.Truly beautiful.Please watch this film, please experience this journey. You won't regret it."

prevailrahman,"May 14, 2020",10/10,"Life is not a cinema but cinema influences life! 'Cinema Paradiso' is such a fantabulous movie where one can deeply engross,one can solely feel the nostalgia of his childhood and youth. It's a nice composure of friendship between a poor boy who is enthusiastic about cinema and a projectionist. Yeah! Friendship can break the shackles of age! It is a beautiful story of a cinema hall from an old village where all the villagers finds there zone to take entertainment during their leisures. After ending this movie I want to say that the world of cinema is beautiful,simultaneously our life is beautiful cause we surrounded with beautiful people here just like the projectionist.
I don't know why but I can't resist my tears after watching this nostalgia journey. It's really really worth watching. It's a kind of cinema which can make up your mind."
igorcavalcanti1313,"Jan 28, 2024",10/10,"Normally I don't write reviews for movies, because most of them don't require or compels me to. But Nuovo Cinema Paradiso I couldn't not write a review for this.Never has a movie touched me as deep or made me as cry and even laugh as this Paradiso has. No journey is as beautiful, fun and sorrowful as Paradiso. Paradiso is the greatest ode to cinema I have watched, there is no greater homage to cinema than Paradiso. I love cinema, I love the movies and big picture and movie can express this love better than Paradiso.Its character are you and me and yet they are larger than life. And the acting that brings these to life, oh they are magnificent. I cannot find the words to describe how truly good the cast is, I feel as if no praise to them and to Paradiso would be enough. Salvatore Cascio who plays young To, well shines and acts better, at such a small age, than most most actors in their life hopes to.I could go on and on dissecting and prasiny every frame and aspect of Paradiso and I still feel it would not be enough. So my final message and what I to shout to every corner of the world and to anyone who can listen to is: Please watch Nuovo Cinema Paradiso!!!"
samuelpozas,"Sep 14, 2025",9/10,"Cinema Paradiso is one of the movies that I would consider a core film. It is a slow-paced, innocent, and sophisticated piece. It is set in old Italy, which makes it beautiful to watch and hear, due to the Italian spoken being sweet and local. It leaves many things unresolved but I think that is also the point of the movie."
pct,"Oct 5, 1998",N/A,"I had tears running down my face on and off for most of the film, which then turned into a steady stream for the last 20 minutes.  A very nostalgic film but done oh-so beautifully like only the Italians seem to be able to carry off.  And with Ennio Moriconne's gorgeous lush film score, the emotional impact of the film is unstoppable."
Luigi Di Pilla,"Mar 6, 2005",7/10,If you like a story without action or bum-bum and love nostalgic/romantic movies this is one for you. There are lot of emotional scenes with lot of humor and a little love story. The music was so fine that takes your breath away and it is well tuned to each scene. Director Giuseppe Tornatore created a nice Italian and original story about a typical cinema in the 40/50ies that was located in South Italy. The little boy and Philippe Noiret did a great job here but every actor made a solid casting. Sometimes I had some nostalgic thoughts about my own country. The rating on IMDb with actually 8.3 is okay and not overrated. There was no doubt that it won the Oscar for the best foreign movie and also for many other international awards. My vote with my wife is 7/10. Go and see it.
WhatsUpManPodcast,"May 2, 2024",8/10,"The story follows Salvatore, a successful filmmaker who reflects on his formative years spent in a small Italian village and his friendship with the local movie theater projectionist, Alfredo. Through a series of flashbacks, we witness their bond and the profound impact cinema had on Salvatore's life.At its core, ""Cinema Paradiso"" is a celebration of the magic and communal experience of cinema. It beautifully portrays the way movies can transport us to different worlds, evoke powerful emotions, and serve as a universal language that brings people together. The film captures the enchantment of sitting in a dark theater, the flickering of the projector, and the collective joy and laughter shared by the audience.The performances in ""Cinema Paradiso"" are exceptional, with Jacques Perrin and Philippe Noiret delivering heartfelt portrayals as the older and younger Salvatore, respectively. Their chemistry and the genuine warmth they bring to their roles create a strong emotional connection with the audience. The supporting cast also shines, adding depth and authenticity to the village community.The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the story to unfold gradually and capturing the nuances of daily life in the village. The narrative is richly layered, blending elements of coming-of-age, romance, and nostalgia. It explores themes of friendship, love, loss, and the sacrifices we make for our passions.Visually, ""Cinema Paradiso"" is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography beautifully captures the idyllic Italian countryside and the nostalgic charm of the village. The use of light and color enhances the film's emotional impact, evoking a sense of longing and melancholy.One of the film's strengths lies in its evocative score composed by Ennio Morricone. The music perfectly complements the storytelling, enhancing the emotions and creating a lasting impression. The iconic main theme, ""Love Theme from Cinema Paradiso,"" is both haunting and nostalgic, evoking a deep sense of longing.""Cinema Paradiso"" is a timeless masterpiece that celebrates the power of cinema to shape our lives, ignite our imagination, and forge profound connections. Through its heartfelt story, superb performances, and evocative imagery, it captures the essence of the cinematic experience and leaves a lasting impression on its viewers. It is a love letter to the magic of movies and a reminder of the profound impact they can have on our lives."

jtadams,"Mar 6, 2000",1/10,"This movie received such high and glowing praise that I was really looking forward to seeing what was purported to be such a touching and insightful window into the human spirit.  What I got was two hours of maudlin, weepy, melodramatic prattle that almost descended to the level of farce it was so bad.What the heck is the big deal with this movie?Basically there's an impish, disobedient child who befriends a rambling old man who works as a projectionist.  Then there are tons of clips from movies so old and so poor as to be irrelevant.  And that's about it.If you like pointless coming-of-age movies that meander all over the map, by all means whack yourself in the forehead with this one.  Otherwise, save yourself the time."
EvaStellaDeFilippis,"Feb 6, 2019",10/10,"This is one of my mom's favorite movies ever, I procrastinated a lot before watching it, but deciding to do it was the best choice I could ever made. This movie is a realistic and emotional portrait of Italy of the '80s, understandable by both Italians and others."
bobbiekostos,"Aug 4, 2024",10/10,"Having seen this wonderful movie probably 6 times, I watched it again and, once again, cried throughout. You tend to cry with joy and sadness, but walk away feeling so good about life. The music is phenomenal and takes you deeper into this beautiful story. Each and everyone of the cast were perfect and you find yourself loving each one. Toto (Salvatore Cassio) is so incredibly adorable. The youthful Toto (Marco Leonardi) was cast perfectly. And the older Toto (Jacques Perrin) said everything with his beautiful eyes. And, of course, the late great Philippe Noiret as Alfredo was absolutely wonderful! A true gem of a film and one to be cherished."
SarahReinhart,"Aug 28, 2024",10/10,"Good classic film. The final scene is a perfect blend of film editing and soundtrack music. Anyone whose eyes are still dry half way into that glorious scene needs to see a cardiologist ASAP. Cudos to the great Ennio Morricone & son Andrea. Many reviewers insist that the shorter, theatrical-release version is superior to the director's cut. The full-length version makes a central character morally ambiguous, in contrast to the uniformly benevolent father figure depicted in the shorter version. In the long version this character commits an act similar to but far crueler than the behavior of another character who is ridiculed early on. Most new viewers will watch the full-length film. The shorter version is more satisfying for those who secretly prefer fairy tales in which the good guys & bad guys are consistently good guys & bad guys. Great film!10/10."
lucascastaneda-56244,"Feb 21, 2023",10/10,"This film is incredible. It is hard to put into words just how emotional and effecting this work of art is. At once a gorgeous ode to film itself, it is also an ode to love and the friends we make along the long road of life. Although some decisions may seem dubious, they were made with love and hope in mind. Along with showing an incredible and heartfelt story, the film also flaunts unforgettable cinematography. The film is truly a work of art. A wonderful, heartwarming, awe-inspiring work of art. This is a film that makes you feel, laugh, cry, and love. Alfredo is more than just a friend to Salvatore, and although it didn't always seem it, he had loved Salvatore and had seen something great within him. Alfredo's final gift to Salvatore is one of the crowning achievements of cinema. It is arguably the most beautiful scene ever."
marcyfiorica,"Jan 16, 2006",10/10,"I consider Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is the most perfect film because of all three of the major ingredients in films of this century are considered important. One, the acting was exceptional good, in the way the very young ""Toto"" was very convincing in acting his age in post war Italy and then the teen-age ""Toto"" was excellent in showing a boy becoming a man in war time Italy and showing a beginning interest in the wonder and love of films, by experiencing the films shown in the town's only movie theater and even making them himself and then the adult ""Toto"" was also excellent in the end of movie when it was apparent that he has to have films to survive his everyday world of making them too. The second one is the direction and I am including the third one, the writing one here too. The director was very correct in showing us the life of this town surrounding the nightly showings of the movies in the Cinema Paradiso theater. I am very involve in this movie each time I see it, I start daydreaming that I am actuals a member of that community and seeing the movies at Cinema Paradiso movie theater in that same Italian town, in which ""Toto"" grew up in."
euplay1220,"Apr 11, 2016",6/10,"It seems there are twos aspects of this film that appeal to many people's emotions.1) Nostalgia: After thirty years of time during which Toto kept himself physically and mentally away from home, it is understandable that the memories from the distant past flood into Toto, although personally I did not feel particularly nostalgic by watching that.2) Love: According to many, the ending is meant to fill Toto with love he lost, but this interpretation is not plausible because it refers to different kinds of love. After his loss of relationship with Elena, Toto left home and had relationships with many women in search for a better heterosexual love, while the ending scene only means Alfredo's paternal love. These two are qualitatively different; the latter kind of love cannot be taken to compensate for the missing former. Considering the special emotional attachment given by Toto to Elena, it is implausible that Toto finds any true love with any other woman, which is precisely why he has had many relationships ever since he lost Elena. An interpretation of the ending scene as a demonstration of the former (heterosexual) kind of love is also implausible, because it is only a film projected on the screen, not real for Toto himself. In a shorter version of this film at least, therefore, Toto is left with Alfredo's enduring paternal love but without heterosexual love with a woman. This aspect is incomplete.These two aspects were emotionally not convincing to me. Perhaps all I need to appreciate its true value is a couple of more decades of life experience, long enough to look far back into the past and be nostalgic. For the time being, 6 out of 10."

hp-1868,"Sep 11, 2006",10/10,"One of the greatest cinematic works ever produced in the history of film making. This film, which is obviously one of Tornatore's, is dealing with the life of a boy who's in love with cinema. In his town there is a cinema whose operator is an old mysterious man named Alfredo. This Bloved cinema, which attracts everybody in town every night, is called cinema paradiso. and as you may guessed it's going to be some kind of paradise as the name says... the paradise of love.

Sleepin_Dragon,"Jan 2, 2026",10/10,"Toto's father is lost in Russia, his mother struggles to run the household, and young Toto is something of a handful. He finds comfort in the local cinema and befriends Alfredo, who runs it.The cinema for me is paradise even now, so imagine it for a young Italian boy just after the Second World War. The aptly named Cinema Paradiso is exactly that - a truly magnificent film.It's like a huge Italian comfort blanket. Sure, it's in Italian, but watch it with subtitles to get the full flavour. The acting is sublime, and the bond between Toto and Alfredo is the film's golden feature - glorious, heart-warming, funny, and tragic in equal measure.Honestly, I cannot throw enough superlatives at this captivating film. It is utterly marvellous from beginning to end: the atmosphere, the humour, the tragedy, all a snapshot of post-war Italy through Toto's eyes.Toto's innocence is what makes this film magical - in some ways he's remarkably mature for his age, in others he's still a child in need of guidance. The pacing is superb, the visuals beautiful. The film feels like two halves, yet magnificent in its entirety, with laughs and sadder sequences perfectly balanced.You'll also notice the power of the Catholic Church - its ability to censor and stamp its moral authority, even down to a single kiss being too much.Magnifico.10/10."
jafghanik,"Sep 25, 2015",10/10,"Before watching Cinema Parsdiso, I was just a film buff, watching, analyzing, and finding out the concept behind making a film. After watching this movie, I literally cried because it was the story of my childhood. That is how I exactly spent my childhood. I immediately realized that I ain't just a film buff, I am a Filmmaker. Coming to the review part of this movie, the story telling style of Giussepe is so unique and nostalgic that while you see the people sitting inside Theater reacting to on-screen emotions is classic and makes us feel we are part of them inside Nuovo Paradiso Theater. Alfredo is a great teacher and projectionist who lived Films all his life. Toto at the same time has just discovered his love for cinema. The beauty of cinema Paradiso is on one hand there's Alfredo who dreams to become a filmmaker however he couldn't because he's the only projectionist in Town and on the other hand there's Toto who's desperate about Films and wants to become friends with Alfredo to watch & learn films. However A school exam decides whether they gonna be friends or not. Adult 'Toto' recollects his memory and childhood experience in the village. The Gift Alfredo had kept all this while for Toto is Alfredo's experience as a single audience. Cinema Paradiso is a beautiful experience that you will remember all your life. Thank you Cinema Paradiso for making me realize my passion for Films."

drakeking1,"Jan 20, 2024",10/10,"Cinema Paradiso is a film that celebrates the magic of cinema and the power of nostalgia. Directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, the film tells the story of Salvatore, a successful film director who returns to his hometown in Sicily after hearing the news of the death of his old friend and mentor, Alfredo, the projectionist of the local movie theater.Through flashbacks, we see how Salvatore, as a young boy and then a teenager, developed a passion for movies and a close bond with Alfredo, who taught him everything he knew about film and life. We also witness the joys and sorrows of Salvatore's childhood and adolescence, his first love, his family troubles, and his dreams of becoming a filmmaker.Cinema Paradiso is a film that touches the heart and the soul of anyone who loves movies. It is a tribute to the golden age of cinema, when films were not only a form of entertainment, but also a source of inspiration, education, and escape. The film is full of references and homages to classic films, from Chaplin to Fellini, from Westerns to melodramas. The film also shows the impact of cinema on the lives of the people in the small town, who gathered at the theater to laugh, cry, and cheer together, forming a community and a culture.The film is also a poignant exploration of the themes of memory, loss, and change. As Salvatore grows up, he has to face the reality of leaving his hometown, his friends, and his past behind. He also has to cope with the changes in the film industry, as television and censorship threaten the existence of the old movie theater. The film asks us what we gain and what we lose when we pursue our dreams, and how we can preserve the memories that shaped us.The film is enhanced by the superb performances of the actors, especially Philippe Noiret as Alfredo, the wise and witty projectionist who becomes a father figure to Salvatore, and Salvatore Cascio and Marco Leonardi as the young and teenage Salvatore, who portray his innocence, curiosity, and ambition with charm and authenticity. The film also features a beautiful and haunting score by Ennio Morricone, who captures the mood and the emotion of the film with his music.Cinema Paradiso is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and smile. It is a film that will make you fall in love with cinema all over again. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is, simply, a masterpiece."

Laura-34,"Jan 14, 1999",N/A,"Cinema Paradiso, was a touching film about the movies. The performances were beautiful and touching, particularly the relationship between the young Toto and Alfredo. The film is about life, love and passion. Passion for the cinema, passion for humans. Overall I loved it as a film, and almost seemed to forget it was in another language, despite the obvious fact that I was reading the subtitles, but it worked and it worked well."
mossgrymk,"Oct 17, 2023",6/10,"Just as ""Shane"" is the western for folks who don't like westerns and ""Big Sleep"" is the noir for the anti noir crowd so this bathetic babe is the foreign film for Americans who hate movies with sub titles. Maybe that is because it is not really an Italian film at all but rather a Spielberg film dubbed in Italian with about half of Spielberg's talent and twice the amount of his soppy, soggy sentimentality. And will Ennio Morricone's cloying theme ever shut up? Give it a C plus.PS...For the record, of the three incarnations of Toto I far preferred the youngest. And Phillipe Noiret's Antonio is a windy, holding forth old bore."

JakeBrinkman,"Dec 31, 2018",3/10,"This movie started off very interesting as a view into cinemas of the past. The movie began on track to be entertaining, informative, well crafted, and presenting the writer's intended message. This should have shown the boy's love for the cinema, taking it over, and watching it slowly decline in popularity.However, halfway through the film, the plot takes a 90 degree turn and suddenly becomes a painstakingly generic romance movie. For no apparent reason, it completely abandons all of the buildup that was made in the first half and turns extremely bland.Usually movies with no purpose and direction receive a lower rating from me, but the only reason I have rated this so highly at a 3 is solely because the setup was good. Thinking about the second half's ruin of this movie still makes me mad."
pebena-28816,"May 30, 2024",9/10,"Cinema Paradiso is a beloved and iconic film that tells the story of a young Italian boy's love for the movies and his close relationship with the theater's aging projectionist. The film's visuals are beautiful, and its portrayal of the magic of cinema is both heartfelt and poignant. The film's use of flashbacks and dream sequences adds emotional depth and nuance to the story. Maestro Morricone's soundtrack is amazing as ever.Cinema Paradiso is a masterpiece of Italian cinema that celebrates the power of film and the impact it can have on our lives. Highly recommend this movie to pretty much anyone."
zfantorangen,"Apr 13, 2022",10/10,"If you love movies, it's impossible not to appreciate Cinema Paradiso, Giuseppe Tornatore's heartwarming, nostalgic look at one man's love affair with film, and the story of a very special friendship.Cinema Paradiso is the kind of motion picture that can brighten up a gloomy day and bring a smile to the lips of the most taciturn individual. Light and romantic, this fantasy is tinged with just enough realism to make us believe in its magic, even as we are enraptured by its spell.The movie will bring forward all kinds of emotions, and is an experience in its own. Nostalgia, looking back at our childhood and the special connections we had to certain things is something we all can relate to, and for Toto, it is his love for the cinema in his village and his friendship with the projectionist Alfredo.Truly a must watch.10/10."
leftwichzachary,"Aug 15, 2024",10/10,"This movie should be watched especially by film lovers. The movie ""Cinema Paradiso,"" directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, has made the audience tearful and left a memorable impact.Director Giuseppe Tornatore has depicted beautiful scenes where cinema portrays various emotions in human life such as joy, sadness, anger, and love. The story revolves around Salvatore, a film director, who discovers that his old friend Alfredo, a film projectionist at a local theatre, has passed away. Salvatore reminisces about the strong bond of friendship he shared with Alfredo, and his love for film since childhood. The moments they spent together, and Alfredo's guidance in the theatre, taught Salvatore the joy of filmmaking. The film's portrayal of comedy, tears, and other emotions makes it particularly captivating.The cinematography, handled excellently by Blasco Giurato, showcases the beauty of the Sicilian town both indoors and outdoors. The camera work, including tracking shots through the bell tower and wide-angle lens perspectives, adds depth to the scenes. The imagery of the bell ringing in the square symbolizes authority and influence over the people, enhancing the visual storytelling, especially in the landscape moments.Given that ""Cinema Paradiso"" relies heavily on flashbacks experienced by the adult Toto, the lighting and color scheme vary to reflect his emotions. Subdued lighting and cooler colors convey melancholy and depression, helping viewers empathize with the character's experiences.I must emphasize that ""Cinema Paradiso"" is the most memorable foreign film (Italian) I have ever watched. As a film lover and filmmaker, I urge everyone interested in foreign cinema to not miss this film, as it beautifully captures the essence of entertainment and life lessons through cinema."

At the tequest of the Church, Alfredo shows cut versions of the movies, eliminating the racier parts, usually love scenes.Toto manages to get some of the splices with near tragic results - they catch fire. His sister is almost killed. Also, family photographs, including the only one of his late father, are destroyed. He finds himself banned from the theater.Toto manages to get back in, and Alfredo, the father he never had, teaches him to run the projector. Later, he saves Alfredo's life when the theater burns down, but the man is blinded. The theater is rebuilt, and the two work together.Eventually, Toto joins the military and becomes a successful filmmaker. He then realizes, meeting an old love, how much Alfredo changed his life.

Artimidor,"Feb 7, 2012",10/10,"If you love movies you owe it yourself to see ""Cinema Paradiso"" made by the Sicilian director Giuseppe Tornatore. It contains about everything that the cinema is about (or maybe better: once was), and more. Tornatore also wrote the screenplay for this film and it can be felt throughout that the material comes from his heart, drawing from own experiences and those related to him - the director even has a cameo appearance as a projectionist in the final minutes. ""Cinema Paradiso"" is as powerful as it is not only because of its topic, the direction and the screenplay, but also because of its scope - spanning the whole lifetime of the main character -, its memorable imagery, Ennio Morricone's brilliant score and of course the carefully chosen cast headed by Philippe Noiret. By the way: Even grandmaster Fellini might have made it into the movie, intended for the role of the mentioned projectionist at the very end. But he replied to the director's request: ""At such an important part of the movie putting a face so bulky like mine could be distracting to the audience. I suggest an unknown person instead: Let Tornatore do it!"" Well, so we've still got a master of cinema up there at least - the one who made ""Cinema Paradiso"".To sum it up: Here we have not just any film about the cinema, it's the definitive one - and in the 50 minutes longer director's cut an already great experience becomes perfect. If you are reading reviews like this and still haven't seen it, you better finish this sentence and then be off to get it. Quick!"
cultfilmfan,"Nov 21, 2005",7/10,"Cinema Paradiso, is an Italian film but I was able to see a dubbed copy of it in English whereas it is originally in Italian. The film is set in Italy in the early years of cinema. It is about a young boy named Salvatore (who is nicknamed Toto) who daily goes to the theaters to watch movies. He becomes friends with the projectionist named Alfredo. The two of them bond and Alfredo teaches Salvatore about film and how to use the projector and the film shows their friendship and Salvatore's life and how he grows up and the impact film and Alfredo has had on him.

Before I start my review let me say that the version I saw of the film was the original version running at 121 minutes. A year or two ago a new version was released with extra footage that runs about 174 minutes. One of the reasons I saw Cinema Paradiso was because I always read good things about it and it is often talked and praised about on different movie sites and message boards. Another reason that I saw this film was when I was in a small independent video store once that carried a lot of foreign, independent and offbeat films. I saw this film on the shelf and on the corner there was a note from one of the workers of the store that said something like ""This is the reason I opened this store"". After reading many good reviews and after reading this note I decided to see the film. Cinema Paradiso has good direction, a good script, good performances from the two main actors and a good supporting cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good production design. The film is a good looking film and it is sweet and touching. The film has a nice story and nice characters that you begin to care about and you want to see how the film progresses and what happens to them. This is a film that I think people young and old will enjoy because it is a coming of age story and it will appeal to many. The film is well made and is just generally a well done feel good movie that hits all the right notes."

drqshadow-reviews,"Aug 9, 2024",6/10,"When a young boy loses his father to WWII, a lonely Sicilian projectionist grudgingly accepts the film-obsessed kid as his assistant. Childless, the older man relates to his new protégée like a son before a nitrate explosion leaves him blind and thrusts the boy into a full-time position behind the curtain. The resulting fire also destroys the town's little theater, but a local lottery winner recognizes its importance to the community and rebuilds, taking the opportunity to cut out the censor-happy cleric who's been trimming romantic content for religious reasons.This entire story is wrapped in a golden air of fond remembrance, which should come as little surprise since it's basically the love-letter autobiography of writer/director Giuseppe Tornatore. He even filmed Cinema Paradiso in the same village that inspired it. That makes for a very intimate, revealing narrative, but also a highly idealized one. Its plot doesn't lack drama or heartache, but Tornatore chooses not to chase those trickier conflicts. He prefers the scent of rose-tinted nostalgia. The result is a very warm, sentimental experience, but also a rather loose, passive one. It's almost like a confessional, a sort of ""here's why I am the way that I am"" that concedes his limitations as a man while also asserting their importance to his development as an auteur. The closing montage makes for a beautiful, memorable farewell, but it was blatantly telegraphed more than a hundred minutes prior."
NeelyO,"Sep 15, 1999",3/10,"Granted, I've only seen the US release version, which apparently chopped out quite a bit of footage, so this may be an unfair evaluation.  That said...There's an interesting *idea* for a movie here, but ultimately it's just not about anything.  The whole film is a flashback from a character we hardly know -- had we a better idea of who this guy was as an adult, then his formative childhood/adolescent experiences might mean something, but since he's a cipher, why should we care about how he got there?Even the much-lauded montage at the end (that's all I'll say about it) is kind of clumsy, and too-little too-late.  There's nothing more painful than *not* crying in the last reel of a tear-jerker, and that's how I felt at this film.  (And if someone like me fails to respond to a sentimental film about a person whose life was molded by the movies, trust me, something is very wrong.)I'd like to see Tornatore's original edit, though -- I may just be responding negatively to the chopped-by-Miramax version.  (Check out the director's very anti-nostalgic ""Everything's Fine,"" which acts as an enema to the saccharine of ""Cinema Paradiso."")"
kerryupchurch,"Feb 15, 2023",9/10,"I am finding it hard to describe this masterpiece but IMDB requires me to submit at least 600 characters! Well, that's how many seem to be in the film itself. The character of the Mediterranean, the lives and loves of ordinary people but seen through the eyes of one. The sets are wonderfully charming, the comedy and tragedy of life unfolding in much the same way as a cinema reel. I found myself welling up on several occasions and wanting to know more. How would this story unfold? How would the passions be released? The complexity and depth of maternal and paternal love is evident and the simple joys of life presented, from the cheeky young boy wanting to know more about cinema (about life really) to the older, wiser maybe, but still passionate, middle-aged man. An astonishingly beautiful film."

I vividly remember the neighborhood I grew up in, where there was a film lab located right beneath our house. My life revolved around it.

Now your probably wondering why i was crying and laughing and crying again and it was because the movie was bad then good and then bad again, no no no...don't get me wrong this movie was absolutely a masterpiece through-and-through. The reason why i was crying and laughing and so on was because the movie made me feel so many different emotions at one time and it changed so quickly but, the way they changed it was flawless. I may be saying this in a really complicated way but i think that anyone at any age should be able to watch this. I know it says rated R on the front but all the partial nudity and innuendos are adult stuff and younger children would not understand...and no there is no sex. In conclusion, I've been writing in a mashed up manner and that is only because i can not explain how much of a moving, touching, and just flat out unbelievable movie this was...PLEASE WATCH IT..."

The original version of Cinema Paradiso is that magical condensation of Toto's life, only the life remembered late in life --- but perfect. The director's cut is tempted into inserting the mundane and tedious that in real life would not make the ""Rememberer's Cut."""

The last 5 minutes are not to be missed by any classic movie fan.Lessons to be learned about the different ways movies and movie theatres and their denizens have been enjoyed throughout the decades.

A story about a young boy striving for work in the glamorous movie theatre.Don't miss it.The Italian version with subtitles is excellent, and the soundtrack is amazing."
aushro,"Dec 18, 2023",10/10,"Ah, ""Cinema Paradiso""! A true masterpiece of Italian cinema as well world cinema. Set in a small Sicilian village, the film is a nostalgic coming-of-age story that explores the power of cinema and the enduring bonds of friendship.The main character is Salvatore ""Toto"" Di Vita, played by Salvatore Cascio as a boy and Marco Leonardi as a young man. Toto is a young boy who develops a deep love for the movies after being taken under the wing of the local projectionist, Alfredo, portrayed by Philippe Noiret. Alfredo becomes a mentor and father figure to Toto, teaching him about life, love, and the magic of the silver screen.The film beautifully captures the themes of love, loss, and the passage of time. It showcases the transformative power of cinema and how it can shape and influence our lives. It explores the complex emotions of nostalgia and the bittersweet longing for the past.The review of ""Cinema Paradiso"" would be incomplete without mentioning its deeply emotional tone. The film has a certain melancholic beauty that resonates with viewers. It leaves a profound impact by depicting the innocence of childhood and the sacrifices we make for our dreams. The ending, in particular, is a poignant gut-punch that leaves many viewers in tears.One scene that always brings tears to my eyes is when Toto watches a reel of censored kisses that Alfredo had cut from the films over the years. As Toto sees the powerful emotions displayed on screen, he realizes the depth of Alfredo's love for him and the sacrifices he made for his happiness. It evokes a mix of sadness, gratitude, and a longing for lost moments.The most iconic quote from the film is Alfredo's wise words to Toto: ""Living here day by day, you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people. The land where you were born. But now, no. It's not possible. Right now, you're blinder than I am.""One of the important lessons viewers may miss is the idea that life is fleeting and we must cherish the moments we have. The film encourages us to appreciate the simple pleasures and relationships in our lives, as they may not last forever.""Cinema Paradiso"" touches on the philosophical concepts of nostalgia, the passage of time, and the role of art in our lives. It invites us to reflect on the impact of film and how it can shape our perceptions and memories.If you enjoyed ""Cinema Paradiso,"" you may also appreciate other Italian films such as ""La Dolce Vita"" and ""The Great Beauty."" Additionally, books like ""The Dreamers"" by Gilbert Adair and ""The Film Book"" by Ronald Bergan delve into the power of cinema and its effects on our lives.Overall, ""Cinema Paradiso"" is a deeply moving and visually stunning film that will leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it. Its exploration of love, loss, and the magic of cinema is a testament to its enduring appeal."
thinker1691,"Jul 8, 2016",9/10,"It isn't often, we as the audience are able to accompany someone in a films which not only entertains us, but often allow us to share their lives through their entire progression.

The Projectist is an old man who tolerates his visits. Day after day the boy not only becomes a help to the old man, but soon develops a love for films, but learns to appreciates them throughout his life.

'Alfredo,' The old man (Philipp Noriret) Gives the boy some advice which doesn't always pan out. Still the film garners many awards from around the world. Interesting enough it is rated R and after seeing the film twice I can't see why. There is nothing in the film which promotes all the objections such as overt nudity, sex or violence. And yet, the village priest see's to it that not even Kissing is allowed to be viewed by the audience. Never the less, it wins many awards and is worth keeping as a movie. The actors have given us a view of their lives and we can't see an reason why the family shouldn't see it as well. ***"
Quinoa1984,"Jun 7, 2008",8/10,"Cinema Paradiso works very well because Giuseppe Tornatore, for all his schmaltzy moments with his characters, loves cinema incredibly and especially the communal and personal act of going out to see a movie. It also works because for all the sentiment, he makes it a story essentially about a boy, Toto, without a father after the war who finds a surrogate-cum-mentor with Alfredo, the projectionist at the theater. Their bond makes for the emotional core of the film, as the grown-up Toto comes back to the town he left so long ago for Alfredo's funeral, and looks back on his childhood and adolescence in this small down of Giacardola.The clips of the films are one of the strong-points, and just the scenes inside of the Paradiso, where there's lots of warm human comedy coming out of the fun poked at the 'old-days' of repression (i.e. ringing the bell for a kissing scene), or just the reactions to the different genres and styles (everything from Visconti to Chaplin to Bardot is screened). And there's a whole host of characters Tornatore has that makes a lot of the first half of the picture pretty special.It's maybe in the second half that it got a little too 'adorable' for its own good, or just too much of a similar one-track kind of narrative with the teen Toto falling in love with a girl whom makes it his first real roller-coaster of a relationship. But, as mentioned, Tornatore keeps it simple, particularly with respect to Toto and Alfredo (the latter actor, Phillipe Noiret, is incredible in the part, even when blind for half the running time). It's also a given that maestro Ennio Morricone delivers up the goods and makes this really rousing, the sentiment not false for a lot of the time as one of his best scores.If I didn't find it overall a masterpiece for some of its sappy bits and occasional over-the-top performance that doesn't click (most of them do, it's Italy after all), it's an exceptional effort for what it tries to accomplish and what many films end up being simply sappy can't quite reach. The film earns its keep by making it very relatable, and reminds us why some of us love movies and movie-going very much. It's the 'shmoopy' of Italian cinema lovers everywhere, and its worth the view even in the truncated Harvey Weinstein cut that played at the Rialto theater near my town; a fond goodbye at a fondly remembered theater. 8.5/10"
Troy-24,"Feb 26, 1999",10/10,"If you love movies, this film is a ""must-see!"" It is pure poetry -- an homage to movies, friendship and life. One of my top three all-time favorite films."
imdbfriend,"Apr 14, 2008",10/10,"Cinema Paradiso is a cinema must for everyone who wants to fall in love with movies or re-ignite their lost passion. A movie about movies cannot get any better than this masterpiece in every sense of word. Simple characters build around a theater only source of entertainment for people in a small province of Italy during WW II period, and a love story of main character first with movies, then with a girl, is simply beautiful, especially the passion of the kid with movies, is simply astounding. Another relationship depicted in the movie that of Toto and Alfredo is beautifully developed and equally well played by actors (3 played Toto, kid, young and mature old). The Kid artist who played Toto is amazing and played the role with equal panache as does the Alfredo. Other various artists are good in their roles, well suited. Music is very good and blends with every scene very well. Direction is superb and the photography too is top-notch, dialog's too are very well written. Watching crowd in the theater watching cinema is a pleasure moment for me as a viewer, it takes me back to old days when I use to enjoy a movie so much in theater, now its usually on TV, DVD, theater magic is not like that anymore. 10/10, must watch, irrespective of foreign language. I myself don't know any Italian and yet enjoy these movies completely. I, a passionate fan of Cinema sees no boundary in languages."
Khalid B,"Mar 12, 1999",N/A,"The thing I liked most in this Italian production is its sincerity. A grown man (Toto) looks back on his childhood he spent in a peaceful little village in southern Italy. We can see young Toto growing up without his father. Alfredo (the local cinema operator) watches over Toto and provides him with advice in love and life. The phases in life we all go through allow us to relate easily to the young Italian struggling while growing up. The score by Ennio Morricone could not have been more breathtaking. The changes from happiness to grief and from joy to pain are accompanied with exactly the appropriate sounds. The movie succeeds in dealing with issues like: hope, yearning, disapointment, love and loss without being sentimental. For me without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen."

gga,"Apr 12, 1999",10/10,"What can I say about this movie?  It is one of the greatest jewels and homages of the cinema, both American and Italian.  Highly emotional and packing a punch at the end that won't leave you for several days, it is full of laughs all along the way.  The more you enjoy and love movies, the more significant this movie will be for you.  It is simply amazing that it is Tornatore's first film.  If Italians were wondering what would happen after Fellini's death, I would tell them to nurture this young filmmaker."
SpelingError,"Jul 18, 2016",6/10,"My reaction to this film when I watched it a few years ago was that its first hour was great, but the second hour made a couple poor choices which reduced it to a good film. I had a feeling my opinion would grow this time around, but unfortunately, it remained the same and, if anything, this rewatch solidified my opinion of it even more.In spite of my issues with this film though, I don't consider it to be a bad film by any means, The aforementioned first hour, in fact, is about as entertaining and moving as any film has the right to be. Tornatore crafts such a humorous and vividly detailed film which is packed with a few different types of greatness. For example, some of the humor involving Alfredo and Toto resonated with me quite well, like the touches of humor thrown into some of their tense encounters in the first act or Toto helping Alfredo cheat on a test. These bits made their building friendship a blast to watch. I also enjoyed the emphasis given to multiple side characters who either attended the theater or were frequently seen outside it. There's a priest who orders Alfredo to cut all the inappropriate scenes from the films (kissing scenes, typically), a tramp who believes he owns the town square outside the theater, a man who spits on people from the upper balcony of the theater, a man who frequently gets pranked for falling asleep during the movies, and the general rowdiness of the crowd that attends the theater. It's clear that the theater is the centerpiece of the town and the main (well, the only) pastime for many of the town's citizens. Finally, I liked how the film saved most of its sentimentality for the ending. Complimented with Morricone's terrific score, it's almost impossible not to be moved during the final montage.While the film's first hour is strong, the second hour makes some odd narrative choices which fail to capitalize on that potential. Since Alfredo's and Toto's friendship is established for most of the first hour, I found it strange how the second half shifted so much focus away from Alfredo. Instead, we get a romance sub-plot between Toto and Elena. Though I've yet to watch the extended cuts of this film, I've read a decent bit about them and my understanding is that they provide a better thematic significance for that sub-plot, so I may enjoy this film more if I watch those versions. Who knows. With the international cut though, that sub-plot took time away from what I liked the most about the film. To top it off, I also found certain elements of that sub-plot creepy, like Toto waiting outside Elena's house for (I think) 100 days in an attempt to get her to like him. After the focus finally gets back to Alfredo, he only stays onscreen for about five more more minutes and, while I found their conversations during those five minutes powerful, they ultimately left me asking for more. Granted, the final act is kind of effective and the aforementioned ending is terrific, but the middle act was a huge misstep and left me very cold. And it's a real shame, because the film had a lot going for it with the first hour. The second hour failed to follow up on that potential though.In spite of my issues though, I'd still recommend the film. The strengths of the first hour and the ending were more than enough to save the day, so I did enjoy the film. Just like my first viewing though, I wasn't so crazy on the second hour. I'll likely check out the longer cuts in the future though to see if this film finally clicks with me."
grantss,"Apr 18, 2015",9/10,"Wonderful, emotional movie.The story of growing up, discovering what you love (with a bit of help along the way)...and not looking back. Simple yet powerful story, well told.Not perfect - a bit uneven at times. Some events are overdramatised and some scenes are less consequential than the attention given to them. Plus, the apparent moral of the story (Alfredo's philosophy) is possibly not such a great philosophy.However, you will easily forget the flaws once the movie is over. The final few scenes are incredibly moving. Filled with nostalgia and genuine sentimentality.One of the greatest movies of Italian cinema."
thepetshopboy,"Dec 18, 1998",10/10,"The most gratifying piece of film making I have ever seen, ""Paradiso"" is one of the few films that I can watch time and again.  Director Tornatore brings a passion to the film which seeps out of every frame and invites the viewer to revisit their youth, their hopes, their dreams and the crushing truth of reality.  You will not see a more beautiful, haunting film than this. Phillipe Noiret gives the performance of his life (one which he played a subtle riff on in "" Il Postino"") and Ennio Morricone's score ranks right up there as his best.  For true junkies like myself I would highly recommend getting a hold of the director's cut in which an additional 50 minutes of material is added.  While as a whole it is not as good a movie (Tornatore clearly needed a forceful editor) it does provide insight into what happeneed to Toto's beloved Elena and surprises viewers with a heart-wrenching plot twist which was cut from the original."
robs-2,"Nov 12, 1998",10/10,Charming lovely warm - avoiding all the Hollywood pitfalls but yet sentimental in its own way this is quite a unique wonderful movie.

MOscarbradley,"Aug 12, 2007",10/10,"You should approach any movie with the term 'director's cut' with caution. It can mean that we are now seeing the film the way the director intended it to been seen before the studio hacks got their hands on it or it could simply mean a lot more of the same, the unchecked ego of its creator. When ""Cinema Paradiso"" was first shown here it ran a very serviceable two hours and told the story of a boy, Toto, in Sicily whose love of cinema is instilled in him through his relationship with the elderly projectionist in the local movie house. The movie was told in flashback as the boy returns, a grown man and now a famous director himself, to his home town for the funeral of his friend and mentor. A sub-plot involving the girl he loved and lost to someone else was completely jettisoned.Now the film has been re-issued with this sub-plot restored to its rightful place and rather than detracting from the film's main theme it adds to it and deepens it. Now we can see that the boy's life was not only influenced by Alfredo, the projectionist, by making him aware of the joys of cinema but more directly, in a much more personal fashion. In a way it's like seeing a different movie but a much more rounded and mature one.Both versions are, of course, superb but while the shorter version plays heavily on the sentimentality quotient the longer version is a darker and sadder affair and allows Jacques Perrin to fully develop the character of the grown Toto, (in the shorter version we can only guess at his motivations). In this version Perrin's performance is just one in a trio of brilliant performances. As the child Toto, Salvatore Cascio holds the cuteness factor at just the right level while the great Philippe Noiret is perfectly marvellous as Alfredo. The shorter version will, of course, appeal to anyone who loves cinema, even remotely, (and Alfredo's 'gift' to Toto is director Giuseppe Tornatore's gift to us), but the longer version is a masterpiece that engages us on a much more profound level. However, neither of them should be missed."
llcaldeira,"Aug 20, 2010",10/10,"As any cinema lover, Cinema Paradiso is on top of my list. This great Italian movie takes us on a trip through the life of Salvatore (aka Toto). Salvatore recalls his childhood when coming back to his hometown for the funeral of Alfredo, the theater projectionist. The relationship between Salvatore and Alfredo is the center of the story and we can't help to be warmth by it. Alfredo also passed to Salvatore all is knowledge about traditional cinema helping him to make the first steps in cinematography.Salvatore also remembers his first love, Elena, and tries to understand why they didn't stay together. When he finally understands it, he is devastated.The movie give us also a hint of the beginning of cinema for masses, church restrictions on cinema and changes in cinema through time. The last scene is one of the best ever made: emotional and beautiful. I always feel my eyes wet.After the movie, I only could think: Do we really have to choose between two lives? Does someone have the right to choose a life for us?http://movieadviser.blogspot.com/"
SamLowry-2,"Mar 18, 1999",10/10,"""Cinema Paradiso"" is the rarest of rare gems: a film in which the script, cinematography, acting, music, scenery and directing come together flawlessly to move the viewer in a profound way. As you watch, you constantly realize the perfection of each little scene, the graceful way the camera moves, the simple and natural facial expressions of the actors, the drama of each character's personal journey. The film builds to an emotional climax that will thrill cinema buffs. Alberto's gifts at the conclusion of the film are really just the final frames of Guiseppe Tornatore's amazing gift to the world of cinema. ""Cinema Paradiso"" is flawless film-making."
Goboy,"Jul 7, 2003",N/A,"I can't but reiterate that this is simply one of the most magical experiences I've ever had watching a movie. The idea that this film is filled with clichés is reviewers being familiar with the tropes but not being able to, or not trying to understand the film on anything but a completely superficial level. CP is homage to the power of movies and a lyrical riff on formula. The story has elements of magical realism that inform the narrative with an almost surreal quality at points. Man, I love this film. The denouement at the end never fails to bring me to tears. I have seen thousands upon thousands of films, and believe me this is as good as it gets... Though not as playful, or clever as Ameile Poulain it is cut from the same cloth. It's seems important to note in lieu of some of the other comments that I have not seen the director's cut."

briancham1994,"Sep 22, 2021",7/10,"This film is one of the most touching works of nostalgia out there. It starts off showing the life of a young boy in an Italian town who befriends the projectionist of the local cinema. This part of the film is very sweet and is full of little moments like the town bonding, the boy sneaking into the projection room, the projectionist talking about his life and more. This all gives a well-rounded view of the boy's life and environment, which feels warm and true to life. The acting of the boy and the projectionist must be commended for a sense of genuine warmth. After a time skip, the young boy becomes a young man who takes over the projection booth. By this point, the repetition of the extended director's cut really starts to show badly. His desperate attempts at romance come across as annoying to watch. This really leads to confusion by the next time skip when she happily reunites with him. It seems that not only the past is presented as a fantastical fairytale, but also the ""present"". No amount of nostalgic rose-tinted glasses can resolve this incongruity."
bendon45,"May 12, 2007",10/10,"This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time and you love movies as much as I do than I'm sure you'd feel the same. The story takes place in a small town in post WWII Italy. With television not yet invented the town's only mean of entertainment is the movies. Every night the Cinema Paradiso movie theater is packed full of towns people who come to laugh, cry, and cheer. The story is told through the eyes of a boy called Salvatore. At an early age he falls in love with the movies and the theaters projectionist, Alfredo. Above all it is about the everlasting magic of the movies and the different affects it has on different people. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a big fan of movies, modern or classic."
EUyeshima,"Sep 13, 2007",9/10,"Before watching this on DVD just now, I had not seen director/screenwriter Giuseppe Tornatore's internationally renowned hit movie - at least the 123-minute version - since its initial 1990 release in the U.S., but I remember having mixed feelings that ran the gamut between being moved by its genuine poignancy and being resentful about what I felt at the time was its shameless heartstring tugging. Nearly two decades later, as I have gotten older and closer to the adult Salvatore's age, I have softened considerably in my opinion of the film, an open-hearted tribute to cinema and its transcendent impact on people's lives. Granted it is awash in sentimentality, but with its unique combination of storytelling elements inspired in equal parts by Chaplin and Fellini, there is a burnished, nostalgic glow to the whole venture as most of it is designed as a flashback.The plot begins with Salvatore ensconced in middle age as a successful film director based in Rome. Unexpectedly, he makes plans to return to his hometown in Sicily for the first time in almost thirty years. The reason is two-fold: the funeral of Alfredo, the projectionist who first introduced Salvatore to films, and the demolition of the Cinema Paradiso theater where they showed films to the enthusiastic denizens every Saturday night. This triggers memories of Salvatore's childhood at the old theater with Alfredo and then his adolescence and young adulthood when he falls in love with a beautiful local girl named Elena. In true Romeo and Juliet fashion, he is separated from his one true love by her disapproving father, a wealthy banker, and I have to admit this is the part of the film I still find a bit predictable with Tornatore's Baroque sense of romanticism in high gear. The scenes that really have enduring impact are those between the young, energetic Salvatore, nicknamed ""Toto"", and the surly but lovable Alfredo. Tornatore captures the magical bond between the two, including a tragic episode that forces them to reverse their roles in the projection room.Interestingly, the 174-minute version presented on the second disc of the 2006 two-DVD set fills in the blanks about Elena's fate. The older Salvatore is reunited with Elena and finds out the truth behind their separation. While I enjoyed and appreciated the longer director's cut, I feel overall the additional scenes don't add as much dimension to the story as the nearly three-hour running time warrants. I think my preference for the heartwarming Alfredo-Toto scenes gravitate me more toward the 123-minute version presented on the first disc. The central performances are memorable with the obvious standouts being Phillipe Noiret (Il Postino) as Alfredo and cherubic Salvatore Cascio as Toto. Looking like a Neapolitan Josh Hartnett, Marco Leonardi (Like Water for Chocolate) takes over as Toto and brings youthful, hormonally-driven fervor to the role, and Agnese Nano brings the requisite dreamy quality to Elena.As the older Salvatore, Jacques Perrin (Z, The Young Girls of Rochefort) bears so little resemblance to his younger counterparts that his performance feels somewhat removed. In the longer version, his performance resonates more, especially as he shares the screen with Brigitte Fossey (Forbidden Games) as the older Elena. The famous screening room ending is in both versions - the showing of Alfredo's gift to Salvatore, a reel of film clips highlighting kissing scenes excised by the local priest - though I find just as touching the theater demolition scene with the now-aged villagers looking on in a most resigned manner. Blasco Giurato's cinematography is stunning throughout, and enough cannot be said of Ennio Morricone's memorable music score, one of cinema's most beautiful in evoking the movies aura of romantic nostalgia.Beyond the director's cut of the movie, the 2006 Limited Collector's Edition DVD has several extras of note, the best being an informative, somewhat academic commentary track from Italian film historian Millicent Marcus interspersed with periodic personal recollections from Tornatore, as well as a fifteen-minute retrospective featurette, ""Exploring a Timeless Classic"". Of more anecdotal interest are a four-minute short on how Baltimore's Little Italy neighborhood has embraced the film with an annual outdoor showing encouraging more than a few romances; two theatrical trailers - the original and the director's cut released in 2002; and most inconsequentially, a Food Network show with Napa chef Michael Chiarello with recipes inspired by the movie."
velismarielena-1,"Jan 11, 2006",10/10,"I just saw Cinema Paradiso for the third time and I just realized that I had never voted for this film before. Well, once again I'm so convinced that this is what outstanding movie making is all about. You name it: excellent performances of all the cast, impeccable cinematography and editing, amazing soundtrack, ideal use of flashbacks and story telling ... and I could keep on naming all the variables and every one of them is better and gets better with time. I wish Tornatore did more films because he's really one of the best directors in the world. I won't reveal any part of the story, even though the film was released in 1989. If you haven't seen it, this is a sure shot. Share it with your loved ones."
didi-5,"May 11, 2004",8/10,"'Cinema Paradiso', in both its versions, is a wonderful movie all about movies, the love of the movies, movie images, and movie influences.  It is also about growing up, friendship, young love, regret, and the pursuit of happiness.We follow Salvatore (Toto) from being a young child, eyes wide with wonder at the world projected on the big screen, through his hesitant adolescence, to adulthood as a successful film-maker in his own right.  Playing Toto at the three stages of his life are two outstanding actors: Salvatore Cascio as the child, and Jacques Perrin as the adult still searching for the missing piece of his life's puzzle.  The teenage Toto is portrayed less well, by Marco Leonardi, perhaps because of his lack of screen time - although there is one sequence in particular concerning his character and that of Elisa which stands out.Also in the cast is the excellent Philippe Noiret as Alfredo, the cinema projectionist who becomes the sage, the wise voice of reason within Toto's life.For me, though, the best sequences are the ones which take place within the Cinema Paradiso - the snatches of famous films which play before us, the reactions of the audience, the whole ambience of a little flea pit.  And the famous final montage with the screen kisses is superb.The extended version of 'Cinema Paradiso' puts back around an hour, mainly concerning Toto and Elisa on his return to the village after many years. This is interesting, but the short version packs a considerable punch too."

halliejopo,"Oct 13, 2013",7/10,"Cinema Paradiso is a movie about a little boy who works in a theater with an old man, to put it in a short summary. There are several positive aspects of this movie, but also a few negatives.Cinema Paradiso is very simplistic. It isn't overly complicated, so it is relaxing to watch. It didn't try to be more than it was. The acting by the older man and the young boy Toto (and teenager when he is older) is well done. The ending scene could not have been more perfect to close the film.The main problem I had with this film was the actor who played the adult version of Toto. He looked nothing like the child or teenage version of Toto, so it threw me off a bit. Also, some parts of the film were much too slow or pointless and could have been cut out. The overall running time was a tad too long to keep the movie interesting.Cinema Paradiso is a nice, if somewhat forgettable, film that I think most would enjoy watching. It is far from any sort of masterpiece, but its innocence and view on life are to be admired."
nycsean,"May 10, 2004",10/10,"I just saw the new Cinema Paradiso this weekend, which also marks the first time I ever saw it. It's a long film but you don't notice the time passing as you watch, since it speaks on many different levels of terms of life, memory and experience.The film has several storylines, reflecting different comments. A film about a first love, about a mentor and a student, about films or about not being able to go home again. However, to select a single one of these as the main story would miss the overall experience, since they are parts of an overall tapestry about the tough choices life presents.The standard hollywood treatment would made a completely happy ending, our hero gets together with the girl (now woman) of his heart; continues his successful movie career; his mentor remains flawless, and somehow restores the old town's spiritual heart. This doesn't happen, for as his mentor states ""life is much harder than in the movies"".Not to say that this a sad film, it's an extremely happy one, and by being tough and presenting a more truthful aspect of experience, its exquisite moments are that much more joyous."

Harpo 2046,"Jul 15, 2001",1/10,"Before seeing this film, I did not think that this film was so emotional. And actually, I have been quite disappointed with the story.  Even if the actors are good, the poor story can't save the film.  However if you like crying and being touched, see this film.  I can't say that this film is bad, but I think that that is poor in truth, and Tornatore just tries to makes us cry."

dwpollar,"Mar 12, 2001",10/10,"1st watched 4/23/2000 - (Dir-Giuseppe Tornatore): Tremendous portrayal of the life of boy brought up being enticed by the movies & becoming best friends of the local movie theatre projectionist. There were so many things that were good in this movie that it's hard to list them all in a short review, but I guess the way it blended real life & real love with the movies and how we respond to their power that they have over us is what makes this movie magic."
xtinaily,"Jan 25, 2020",10/10,So far I haven't come across another movie that touches my heart as much as Cinema Paradiso does.
tobyindia,"Dec 21, 2004",10/10,"i bought this movie having only read about it, its awards, but without knowing the storyline and i delayed watching it for a long time. But when i did watch it...My! It was a revelation. The storyline, the story telling, the cinematography, the acting and the score just works so well together! Its the only movie..yet which i had no choice but give it a perfect 10! The plot outline or the movie trailer doesn't do justice to this masterpiece. Some people describe it as an art-house movie but it isn't, its just a GOOD Movie. This movie is a reason as to why we like movies in the first place. Watch out for the emotions in the lead adult character at the end of the movie. Its an emotion the viewer will also feel. Just watch the movie without pre-judgment and i am sure it will have an impact on you! Super!"
jocurrie-1,"Dec 2, 2001",10/10,"Beautiful camera work and faultless performances from the cast prevent this touching account of a boy falling in love with the movies becoming either sentimental or too self-congratulatory by a master of this craft. As well as portraying his own childhood, the director shows a kind of  history of mid twentieth century mores of southern Italy. Nostalgia and reminiscence have seldom been portrayed so movingly without becoming saccharine. The colours alone make this a movie worth treasuring."
Emerenciano,"May 28, 2006",N/A,"What could please a fan of cinema more than a great film about cinema itself? And what if this films brings up the fabulous European way of telling a soft story? Would you be interested in it? If you still do not know the answer i tell you: you will be able to see Philippe Noiret in a wonderful performance. So, get this movie right now.Salvatore (Salvatore Cascio) is a young boy who loves going to the cinema everyday. He is good friends with Alfred (Philippe Noiret) and always tries to go up the projection room to check how things work there. As time goes by, Salvatore (now Marco Leonardi) keeps his love for the cinema and starts working there. His friendship with Alfredo continues and they're like father and son. He also falls in love with Elena, a very beautiful girl.From this moment on, the film, that is already wonderful, gets even more enchanting and we just cannot stop watching it. The photography and the soundtrack are enchanting."
ankitkb89,"Nov 9, 2012",10/10,"I am not a big fan of movies released in 80's or earlier. I didn't expect much from this movie and watched it only owing to its high rating and ranking at IMDb. But buoy.. was I amazed. The movie is just less than 3 hours(extended version) but there is not a single moment where you find yourself detached from the movie. I wont call the acting at its best but its the story that forms the backbone of the movie. The story brings out relationship between three main pillars of human life - 'Love', 'Friendship' and 'Carrier'. This is the best romantic drama movie I have ever seen. If you weigh story more than big actor names and watching with subtitles is not a turn off(for non Italians) then this is a must watch for you."
johnnymonsarrat,"Dec 29, 2004",5/10,"Some people are very arty about films. They can enjoy a flick that has great costuming, great acting, and a wonderful score, even if the plot is boring and the characters unlikeable. Like The Piano (1993).The Cinema Paradiso is like this. There's no real plot; basically we follow the life of a boy who becomes a man. There are endless slow-moving scenes of how much he loves movies. It can throw you into a real funk. And the ending doesn't resolve the biggest mystery of the film. I won't spoil it for you but it involves romance.Who should see this film:-- Anyone who liked Forrest Gump, a film I personally loathed-- Arty film types, you have a real racket going in making the rest of us feel inferior for wanting our movies to have plot, pacing, conflict.I'll give Cinema Paradiso a surprisingly low 5 out of 10. See ""Life is Beautiful"" or ""The Shipping News"" instead."
aharmas,"Sep 24, 2005",10/10,"By the end of this tribute to the movies, there shouldn't be a dry eye in the house. ""Paradiso"" is a beautiful film, a movie that takes a simple story of a very special couple of people and explores how the most intense emotions in life shape the best films, and how censoring our dreams can lead to incomplete existences.Watching Toto grow up from an innocent who is drawn to the movies, though he might not be able to express the reasons why. As the film continues, Salvatore's life takes unexpected turns, some of which leave him emotionally scarred for life.The film moves along nicely, giving us very rich performances, a solid story line, and one of the most wonderful music scores to ever compliment a film. If there ever was a true gem of cinema, here it is."
pozzo-lahiri,"Jul 23, 2005",9/10,"One of the greatest I've ever seen, Tornatore pulls off masterfully a movie which is technically brilliant and at the same time pulls at the viewers heartstrings! Viva La Tornatore! Grande! Later Tornatore directed MALENA, it is also a great movie, but it never reaches the greatness achieved by CINEMA PARADISO. The movie shows the diverse nature of the crowd present at a movie theater, people in all kinds of moods, as Roger Ebert said,""Romances are launched in the darkness of the theater, friendships are sealed, wine is drunk, cigarettes smoked, babies nursed, feet stomped, victories cheered, sissies whistled at...""! The movie sometimes reminds us of Fellini, especially when in the long shots someone suddenly appears in close up. Like Truffuat, Tornatore gives a special place to posters in this movie. 'This film captures the essence of a man's life, gently bringing us from childhood to middle age believably and beautifully.' There is a presence of warmth and humor in the movie, from the fainting lottery winner to the zealous censorious priest, and the madman who goes on saying, ""This square is mine""! It is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes poignant but it's always warm, wonderful, and satisfying. It is one of a kind. Salvatore is present in all of us. And when Alfredo says, ""Living here day by day, you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people. The land where you were born. But now, no. It's not possible. Right now you're blinder than I am."" --- it applies to all of us on a universal level. And the music? It is brilliant, romantic and never fails to touch the heart, kudos to Ennio Morricone. The movie is perfect, beautiful and to describe in one word: BELLISSIMA!"
rizkalain,"Oct 27, 2018",10/10,You never get enough of this most charming authentic story..the smallest details and simple acts makes is what what makes this movie so special..taking you back in time..
kstro,"Oct 22, 2003",10/10,"This ranks as one of my all time favourites. A celebration of the cinema and of life, Cinema Paradiso is beautifully crafted and one of those rare few that manages to touch on so many global themes (while lesser films struggle to find any theme). A coming of age film about (among other things) friendship, family, love, loss, war, religion, and politics, set against the rugged beauty of the Sicilian countryside, Paradiso transports the viewer effortlessly to that place, as if we had lived there all our lives.Like Hallstrom's ""My Life As A Dog"" and Robert's ""My Fathers Glory"", Tornatore has surrounded his protagonist with quirky characters in perfect balance; i.e. the kinds of people-you-know, and people-you'd-like-to-know. This alone makes it the type of universally transferable movie everyone can enjoy. But for me, the masterstroke was Toto's love of movies. This added another more subtle level to an already well rounded flick.  Of course the Paradiso was a metaphor for change/progress, a symbol of community spirit, etc.  However, to try and analyze this film too much would be doing it a supreme injustice.  It is simply a beautiful piece of cinematic history, a film for all true movie-lovers."
panchodh_12,"Jul 24, 2015",10/10,"I can't really think of many other movies that fit the same category as Cinema Paradiso. Right now I can only think of ""It's a wonderful life"" and ""Amelie"". But they are movies with a special spark. Movies that after the first few scenes you know that, regardless the development of the plot, you're now become completely involved with the story and the characters. You are *in* the story. It is often said that great movies are the ones that manage to convince the public that what they are seeing is reality, that the spell they cast is so well-carved that you don't notice that on the other side of the screen there's actors who leave their characters after the director shouts ""stop"", and people who work on the make-up, lightning, script. Great movies are those in which you forget that what you are watching a movie.Now, movies like Cinema Paradiso,, take it to a whole other level. It is not only that they make you believe you are watching reality, but that it's a reality deeply close to your heart. Two hours ago I'd never heard of Salvatore, Alfredo and Elena. But now they already seem like old-friends, people that know the purest of me, people that I don't want to believe that actually never existed, and were simply actors repeating the lines written by a guy. I actually want to believe they are somewhere in this real world. Movies like Cinema Paradiso completely blur the line between that side of the screen and us.It is therefore completely senseless that I spoke about the direction, the magnific editing, the outstanding performances and the touching music. Because that would mean to accept that Salvatore and Alfredo never existed, and I refuse to do that. At some point, Alfredo says that life is much worse than in the movies. But right now, after having just finished Cinema Paradiso, I want to believe it is not. I want to believe I am right now in that world where magic can happen, a world where, somewhere in Rome, Salvatore is kissing Elena.I don't usually cry in the movies. There have been some movies that do make me cry, though. Holocaust movies like La vita è bella are especially good at that. But most of the movies that make me cry are because they are particularly sad. Few movies have made me cry of happiness the way Cinema Paradiso did."
damianphelps,"Nov 22, 2022",7/10,"Cinema Paradiso is on the list of films all lovers of movies are supposed to watch (currently ranked 52) so naturally I gave it a go. Did it live up to its ranking, for me no, was it good? Yes.Its a quaint, beautifully visitation of a man's life from childhood through to later life. It examines love and what it means for him at different stages of his life.There are some very touching moments but for me the movie fell ultimately short of a satisfying conclusion.Its a film full of passion so its nice to watch but at times, including right at the start, it can be frustratingly slow.Lovers of film take heart you, it won't disappoint :)"
digoutthelight,"May 31, 2025",9/10,"A masterpiece that brilliantly demonstrated the film's value of existence.Beyond approaching film as a field of art, film that welcomed me into the world film.By watching this movie, I entered the world of cinema and was completely buried in it. I think it is a work that can prove a movie throughout the era of mt life, era of the most generation, and all eras. Sometimes I think it would be better if i watched movie a little faster, but I envy the feelings that people who have not watched movie will feel when they first see it. LOL I'm just infinitely grateful to be able to watch a movie ,Cinema Paradiso.."
Dibyayan_Chakravorty,"Nov 25, 2019",8/10,"A celebration of childhood, friendship, life and classic movies. Truly one of the greatest Italian movies ever made."
melstimpson,"Nov 4, 2017",10/10,"You should take any opportunity to go to any cinema to watch this film which itself is about a love affair with cinema. It is a masterpiece created by a director who himself is in love with cinema. No special effects, just a great story, brilliantly conceived, directed and shot, captivating acting by perfectly cast actors and yet another inspired soundtrack from the genius Ennio Morricone. The shorter version delivers as much enjoyment but the full version is more satisfying as it closes the circle. I defy anyone not to be captivated by it! It may be the most perfect film ever made and I will never tire of watching it. Bravo, Sr Tornatore!"
fluffhead34,"Feb 4, 2007",10/10,"A beautiful film that celebrates life,love and the magic of cinema. I just watched the original version on TCM, and loved every minute of it. There were no scenes that dragged (for me), and the subtitles did not distract me from the wonderful camera work and cinematography which sometimes happens to me with foreign language films. No repeated viewings are needed to understand and enjoy this film.Robert Osbourne of Turner Classic Movies spoke of the new version that is available with over 50 minutes of added footage, but said that he thought that this is one film where added footage did not improve on the original, though he left it to the viewers to decide for themselves by watching them as they are both available on DVD. I for one can not see how this film could possibly be improved upon,but I will of course have to see for myself!"
farron34,"Feb 16, 2013",10/10,"Let me start by saying, being a film lover, this story was incredibly powerful for me. I thought the cast was excellent, every performance touched on all the right points, the writing was superb, the main characters were well developedand I never knew would have thought that scraps of film put to together would make me cry.This was a film that I never wanted to end. It is a multi-layered love story and and really just a story about how life unfolds. The way that many things are brought up in the film casually and then used later for emotional impact is quite beautiful. I know some people are ""afraid"" of foreign films, but if you watch only one – make it this one. I highly recommend this film as an example of how meaningful films are constructed."
Jimmy Jimmereeno,"Dec 17, 1999",10/10,"What else can I add about this that hasn't been said?  If you like movies at all you should see this at some point in your life. Hopefully multiple times.  It's a simple story about a boy growing up in Italy and his love of the cinema. You might shed some tears but, I don't know, just rent it!"
rdalamillos,"Nov 1, 2020",10/10,"This being my first review, and not in my nativa language Im quite nervous and might not be able to fully express my devotion for this specific film. Following the story of a small cinema in an italian village, this movie sets you on a trip through love, happiness, and overall a state of joy. I found this movie by chance, I had never heard of it before and decided to give it a go. Im really happy I did because nowadays it definetly is on my top 10 movie list. This emotive film, suited for all audiences will most certainly make you have a good time, its a truly beautiful journey I reccomend to everyone."
jameslinton-75252,"May 4, 2016",6/10,"Cinema Paradiso is an extremely touching film about the relationship that a boy has with the town's projectionist. Salvatore is a mischievous young boy who develops a passion for cinema. The film's projectionist Alfredo mentors the boy and becomes a surrogate father to him. It engages wonderfully with themes of community, growth and nostalgia. There is very strong emphasis in remembering where you came from. One thing I didn't like though was the love story they gave Salvatore. I felt that this was contrived and unnecessary. it didn't add anything to the plot.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/vtbGiX"
movie pimp,"Jan 11, 2000",10/10,"As a big fan of foreign films, I have yet to find one that has moved me like Cinema Paradiso. My VHS copy of this movie has probably been screened 100 times, and I can't wait for it to be released on DVD. The story follows a small boys obsession with the world of cinema, and the kind projectionist that takes him under his wing. It's packed with emotion that wakes up the movie lover in all of us. And the final scene packs such a wallop that you had better make sure a full box of Kleenex is sitting beside you. In my opinion, Cinema Paradiso is the best foreign film ever made and one that will live on for years to come."
TheMovieDiorama,"Aug 27, 2019",7/10,"Bellissimo! One of life's greatest delectations is the medium of film, more specifically the cinema establishments. A cinema was, well still is, able to bring together a community of movie enthusiasts and enable the minds in the room to escape the boundaries of reality. Films can influence. Films can inspire. Yet most profoundly, films can entertain. Tornatore's post-WWII Italian drama is an ode to the boundless possibilities of said medium, and as a reclusive cinephile who yearns to be ascended by these moving pictures, I gobbled this feature up quicker than munching on fresh carbonara. After receiving news of the death of his fatherly figure Alfredo, Salvatore reminisces about his childhood and how he discovered his infatuation with film.As predicted, considering this title won numerous awards between '89-'91, it's stuffed with tropes and sub-plots found in a variety of genres. Most worked in Tornatore's favour, the remaining few on the other hand proved to be a futile exercise in overloaded storytelling. Immediately what springs to mind, and has yet to abscond the empty void that is my brain, is Morricones' composition. Sensationally authentic, with subtle Italian flavours that truly encapsulated Sicilian aesthetics. The ambience, the atmosphere and the almighty sense of communal drive. It's what makes Cinema Paradiso so incredibly enticing. Fully complementing the heartfelt narrative style that Tornatore had lovingly produced.The plot is unwrapped through Salvatore's perspective, naturally a consequence of this is that his life story is the prominent development function for all characters. Aside from Alfredo, his war widow mother Maria and his childhood love interest Elena, other characters were mere background villagers that were implemented to enhance the overall lighthearted humour. It was a success. Purely shining the spotlight of Salvatore, and experiencing how films had moulded his life, was effective. The glisten in young Salvatore's eyes reminded me of when I received that very same sparkle. Watching my first film, overwhelmed by inspiration.Whilst Tornatore's intention was to celebrate this popular art form, the drama surrounding his characters also took precedent. For the most part, both elements were well balanced. The second act however, which I can only assume the theatrical cut was edited with a chainsaw, unfortunately lost momentum. Pivotal scenes felt abruptly removed, particularly the sweeping romanticism between Salvatore and Elena, and severely came across as underdeveloped. The romance, being a manifestation of everything that Salvatore had witnessed being a projectionist and having to splice out kissing scenes (more on that in a moment), had no time to truly simmer. Undercooked spaghetti of love, or something of that cuisine. Then randomly shoving in the compulsory military service montage, and the second act truly proved to be voided of purpose. I can only assume that the director's cut, with an additional fifty minutes of footage, resolves these issues.Fortunately, the concluding act kicks in and rounds off a sterling performance from Noiret who acts as the father figure for Salvatore. A much required dynamic that allowed some emotional connection between Alfredo and Salvatore. Only to the conclude on a whimsically melancholic note that is sure to make you empathise with Alfredo. Yes, the ""kissing scene montage"" as it's infamously referred as. Profusely removing comedy and pushing sentimentality forward. It's not particularly subtle, but Tornatore solidifies his sentiments of intertwining pragmatism with nostalgia. Closing this coming-of-age narrative with a celebratory tear.Cinema Paradiso is a reflection. A reminder if you will. That the age of cinema is far from dilapidated. A celebration of an art form that we, the general public, take for granted. And most importantly, it proves that film can inspire generations, shaping their lives for the better. My criticisms I suspect are mostly regarding the international cut of the film, but still need to be addressed. I'll be sure to give the director's cut a gander in the near future, in the hope that it only betters the story. For now, whilst it isn't the greatest export from Italy, it certainly is deserved of its unanimous praise. Even if the lighthearted nature downplays the dramatic elements."
bilging,"May 4, 2025",1/10,"The film presents itself as a nostalgic love letter to cinema, but beneath the soft lighting and sentimental music lies a film that feels emotionally manipulative, shallow, and unbearably slow. Rather than celebrating the magic of film in an honest or moving way, it resorts to clichés, one-dimensional characters, and repetitive emotional beats that quickly wear thin. Without real narrative depth or meaningful character development, the effort feels hollow. The protagonist's journey lacks authenticity, and the relationship between the boy and the projectionist, meant to be the heart of the film, is underwritten and melodramatic. The ending attempts to deliver an emotional punch, but it comes off as unearned and overly theatrical. What could have been a poetic tribute to lost innocence and the magic of cinema instead turns into a bloated, overpraised memory reel. Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is not a celebration of cinema-it's a sentimental trap dressed in nostalgia."
thomas-hardcastle-2,"Jan 4, 2009",10/10,"I was beginning to lose faith in humanity. Many of the films I had seen in recent times were so badly conceived that I was beginning to lose my passion for film.I had heard about Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, because it was on people's favourite movie lists, and was a top IMDb film. When I saw it on sale, I bought it, and that's when it all happened. I fell in love with cinema again.I'm not going to go into the details of the many characters and situations in this film. Suffice it to say, it is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. I have the largest film collection of anyone I know, and this film is without a doubt in my top ten. It is full of love, nostalgia and beauty.Both versions of this film are great, but angle the overall piece in different ways. The extended version (director's cut) concentrates a lot on the aftermath of the love story, and is essential viewing for anyone who loves this film. You can easily fall in love with this film watching the shortened version only, however.Overall, I am back in love with cinema, and this incredible film is the one and only reason for this. The word ""masterpiece"" was created for this movie."
dplcobb,"Jul 4, 2017",10/10,"The main plot is about cinema, but I tend to get side tracked by the sub plot of a poor man who cannot reach his only love because of his status in life.Somewhere his sadness of never reaching his love is supplanted by the beauty she brought to his life and to the world through cinema."
shneur,"Mar 26, 2005",9/10,"This is a lovely, sensitive film which evokes a variety of emotions, leaving the viewer with a sort of satisfied exhaustion, like after a good session of yard work. Its focus is the power of love to shape our lives over the long term. The protagonist's passion for the cinema and his youthful immersion in ""first love"" are intertwined, and become mutual symbols each for the other. What constitutes success and what failure? What is or must be sacrificed to achieve our goals, and how are we to know in advance which life goals will prove worthy and enduring? All these dilemmas move beneath the surface of an engaging tale, but without detracting from its drama. Let me point out too an important word of warning that may be missed: When an adult's help and guidance of a young person, no matter how lovingly offered, crosses the line to making decisions for them without their knowledge or consent, the consequence often may be suffering for which no one would have wished."
nairtejas,"Sep 27, 2024",9/10,"I watched Cinema Paradiso for the first time today, on the big screen, in the same auditorium that had its director Giuseppe Tornatore in the audience. And what can I say! It is already one of my fondest memories to have, ironically watching a movie that deals, above all, with nostalgia. It's tempting to take a side for the protagonist, who remembers his childhood camaraderie with his friend, a theatre projectionist. It's an amusing story told with enough humour and love that it's bound to make your eyes wet towards the end. I'm someone who often finds myself give in to nostalgia, so Cinema Paradiso shattered me.(Watched at the Italian Film Festival organised by the Film Heritage Foundation in Mumbai.)"
YNOT_at_the_Movies,"Nov 3, 2002",N/A,"Just watched the 2002 release of Cinema Paradiso (170 minutes version).I really like the 123 minutes version, which won the Academy Award in 1990, much better than this `new' longer version. It's irony that this new version was actually the `original' version. However, I feel lucky that I actually saw the shorter version first. The shorter version is very tender and sweet, the longer version is rather dreadful and not convincing. I strongly recommend everybody to watch the shorter version first before you go to see this `new' release.My vote: 10 out of 10 for the 123 min shorter version; 7 out of 10 for the 170 min (2002 US) release."
braddugg,"Sep 7, 2014",10/10,"Passion exuberance in every frame of the film. A rarity and a great tribute to cinema itself.When love, passion and intelligence come together a genius is made and precisely Cinema Paradiso is that. Giuseppe Tornatore is a genius too. This is just his second feature film and he does an exemplary job.The nuances of a child from helping friends to learning things, growing up as juvenile and falling in love, then as a man who does his own thing. The life of a person is shown beautifully with wonderful fine moments. I love the scene in which Alfredo tells him not to trust a blue-eyed woman and how he uses a dialog from an old film is wonderful. From Keaton to Chaplin to Clark Gable to many more. There are wonderful references. The aficionados will love this as there are many montages of the good old films. The genius lies in a scene where the frame of the pass through the walls of the projection room and the film is showed on a wall of a street. Wonderful thing that and hats off to the writer director Tornatore for that.I must specially mention Ennio Morricone and his score. What music does, we all know it adds up life in a bland moment. It adds emotions, it reflects emotions, it fills silences. Ennio Moricone does it all and more he adds life to movie itself and how much ever I praise Morricone, it would be less by all means.The acting is fine be it of Alfredo, the projectionist played by Philippe Noiret, Salvatore Di Vita (child) played by Salvatore Cascio or a host of others. The boy and Alfredo have a charming chemistry which is wonderful, it gives a smile and at times there are feelings echoed my own of the way I respected my childhood teachers.A word about Giuseppe Tornatore, he really knows how to show kids and adolescents in the film. The earlier film I watched of his, Malena too had shown adolescent feelings wonderfully and here too, he knows how wonderful a kid can be and precisely depicts that with even more sensitivity. Kudos to him for that and I shall be indebted for him in many ways to have made two of my favorite films. This one and Malena.To all the film lovers, this is a must watch film and one of those that you must surely watch before I pass away. I am lucky to watch this and wish there shall be many more lucky ones. A 5/5 for this, one of the greatest films ever."
behz,"Apr 22, 2012",10/10,"I first saw this when it came out in the 80's. Loved it so much, and never forgot it. I've probably seen it once or twice since then, and having watched it just now one more time, I can say that it's a film that simply never gets old.I've seen many amazing movies, but none of them have ever created emotions inside me like this one. The joy of seeing life in the old days, in a small Italian town full of colorful people and life, the look on little Toto's face when he was with Alfredo watching movies, the pain of regrets in later life and coming back home. It's just an unbelievable movie, nothing else like it.I just wish we could have more movies like that. Alfredo is one of the most lovable characters I've seen in cinema, a perfect father-figure played so well that it's practically flawless. The music is the cherry on top. The way all the elements have been brought together is nothing short of magic."

Rommel52744,"Jul 15, 2003",10/10,"Wow.  This movie is perfect from start to finish.  Music, setting, plot, characters, and of course the movies meld seamlessly into one to create a masterpiece.  I bawled my eyes out like a little girl the first time I saw this.  The scene with the reflecting projector and the very end are so simple yet so beautifully sweet and touching.  This movie makes the guy from American Beauty who thought everything was so beautiful look like a gothic junkie.  Anyone who believes there is beauty in cinema should watch this movie. My personal favorite. 10/10WARNING.  DO NOT WATCH THE DIRECTORS CUT.  The newly-released extended version is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND IT DESTROYS THE SPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL.

His father, off to war for so long, is unknown to him. His mother is stressfully attempting to raise him.Escape is found through the movies and the mentorship of the local cinema projectionist, Alfredo.Life becomes a relentless pursuit of film, both in technical production, and love of the art.Characters ranging from the local mentally challenged Denizen who warns all that this is `my square', to the priest who plays so central a role to daily life, he is the town censor. Pepper the landscape with other characters who reward us with laughter and depth of feeling and you have an idea of this film.Alfredo is the heart of the movie.  The scruffy projectionist, without child, who becomes both teacher, and guidance councilor to the young waif Toto.  The movie moves thru various stages of Toto and Alfredo's life, greeting both tragedy and comedy with equal aplomb.This is a sure winner for those willing to enjoy an Italian film made with grace and sincerity.Sit back and enjoy a sure winner!!"
fernandoschiavi,"Aug 1, 2023",9/10,"With a simple but deeply moving plot, the film ""Cinema Paradiso"" totally involves us in a roller coaster of emotions, in a sentimentality based on a powerful relationship of friendship and passion for the magic of cinema. With beautiful and engaging images, the film captivates and releases us with a face full of tears. In a defeated Italy after World War II, in a small town in Sicily, the boy Toto (played by the adorable child actor Salvatore Cascio), mischievous, sweet, innocent and intelligent, was mesmerized by the local cinema, the 'Cinema Paradiso'. As an altar boy at the church, Toto secretly enters the magical world of cinema and begins a friendship with Alfredo (Philippe Noiret), a grumpy middle-aged projectionist, but with a huge heart, a frustrated figure for not having taken a different path. (Possibly as a filmmaker), but who still keeps his passion for cinema alive. Toto, the son of a war widow, becomes very attached to Alfredo, almost in a paternal relationship.All these events arrive in the form of a memory when Toto, much later in Rome, now Salvatore, a successful filmmaker (Jacques Perrin, in the adult phase), but embittered, receives the news that his great friend Alfredo has died. After 30 years, Toto will return to his homeland. From here, the film makes a long flashback of Toto's life, his childhood, adolescence (life stage interpreted by Marco Leonardi, with a passionate and dreamy look) and, mainly, his adventures in the 'Cinema Paradiso' of his small town, called Giancaldo. It was there that Toto learned to love the cinema and his happiest place is the projection booth.From the projection booth of the old Cinema Paradiso, where Alfredo works, Toto gradually falls in love with the seventh art, discovering its mysteries and gaining repertoire. For him, films become both a refuge and a school where he learns about life. He sees westerns, romances, thrillers, adventures, thrillers, comedies. The world reveals itself before the boy's eyes through images presented to him by Alfredo, a mixture of friend, mentor and father. A guide, finally, that leads you to adulthood. Soon, the boy learns the trade, and as the years go by, we follow his maturity, the first love, the difficulties of life. Meanwhile, a certain evolution unfolds in movie theaters, at the same time that it shows how the modern world ""killed"" old cinema, losing that magic of yesteryear.""Cinema Paradiso"" is a tribute to cinema, addressing this whole process that cinema has gone through and also, simultaneously, a biography of Toto (Salvatore), from his childhood to adulthood and his intense relationship with cinema. Several important points of the technical, social and thematic evolution of cinemas are presented in the film. Among the points covered are the evolution of projectors, from manual to automatic, the material of the films themselves, moving from extremely flammable and dangerous to fire resistant films. There is also the melancholy transition from a larger and larger community environment for information and entertainment to an obsolete environment for these purposes, superseded by the advent of TV and VCR. In thematic terms, ""Cinema Paradiso"" also touches briefly on the issue of programming in street cinemas that have fallen into decay and, in order to maintain audiences, resort to pornographic productions with little aesthetic value, a phenomenon replicated all over the world.Director Giuseppe Tornatore directs ""Cinema Paradiso"" with extreme elegance, through beautiful camera movements, like a tracking shot that begins with the crochet abandoned by Salvatore's mother (Antonella Attili, young, and Pupella Maggio, elderly) when he finally returns to home, past the window and the taxi, until finally finding the boy hugging his mother. Tornatore, by the way, abuses tracking shots and panoramic shots, competently exploring the beautiful landscapes of beautiful Italy, aided by the direction of photography by Blasco Giurato. The director also handles the tense sequence of the fire at Cinema Paradiso very well, started exactly when a shot would be fired in the passing film. Then the question ""Who will rebuild Cinema Paradiso?"" is answered with another camera movement, which points to the Neapolitan winner of the lottery. And he really built the ""Novo Cinema Paradiso"", starting a new phase in the city's cinema, now led by Toto, since Alfredo was seriously injured in the fire and lost his sight. In another moment, a simple but very symbolic movement takes place when Salvatore has confirmation of his father's death. Note how Tornatore takes the camera to a poster for ""...Gone with the Wind"", in a clear allusion to the physical resemblance between his father and Clark Gable that Alfredo had commented on earlier. Finally, Tornatore also zooms in on the beautiful scene in which Alfredo tells the story of the soldier who promised to wait a hundred days for his beloved, and which will be reflected in another beautiful sequence between Salvatore and his passion Elena (Agnese Nano).Tornatore also demonstrates a lot of competence in leading the actors, starting with the duo that leads the narrative formed by Toto and Alfredo, but interpreted by four different actors. Their friendly relationship begins with discussions about the boy's presence in the projection room and progresses to the purest feeling of respect and affection that accompanies both of them throughout their lives. To convey this sensation, it is essential that there is chemistry between the characters, and fortunately Philippe Noiret manages to establish this chemistry with all the actors who play Toto in his three phases, with special emphasis on childhood, experienced by Salvatore Cascio. The beginning of the friendship between Alfredo and the boy Toto is what determines the public's empathy with the duo. Also playing Salvatore are actors Marco Leonardi, in his teens, and Jacques Perrin, already in his adult phase and responsible for exciting moments in the feature. Upon hearing the news of Alfredo's death, the already adult Salvatore pretends to be no big deal, but when he turns to the side on the bed, his face clearly demonstrates the importance of that name and the impact of the news. The rain and the sad face dipped in the shadows make it clear to the viewer that this is someone really remarkable. With the absence of his father, clearly felt by the boy, it is in Alfredo that Toto sees his father figure, and that is why the boy becomes attached to that apparently grumpy figure, but charming in his essence and with a huge heart.At the same time, Alfredo adopts Salvatore as the son he didn't have and even if unconsciously, they complete each other. It is understandable, therefore, that living in a small Italian town in the post-war period, still without television and fatherless, the boy sees in the dark of the cinema (and in the company of Alfredo) the opportunity to escape reality and live a world of dreams. His life started to change definitively when he helped Alfredo in a test and got the right to attend the projection booth. From then on, he lived a magical period in his life. Alfredo's life would change completely after the tragedy of the fire in the old Cinema Paradiso. Unable to do what he loved most; he starts to have even more sensitivity to perceive the world around him. And Philippe Noiret's performance grows even more when Alfredo is blinded, transmitting even more emotion and competently exposing the character's feelings, as in a smile he lets out when he senses that Toto is going to see Elena inside the church. Antonio's importance in Salvatore's life is even more evident when we see him asking him to ""stay away"" and ""don't come back!"". Antonio understood that he could achieve much more in life by going to the big city (""The world is yours!""), which demonstrates a true love, which is not selfish and prefers Toto's happiness over keeping him tied to the world. By his side - and deep down, he knew that if he asked, Toto would stay. The boy kept his promise, staying thirty years without returning to the city, and on his return, he is seen with great respect by everyone, fulfilling Alfredo's dream - and even Tornatore's visual composition demonstrates this, filming Salvatore from the bottom up, demonstrating greatness.Tornatore's sensitivity also rewards the viewer with some incredibly beautiful sequences, such as Toto and Elena's first kiss, aided by the wonderful soundtrack and the flashes of the falling rain. Another touching moment comes when Salvatore returns to Cinema Paradiso. The small details found in the abandoned cinema, like the Lion's mouth from which the images were projected, are extremely important to him, after all, they are part of the memories of an important phase of his life. Life is made of these little memories and the film portrays this very well. In another scene, the people's tears as they see a part of the city's history and their lives go away with the implosion of Cinema Paradiso is heartbreaking. Hard to hold back the tears. Just as it is practically impossible to hold back the tears in the beautiful final sequence, when Toto watches the ""forbidden film"" left as a gift by Alfredo, with pieces of kissing scenes from great films in the history of Italian cinema.""Cinema Paradiso"" is a beautiful homage to the magic of cinema and therefore enchants the audience in a unique way. The great beauty of this great classic of world cinema, lies in its extreme sensitivity and simplicity. It is a work made, literally, of tears, which shed both in the plot and in the audience that watches it, in perfect harmony. A sentimental and irresistible film for those who allow themselves full emotion, on the edge of their skin. It hurts the heart, and soon after, it comforts it, as if it were a long, warm and tight hug from someone loved."
lkil,"Jun 24, 2004",N/A,"Cinema Paradiso is a magnificent film.  In spite of its at times somewhat sugarily charming indulgences, the movie contains a powerful element of tragedy.  As a director, Giuseppe Tornatore deals with his favorite subject, which our popular and public culture simply prefers to ignore and glance over -- the price of progress, the price of change.  Cinema Paradiso focuses on the torments of change, on the moral and emotional dilemmas which it raises.  Though, the overall spirit of the movie is life-affirming, the deeper message is masterfully broadcast to the viewer: superficial happiness of the present conceals under its thin veneer the tragedy of those we ""leave behind"" to slowly fade away into the mists of the ever more distant past. Salvatore's mother sums it up brilliantly when she refers to the people from Salvatore's past as ghosts.  The destruction of the cinema theatre at the end is yet another confirmation of the same message.  As the popular cliche would have it, ""life goes on.""  But we inevitably (whether justifiably or not -- could be endlessly debated) are forced to betray our past, to turn it to ruins (literally and figuratively) so that we could later on sweetly reminisce about it.  The lessons of this movie are multiple but one of the most important and frequently neglected is that of loyalty, of respecting, remembering and understanding those who lived, loved, suffered, thought, and fought before us.  Cinema Paradiso is about how much we owe to those who preceded us, who shaped us with their wisdom, who sacrificed for us (maybe naively), who allowed us to be what we are.  Let us REMEMBER!"
Nobody-27,"May 13, 2024",4/10,"There's not much that hasn't been said about this film. I will not try to convince anyone that this is a great film in almost every way.However, a film with a major thread being the love story of the protagonist (as reflected and evoked by the amazing last sequence) drops that same thread like it never happened! Why? First, the director put too much of the ending to it in its first incarnation. Then he shortened it, at which point it was great and that was the version I saw. But then, someone convinced the director that the one single second after the credits was still too much (How is tying up loose ends too much?), and that got taken out. What we are left with is a film that has the most stupid ending and after-the-credits revelation ever! We see the protagonist look up at something that gets his attention, and cut to black.That's it.If you never saw the version I saw, you are left wondering. ""What the heck did just happen? Can I see what he saw also?""
No, you can't.The first time I saw this latest and unfortunately the most popular version of the film, I thought I received an improperly made DVD. But ending was not done in error, it was fully intentional.Finally, after seeing that the good version is all but non-existent, I had to come here to warn others: yes, there is a great version of ""Cinema Paradiso"" out there, but no, it is not available anymore. If you can find the 1990s US NTSC VHS tape, you can see it, otherwise, you are out of luck. It is either the new, shortest version of this film with a bad ending, or the original, overly long version with also a bad ending (That version did poorly in theaters which is why it was shortened).Ah, the ruinous nature of never-ending fiddling with a good film. With the all important one second shot at the end of the credit, right after the protagonist looks up at something, it is a perfect 10. As it is, the film is lacking the single most important shot and does not deserve the praise it gets."
sfworthington,"Aug 4, 2021",9/10,"Life imitates art, art imitates life. Life inspires art, art inspires life. Cinema influences life and life influences cinema.This film feels like a dream, a beautiful dream. When you love cinema, seeing a film like this is just a truly magical experience. Just seeing a character's face lit up from the light of a cinema screen sends floods of nostalgia and emotion through you, it's so incredibly visceral even though technically not much is done at all. It's a sentimental story that speaks for itself and tells itself flawlessly. It really is engaging from start to finish, you go on a journey with the characters and hope everything turns out well for them, that's a basic requirement of any good film but with these characters you're invested in their lives' right from the get go. The beauty of cinema is a major stimulant to this film but along with that we also get a thoughtful coming of age story along with a lovely exploration into friendship and what we gain as well as lose throughout our lives'. The film-making is seamless with Morricone's breathtaking score, which as always matches the emotions of the narrative and the characters so perfectly. There are also multiple brilliantly framed shots which on their own have the ability to evoke so much emotion, let alone in the context of the film when we have already built such a strong connection to what we are watching."
