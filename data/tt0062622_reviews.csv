doomedmac,"Apr 10, 2020",8/10,"I'm EXTREMELY conflicted about this movie. I hate it, but it's amazing. I won't ever watch it again, but it's groundbreaking. I can't recommend it, but you have to see it."
simon_booth,"Jun 17, 2003",10/10,"Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species.  For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as ""boring"" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making.  Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority.  Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic.  This is the film that put the science in ""science fiction"", and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day.  It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film.  The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes).  The film's greatest strength is in the details.  Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey.  To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can't work out how some of the shots were done.  The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development.  It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick's.Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going.  Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future.  Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue.  There's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel.  I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.I'm glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher.  Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10."
Cain47,"Nov 16, 2001",10/10,"I'm always surprised, given that the famous title track of 2001 is called ""Also sprach Zarathustra"", that nobody (nobody I've read, anyway) has noted the parallels between the movie and Nietzsche's famous work, ""Also sprach Zarathustra"". The idea of man's rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of N.'s ""Zarathustra""; there is a prominent passage called ""On how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child"", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel; always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that ""man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman."" The structure of the movie fits that description: a brief history of man as beast, until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, as it were), and then a brief glimpse of the overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in ""Zarathustra"", he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to ""go under"". Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as Kubrick's best 1960's-style attempt at depicting the mystical ""going under"".I know these parallels are pretty broad, and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I have not personally seen it. But I just wanted to mention them, if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy, and it is in my opinion, explicitly and unmistakeably Nietzschean. The case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of ""Zarathustra"" updated for the modern age. Feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to Nietzsche."
mmt02,"Jun 3, 1999",10/10,"Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is  the greatest cinema experience of all time:  1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen.  The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most  stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow  Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate)  depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space  scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds  to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL).  The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is  a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original  release, it was a favorite ""trip"" movie. I can think of no other movie  that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry  Phantom Menace fans!)  2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick  likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his  characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such  as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces  are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M  and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the  audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of  HAL's glowing red ""eye"" to show the coldness and determination of the  computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the  hieght of his style.  3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I  whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000.  Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and  the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and  his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to  escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000  and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although  having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a  particular scene.  4) The controversial  ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of  trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of  2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the  ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he  inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the  hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick  allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful  discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is  that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely  plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an  entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great  Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly  meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the  mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a  widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience."
Manthorpe,"Jan 5, 2005",10/10,"A review I have put off for far too long....Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.Very highly recommended."
Don-102,"Mar 7, 1999",10/10,"I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.Aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed."
briancham1994,"Aug 10, 2020",6/10,"Count me as one of the philistines who is too simple-minded to appreciate this so-called masterpiece. Actually, I have a degree in media studies and a great interest in science, science fiction and anything thought-provoking (the technical term is ""need for cognition""). But I am just baffled by this film and why it is so esteemed. It is simply slow, empty and lifeless. When absolutely nothing is happening on screen, am I supposed to feel or think something profound? Even when my professor explicitly explained to me why this film is so great, I still cannot convince myself that it is so."
aaronjohn-caudill,"Aug 19, 2022",5/10,"I decided to give this movie a shot since it's supposed to be an amazing piece of filmmaking and a classic. If you've read any other negative reviews then you've heard other people complain about how boring, slow paced and pretentious it is. The plot is a big question mark and there are scenes that draw on for an eternity. Add in numerous scenes with ear piercing noice and sound effects, it's just a really unenjoyable movie. Isn't the point of watching a movie to be entertained and enjoy ourselves?? I forced myself to sit through this and it felt like work, like I should be getting paid.I can't completely trash it though. It's incredibly beautiful visually. I can't believe a movie this old has such good effects and looks this good. The sets are also very impressive.All in all though, I can't ever recommend this to anyone. I wish I hadn't wasted 2+ hours on it. The first 15 minutes is either black screen, silence, or apes screeching at each other for god sakes. This is a movie that ""deep"" people claim to like to make themselves seem more cultured. Deuce Bigalo is 100 times more enjoyable. But to each their own I guess."
Doylenf,"Jun 17, 2002",N/A,"There are two schools of thought about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  One, is that it is the greatest science-fiction epic ever made. This is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the Star Child ending. The others, like myself, find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.The musical background is glorious, the colors are dazzling, and there's an interesting use of HAL as a villainous computer. Beyond that, there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals), the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space), and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.I had the same letdown feeling when I watched THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE, so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste. Intellectuals will take the position that you are a mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion of the movie--so be aware that this is not conventional story-telling in any sense whatsoever and only for those who admire Stanley Kubrick's way with unlikely cinematic material."
tapioylinen,"Feb 7, 2000",10/10,"I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.The Space Odyssey is not something one can just ""go and see"". One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact I don't think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring 'Also spracht Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss and 'Blue Danube' by Johann Strauss.Take all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film. If it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well.Or maybe I'm just plain crazy..."
Lechuguilla,"Feb 6, 2005",10/10,"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We ""see"" our primordial past, and we ""infer"" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. For perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think the sleek, black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. Mystery is more profound than explanation.""2001 ... "" is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word ""masterpiece"" to describe a movie. But Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"", or Vincent Van Gogh's ""The Starry Night""."
alexcole10,"Jun 13, 2020",10/10,"2001: A Space Odyssey is my favourite film of all time for simply one reason: the ending. Kubrick's ambiguous finish to this suspenseful trip will leave you debating and theorising its purpose for a long time.Further positive aspects include its eerie score and music throughout (notably at the beginning), the visually pleasing aesthetic, and contrastingly the use of silence to truly prove that ""no one can hear you scream in space.""I strongly recommend watching this film in a dark room with no distractions in order to achieve the full cinematic experience, and hopefully it will not disappoint."
indraya,"Aug 29, 2002",10/10,"This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning. The film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions. It is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. The film is great by itself, yet, in my case, the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book. I've read it at the age of 10, really not thinking about problems like 'what is the relationship between evolution of humankind and development of human morality'. But the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction.The day I learned '2001' got only special effects Oscar and was not even nominated for the Best Picture was the day when 'Academy Award' completely became two words meaning nothing to me."
Xstal,"Nov 22, 2022",8/10,"There's a monolith that seeks to influence, the evolution of the simian confluence, teaching apes how to compete, how to kill to get their meat, all leading to, a lunar revolution. On the moon, another block has been discovered, the apes now have the means to open wings and smother, it's to Jupiter they go, what they'll find nobody knows, but it doesn't seem to fill primates with dread. To protect they have a powerful A. I., it misses nothing, and nothing passes by, everything will not be fine, if you rely on an airline, as it watches with satanic, evil eye. At Jupiter, Darwin gets dispatched, down kaleidoscopic, psychedelic hatch, death brings birth and birth brings earth, a giant foetus wants to berth, I'm not sure hominins will make much of a match.A perpetually engrossing film that offers more conundrums than conclusions, your interpretations uniquely your own, but the scale, cinematography and concepts are truly out of this world."
diamond-31,"Mar 3, 2001",10/10,"Like a Circle around the human condition, 2001 starts at the beginning, skips the middle, and proceeds to the ending, right back where we started. Noting the weakness of words compared to image(s), Kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenery, and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering.  Or not, depending on the audience.A monolith in cinematic history, 2001 is a high water mark of direction, execution, and achievement.  If one considers the ambition of the film (a film about everything), and the measure of success the film achieved to that end, a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made."
gavin6942,"Dec 1, 2014",6/10,"Humanity finds a mysterious, obviously artificial, object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the intelligent computer H.A.L. 9000, sets off on a quest.Saying that ""2001"" is overrated is the sort of statement that can bring down hatred and vitriol from science fiction fans, Kubrick fans and more. Of course, it is possible to be a Kubrick fan and still generally dislike this film.Nobody can deny that this film is visually stunning, and a landmark in imagery. It also has the advantage of being the last film about space travel to be released before the moon landing, making it somewhat prescient in a way.But yet, does it need to be so long, so grand, with the music and long shots? Perhaps not quite ""pretentious"", but the film presents itself as being more important than it really is. Critics at the time (1968) denounced the film, and perhaps they were right. At the very least, two cuts could be made: a longer one for die-hard fans, and a shorter one for casual viewers."
sol-,"Jan 3, 2005",10/10,"A whimsical, often spectacular view of a future in which advances in technology dominate the world. It is well shot and although slow-moving it is intense and enjoyable throughout. The featuring of classical music to establish atmosphere works brilliantly; it provides a feeling of awe, mystery and intrigue  the same aura that Walt Disney worked in creating 'Fantasia'. The special effects, both sound and visual, are still spellbinding by the standards of today's technology. Aside from the technical pluses of the film, it stands strong as it is one of not many films out there that has something important to say about humankind, and where the human race is heading in terms of our increasing reliance on machines and our unquenchable thirst to discover. Despite an ending that is hard to understand, it is even harder to overlook this film a true cinema classic."
SuperMegaTont,"Jul 3, 2025",6/10,"The novel on which this is based is okay and could have been the basis for a sci-fi film classic. However, while 2001: A Space Odyssey is recognised by critics and possibly fans as such, it is not for me.Insightful commentary on what it means to be human, evolution and our place in the universe, the dangers of artificial intelligence and loneliness are all undermined by extended CGI scenes of a spacecraft slowly and beautifully floating through space set to famous classical music. It's massively self-indulgent.A 30min story crammed into 150min film - there's almost two films here, one a relaxing almost meditative experience and the other a pared back true sci-fi movie. They make unpalatable bedfellows.It's worth seeing, but it's one I doubt will be often revisited and is one of the weakest of Kubrick's films."
lcwtq,"Dec 3, 2024",4/10,"5 minutes of a blank screen followed by 15 minutes of men dressed as chimpanzees screaming at each other, an hour of nothing happening, half hour that is slightly interesting and another half hour of a bad acid trip.Out of well over 100 ratings on IMDb I have never felt compelled to wright a review before, until now.I felt very let down by this movie given its hype. Yes the special effects still hold up to this day and it is quite pleasing visually, however that's no excuse for the complete lack of substance.There is absolutely no character development and basically no story. The most interesting character is the AI computer HAL. The scenes drag on endlessly and the audio is terrible. 3-4 minutes scenes sometimes longer of nothing with horrible jarring audio over the top of them. I would bet you could fit all the dialogue for the entire movie on a few pages.Anyone that claims to understand this movie is lying, there is nothing to understand, it's complete nonsense. Even Kubrick's reasoning for the ending sounds like he made it up on the spot.I am a huge sci-fi fan and given that this movie is credited as being one of the origin's of the genre, so well respected with fantastic reviews I was expecting so much more. 2+ hours of my life I will never get back."
CinemaClown,"Sep 2, 2013",N/A,"Putting the science in science-fiction, 2001: A Space Odyssey is an unprecedented, undisputed & unparalleled achievement, and a landmark moment in cinema history, for it nearly killed its genre by setting the bar so high that it hasn't been equalled or challenged ever since. Universally & unanimously hailed as one of the greatest & most influential films ever made, it is without a doubt Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus."
FourHundredaYear,"Apr 11, 2005",10/10,"In late 1968, I got my dad to drive me to Hollywood (I was ten) to see ""2001"" during its roadshow engagement. Earlier that year, during a family trip to San Francisco, we had stopped to eat at a Howard Johnson's diner, and with our meal I had received a comic book promoting the film (if you'll remember, one of Kubrick's less astute predictions was that Howard Johnson's would be the food franchise on the Space Station). After the mind-blowing revelation of that comic book, I suffered through four or five months waiting for my chance to see it.It took two tries. The first try was the weekend that the Apollo 7 mission became the first to circle the moon. My dad took not only me but also my mom and six-year-old brother. We drove the thirty miles to Hollywood......only to find that ""2001"" was sold out.Quickly we checked the paper for a suitable alternative. There was an ad for another interesting looking sci-fi film playing just a few blocks up Hollywood Boulevard... ""Barbarella."" This was literally just a week or two before the ratings system went into affect, so the only way we had to judge the suitability of the subject matter was by the ad, which was illustrated with goofy, fun-looking cartoons. ""I wanna see Bar-bella!"" my brother cried excitedly. It looked good to me too. So off we went.Try to imagine sitting next to your fairly prudish mother in 1968, watching -- without any warning -- Jane Fonda's zero-gravity striptease. And then every stripe of fetishism and polymorphous perversity, under only the thinnest satirical sci-fi camouflage. I remember afterward, out in the lobby, my dad kneeling by my sniffling brother, gently explaining ""Those dolls couldn't really have been biting her,- they COULDN'T really bite her because their teeth were angled inward, if they were really going to bite her their teeth would have had to angle OUT, so you see...""But I digress.On our second try, dad took just me. This time we got in. The theater was huge, with dark red curtains. The screen was huge, but thankfully not deeply curved like a Cinerama screen. (Over the decades since then, I have seen ""2001"" several times at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, where the screen IS deeply curved. Every time the spaceship Discovery is shown from the side, it curves up at the ends like a smile. By the nature of its visual geometry ""2001"" was meant to be seen on a FLAT screen.)The overture began, weird otherworldly sounds like I'd never heard before, as the auditorium lights slowly dimmed. And then, that amazing stylized MGM logo, created specifically for ""2001"" and never used at the head of any other film (although MGM did later adopt it for a time as their corporate logo). And then the thrilling swell of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" and that awesome lineup of the moon, the Earth and the Sun! An image like nothing ever seen before on a movie screen. Or in real life either: ""2001"" was showing us vistas of our solar system that NASA photography had yet to capture even approximately.Half the time I had no idea what was going on. But I didn't care. To me it seemed like a film FROM the year 2001. I was enthralled, and goaded to TRY to understand. More than any other film I can think of, ""2001"" really lived up to that oft-misused cliché phrase: it ""made me think.""Driving home that night, I remember doing the math: in 2001 I'll be forty-three. I'll SEE all that!My dad died in 2001."
TheLittleSongbird,"Oct 19, 2010",10/10,"To me, this is not only Kubrick's best film but also a milestone of the genre. It is quite long at around two and a quarter hours, and it is slow, that I agree with. But it is never boring, well not to me it isn't. Besides, and this is up to interpretation, but I think the slow pacing is deliberate, it adds to the haunting and eerie quality 2001 has and also to assimilate every shot which speak volumes, and also 2001's greatest strength is actually in the details.The story is somewhat abstract in its structure but is also quite complex, innovative and interesting yet has a simple message, and the screenplay and direction by Kubrick are superb. The acting is not the film's best asset, but it is good enough, with Douglas Rain the standout as the voice of HAL 9000 as he is really quite brilliant. Two things especially make 2001 so good. One are the visuals- even after all those years they are simply outstanding. The cinematography is indeed splendid, as are the colours and settings, but there are so many memorable images. The images of the giant Starchild floating through space and the tribe of apes painfully putting two and two together still resonate considerably even now. The other is the music. Coming from a big classical music enthusiast, I was delighted by the use of Also Sprach Zarathustra and On the Beautiful Blue Danube and how they combined with the visuals were exceedingly clever.Overall, this is a truly wonderful film that is worth seeing for the visuals and music alone and still continues to intrigue and perplex with the ending. As much as I like Oliver and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, two of my childhood favourites, and the brilliant Lion in Winter to me this is it... the best film of 1968. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
ebloomberg,"Jan 28, 2019",6/10,"I just saw this again today on TCM, and it still leaves me empty. This movie is very well artistically made, but it's also very slow and boring. The most important part of the movie is HAL, but that's about it. There are other visually stylish movies which don't have great acting, such as Blade Runner, but at least that movie has sort of an interesting story. I must admit that I do like it because it is slow and visually artistic. This is only because it's very cold outside, and watching it in bed allows me to doze off here and there. If one were paying money to sit in a movie theater and expected to stay alert, I think many would have a hard time with it."
DeathFish,"Jan 2, 2007",10/10,"This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. But nonetheless I was really, and I mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was in true Kubrick style amazing and enchanting. It feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though I had seen the rating before I bought it. But this movie has more to it than this. The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, even though I think there are some clear points concerning humanity (also true Kubrick style). How humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of humanities tools. How we in space appear like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero-gravity, breathing through equipment as fish out of water. On the peak of evolution, we set out into the never-ending adventure as simple primates. Many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. But before you can jump to those conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. This is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, this requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. All of this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me."
simbiat,"Jan 2, 2025",5/10,"I'll probably wake up in a gutter tomorrow after sharing this opinion, but this is not a good movie.If I consider the time when it was filmed - yes, I can see how groundbreaking it was visually. It still looks amazing (at least in 4K), and holds up extremely well, since all affects were practical ones, and of high quality, and they meshed with ""real life"" seamlessly. At the time it was an extraordinary feat, for sure.It also a unique atmosphere. Those ""silent"" moments, long panning - they do make it feel more ""real"". Amount of details also adds to that. And I am not talking about clutter (although that, too, to an extent), but rather amount of actions that are taken by characters when they are doing something. It is, indeed, realistic, and at the time it would also be considered a huge spectacle because of that.But while these things certainly mean a good art piece in general, I am not sure if they mean ""a good movie"". At least, to me a ""good movie"" implies a good story as well. This is more like a set of concepts with a lot of padding, that does not really deliver anything. That may be fine sometimes (I think ""Room 104"" had a few episodes like that, and possibly ""Black Mirror"", too, and those episodes worked fine as standalones). But I felt like this movie was trying to be more.The way it is structured suggests that it is trying to tell a story, first showing the ""background of the world"" (kind of), then zooming to a small piece of that world, and then zooming out again. It implies something of large scale being affected (or at least being carried out) by something small and seemingly insignificant. Conceptually it sounds fine. ""Lord of the Rings"" is kind of similar in a way. Or ""Dune"". And both of those are found boring by some people.But LOTR and Dune are ""boring"" because they tell too much information about the world (world-building), while Odyssey tells you... How people are watching news. Or piloting a shuttle or whatever. Which, to be fair, can be interesting for some, but it does not progress a story or bring any extra understanding or appreciation of the world of the story.And no, this is not because the movie is philosophical or anything. It tries to be, yes, but can't say it succeeds, but that's debatable, of course. I think main problem is that it focuses too much on mundane actions in a fantastical setting, that it loses its focus. It's like you are watching a reality-show like ""Big Brother"" or something, but instead of interesting interactions between the players you see how people are just reading books, listening to music or maybe assemble some furniture. Those are meaningful for the players, but not for you, the viewer.So, yeah, I get why it is an important piece of art. But as a movie I'd say its too niche than media wants you to believe, because it's not as entertaining as it could be."
rooprect,"Jan 25, 2012",10/10,"If the Earth was about to blow up and I could choose only 1 film to survive us, it would definitely be this. What's funny is ""2001"" isn't even my favourite movie. But I believe it tells the story of humankind better than anything else I've ever seen on the big screen. Essentially it asks the age old question ""what is the meaning of life?"", and for my money, it provides a very satisfying answer.What makes it such a phenomenal work of art is that it is able to address some of the most divisive, incompatible human attitudes (in particular, religion) and present us with a model that we ALL can accept. Judeo-Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Scientologists, Fundamentalists, Existentialists, Atheists and even Satanists can find truth in this film because it applies no labels. Like the mysterious yet commanding ""black box"" that appears in the film, it remains exactly that: a sealed black box which can be anything we choose to see.The black box may represent God. Or it may represent science. Or it may represent history. Or it may represent individuality. Make up your own mind, and you will learn a little something of yourself. Really, this movie is like a puzzle with infinite solutions, designed to teach us about ourselves by what we see in it. It's truly interactive. No other film has ever made me feel this way.The plot is almost irrelevant, so I won't bother summarizing. What you should pay attention to are the themes and questions the movie addresses.1) Are we alone in the universe? 2) Is there a point to life? 3) Are we heading in the right direction?By the time the movie ends, you should have an answer to all three, and yet all our answers will be different.SO WHAT THE HECK IS THE MOVIE ABOUT? OK, since you've read this far, I'll give you an idea. The movie is about evolution. Not just your Darwinian natural selection stuff, but a compelling proposal that evolution was (or continues to be?) guided by some extraordinary force. If you like, this is the marriage of God & science that we've all been waiting for. Or if you like, it's a testament to pure science. Or pure God. Like I said, Kubrick allows for every possibility. And I have to hand it to him for remaining so tight-lipped that nobody ever knew what his personal feelings were on the matter.The film starts in prehistoric times with a tribe of moribund ape-like creatures on the edge of either extinction or excellence. Then we jump ahead a million years or so to find humans in a similar state of stagnation yet on the edge of another fantastic evolutionary step forward. Finally we jump forward to catch a glimpse of what evolution may have in store for us in the not-too-distant future. If it sounds like a documentary, I suppose it almost is, except without Marlon Perkins talking over it. We are expected to fill in the details ourselves, and that is the beauty of what this film does. It takes a purely objective approach and manages to lead us to our own satisfying conclusions.A word of caution. I don't think you're supposed to ""get"" this film on one viewing. I certainly didn't, and I've never met anyone who did. Even Roger Ebert (who ranks this as the greatest film of all time) was initially lukewarm about it when it premiered in '68. So if you feel like you just got cheated, or if you have no idea what everyone's raving about, please be patient and give it some time to sink in. I saw this movie when I was 16 and loved the middle part but hated the ending. Decades later I saw it again and suddenly understood it better. But I confess there's still a lot I haven't realized. I suppose as I get older and hopefully wiser I'll continue to interpret new ideas. And that's why this is the greatest movie of all time. It is about evolution, and moreso it EVOLVES WITH US."
Torgo_Approves,"Aug 19, 2006",10/10,"(r#54)Only Stanley Kubrick could create a film like 2001. It is unlike anything made before or after it and whether you like it or not, it is an unforgettable experience. I urge anyone who disliked this film to give it at least one more chance - I can honestly say that the film was way too far off the wall for me to appreciate it the first time I watched it.2001 is overflowing with iconic images, from the opening scene accompanied by Richard Strauss' ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"", to the bone being tossed into the air by the ape. It has become such a huge phenomenon that even today TV series, movies, parodies and comics continue to spoof it. It is impossible to hear The Blue Danube without associating it to Kubrick's masterpiece. And that is what it is, in every sense of the word: a masterpiece. Nothing is half-baked or average about 2001 - it is a work of enormous attention to detail and love for the art of movie-making itself. Although Kubrick continued to direct amazing movies like The Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket (which were all far more accessible movies) after 2001, he couldn't top this: his crowning achievement.It's easy to see how viewers may be put off by 2001 - it doesn't follow the usual movie formula where the plot comes to a conclusion at the end. In fact, neither before nor after 2001 has a movie been made the same way. Plot line and characters are more or less redundant in this film: It's all in the images and music, and what it all means. I won't go into the point of 2001 since I haven't read the book and I think it is up to each viewer to decide for himself what it all means.The movie jumps from the very dawn of man's use of weapons to a time when space is heavily trafficked, and continues to show us the fate of some unlucky astronauts at the hands of a super-intelligent computer called HAL-9000. I won't spoil what happens in the end but I will say that if you could see it coming, you must be some kind of super genius; as far as I'm concerned it is the single least predictable ending for a movie, ever.Kubrick is the only director that I know of who has portrayed space in the most realistic way possible: vast, endless, dark, empty, and soundless. It's admirable that a director goes out of his way to make sure no sounds are heard in space, but rather than let this make the movie dreary and dull, Kubrick uses this to his advantage: the chilling silence of some scenes actually help build up the atmosphere in a way that no movie has done before. Some scenes are outright scary, working at an almost subconscious level. Kubrick has always been a master of creating moods and emotions with the viewer, and 2001 is the prime example of this: The climactic scene in the bathroom is unbelievably frightening, and Kubrick creates a sense of dread purely without monsters, murderers or loud music. It's amazing.The movie is highly meditative and definitely not the one to watch if you want a loud, action-packed Star Wars-type adventure. The long periods of near-complete silence, the low-key dialogue, HAL's monotonous voice (a stroke of genius) and the scattered pieces of classical music set you in a state of complete relaxation and makes you think. I realize this is highly personal and will not work for all viewers.The special effects are pitch-perfect, still as good today as they were almost 40 years ago. While the digital effects of the Star Wars prequels will be outdated in 10 years, 2001 will continue to stun people with its shockingly realistic and believable effects. Although I would have preferred Kubrick to win the Best Director Oscar for this (as well as many of his other films), the Best Effects award is completely deserved. 2001 still beats many of today's movies in terms of best effects.If you've grown tired of mediocre movies, give 2001 another chance. At first viewing, I thought it was tiresome and drawn out. At second viewing, it was the most perfect movie ever made. If you're open minded, this is for you, if Pirates of the Caribbean is your favourite movie of all time, it's not - and I don't say this to insult fans of Pirates, I'm just saying that this film might not be up your alley.I hope I don't sound too pretentious because I know how horrible many of 2001's rabid fans can be. I know for sure that it is not certain you'll enjoy 2001 - but I urge you to give it a chance. It is the ultimate acquired taste, and in my opinion, a masterpiece of epic proportions."
phenommatty,"Apr 22, 2008",8/10,"I have seen thousands of films ranging from foolish humor such as harold and kumar to brilliance like Requiem for a Dream. I've been wanting to see this film for years and after building my new home theater I deemed that this would be the film I would use for its opening.Wow.I found myself fast forwarding (Something I've never done in a film) through many of the so called 'visual masterpiece's' If it wasn't for HAL I would have broke this garbage into a thousand pieces. Don't get me wrong I love every other one of Kubrick's films, he just missed on this one..terrible."
bkoganbing,"Feb 6, 2009",8/10,"What the meaning of the black monolith is in 2001: A Space Odyssey has been puzzling moviegoers for generations. I confess I haven't any better idea than any of the others who have written on this board. I guess Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Clarke wanted everyone to make their own evaluation. A little more evidence could have helped.The awesome visual affects of 2001 for which the film won its only Oscar in 1968 have blinded a lot of viewers to the ultimate incomprehensibility of the plot. That big black rock means something a whole lot different to the prehistoric caveman than to the futuristic astronauts. To one it means power, the other understanding. It's like some all powerful creator has left this touchstone for mankind to take another leap forward.The film begins with the cave people who are struggling to survive against animal creatures who are better equipped than they are for dominance. But contact with the rock, so glaringly out of place from the surroundings awakens the latent intelligence in the cave folk and they stage a comeback against their foes. It's the beginning of man's dominance.In the biggest fast forward in screen history, we are now in the future and another of these things has been discovered on a moon of Jupiter, the first sign of intelligent life away from earth. Scientists Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood and three other scientists in cryogenic suspension are sent to investigate. Remember we haven't discovered warp drive yet.Civilization may have taken too far a leap forward because these guys are in the hands of an all powerful computer named HAL who controls the ship and their very lives by definition. What's supposed to be a tool for man now is his dominator.When man does come in contact with that monolith on a Jupiter moon, my own interpretation is that the contact represents an all powerful creator telling man to reflect on what he has achieved and to warn him to not go too fast forward in the future. The monoliths represent signposts, like checkpoints in a race to God only knows what end.I'm always leery of rating a film like 2001 too high when the plot is so vague and speculative. But the special effects and Kubrick's use of classical music to create that space ballet just so dwarf the human beings involved, in effect the film itself is a warning. And all that music was in the public domain so MGM didn't have to lay out big bucks for a composer.I always favor story over spectacle which is why I can never give 2001: A Space Odyssey the highest rating. But when the spectacle is as awesome as what Stanley Kubrick gives us, you just sit there amazed.Of course 2001 came and went and instead of reaching for the rest of the solar system and beyond, mankind regressed into barbarism with the most notable event being a planned massed murder. Mankind needs to touch the monolith and make another leap forward. Maybe Kubrick should have looked farther ahead and called his film, 2101: A Space Odyssey.I hope we touch the monolith before that."
Willtur,"Aug 11, 2009",6/10,"I'm sorry for the lopsided rating but this movie needs to be dropped down a peg from it's absurd status on the IMDb 250. How this ever got lumped in the other great Kubrick movies I will never know. In Dr. Strangelove you had an awesome dialog about war and with A Clockwork you had a look at violence and rehabilitation as well as many other things.In 2001 you have a look at monkeys for 12 or so minutes. Everyone gets it. It's not hard to get, it's pretty, it has some smart writing but the lack of editing is like watching someones life from beginning to end. 2001: An Eternity would be more fitting. I know some people will say you know what it's perfect, every minute had to be there. That's fine I wouldn't want to rob you of your monkey action or your ship docking sequences but I swear you could do this movie in a short and not lose the message.Maybe that was the point, To do a movie with space imagery and a ton of sunrise images that you can play you're enigma CD with the lights dimmed low as you try and woe some woman with your impressive movie watching resume. Whatever the case this movie shouldn't be uttered in the same breath as his other movies, they actually have content.Knowing his work and picking this one over the rest would be like picking Bad Boys 2 over The Third Man, Eye candy over substance."
akdjreview,"Dec 18, 2021",6/10,"To be frankly honest most people will be disappointed with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Including myself. It's boring, but that doesn't change the fact it's one of the most beautiful films ever made.To like and enjoy the story you must be a huge interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. Because it's not an enjoyable storyline. It's incredibly boring, and you don't even find out about the storyline until after it has happened. Also, the first 20 minutes were the most unnecessary I've ever seen in a movie.But it's beautiful. Probably one of the most beautiful films ever made. With incredible shots of space and amazing use of lightning that is so shocking considering it was released in 1968.I don't recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey if you are not a big science, technology etc. But if you just want something beautiful you should watch it."
heath01,"Nov 1, 2008",N/A,"I just watched 2001 on TMC (one of many viewings over the past 20 years or more). I've always liked the movie, and I've always appreciated the symbolism and art of the movie, and I've always felt that this movie is largely under-appreciated by most people. But I still have to say that there are places where this movie is just too dog-gone slow. The non-dialogue, artsy-type scenes of this movie could be cut as much as in half or more at times without really affecting the overall mood and communication of symbolism.For example, the scene where Dave travels through space & time at the end - does it really have to drag on as long as it does? Or is this just a chance to show a 1968 audience some really groovy psychedelic effects? The extended version of this movie has no dialogue for the first 45 minutes! Yes, 45 minutes! OK, we get it. Dawn of man. Monolith appears. Intelligence is sparked in primitive man. Man uses intelligence to fashion tools for hunting, crafting, and killing each other. We get it. Next scene, please.Well, that's enough comment from me. I have to go take my ritalin now. ;-)"
inkblot11,"Sep 24, 2025",10/10,"The film, based on a short story by legendary writer Arthur C Clarke, opens in prehistoric times on Earth. A monolith appears as Cave era men gather nearby. Soon, these men can use tools to further advancement. Abruptly, the time changes to 2001. Another monolith has been uncovered on the Moon. It's emitting signals to Jupiter. 5 astronauts, three in hibernation, are sent on a journey to the 5th planet. One is Dave - Keir Dullea. Also onboard is HAL 9000, a supercomputer who has never been wrong. A piece of equipment malfunctions, opening the door to major complications. Soon it's HAL vs Dave. Who will survive? This mind blowing film has a fantastic story and special effects. It asks the viewer to ponder ideas and possible conclusions. It influenced dozens of other films, with the catch phrase I have a bad feeling about this. Also significant is man vs AI. HERE is a film not to miss."
kinolieber,"May 20, 2001",10/10,"I find the divergent comments about this film quite interesting. It's either a masterpiece and suprmely involving or it's a worthless boring fake. I think if you were in a Cinerama theatre and had the experience that Kubrick intended, there would be no doubt that you had just seen one of the great films of all time. The pacing of this film is absolutely dependent upon the overwhelming size of the image and the detail of the soundtrack. There is no way to describe in words the power of the first time I heard the Zarathustra theme in a Cinerama theatre. It went way beyond what you would experience even in a concert hall since the music surrounded you and the volume and fidelity were simply overwhelming. This is a film that had people shaking and giddy following the title card! And so it goes for the rest of the film. What may seem slow and uneventful on a video screen was just what was required for an audience to absorb all the visual and aural information. Those stills for example, at the start of the film were accompanied by desert sounds that were so real you expected a cricket to hop out from under your seat. And the long sequences outside the Jupiter ship involving the AE35 unit are entirely engrossing and set one up for the silent horror that ensues.I just watched the film again for the I don't know how manyth time, and every time I see it I am surprised by threads I never noticed. This time I was amazed that the film is so much about murder. Murder as the basis for evolution, murder of humans by machines, murder of machines by humans. And has there ever been a greater metaphor for our technology dominated society that the sequence of the man jogging in his giant squirrel cage while the saddest music you have ever heard plays on the soundtrack?"
Andrew-Critchley,"Feb 28, 2006",10/10,"I can't remember when or where I first saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, probably because it is just so stunning. It epitomises grace, both visually and intellectually, and more than any other film it perfectly articulates the true purpose of science fiction.Every film (if not art in general) is ultimately an exploration of the human condition; but whereas so much Sci-Fi is simply a stylistic treatment of another genre (typically the Western) 2001 explores concepts that no other genre could - and that is what Science Fiction is for, stepping beyond what we have in order to better understand it. Exactly what 2001 explores is unclear, as the endless debates and its notorious ending make, well, perfectly clear; but if it is meant to do no more than stimulate thought then it achieves greatly.If Fantasy and Horror represent the imaginative then Science Fiction is the philosophic, but only the greatest examples rise to the challenge and that happens too rarely. Blade Runner (Sci-Noir, but anyway) is one of the few, questioning another facet of human nature, again doing so without resorting to blunt explanation when eloquent ambiguity communicates much more powerfully. So too Metropolis, the Citizen Kane of Sci-Fi; but compare these with The Matrix Trilogy (Kung-Fi), which had the potential to be both accessible and thought provoking but finally delivered only glossy nonsense.As well as breaking technological boundaries in its production, 2001 remains the strongest example of ""hard"" Sci-Fi for its scientific realism and the wholly convincing portrayal of future technology - human level, of course. Not just in the obvious hardware of the space age but also for HAL 9000, undoubtedly the most authentic representation of AI in either film or reality.I love this film. Over the years I read Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey novels and found them more or less enjoyable, but the original film remains the pinnacle. When much younger I liked 2010 (A Space Idiocy...) which can only be regarded as a children's primer and was out-grown long ago, but there really can be no comparison between them, maybe with any other film at all. Stanley Kubrick was painterly in his style, but I think 2001 more than any other demonstrates the purest work of his imagination. A masterpiece unconstrained by the world that spawned it.As I write these words, 1040 other people have already had their say and I can only assume that no-one else will ever read this. Sadly I'm not patient enough to wait for another 960 to do the same, so the ultimate 2001: A Space Odyssey commentary will have to go to someone else. I hope they like it very much."
Neal Wruck,"Sep 22, 2001",10/10,"As I read all the negative reviews for 2001: A Space Odyssey (On Amazon. Com), I begin to wonder as to what kind of morons people can be today. In today's society, an acceptable film has to be fast paced and highly entertaining (Just look at the Oscar results of the past five years). They don't have to have a plot or a purpose. But it was the reviewer on Amazon who said he was happy that Stanley Kubrick was dead that really got me mad.The day that Kubrick died was a dark one for American cinema. Few directors alive today have the guts to try something new and imaginative. It's all sequels to hit movies (American Pie 2, Rush Hour 2, Jurassic Park 3) or remakes of old classics (Planet Of The Apes). 2001 was bold. It was a challenge. It was something new. It defied every set standard of Science Fiction films, from its unconventional narrative to its use of classical music. It showed that you do not need to have lots of dialogue to express ideas or emotions. Images can be just as powerful. And 2001 is unthinkable today without the power and excitement of Thus Spoke Zarathustra or the waltzes of Strauss The Blue Danube. 2001 critics also say that the humans are boring and `By the Book', while HAL the computer is sympathetic and interesting. That was Kubrick's purpose: The mechanizing of the human and the humanization of the machine (Another example would be the two airplanes in the opening of Dr. Strangelove).I have also read reviews of people who claim the movie is boring and complain that scenes take too long. Without the Dawn of Man ape scenes, would you really know what the hell was going on? It would start suddenly with a ship in space. It would still be, in your words, Lame! The docking scenes take five to ten minutes because that is how long it takes to dock a ship! It is not like in Armageddon or Star Wars where it takes just a second. These men are professional airline (Or spaceline?) pilots who are also carrying a cargo of passengers. They sure are not going to risk their lives just to arrive on time. Things are also slow moving in space because of gravitational forces and because it is a sterile and empty environment.Other morons also talk about how Boring the Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite scenes are and how pointless they are. The Star Gate Dave Bowman goes through is the Grand Central Station of the aliens (A highway you could say). The room he ends up in is a `Zoo' where extra-terrestrial `Zoo Keepers' study him and the way he acts in his natural habitat. The monolith there changes him from a young adult Bowman to a middle aged Bowman to an old, dying Bowman and finally into the Star Child. It is only boring if you think its boring.Some morons also don't know what the monoliths are about. In the beginning, the monolith is a teacher to the apes that causes them to evolve into humans. The monolith on the moon is a beacon. It sends a radio message to the extra-terrestrials on Jupiter telling them that the human race has advanced into outer space. The one floating in Jupiter space is the passageway to the Star Gate and I have explained the one in the room. We also never see the extra-terrestrials at all throughout the movie (We can however hear them in the room). Thus we have a greater fear of them because we do not know how they act or what they look like.My final thought is that if you have a short attention span or if you thought Citizen Kane was worse than Battlefield Earth, you should stick to Star Wars (Though I did like it) and a stupid Bruickheimer/Bay movie for your entertainment. 2001 is certainly one of the greatest movie experiences of all time and also shows that cinema can be one of the most powerful forms of art and can be utilized for other purposes besides showing people getting shot in the head or fornicating. It is also a reminder that Hollywood's future is always better than the real future. Oh how I would love to have my own Space Liner with it's own spacepods, a videophone and a zero gravity toilet."
The_Sonuverse,"Oct 20, 2018",10/10,"I am really very upset with myself that I've not seen this movie until 2018. Zack Snyder's shots in Batman V Superman made me interested in knowing more about Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey and Yes I was Blown for days after watching this film.Usually before watching any film I spend some time on knowing facts and trivia about it and I knew that way before scientist have reached any other planets, Stanley kubrick had shown everyone how any other planet/world would have looked like.I loved the transitions from era to era, and how well he had made use of what ever resources he had in 1968. The time when even a proper functioning computer or even the idea of using technology for video calling wasnt available, the man had shown it all.I still am hungover this film.

kristian_cooper,"Oct 7, 2015",10/10,"A culturally significant masterpiece of its time. 2001 A space odyssey is quite possibly the greatest science fiction film (and book) of all time. When people mention the notion of space travel in film this movie arguably one of the greatest of the 20th century always springs to mind. Just the ideas and themes presented in this film are truly ground-breaking. Before we had Gravity, interstellar, star wars, we had 2001, the film that started it all. From the dawn of time sequence where the film begins we soon witness one of the most awkward plot changes in cinematic history. Suddenly we are thrust into outer space, into the modern era witnessing a spacecraft descending into a space station and we soon witness a group of astronauts on a journey to the planet Jupiter. Kubrick's attention to detail and predictions of future technologies were simply spot on. The video phone in the space station, recognise that? It's what we now know as Skype. There doesn't have to be a lot of dialogue for one to understand the very notion of what is happening during the film in fact at least half an hour of the film there is no dialogue whatsoever. I wouldn't even consider there to be a lead actor in the film, in actual fact the central character in this film happens to be an artificial intelligent being known as the ""HAL-9000"", the central computer that helps the crew control their ship en route to Jupiter. 2001 A space Odyssey set the benchmark for idea of 'Man Vs Machine' and these ideas were later evident in future works such as Bladerunner and Bicentennial man. Also we must remember this film was released before the days of flashy CGI style special effects yet the way Kubrick gave you the sensation of being in outer space was just awe inspiring. Not to mention quite possibly one of the most spectacular uses of Strauss's music in cinematic history. This film does everything a science fiction film should. It also was the first film to get all of the science behind space travel accurate. So if you haven't already done so, do yourself a favour and watch this groundbreaking, phenomenal film."
Soumyadeep9190,"Jul 1, 2025",9/10,"It's hard to believe that 2001: A Space Odyssey came out in 1968. The visual effects are so stunning, they still feel futuristic even today. Stanley Kubrick created a film that feels more like a space experience than just a movie.2001: A Space Odyssey is not just a sci-fi film - it's a cinematic experience. Stanley Kubrick tells a huge story, starting from the ""Dawn of Man"" to the far future in space, all with very little dialogue. He lets the visuals, music, and silence speak for themselves.The Monolith appears again and again, like a guide through human evolution - but we never get full answers, and that's what makes it so haunting. The final part of the movie, where the astronaut goes through that colorful light tunnel (often called the ""stargate"" scene), is a pure visual trip - abstract, hypnotic, and unforgettable.And then there's the ending - silent, strange, and open to interpretation. Kubrick doesn't explain it, he lets us feel it.Kubrick's direction is bold and ahead of its time. The space scenes, the rotating spacecraft, and the use of classical music all make this film unforgettable. Every frame feels like art. It's slow, quiet, and deep - but for those who are patient, it's one of the most powerful journeys in cinema."
patomartinezfgo,"Apr 4, 2017",10/10,"This movie is just beautiful. Stanley really shows he is a genius in the way that he sets up his shots. All of his shots are beautiful, I cant stress it enough. The camera work is marvelous and really helps you understand character motivations (specially HAL 9000, who is just a computerized voice). The colours used in this film are also beautiful. Every shot feels alive and genius.The score is amazing. It has some of the most famous classical music ever put to film, and it really helps set up the mood for certain scenes and really gives you the chills.The special effects are amazing for the 60's, I would even say they look very similar to the effects of Star Wars. It really amazes you how they did certain shots.Of course, the real juice in this movie is the symbolism and themes. This movie is packed with themes about humans, technology, instinct, and existence itself. I saw this movie about 3 days prior to writing this review, just to make sure I understood the themes, I had to ponder for quite a bit and really analyze the film, and it still left me with questions. Actually, the movie is made to raise more questions than it answers.I would say, that this movie is a thought time if you are not a complete film fanatic. The pace is very slow, for you to be able to appreciate every shot, and most of the parts would make people that are not really interested in film as an art form, pretty boring. But if you appreciate film as an art and love a good film with deep themes... this is the right one for you."
crose5,"Apr 26, 2007",10/10,"There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a ""space"" movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.There we sat, waiting for it to begin. But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no coming attractions. The theater owner at the Cooper Theatre for some reason chose to play ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" with the lights still up so we all stood, never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended. Then the theatre went completely DARK and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible.The overture ended and my seat began to VIBRATE as the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed, hearing ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" for the first time in my life. The ride had just begun.(I highly recommend you watch this opening, this film, in a DARK room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect I felt in that theatre.) Of course, it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science-fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, highly under-rated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in wonder, caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before.I saw it 7 more times within the next year, always in a real full size theater, like all theaters were before multiplexes. I might have been ""high"" once but I didn't go to see it again and again because I was ""tripping"". I went because I knew I was seeing a work of art. It was SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL; the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence; the sights unimagined and unimaginable; the affection for HAL turning to terror. And of, course, WTF was Kubrick really trying to get across to me? Years and years and many more viewings later, I understand it as well, I think, as I ever will. Read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web, you'll find ""explanations"", that's not my purpose in writing these comments.What I hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy it's beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of (e.g, Gayne Ballet Suite or the Blue Danube); savor it like you would a wonderful meal, sip it like a fine wine; look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that ARE there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTED to SHARE some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you. a human, came from and where you're headed.If that's too much work for your brain, and you can't see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film, then, pardon my bluntness, but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a pre-monolith ape. If you want mindless escape, this isn't for you.But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries, and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life."
thechrisfigaro,"Oct 19, 2025",6/10,"This is the second Stanley Kubrick movie I've seen that I didn't enjoy. The first was The Shining, which I found painfully slow and uninteresting. It annoyed me. And it's not because it was bad, but because everyone treats it like a masterpiece. I expected brilliance, tension, something gripping. I got none of that.And this space movie is no different.I'll give credit where it's due. The movie is well made. The visuals and cinematography are stunning. The effects and the music are genuinely impressive. You can clearly see how other movies like Star Wars, Interstellar, and Inception took inspiration from it. But that's where the praise ends.The movie is pointless, painfully slow, and filled with way too many long drawn out shots. The opening title alone takes over four minutes. Four minutes of just music and a black screen. What was the point of that? Then we spend twenty minutes watching a bunch of monkeys in the wilderness. Later, we're stuck with two characters silently eating and watching an expositional video on their tablets for what feels like an eternity.There are no characters worth mentioning or even remembering. The story goes nowhere, and by the end, it feels like the movie had absolutely nothing to say. I expected this movie to at least have a story, something to hold on to.I don't think I'll be watching any more of Kubrick's movies. I don't care how highly praised they are. I'm done."
shabanavdulaj,"Jul 11, 2020",10/10,"How do you put statistics on this one? This isn't measurable, because this is the art of human at its most daring and uncompromising state.I felt bad in the end of the film because I was thinking of what a talent Kubrick was, because of the way he changed cinema and because of how much he has influenced filmmakers, and it seems that everybody takes that for granted. They don't take it for granted really, but it sure feels like that because no matter how much you talk about Kubrick's talent and his achievements, it will never be enough to match his ingenuity, his knack for originality and so on.Inception it's a fantastic film, it destroyed ratings and blew everyone away when it came out, but think of how much Nolan borrowed from other films on it. You see ""parts"" of Paprika in it and you even see ""parts"" of 2001 in it as well. And I'm not saying that it was a piece of cake making a movie like Inception, because although Nolan did borrowed a lot, he did a great job at attaching and orchestrating everything in the right way. But when Kubrick made 2001 the world had never seen nothing like it before, there is sheer originality and imagination in it and it all came from inside of Kubrick, and I can't find the right word to describe what does that mean, especially because of the time of when it was made. And no matter how many directors will try to imitate him, they will never come close on reaching him, it's as if they follow him on Facebook and he comes out on Twitter - one of a kind.When you think of all of the great directors, Hitchcock, Fellini, Kurosawa and others, you would notice that the type of films they made were very similar. What I admire about Kubrick is that every movie he made was so different from each other, and they were all masterpieces. You can't find a more diverse director than him, always extending himself, playing with the genres like they were his yo-yos - he doesn't make the other directors feel in awe of him, he makes them wear diapers. He was such a virtuoso, always challenging himself on doing something new, and he did it with an ungodly artfulness and that makes him in my eyes the greatest director that ever lived.Filmmakers are storytellers, they 'tell' stories. In 2001 Kubrick decides not to tell, he goes even further and instead of telling he 'shows'. That's the reason why a lot of people find 2001 an empty film, because when you don't tell but show, you do not give away your point of view, therefor there is not a message for people to absorb it directly, they have to figure it out on their own. And this remands me of a great quote I read during my university days, ""The best teachers are those who show you where to look, but don't tell you what to see. "", and that's exactly what Kubrick did with 2001.2001 it's his most superlative work, a film for the ages. All of his films are amazing but with this one he had the audacity to break boundaries of film and he did it in such a poetic way, for one to just watch and admire."
matttlea,"Jan 2, 2025",6/10,"I watched the film because it has been regarded as a classic, a masterpiece by some.I thoroughly enjoyed it up until the ending sequence where I couldn't comprehend what was going on. Maybe Kubrick could understand, but I was lost.The issues with HAL was ahead of its time and very creative, displaying fears for the of the future people no doubt had in 1968.However to me it seems Kubrick was smoking something when he created the ending scenes; I can't imagine how confused people must have been seeing this in the 60s. Maybe they would have understood it better if they had read the novel, but I think it would have been better left as a novel."
frankbidak,"Dec 24, 2024",1/10,"This movie is overhyped and boring.2001: A Space Odyssey is, unfortunately, one of the most disappointing movies I've ever watched. While the underlying story is undeniably intriguing, the execution falls flat. The plot is meandering, and the pacing is painfully slow, with excessively long, drawn-out shots that test the viewer's patience. The acting feels lackluster, failing to bring depth to the characters or engage the audience. Despite its reputation as a cinematic masterpiece, the movie left me frustrated and underwhelmed, overshadowed by its flaws rather than its potential brilliance..."
cwarne_uk,"Feb 8, 2003",N/A,Kubricks' 'masterpiece' achieves his career ambition - in it he produced an art-house movie for those too stupid too appreciate real art-house movies. A humourless sequence of pretty pictures hiding the blandest of ideas. Nice performance by HAL almost rescues some respectability but the woeful nature of the rest finally wears one down. The most overrated movie of the most overrated director ever.
johnyjoe,"Mar 13, 2006",10/10,"I don't even know how do describe this film. It is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen. It is also the most confusing, creative, astonishing, and wonderful as well.For my entire life I've been looking for a movie as bizarre and beautiful as this film. I never expected to find it in a space film made in the 60's (although, that should have been the first place I looked). All I had knows before starting this movie was a general idea of some of the scenes (from parodies), and that it was supposedly confusing. Well, it was confusing, but in a very good way. It was mysterious and artistic; a real feast for the eyes, and on top of that it created an atmosphere very rarely seen in movies.This quiet, subtle masterpiece uses long and uneventful scenes to actually create the illusion of boredom mixed with wonder that the characters would experience in space. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed these scenes too, as I tend to hate scenes that drag on too long. What Stanley Kubrick managed to film was realistically boring scenes that, instead of just being pointless like most modern Hollywood dramas, had strong meanings. Plus, every scene had a certain beauty that only an artist would be able to create.So anyone who has yet to see this movie for whatever reason, go out right now and rent the movie. Don't think about it until you've put it in your DVD played. There will be plenty of time for thinking during this epic.K.T."
aliaselias,"Jan 5, 2006",10/10,"In '2001:A Space Odyssey' the following theory was put: The process of evolution goes not always straight and successionaly but it moves sometimes spasmodically and suddenly. A question about it is whether those evolutional leaps are inherent in the process of evolution, i.e. driven by internal evolutional forces, or they are driven by some certain external forces. In this movie Kubrick and Clarke take the second hypothesis (But, of course, it doesn't automatically mean that they really think so). The further question 2001 puts is whether an organic-biological being/entity alone can have a consciousness. To that question the computer HAL gives a clear answer with 'No'.Actually no one could answer such questions clearly, but who does NOT ask him-/herself sometimes in his/her life?: Where mankind is from and where mankind is going to go? What the consciousness is, what 'one's self' is?In 2001 that profound and philosophical questions are 'written' in a perfect picture language. I don't know any other movies that succeeded in visualizing such deep, 'eternal' questions so perfectly.It was more than 25 years ago when I saw this movie for the first time, but I am still asking myself how and when we mankind will leap to the another evolutional stage.And I'd like to know what Charles R. Darwin would have said about this movie ."
Tviktor212,"Dec 2, 2014",10/10,"I must say, at first I hated this movie. I didn't understand anything about the end. Then I started seeing it again, and read the book, and finally understood this whole thing.I must say, now that I understand it, it's not a complicated movie. also, it definitely has great effects for 1968. What Tarkoskij said, and I agree with, this movie is a little ""cold"". In the final sequence, I don't feel that much of an emotional journey together with the main carachter, like in other films, e.g. Solaris, Stalker or even Interstellar, inspired by this film. Also there is a loong sequence at half movie that just makes me bored, for some odd reason.What I instead like of this, is the plot, and the cinematic side of it, the solutions adopted to film some scenes. The great synchronism between music and picture, the use of classical music, mixed with gyorgy ligeti's music really makes that side of the thing. Pink Floyd fans like me will like the fact that their song ""echoes"" is perfectly synchronized with the last chapter of the movie, I suggest also to watch that listening simultaneously to the song, it definitely gives a different feeling."
Movie_Buff_Brad,"Oct 2, 2007",6/10,"After hearing so much praise over it from the entire planet, I firmly believe it IS the most overrated movie of all time. Everyone spreads around that it is ""the best science fiction film ever made"" and it's the best of Kubrick. Everyone. I feel like I'm missing something here. How is this better than A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove? As of now I've seen 7 Kubrick movies, the other 6 were better.I watched it once with huge expectations, and I was extremely disappointed with it. Since people were still saying the movie was amazing, I decided to give it a second chance. So I watched it again with low expectations, and I still didn't think it was anything more than decent. In fact, my rating went down. I gave it TWO chances and still wasn't impressed.My problem with the movie is that it is one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. It basically goes like this: long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, a bit of dialogue, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, some more dialogue, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background...For the first hour of the movie I was content with this, the next five I was starting to lose patience. It's so slow like this that by the time we got passed the monkey montage I started to lose interest in everything. Too little dialogue, too little interesting characters, too many long shots. It just isn't my thing.But this doesn't mean the movie is horrible. I gave it a 6 for a reason (albeit barely a 6). The cinematography is amazing, the shots are nice, extremely impressive visual effects - highly earned Oscar for Kubrick, and a creepy atmosphere. Pretty much anything technical this film gets an A+ with. And HAL is an interesting villain.For me, this is one of those movies that everyone loves, and as much as you want to, you just can't. Maybe I should give it another chance... third time's a charm. But how many times do I need to watch something in order to like it?"
Squid2004,"Dec 17, 2025",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is not a typical science fiction movie. It does not rely on fast pacing, constant dialogue, or clear explanations. Instead, it tells its story mostly through visuals, sound, and atmosphere. Watching 2001 feels more like experiencing a piece of art than following a traditional narrative, which can be challenging but also an extremely rewarding and all-encompassing experience.One of the strongest aspects of the film is its cinematography. Kubrick frequently uses wide shots and centered framing, which makes the characters appear small compared to their surroundings. This is especially noticeable during the space sequences, where astronauts are shown floating in vast, empty environments. The framing creates a feeling of isolation and emphasizes how insignificant humans are when compared to the universe. These visual choices support the film's themes of human evolution and the limits of human control.Color also plays an important role in shaping the mood of the film. The early ""Dawn of Man"" scenes use natural, earthy colors that feel raw and primitive. In contrast, the space station and spacecraft interiors are filled with bright whites and cool tones, which feel clean but emotionally cold. HAL 9000's red eye stands out sharply against these neutral backgrounds, making it visually unsettling, even slightly dystopian in a positive way, and signaling danger long before HAL becomes openly threatening.Sound design is another area where 2001 stands out. Instead of a traditional soundtrack, Kubrick uses classical music, such as Also sprach Zarathustra and The Blue Danube. These instrumental pieces elevate simple actions like spacecraft docking into moments that feel epic and ceremonial. At the same time, the film uses silence effectively, especially during spacewalks. The lack of sound makes space feel empty and dangerous, forcing the viewer to focus on visuals rather than dialogue.Narratively, 2001 does not follow a conventional structure. The film is divided into distinct sections that jump across time, from prehistoric humans to a distant future. This structure can be confusing, but it encourages the viewer to think about larger ideas rather than specific plot details. The most engaging part of the film is the storyline involving HAL 9000. HAL's calm voice and polite behavior contrast sharply with its actions, raising questions about trust, technology, and what it means to be human.Overall, 2001: A Space Odyssey is not a movie that explains itself or aims to entertain in an obvious way. It challenges viewers to be patient and reflective. While it may not appeal to everyone, it remains one of the most influential science fiction films ever made because of its bold visual storytelling and philosophical depth."
artmugal-45795,"Feb 20, 2022",6/10,"My main problem with this movie is the pace? What is the point of pointlessly long scenes? Get to the point seriously. Possible one of the most pretentious movie with awful cheesy soundtrack, I read the book which was great, unlike the film book made sense, Kubrick with all those amazing visual couldn't end it properly.Kubrick was good with machine that is why all his cast acted like robots, Ironic a movie about humanity had nothing to do with human character feeling and emotions."
felstead-76130,"Oct 22, 2024",5/10,"Overall it's not a bad movie. The music throughout was brilliant. I thought the story was good but it was painfully slow. I can understand why it has a such a high rating but this film isn't really for me.It says I have to fill in so many characters and there isn't much else I can say so I'll let you know what I cooked for dinner tonight.I made cottage pie. Browned off some lean minced beef and ground pork with onions, a little garlic. Added beef stock, canned beans and garden beefs. I then made a southern style gravy and added it to the meat.I mashed some potatoes which I boiled in salted water, adding butter and full fat milk to make the constitancy softer (it's easier to spread on top of the gravy.Placed the meaty gravy in an oven dish spread the creamy potato on top before sprinkling mature cheddar and mozzarella on top and a few crispy onions.Baked in the oven until a cheesy crust was formed on the top.The kids loved it."
clarenceporter,"Sep 28, 2018",N/A,"2001 was a breakthrough in technology, theme and content and is quite possible the finest science fiction movie ever made. To think that this movie inspired everything from Star Wars to Alien and Close Encounters.... science fiction owes a huge debt to Stanley Kubrick and 2001.If you haven't already then please go and watch this film. You won't notice the almost 3-hour runtime I can assure you that much."
PolReamonn,"Jun 7, 2018",10/10,"There is not much new I can say that hasn't alredy been said in regards to the plot points and themes of Kubrick's magnum opus, so I won't even try.What I will say is that I saw this film at a cinema in Belfast where it is being screened to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its original theatrical release.I have seen 2001 many times on a TV screen and always enjoyed it. How can you not love a film with HAL? But seeing it at a cinema was a completely different experience and I was simply astonished by what I saw.Here is a film 50 years old and it looked mint. The set pieces are incredible and all I could do was marvel at what I was looking at. It really gave me a new appreciation for what Stanley Kubrick and everyone involved in the production crew achieved.As I said already, I have nothing new to say regarding the overall themes of 2001: A Space Odyssey but one thing I will do is recommend that if it is being screened in a cinema near you, seize the opportunity to watch this masterpiece on the biggest stage of all, where it belongs."
ttornak,"Jul 11, 2005",10/10,"I saw 2001 for the first time at the age of 11, and quit some time after the docking sequence. It was slow, didn't make any sense, lacked any form of action (dramatically or otherwise) and I couldn't relate to the characters. There wasn't even a single good line in sight.I gave it another chance at the age of 18 and this time I was ready for it. It showed me that time could be just as impressive as the vastness of the universe. It told me about the nature of humans and life, about what is history and therefore, what is not. At the same time, it celebrated and mocked human intelligence and science.But mostly, it made me realize humans are part of this universe. There's no clear division between us humans, what we call nature and the universe. Fairly basic, I admit, but everyday news often leads you to belief differently.For the first time I watched a movie that wasn't about the plight of individuals or groups of people, but about the human race.This must be one of the most pretentious movies and to succeed in such an enterprise is beyond comprehension. If compared with music, it didn't behave like a rock-song, but a symphony which has many layers and ways to appreciate it. And like a true classic, it stands alone.Are there any mistakes ? Not a real mistake, but something that could have been done differently. The 'trip' bowman takes to his final destination seems very sixties-like, but that's about all I could find.Only 3 movies received a 10 from me, this is one of them and without any doubt the most important."
tuffguy98,"Mar 7, 2006",6/10,"This movie had about 45 minutes of greatness strewn throughout a 2 1/2 hour movie. In these 45 minutes the pacing, the visuals, the dialogue (when applicable) was magnificent. The rest was a hodge-podge of (usually beautiful) scenes thrown in there to make it look like a cool sci-fi movie.In one scene of the movie they retrieve a piece of equipment off the top of the spaceship because the computer says it will fail soon. In doing so, we hear 10-15 minutes of the same hissing sound from the man's oxygen tank and his breathing while the pod flies slowly, gracefully over so he can get the damn thing. How does this further the story? How does this say anything? I can get the feeling of isolation in space without having to hear 15 minutes of breathing and a hissing oxygen tube. Actually, I got it plenty well before that thank you very much.Another example is a 45 minute long sequence (if I'm exaggerating it isn't by much) where it shows a bunch of pretty colors flashing by interrupted by a picture of his eye, occasionally. These would have been magnificent scenes if they had done something for the story or highlighted some type of theme that actually applies. I guess it's supposed to represent the infinite, but I don't see the infinite as being a bunch of random effects shots all streaming together in the most lethargic fashion possible. Maybe that's just my opinion.It's almost as if they are going for this artsy style which includes only a few brilliant moments of actual human emotion strung together by a bunch of effects sequences that show the same things, with the same noises, for such a long time that I felt like shooting myself in several instances (notably the ones I mentioned).In summary, I'd give those 45 minutes I mentioned before a 9.5/10 because I could imagine them being magnificent with decent support from the rest of the movie, while the rest of the movie gets a 1/10. Which averages out to about 4/10."
sidsun27,"Jul 9, 2018",10/10,"This movie came back a long time ago and till date no one ever attempted to make a film like this becus they knew the audience would call it a copied crap!
As this is a masterpiece, many other directors can only take this movie as an inspiration but not try to replicate this . If so then the situation was going to be like, when the oldboy 2013 came out!"
JackRJosie,"Jan 17, 2025",4/10,"Sorry. What?I can appreciate an obscure artsy film. I would consider myself capable of peeling back layers of symbolism. But this film was another level of odd. Simply odd for odds sake. How this movie is loved by the mainstream absolutely boggles my mind! A full quarter of it is incoherent babbling of random nonsensical images. People who are trying to make sense of this are fools who are too swept up in feeling 'different'. I mean people are really chomping at the bit here. Even in moments where there is a coherent story it is UNBEARABLE to watch, with unnecessarily long drawn out scenes that bore you to death. Perhaps it was interesting for it's time as a look into the future of science, but today it stands as a lively yet pretentious hob goblin of nothingness."
bw92116,"Nov 27, 2006",10/10,"Sadly it appears that younger generations of filmgoers don't appreciate this film. Having been raised on frenetic, action-packed ""science fiction"" films like the Star Wars and Matrix series, and having spent too much time immersed in the chaotic frenzy of video games, they finally sit down to ""2001"" and are bored and frustrated by it. Well, naturally, if you're used to films in which every three seconds there is a crash, a special effect, a sex joke, an explosion or a killing - then you attempt to watch a slow, ponderous film like ""2001"" you're going to get bored. For those people, this is an education in what cinema can be. Science fiction doesn't have to be horror, comedy or martial arts. It can be literature and philosophy. ""2001"" dares to ask meaningful questions of the viewer, for example, ""What is mankind's place and purpose in the universe?"" And it doesn't provide all the answers. It challenges the viewer to come up with his/her own answers. Other issues, such as man vs. machines of man's invention, and the possibility of higher ""intelligence"" than man existing, are also also addressed but not given pat or preachy answers. The ambiguity is part of the appeal of this film, in addition to the spectacular visuals. The slow pace and long scenes give the viewer a chance to digest and contemplate what he/she has just seen and heard, while the film is still in progress. The long scene of the spacewalk with the only sound being the astronaut's breathing is intended to make the viewer a little uncomfortable. The extended special effects sequence near the end is almost like taking a hallucinogenic drug, but without the need to actually take one. This film, like other wide-screen epics (Lawrence of Arabia et. al.) really needs to be seen in a theater with a large screen and good sound system, or at least on a large, high-quality video screen with good sound. I was lucky to get to see it at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood in 1973, and it was shown with an intermission - and the soundtrack included an ""overture"" which was played before the curtain even went up, and also at the end of the intermission, to help set the mood. Of course the cinematography is masterful - space travel never looked this elegant or beautiful, in any other film save possibly ""Apollo 13."" Beyond that, it is the intellectual challenge that the film presents to the viewer that makes this film so memorable."
Daryl-19,"Oct 17, 1999",10/10,"I had no idea what this would be like the first time I saw it. I thought it would be boring and plotless, but I was completely wrong.2001: A Space Odyssey is the best film I've ever watched, Sci-Fi or not. Almost everything about it is perfect. If it wasn't for 2001, current science fiction would be more ""fun with strings and fishbowls"" nonsense.The special effects and models still look good today. The attention to detail on the spacecraft interiors is near obsessive. One one could sit through a viewing just pointing out tiny details on the monitors. But that's not really the point of this film.In fact, 2001 isn't really a science fiction movie at all. It looks like pure science fiction, but not if you watch closely. There are several plotlines about evolution, the use of weapons, etc.I also seem to like everything that alot of people didn't like. Kubrick made a film that was made for people to THINK about, not a movie for quick thrills. Space is huge and completely silent; Astronauts aren't actors . Why can't people seem to grasp these theories? Critics blasted Kubrick upon release apparently for lack of explosions and no overblown dance numbers. Now no critic dares say a negative comment on 2001 or else ruin their career.The brilliance of 2001 has now deteriorated into the nonsense of ""Independence Day"" and ""Armageddon."" I almost wanted to barf when somebody called THOSE serious think pieces."
Wes_Dean,"Jun 25, 2018",10/10,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a peculiar movie, no, peculiar is too negatively connoted and does not measure to this masterpiece; 2001: A Space Odyssey is a unique, transcendental, mind-blowing experience.For it to be one of the most memorable cinematic moments of your life, you have to watch it in certain conditions. I personally first watched this movie on DVD, in my couch, on a TV, with a normal sound system. The memory I recall from my first viewing was good, although it didn't meet my expectations. Because when you see everyone saying that this movie is a masterpiece, unique in its genre (what I actually said in the beginning) you then have high expectations and you do not only expect for the movie to be good, you are also hoping for emotions, sensations you can only feel while viewing this movie. Unfortunately the emotion, the little je ne sais quoi, didn't come to me nor to my living-room. But the enigma of the whole movie started to germinate in me, I wanted to understand what I had witnessed. However, the little seed only germinated and never blossomed.The day Kubrick's masterpiece blossomed was the day where I finally went to see it where it should be watched and where all movies exist, live and die, in that dark room where the simple act of pushing a door and sitting down gives you the power of becoming invisible to others and yet embark on a journey with anyone who decided to sit in the dark with you. Yes, the movie theater. I can still remember the state I was in when the credits started rolling: shaking like a leaf, my blood whirring through my entire body, hands shaking, leg muscles tensing up; I had just experienced a whole new feeling. The silences (sometimes boring) didn't of course miraculously disappear, but I can tell you, just changing sound system, I rediscovered this film. I recall hearing about a nun that would've watched the movie and never experienced such a religious trance, she felt close to God. I can understand her, although I am not religious at all, this movie has this inexplicable power, puts you under a spell.Kubrick also confirms by that movie, once again, that he is a master to his art, he excels and imposes his visionary style and ideas that are still relevant today. But to fully have a thorough 2001 experience, you should watch it at least two times but you must watch it at least once in a movie theater. So enjoy the fact that there are rereleases of the movie the 50th anniversary to discover something that is yet unknown to your emotional spectrum."
jjensen-1,"Jan 18, 2006",10/10,"Even though this movie was made long before most of the readers of this Website were born, it's quality and workmanship blow the newest Star Wars (or other recent) flicks out of the water.Seems like the kids nowadays have no appreciation for hand drawn art work - it's all about polygon rendering.... Who cares if your computer can draw - Where's the respect the real artists!?2001 is still the most accurate depiction of space exploration by humans in this century (even if Kubrick's idea of fashion is a bit screwed up). Beats the hell out of sci-fi flicks that still think there's sound in the vacuum of space (like Star Wars episode whatever).Don't get me wrong - Star Wars Ep. whatever has many shiny objects and loud noises to occupy the masses - but nothing will beat the hand drawn, genuine workmanship of Trumbull and Dykstra."
wwe7961,"Aug 2, 2010",10/10,"I am speechless. I don't know what to say. This is amazing. This a film that takes your brain, chops it into little tiny pieces, puts it back together perfectly, and puts back in your head at the end of the movie. It is so strange that I love it so much. By the end of the movie I felt like I was a different person. I was still exactly the same, but something felt different. It moves slowly, but that lets you feel every moment of it. The use of sound in the film is the best I have ever heard. The music and sound editing is just amazing. The visuals for the time sent sci-fi in a new kind of direction. Hal-9000 is one of the greatest villains ever. I could go on for days. This film is amazing.4 stars out of 4"
utgard14,"Jun 21, 2014",10/10,"What can I really say about one of the greatest films of all time that hasn't been said already? The first time I saw it as a teenager I was left amazed at what I had seen but at the same time confused as to what it all meant. This was the first movie I saw that didn't spell everything out for me. It took time for me to learn to enjoy that. It's a beautiful film. I've heard it described as visual poetry and I think that is as accurate a way of putting it as anything else. The visuals are stunning. The special effects, sets, costumes are all first-rate. I recently watched it with my girlfriend who had never seen it and has tastes that are strictly mainstream. She was in awe of the look of the film, particularly given its age. Not enough good things can be said about Kubrick's use of classical music in this, as well. It's a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it's received. Obviously a film that every serious film fan has to see. It might not be to everybody's tastes but it's an experience unlike any other and, in my opinion, worth repeated viewings. For those of you interested, there's obviously the Arthur C. Clarke books that are worth reading but I'm also going to recommend you check out the Jack Kirby 2001 comics. They're trippy and lots of fun!"
Indy-52,"Nov 1, 2001",10/10,"I will admit right away that I'm one of those idiots that hadn't seen Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY before this re-release in occasion of the real year 2001. I was very surprised by the film in the way it wasn't boring at all like some people I knew had told me. It is a truly thought-provoking, awe-ispiring work, always intriguing and unpredictable, standing head and shoulders above almost every other sci-fi film ever made. No other film I have ever seen captured my sense of wonder and my subconscious so deeply. I still can't keep it away from my thoughts. It is without a doubt Kubrick's most accomplished work to date (I have seen most of his movies). Using tremendously impressive effects portraying the starkness and silence of space, Kubrick made an unparalelled masterpiece, that immensely rewarded those with attention spans longer than five seconds.After a majestic opening title scene showing the sun rise up from the moon and using the enchanting 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' tune by Richard Strauss at maximum volume, the film opens with a 20-minute sequence showing the lives of a tribe of prehistoric man-apes. In typically Kubrickian fashion, the film calmly watches those animals, which are just about a few dozen thousand years away from becoming human, defending themselves from leopards, fighting another ape tribe for the waterhole, sleeping. Just when you think you're watching the wrong movie, something really unexpected and weird happens: the family that we've been watching finds a big black stone of some unknown material standing rooted in the ground. It is a thing of extraordinary geometrical precision, something totally out of place in this primitive world, suddenly appeared there with mysterious purposes. We see the apes slowly approaching the thing in fear and wonder; eventually they will find the courage to touch it. As all this happens we hear a menacing background music with ominous voices, a classic example of Kubrick paranoia music, which will be heard everytime mankind comes in contact with a monolith, as the black thing is called later in the film. After that the movie cuts to what seems to be the next day, and as we see one of the apes toying around with some bones on the ground, we hear Strauss' famous tune slowly coming up again: we know that something important is about to happen. The ape finds a way to use one of the bones as a weapon and starts thumping enthusiastically on the other bones, detroying them. The film assumes that we understand that this is because of the monolith: it is helping the evolution of the apes, pushing them to become more intelligent. This ape, who seems to be the leader of the tribe, then leads them to the waterhole to once again face the other, stronger tribe, this time with something they had never had before: weapons. The others come unarmed and their leader is killed by 'our' tribe's leader, who is armed.After this comes one of the most famous shots in movie history: the ape who has just killed with the bone throws it in the air and after following it for a while, the camera abruptly cuts to about four million years into the future. It is the year 1999 after Christ and man, in Kubrick's vision in 1968, has by then conquered space (unfortunately we now know that he was too optimistic about progress in space travel). Finally you understand a bit of where the movie is going, and finally the 'Space' in the title makes sense. The movie doesn't tell us it's 1999, but we find out later. With more classical music Kubrick shows us his unique, stark, and meticulously realistic vision of space. The camera lingers over spaceships and a space station, where we meet the first human characters and we hear the first dialogue. The man we meet is one Heywood Floyd played by William Sylvester. Something typical of every Kubrick film is that every character remains distant, boring, and hard to connect with; here the character development is even less important than in any other film he has done. We never find out anything about him, although he does have an important scene where he talks to others about an epidemic on the Clavius moon base: the people he talks with are similarly vague characters, who serve only to advance the plot. This criticism of flat characterization actually isn't really a criticism: part of the film's point is that machines like HAL, who we will meet later, have more interesting personalities than humans. Humans are supposed to come off boring. Anyway, Floyd goes to a meeting where he finds out that the hubbub on Clavius is caused by a dug-up black monolith that has been buried there for, you guessed it, about four million years. Humans were attracted to it because it sent out powerful signals. The thing looks exactly like the one the apes found earlier in the film. In an hypnotic, enchanting sequence we watch Floyd and his team approaching the monolith with the same sense of wonder the apes felt. Once again we hear that haunting music with those scary voices singing in the background. Floyd and the others gather around the monolith to take a picture, but a few seconds later they are startled to hear a piercing shriek coming out of the monolith. We see those men writhing with pain in their ears, and it's almost unbearable for the audience too. After that we see a shot we have seen before: the sun rising up on top of the monolith. We saw it before, after the apes had found the monolith, but I haven't figured out the meaning of this shot yet. Perhaps a signal was sent out of the monolith on the moon because it saw the light of the sun for the first time, and wanted to let its creators know about it somehow.After this sequence the film takes another leap forward in time, though not one quite as huge as the first one. The year is now 2001 and the title card says ""Jupiter Mission: 18 months later"". In another classic sequence, we hear beautiful classic music as the camera pans across the spaceship Discovery, and the film's central act begins. Everything that happened before is a setup for this part. First we see one of the astronauts running round in the circular control room of the ship to keep himself fit. Once again these people remain unknown and distant to us. They are Mission Commander David Bowman (Keir Dullea), who will play an important part in the story, and astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). The film lacks any comedic punch in its dialogue, but that's just the point. In the Discovery ship we meet the most intriguing character in the film (and one of the most intriguing characters in any film), and he's a computer. It's the famous HAL 9000 computer which controls the functions of the entire ship, and he is given a chilling, appropriately soulless voice by actor Douglas Rain. In the first scenes on Discovery we find out that HAL is supposed to be a fool-proof computer, incapable of commiting error. Soon later while HAL is chatting with David Bowman about his doubts on the mission's purpose, he mentions a fault that he's picked up in the AE-35 antenna on the ship. Here's where the trouble in the film starts: it turns out that the antenna is perfectly fine. That HAL has committed a mistake is alarming to Bowman and Poole, because he could now make mistakes about anything in the mission. They close themselves off in private to discuss the situation. They ultimately decide to shut him off and continue the mission by themselves. Little do they know that HAL is reading their lips and so knows about their intentions anyway. So when Poole has to go outside the ship to check the antenna again, HAL becomes evil and doesn't let him in again. He floats off into space and dies. And in the most suspenseful and dramatic scene in the movie we see Bowman struggling to get back into the ship from the space pod he's in.In case you don't know what happens next, let me tell you that the movie actually becomes moving and dramatic. All the following scenes have gone down in movie history, but the final 20 minutes, where the main character is taken on a dizzying 'journey beyond the infinite', definitely belong among the most confusing, strange, enigmatic, and ultimately astonishing endings ever shown. Kubrick has so much to tell the audience, so many messages in his big final revelation that many audience members will be lost on it. I was too, and after being dazzled by its complexity I did eventually 'get' it, or most of it anyway. This is a rare movie that has the courage to skewer with our perceptions about life and our place in the Universe. It's too soon to say for me, but I think it will change my way of looking at life. It is easy to see why it was initially rejected by critics and audiences and later gained a huge cult following, ran in theatres for many years, and was eventually considered universally as a classic. It's a film that you might have a hard time understanding the first time around, but later buries itself into your subconscious and doesn't leave you. It's definitely the closest-to-perfect film if there ever was one, and it might even change your mentality and perceptions as it did with me."
atmoore-75075,"Nov 18, 2020",7/10,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a story about man vs machine, which starts with Dr Dave Bowman and other astronauts being sent into space for a mysterious mission. However, their AI system HAL starts acting up which leads to an intense between man and machine that happens through time and space. This movie is very interesting and Stanley Kubrick did a very good job adapting this movie from a short story, he was able to make this movie almost three hours long and most of it feels pretty surreal. The idea of going through time and space is something that is always discussed about, but this movie portrays it in a realistic manner, almost as if it something that could actually happen. I personally thought that this movie was okay and I am not really one that enjoys these kinds of Sci-Fi movies and I only really wanted to watch it because the premise for it sounded interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Sci-Fi movies or to anyone who wants to see a good Stanley Kubrick movie."
joshuafagan-64214,"Nov 13, 2015",10/10,"I'd prefer that you play the theme to the film when you read this review. Look it up on YouTube, if you will. It lends everything a deep, thick layer of gravitas; I think my review is no exception.Here it is, folks. One of those true event movies. A film that makes you remember the place and time when you first saw it. This movies revolutionized cinema in many a way, providing inspiration for the masses. While this is only arguably Kubrick's best film (I have it second), it is certainly his most important. Contemporary critics were stupefied and divisive; to me, that typically means one of two things: either you have a comedy film or dark, dark drama that heavily depends on individual taste; or you have one of the greatest works of cinema ever made, one that people just aren't ready for yet. i am confident when I say that this is part of the latter category.I'm sure that you know some of the famous lines or scenes from the film; the protohumans banging on the mysterious black monolith, the interactions between the computer and Dave, and the trippy sequence near the film's conclusion that ends with the main character turning into a starchild. (By the way, there are actual reports of hippies sneaking into the film just for that last third and tripping, which I find hilarious.) But this film is more than its most memorable parts. I mean, so are most films; but this film is all about the overall atmosphere and tone. There is little dialogue and little human interaction. This film is a cinematic experience; a film closer to Fantasia than The Social Network. The most memorable and personable character is a computer, for crying out loud. If you had any doubt that a good film could be made without any of the traditional elements of a good story, here you go.I am frankly surprised that this got popular, even in the sixties. It is nothing less than monumental, and one of the few things that I can truly, unhyperbolically say took my breath away. I don't think I need to say that a movie like this would never get popular nowadays, and it certainly wouldn't get the same sort of budget. this is a good time to remind that a movie being clearly from its era is not a bad thing. This movie swept in when it could and ran to the stars.Looking at the reviews, I can say criticism has not changed much in the last fifty years; there are still some who degrade an epic like this, unable to grasp the bigger picture. I am not saying that this film is perfect, but rather that it's beyond criticism; its faults are as meaningless as our planets in the grand expanse of outer space.To Mr. Kubrick, I tip my hat. And I will do the same to you, the reader, if you indulge in a film that grasps the spirit of science fiction like no film before it. This is the movie that showed that the medium could transcend its roots and take on a soaring life all of its own."
jakepanek,"Jun 22, 2019",10/10,"I own three copies of this movie on Blu-Ray and DVD. I saw this movie in IMAX for its 50th anniversary. Yet every time I see this movie it's like seeing it for the first time again. Stanley Kubrick's monumental achievement of cinema will go down in my book as the movie that made me love movies, want to be a film critic/filmmaker. The best film ever made for sure.MASTERPIECE"
natsupernnja,"May 24, 2018",10/10,"Kubrick's sci fi epic has left me, like many others, divisive over it's greatness. My first viewing went as well as expected. I criticized the slow pacing and often irritating sound design, with a special emphasis on the confusing final 20 minutes of the movie. However, even weeks after watching it, it still wouldn't leave my mind. Upon recently watching it for a second time, I am starting to understand what Kubrick went for. Studying the film led me to see the philosophical themes presented by the movie. Themes of evolution, existentialism and creation. These themes were able to grant me a more accepting view on the film. As for the more materialistic parts of the film, the visual effects are utterly magnificent. If Kubrick intended to inspire awe, then that was firmly accomplished here. This whole movie is essentially eye sex, for want of a less-dirty term.2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those movies that gets better upon multiple viewings and hopefully, upon future rewatches, I'll be able to accept this movie for what it is...a beautiful exploration into humanity's search for answers"
darian_h,"Mar 17, 2002",N/A,"The first time I saw this movie, I was 14. Didn't make much sense to me, so I gave it no thought. I grew up some more, came across all the HYPE that it's supposedly the ""GREATEST"" movie, and all that.So TODAY I'm 20 years old and I decided to see the movie to judge for myself. It was nice while it lasted, but frankly I don't see what all the fuss is about. Maybe it's one of those HOAXES where some 5 big names say it's the greatest movie in the world and suddenly everyone is heard saying that. See parallel: ""The Emperor's new clothes"".It is NOT the greatest movie of all time, and it does NOT deserve to be in the top 100 list. But it's there- obviously the HOAX has worked. Everybody and their preferences so if you like it, good for you!I'm not going to file this away as bad though. I'm gonna wait till I'm 30 and if I'm still ALIVE by then I'll give it another try- maybe I'll see the what most others see.I tried really hard, I really did. I just hope that 10 yrs from now as I give it another chance, it wouldn't be a waste of 2 hours."
DaveDiggler,"Apr 29, 2008",7/10,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is set in the year 2001 and the main character is HAL. HAL is a computer. That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064 a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called sleep. The film starts with nothing but a pitch black screen for well over two minutes. Then, the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is ""The Dawn of Man"" sequence. So, if it's in chronological order, the blackness prior to this, is the birth of the world?During ""The Dawn of Man"" sequence, out of no where, a huge rectangular block comes from out of the ground, from the sky, we'll never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it's there. The monkeys go apesh!t once they find this huge rectangular block that only man could have made, but that's the catch man hasn't evolved yet. So, who made it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? The monkeys find a tool. The monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys. The monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group. Why? Because they have used their mind to gain an advantage. The more advanced monkeys, and more importantly, smarter and more innovative monkeys, are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering hole.We quickly jump into space, millions of years later, where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe. And for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning. The score is legendary. The cinematography is spectacular. The editing is, however, atrocious. There are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for, what feels like, an infinite amount of time. Once we board the ship there isn't much to talk about. For the next hour Kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we completely get the message. The spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking. Remember what the first cell phone looked like? Me neither, but that's what the future looks like in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors, and they're oddly shaped because we all know, in the future, we're going to be sitting in weird looking chairs. The computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to HDTV because the clarity is atrocious. All the TV sets look like they're from 1968, so it's not all that futuristic. Like all films set more than 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we shouldn't say, ""Well, that's how you would think it looks."" No, I wouldn't. Just like I wouldn't think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047. It's not going to happen and if someone made a film right now, set 30 years in time, and had a talking, self thinking computer, I would laugh at the stupidity of it. Just like I did with ""2001"".HAL is the liveliest person- shoot I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the muted characters in this film. And HAL actually thinks he's alive. He sees humans as his maintenance men who take care of him while he does all the work. HAL ""reads"" the lips of one of the very few conversations between Dave and Frank and he ""sees"" that they are planning to turn him off. This is where the only dramatic part of the film enters- An ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into a bigger spaceship. Oh, the drama!! Once HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave makes his way back into the spaceship proving mans ingenuity. Dave proceeds to terminate HAL. HAL pleads for his life as he slowly fades away, which, like everything else, seems to take forever. If the scene was shortened I think it could have been truly incredible.The final act is just as tedious as the first two. The huge block that the Apes found appears again at the end. It comes out of nowhere... again. Then, an infant is born in a placenta-like shield overlooking the earth from space. What is Kubrick saying? Is it about transformation? Dave to an infant? Is man evolving again? Is Kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of whatever that alien looking thing is? Maybe I'm going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think about it the more the beginning and the ending make sense. There are a few questions left unanswered, especially for the purpose of the blocks, but if you can make it through the film it should spark some thought.The film moves at a snail's pace. The first act and the third acts are fairly strong, but the second act meanders around, hovering in one place for what seems like eternity. There is some intriguing ideas in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance. And for that, it finds some level of profound greatness."
cameronmcclure,"Apr 25, 2022",6/10,Honestly F knowsVisuals are mental but I wasn't coming down off ket so was really just drawn out a bit too long. Really appreciate the genius behind all of effects and how good this movie actually looks I can imagine back in the day this was pretty mental to watch at the time on the big screen.But honestly after 2 explanation videos on YouTube my answer is still F knows what just happened and I get the point and that's what Kubrick intended for each person to find their own meaning but maybe these type of films ain't for me.
paulclaassen,"May 19, 2024",4/10,"'2001: A Space Odyssey' depicts the world from primitive times to the moment computers start thinking for themselves, and becoming superior to Man who invented them. This film will not satisfy every palate, and the ending is like poetry that needs to be analyzed.The film starts off in prehistoric times, and almost looks like a documentary - without narration. It then jumps ahead to the space era. Here, Dr Floyd from the National Council of Astronautics travels to the Clavius base on the moon. The purpose of his visit is to gather additional information to the possibility of an epidemic at the base.However, we would never know the results of his investigation, as the film then jumps ahead 18 months and we meet Dave and Frank on a mission to Jupiter. Their ship is controlled by a super computer called HAL. When Dave and Frank become concerned about HAL and plan to disconnect it, HAL takes matters into its own hands.'2001: A Space Odyssey' is a symphony of beautiful visuals and colourful imagery. Stanley Kubrick's vision of space travel can be considered the pioneer of sci-fi movies. The film also takes its time showcasing these marvelous visuals, accompanied by a classical score. '2001' looks incredible considering it was made almost six decades ago.However, the film concentrates so much on the visuals that it is insanely slow moving. You can easily use the fast-forward button at times and you won't miss a thing! Every...scene...is...just...so...slow... Apart from this, it also really wasn't all that interesting. The story could have been told in about half the time. And can someone please explain that strange ending? I can't imagine people were satisfied leaving the theatre back in 1968...Despite being an extremely well made movie, '2001: A Space Odyssey' was just way too slow for my liking, and I became bored. The visuals alone was not enough to keep me interested, and I was relieved when the credits rolled."
MovieAddict2016,"Jan 19, 2004",10/10,"I bought Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" on DVD along with the (far superior) ""Clockwork Orange."" I have watched it since I was a child and admire this movie for its theatrical scope - as a movie buff, this is a milestone for me and my viewing experience because it is a breakthrough in narrative and for that reason alone I am thankful. I will always remember it and always take it into mind as one of the best examples of a director holding an audience and controlling them in his grip.But (and this is a huge ""but"") it has not aged well over the years. Many of its scenes that depict space travel had audiences sprawled in awe - it was the first feature film to really depict outer space as something realistic (and man hadn't even landed on the moon yet!).But compared to today's films, it is not very good. It is corny, overlong and unrealistic. Back then, it was a reason to see the film. Now, it's not impressive at all. This may seem ignorant, but think about it for a minute - why should we praise a film for being ""the first of its kind"" when other films have come along and done the same thing, much better?I understand doing this to a certain extent - but to say ""2001"" is great solely because of its effects and for being ""the first"" is silly, as far as I see it, because much of it now just isn't very good. Cinema elitists enjoy explaining the reason it is still ""great"" because of its effects. The point they seem to always bring up is ""...at the time of its release..."". I understand this but _now_ it is no longer fascinating as it's been done many times since.Kubrick is too fascinated with long empty passages of nothingness. It's like some self-indulgent ego-trip - take the opening for example. Four minutes (!) of absolutely nothing occurring on screen, just eerie music. Finally it opens, like some sort of epic opera and we are shown the planet's eclipse with the famous soundtrack, etc.I find this incredibly poor storytelling, not because I think it's ""boring"" or ""too slow"" but because it is pointless. I admire long movies (""Once Upon a Time in America"" 4-hour version is wonderful) but ""2001"" has many scenes that go on endlessly, needlessly. There's a difference between slowness (any Leone film will be) but at least Leone uses this as a canvass for exploring something - Kubrick, many times in this particular film (and maybe only this film), doesn't really ""show"" us anything meaningful. It's like we're staring at a moving spacecraft for two minutes. I check my watch at three minutes when the music is starting to tell us it may be over soon and I think, ""Did that in any way actually improve the story itself, or show us anything useful?""No. It's basically bragging to the audience - ""look how good it looks."" Problem is it looks like crap nowadays.The critics tend to love this long nothingness because of its artistic merits. And I somewhat understand this - I can understand praising ""2001"" for its uniqueness, its powerful narrative. But the fact of the matter is that as a movie it's simply not very good because of this! It has dated very poorly. E.g. the space station segments - they are one of the only moments in the film with extensive dialogue. The ""futuristic"" suits are laughably '60s-ish and some of the ideas in the movie about communication via video, etc. are ludicrous.That happens in any movie after a certain amount of time, but ""2001"" almost entirely depends upon this. I feel the actual story itself is weak. Kubrick is at a loss for anything useful so he delays it by continually showing us exterior shots of spacecraft and planets in tune with classical pieces.It just gets to be too much after a while.This all said, please understand I am not putting down this movie. I still admire it very much for what it is and will watch it for years to come. But as a piece of entertainment, as a movie...I find it poor and self-indulgent on Kubrick's behalf. It lacks the satirical bite of ""A Clockwork Orange."" The end sequence is horribly outdated with drug-trip visuals (it was rumored to have been one of the movies stoners would go see on a regular basis!). Like everything in this movie, it goes on too long - look at ""Easy Rider"" and ""Midnight Cowboy."" Both have '60s/'70s druggie sequences but both end before becoming intolerable - ""2001"" goes on too long...My review may seem very incomplete, ignorant and contradictory but if I had to explain it all in summary I'd just say this: ""2001"" is a piece of art, but it is not a good movie in any way. I have seen art house films with better plots (""Punch-Drunk Love,"" ""Magnolia"") and more involving stories. ""2001"" is a showcase for special effects and directorial styles - but now it is very outdated and alienating and this is my biggest problem with it.I can't rate this movie because I would rate it 5/5 in some ways, but very low in others. As a movie it's simply not very good - as a breakthrough/unique art-house type picture it's a great example of how a director can control a movie to the fullest."
WriterDave,"Nov 21, 2005",10/10,"There are many movies out there so full of energy and self-conscious visionary bravado (films like ""Goodfellas"" or ""City of God"") that they perpetuate the myth of the greatest film of all time. Then, there are movies like Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" that created the myth, and simply are.""2001"" is the prime example of why Stanley Kubrick is the greatest director of all time. He was able to traverse many different genres throughout his career, and in doing so created the mythic templates by which all other latter films in those genres would attempt to emulate. Prior to this film, he made the greatest satire ever in ""Dr. Strangelove."" Following this film, he made the greatest costumed period piece in ""Barry Lyndon"" and the greatest ""modern"" horror film in ""The Shining."" Throw in films like ""Clockwork Orange"" (another biting satire) and ""Full Metal Jacket"" (the best ""grunts-eye-view"" of war ever made) and you have the greatest director of all time.Here's why ""2001"" is the greatest science fiction movie ever made. The amazing visual effects and the set designs with their painstaking attention to detail still hold up to today's harshest scrutinies. I dare you to find a movie from any period that looks this good. It makes today's CGI laden films look like visual puke. It also presents us with a prophetic and realistic look at what might happen to our society as it continues to evolve and become more dependent on technology, and the quandaries of creating Artificial Intelligence. HAL, the super computer, is without a doubt the coldest and most profoundly dangerous villain ever to grace the silver screen.On its most simplistic level, ""2001"" is the most arresting combination of visuals and sound ever captured on celluloid. What make the film so transcendent are its philosophical and spiritual posturings on man's place in the universe and just how ""alien"" our first contact with outside intelligent life may be. The overture and opening credits send shivers down my spine every time, and the ending gives me enough energy to fuel a thousand dreams. No other film in my mind is this innately powerful."
StarCastle99,"May 29, 2002",10/10,"Okay, I've read enough viewer comments and can't contain myself. I'm a writer and a filmmaker.  I'd like to know where it is written that a film has to explain itself to you.  I saw 2001 when it first opened. I was with five other people.  We discussed the film for two hours.  When was the last time that happened?  For those of you who felt it was slow, so is space travel.  Get it! There ain't no Warp Factor 1. Secondly, the ending: has nobody ever read anything by Arthur C. Clarke? One of the recurring themes in Clarke's work is that any civilization sufficiently advanced over humankind would seem like Magic, or even Gods.  If you didn't understand the ending, perhaps you weren't supposed to.  Isn't it possible that Kubrick was giving you the experience of how clueless we would all be if confronted by an intelligence millions of years ahead of us.  Look, opinions are like rear ends, everybody has them, but when people put this film down as garbage or the equivalent, it tells me that they aren't thinking it through. Television and motion pictures are very passive media.  They supply you with 100% of audio and video.  Old time radio forced the listener to be imaginative and conjure up the picture. Surprisingly, it's not difficult to do that at all. Here is a film that dares to be somewhere between radio and the visual media.  It doesn't hand you all the answers on a silver platter.  Like a really good computer game you have to figure them out. Whether you liked it or not is your decision. Enough very knowledable people in the film world have viewed it and deemed it one of the great masterpieces of film. As many have said, it's an experience. If you can't deal with that, then go back to your five pages and a boink pacing, but dissing this film is a bit like saying Mozart didn't know squat about music. An opinion like that only make you look bad."
framptonhollis,"Oct 14, 2015",10/10,"You've probably already heard all of the praise that has been given to this film. And, really, all of this praise is truly deserved! It is a beautiful work of art, and even if you didn't like it (which is perfectly understandable), you should REALLY still appreciate the special effects in this film. It changed science fiction film history, and just film history in general.I mean, if the Academy hadn't given the Oscar to Kubrick for best visual effects, it'd probably be the biggest Oscar snub of all time! Of course, I don't take the Oscars all too seriously, so it wouldn't impact my life or anything.The film is broken up into a few parts, all eventually being connected to a black monolith. The unconventional structure of the film makes ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" even more interesting.Besides the unconventional structure, this film is experimental in many ways. It has some pretty experimental visuals, filmmaking techniques (including a particularly famous jump cut) , and a powerful and strange ending that begs to be analyzed by everyone who sees it! While I'm not the biggest fan of over-analyzing movies, this is definitely an exception through my eyes. The film clearly wants the viewers to interpret and analyze it, and that is what makes it even more interesting.Kubrick is clearly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The already mentioned experimental techniques and visual effects have truly influenced some of today's great filmmakers. The film also has a genius use of classical music. The music and the visuals match together beautifully, A lot of people may believe that this film is boring or nonsensical. While it is understandable to have those opinions, I was never bored during this film. It has intensity, mystery, and, of course, beauty!"
parsaamiri-13076,"Oct 30, 2019",10/10,"Considered one of the most significant pieces of cinema ever made, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a philosophical magnum opus. The genius of its creation can easily explain a lot about people finding it a ""boring"" experience.
How often do you stumble upon people reading philosophical books which they find interesting? How often do you find people contemplating the abstract concepts and intuitions such as metaphysics and science?In a world enjoy being spoon-fed via the mass media and the dazzling technology, it is quite common to consider the Kardashians as popular and the Marvel universe as compelling.
These unpleasant remarks are even a sign that this movie is a great success. One that you can still relate to 50 years later. A little too close to the bone for anyone pondering over the future of the modern homo sapiens. A question yet to be answered for the ages to come.The Croatian-American philosopher, Daniel Kolak, considers philosophy to work as a plow in the farm of the mind. It rather raises questions than provides answers. This is how you should be prepared to face this movie. As Roger Ebert says: ""What he had actually done was make a philosophical statement about man's place in the universe, using images as those before him had used words, music or prayer. And he had made it in a way that invited us to contemplate it -- not to experience it vicariously as entertainment, as we might in a good conventional science-fiction film, but to stand outside it as a philosopher might, and think about it.""As for me, after watching a considerable number of movies, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" stands out as one of the most captivating movies I ever saw to this day.
Never have I seen a movie whose final scene is as magnificent and genius as this movie. The climax of the story being patiently and meticulously told here is its very ending. The cinematic definition of the word ""awe""."
TheUnknown837-1,"Feb 1, 2010",10/10,"For a long time, Stanley Kubrick's most influential and controversial movie, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", was a befuddling enigma to me. I've pondered over the movie for ages now, trying to reason really what it was about and more importantly, what I thought of it. A few moments ago, I saw the movie for the third time, but for the first time I understood it and I understood why it has gone on to become one of the most celebrated movies of all time. I'll be honest; for a long time, I didn't think much of ""2001"" and now that I look back on those previous two experiences of watching it, I feel a little embarrassed that I was so far off the mark before. I just had to learn that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was not a film to be taken at face value; it was about something else. And that something else cannot be determined by a majority. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is about the individual's relation to the universe around him, and because human minds are as infinite as the stars, they are just as varied.I always knew what ""2001"" was about in plot. It's a movie that is about humankind and man's relationship to the universe, composed of three stories that are interconnected in one of the most cosmically fascinating manners. The first part of the story concerns the dawn of man. The second relates to man's discovery of an artifact on the moon, hinting that maybe man is not the only intelligent being in the universe. The third revolves around a mission to Jupiter, in which the ship's computer, the famous villain HAL 9000, turns on the astronauts. And from here a fourth, most symbolic and controversial story emerges. That's what ""2001"" is about. *in plot.* What's it's *really* about is up to you.""2001"" means something a bit different to everybody. Some even think it has some religious (or even anti-religious) subtexts. Personally, I don't think so. To me, ""2001"" is about mankind's progress, but only in scientific terms. To my mind, it's about the progression of man from being a dumb brute to realizing that he possesses something that is greater than the stars and planets and his own machines that physically dwarf him in the universe. And the mysterious black monoliths whose origins go unexplained throughout the film are sort of like milestones in man's progress. And his progress is not his technological advances, but his intellectual ones. Throughout the movie, there is lots of symbolism about man's intelligence and how he uses it to overcome obstacles that lay before him. That's what it means to me.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a different kind of masterpiece. It does not work, as Roger Ebert noted, on a human level. The characters are flat and two-dimensional, acting is amateurish, there is not an extreme amount of development, but it doesn't really matter in a movie like this. The movie utilizes visual means to carry an impact to the audience and somehow this makes the movie even more powerful. I do think it would be even more of a masterpiece if it did work on a human level, but then the already stretched running time might slow down some more. Ironically enough, the most charisma and the most emotion comes not from our astronauts, but from HAL, the monotonous-voiced computer who turns lethal when threatened with his own ""life."" Stanley Kubrick won the only Oscar in his career not for directing, but for the special effects, which are jaw-dropping even by today's standards. They are especially awesome today, forty-some years since the movie's debut, because it staggers the imagination to wonder how they could have been done in the 1960s. But what makes these effects so special is not the mere fact that they are eye candy, but because they are used with imagination and delicacy so even the four-plus-minute sequences where very little besides objects floating in outer space coupled with Johann Strauss's waltzes can be mesmerizing.It took me a long time and three views, but at last I do understand why people cherish ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Not only is it a truly mesmerizing film, but it's a deeply symbolic one about man's folly and success. But what's best of all is that it means somethingand not something definite, but individualized. It meant something to its creators and it means something different to us as individuals. That's an odd parallel to life, isn't it? Now for some, the movie is too long and I agree the running time is a little stretched and Kubrick might have done the film some good if he chopped a few sequences of space exploitation, but overall, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is an amazing accomplishment not merely in special effects, but in cinema. It's a different kind of masterpiece – one that takes some getting used to it – but it is a marvel much like outer space itself."
hannahgrahambell,"May 14, 2018",7/10,"2001: A Space Odyssey is objectively a visual masterpiece; but for those who appreciate a subtler, slower story line, it is a narrative success as well. Does the movie revel in showing off its mind boggling special effects? Does it, at times, seem more like an impressive art gallery than a film? Yes and yes, but even 50 years later, the special effects are amazing enough to warrant the rather pretentious display. It is clear that Kubrick's vision influenced nearly all sci-fi movies set in space up through the 21st century, and the only things that clue into its date of creation are the costumes and lack of outrageous CGI monsters. The calm, long shots of space and the spaceship set to classical music allow the audience to take in every bit of the mystical, beautiful, and slightly intimidating aspects to space and technology that Kubrick wished to convey.
One of the main complaints about 2001: A Space Odyssey is its length and slow plot. There is no denying that the movie moves at a slow pace or that it is long (about two and a half hours), but whether this works in the service of the movie or not is as matter of preference. Admittedly, the style of storytelling is slightly difficult to adjust to when an one is used to the current space movie genre, which often entails exciting action and an ensemble of characters whose personal relationships form a core of the movie. In 2001, the suspense is much quieter, but the drawn out length keeps it simmering constantly under the surface. Instead of an ensemble cast with charismatic characters, the core of the movie contains one human and one supercomputer, HAL. Additionally, the cerebral nature of the third act is radically different from those of Star Wars, Star Trek, and other epic space movies. However, the story line is still thought-provoking, exciting, and fairly simple to follow once its unique form is accepted and celebrated."
mrcaw12,"Dec 29, 2003",10/10,"After reading some of the user comments on this film I felt I'd like to add my two cents.I consider this film to be one of the masterpieces in the world of cinema. Would I want every film to be similar in structure? No, I would not. But that does not diminish the accomplishment of this film.I've read comments from users citing the film as boring, hard to understand, pointless & lacking in narrative.I feel these opinions are based more on the expectations of what a film should be and not on what the film actually is.What this film does and brilliantly I might add is to challenge the concept of what the medium of film can be. Instead of using film as a medium to tell a straight forward narrative, the film ascends to loftier goals.  I see the movie as a piece of art. Cinematic art. I liken the experience of watching 2001 as viewing a great masterpiece of art.I don't watch 2001 to merely have some science fiction author's hypothesis of the nature of existence explained to me. I watch it for the visual feast combined with the haunting score and challenging intellectual theories presented. Film is first & foremost a visual medium. The use of sound in the form of scoring compliments the visual for sure. But dialogue between characters is only relied upon in this movie when it is absolutely necessary to further the story.The film is not fast paced. But slow pacing in and of itself does not condemn this or any other film. It's what the creator does with the pace of the film that matters.In many ways, for me, this film is a ballet. Key scenes in the timeline of man are presented and there is this dance of life. Dance of death. The constant struggle to further the awareness of life, the possibilities of existence, the barriers of death of time & of space. It's heady stuff for sure and the movie only presents scenarios, possibilities. It does not provide answers. It only suggests what ifs. And it does it with visuals combined with a perfect score that to this day, inspire film makers & audiences worldwide."
Vartiainen,"Jul 25, 2018",7/10,"One of Stanley Kubrick's greatest works - which is saying something - and still considered by a great many people to be the greatest science fiction film ever made.It is a film that takes us from the very beginning to the very end. Starting from space, slowly and majestically approaching prehistoric Earth, settling us in to witness the birth of mankind. And it keeps going on from there. All the way to the end.The one thing that impressed me the most about this film is its technical supremacy. This is a film that was made in the 60s. Computer effects had barely been imagined back then and they wouldn't be widely used in decades. And yet this film has some of the most amazing visual shots I've ever seen. I frankly have no idea how they even made some of them. Or, at least, made them without going to ridiculous lengths in set-building. And it looks great, perfect even.As for the story, it's a Kubrick alright. None of the man's films are what you would call fast-paced, but this right here just might take the cake. I enjoyed the beginning a lot. The slow pace allowed for the majesty of the imagery to shine and it reflected the slow build-up of mankind rather beautifully. But the space scenes did not pick up the pace, and I do think that they should have. Just a little bit. I get that the style is what it is and when the mood leans more towards horror, it does work, but I still think that the same story could have been told in a briefer fashion. Easily.Still, I cannot fault the film too much. It is quite unique in its mood, approach, story and scope. An iron hard classic for a reason and definitely an inspiration for all the science fiction that would follow. Owe it to yourself to give it a chance."
jc193,"Mar 27, 2025",5/10,"Starting with the things I liked, the cinematography is undoubtedly beautiful and ahead of it's time. The camera movement, placement, and colors, all add to the lonely feeling of outer space. The soundtrack also accompanies this feeling well. I also like the idea of the supercomputer HAL going rogue, and a mysterious Monolith appearing. It's definitely ahead of it's time in terms of technology and film quality. But that's about it. The acting is good, but it doesn't seem hard to mess up. There's 0 dialogue during the first and last 30 minutes of the movie, and lots of gaps without dialogue in between. I guess the justification is that it's supposed to match the inhuman feeling of space, but it's quite excessive. The pacing is really slow just to not really go anywhere in the end. I don't understand the ending at all honestly. In general, there's little context and elaboration on why certain things happen. 2001: A Space Odyssey is more of an art form than entertainment, which can be ok depending on what you're watching for. I understand why some people love it and why some people hate it. For me it was just unenjoyable."
flipcritic,"Aug 25, 1999",10/10,"Perhaps Roger Ebert said it best... ""Kubrick's goal here is not to thrill us, but to fill us with a sense of awe.""  And no film I have ever seen captures man's universal meaning in a film as does ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" From man's beginning to his probable destiny, Kubrick has captured the essential milestones that may have and what could still shape the very essence of humanity.  And he does so very very much with so very little. This film, without computer graphics and hitech special effects, accomplishes more for the science fiction genre, than any other film of its kind, including the Star Wars Trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Contact.For me, this is definitely the best motion picture of all time.  ***** out of ****."
theisland2,"Nov 8, 2018",10/10,"One of my favourite movies of all time. I absolutely adore the psychedelia this movie features, with the dream-like colourful ""star-gate sequence"" for example. Acting is fantastic, insane VFX and cinematics, iconic characters, and of course Stanley Kubrick. The greatest director of all time. It's perfect!"
adam_pittavino,"Aug 21, 2019",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's '2001 A Space Odyssey is the kind of film that viewers really have to prepare for. Well, thats what I tell people before they devote their precious time to watch sci fi's most admired entry. 2001 opens to desolate plains in prehistoric times. This 15 minute sequence demonstrates how ape-like creatures can use the bones of an animal to kill a tribal rival. During all this, a bizzare alien monolith appears and causes bewilderment amongst the primates. Just as the bone is hurled into the air to signify celebration, the film jumps thousands of years into the future as a space station orbits the solar system. We are introduced to Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) who is travelling to the moon with the task of exploring a black monolith that has been found beneath the lunar surface. The monolith starts to beam a heavy transmission toward Jupiter and 18 months later astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are en route to find answers. Like many of Kubrick's films, we see a lack of emotion and personality from his characters. But in 2001, it exhibits the fact that we may not be superior to the apes, but having access to better equiptment certainly gives the illusion that we are. The most impressive character is a computer named HAL. He is inquisitive, shows empathy and expresses concern toward the activities of the two pilots aboard the space ship Discovery. The actions of HAL that follow are etched into film history, im sure you have heard many impressions of the rouge computer. Dave confronts the monolith, transporting him into an unknown dimension, ageing him beyond belief, before morphing into a shining fetus appearing in space. Its questionable which segment of 2001 is the most memorable, Kubrick merges together an impeccable ensemble of music and stirring visuals to create a movie that doesnt play by the rules that other films adhere to. 2001 is a puzzle that begs to be solved, the ambiguity only adding to the overall brilliance, each and every frame worthy of a discussion, if not a debate."
vnd238,"Aug 16, 2013",N/A,"When I first saw this movie as a teen, I really liked it. When I watched it today, I found it bored me almost to tears. While it initially was a tour de force in movie making and introduced a couple of advanced sci fi concepts of the late 1960's, it doesn't stand up well in today's culture.The plot is extremely thin, and could be told in very few words. The plot moves at a snail's pace. It was impossible for me, as a technically educated adult, to avoid spending the idle time spotting bad physics, improbable technology, and unrealistic events.The cinematography is highly touted, and it undoubtedly represents a significant step in the advancement of film art. Nonetheless, there are aspects of the film that I found woefully unconvincing by today's standards. Scenes that created high drama in 1968 are now sadly obvious fantasy that prevented me from enjoying the film.The ending is so obscure that, if you plan to watch the movie, I'd recommend reading the book first.This movie joins a list of others that I never wish to see again, and in fact, I regret having spent time on it this time around. If you are less technically demanding than I have become, you might like it, but you might still find it slow moving and dull."
memdoc,"Jul 12, 2002",10/10,"This film is beautiful to behold.  Beautiful pictures, beautiful music, beautiful direction all telling a  rather simple story about very complex issues.  For those who found the film boring or slow, you ought to know that Kubrick intentionally created a drawn out exposition of the plot to show how boring space travel and perhaps space itself can be.  Indeed, there are lots of jabs at techonological progress throughout, e.g. HAL spells IBM minus one letter in the alphabet for each letter, and the primitive bone-tool is juxtaposed with a space ship in what must be the single greatest jump cut in the history of cinema.  The excitement occurs due to conflict and is instigated by a mysterious and rather unnatural or even supernatural monolith from (?outer) space.  The monolith intervenes with the natural course of history at very crucial moments in evolution and human development leading man into a pursuit of the monolith itself.  We never learn what the monolith is nor do we know where it came from.  Is it God?  Is it alien life?  Is it a cosmic joke?  Regardless of what it is, man is simply obsessed about finding out what this monolith is, where it came from, and what it means.   Like most of Kubrick's films, this one is about human nature and it's mysterious origins.  At first innocent, later intelligent and, consequently, violent.  In many ways, 2001 is a retelling of Adam's fall from grace and, possibly, future salvation."
siwyaf,"May 26, 2018",10/10,"This movie came out in 1968. I saw Dr. Strangelove on TV at that time and was blown away to find out there was such a director who wasn't afraid to make a politically satiric movie about the cold war. I originally saw 2001 in an old palace type of movie theater in Boston, got stoned in the lobby, with a friend before going in and only anticipated the light show at the end. It was so good that it left you thinking what the heck is he saying at the end. I read the book and just liked the beginning about the ape who was more contemplative than the others. At the time there was a book out called On Aggression and was interesting and popular because of the Vietnam War. Today this movie is too long for the younger show me now generations. I still think this is the best movie that was ever made about actually encountering alien, super intelligent life. I'm still wondering if Kubrick is saying it was an alien life form or spiritual awakening that is portrayed in the end. I'm glad he was into using the classical music sound track because it does take you away from the dumb human dialogues that come out in some SF movies today."
luapdlevdeerb,"Aug 22, 2019",10/10,"This move came out in the year when I was born, and I think it is still one of the best SF-movies ever made. The special effects are still outstanding, especially when realizing they were made without any computer, in a time - one year before the first moon landing - in which mankind had not yet seen Earth from space. The imagery is fantastic, and the story is mind-blowing. This is not a standard SF-movie with a predictable speedy storyline and a clear answer in the end; if you expect such a movie then do not watch it. It is a movie that shows space travel how it really is, made in a time when people were still fascinated by it and full of hope, with an intense experience that is truly alien and beyond our imagination. If you watch it for the first time, then watch it on a screen that is as large as possible and open yourself for a great cinematic experience."
majikstl,"Apr 19, 2004",6/10,"Seldom has so much awe been directed at a film with so little to say. The message that 2001 imparts can be summed up simply: Intelligence is the element that made apes into humans and will eventually cause humans to evolve even further. Shorter still: Intellect = evolution. Not particularly profound. Not particularly controversial. Not even particularly original. Just a common sense observation. But director Stanley Kubrick's penchant for pretentious rambling and oblique storytelling invites viewers to make desperate attempts to look for greater meaning, which simply is not there. As the old saying goes: There must be a pony!Which is not to say the film is devoid of substance. Buried in the middle of the film is a Jim-dandy episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" When the astronauts find themselves at war with HAL, the computer that serves as both their servant and their master, the film -- finally -- develops into a compelling drama. The situation itself is suspenseful, plus, it lends itself to many interpretations: Man versus machine, man versus his God, intellect versus instinct, the future versus the present, etc. Dramatically, visually and intellectually, the film does, ever so briefly, live up to its hype. The heart of the film beats strong. Unfortunately, the heart beats in a body that is grotesquely deformed.For a film that looks so sparse and lean, 2001 is ridiculously flabby and out of shape. What is amazing is that so much of what is romanticized as being mystical and philosophical is really just contrived and sometimes just plain silly. The infamous black monolith is a mere MacGuffin, a gimmick that lamely propels the story and loosely ties together the film's three acts. The controversial and endless ""dawn of man"" prologue drags on far past the point where it has anything to say and yet still reveals so little about either the film's plot or mankind. The ""star child"" finale is, to be kind, cute, but no more insightful than the rainbow at the end of E.T.The adoration the film has acquired has an almost cult-like arrogance to it: ""The film is great because we 'get' it and those who don't are just too stupid or shallow or, well, just not one of us."" Yet, when pressed, few even attempt to venture a guess as to why the film is awe inspiring, brilliant and revolutionary. Instead, the film's defenders only make excuses for the film's failings: It's boring!  ""No, it's meditative."" The scenes are repetitive and drag on too long! ""No, Kubrick trusts the viewer to absorb the beauty and the depth of the images, which transcend conventional film pacing."" The ending makes no sense! ""No, the film defies conventional logic."" Why? How? ""Well, it has to, otherwise why would it be like it is?""The ultimate paradox about 2001 is that Kubrick is hailed as a genius because he has made a film that raises more questions than it ever hoped to answer. The mere fact that it is so vague in its intentions angers some, but it overly impresses others.  To argue that the film is great just because it can't be easily explained is no more honest than saying it is lousy because it can't easily be explained. And for my money, a genius is one who provides answers, or at least theories, not one who just asks questions.The irony is that even with all the pretentious hot air with which Kubrick over inflates his epic, he still gets his basic message across. To survive, the astronaut Bowman must defeat HAL, but in doing so he, at best, only delays his own extinction. The evolution of intelligence, even in a corrupted state, will be man's undoing. Mankind is doomed to outsmart himself.  And the same can be said for Stanley Kubrick."
Prismark10,"Feb 21, 2015",7/10,"Martin Scorsese once said that certain great films need to be revisited at certain points in your life. A film you may have watched when you were 20 years old would give you a different feeling when you are 45 years of age.Well I did watch 2001 when I was about 20 years old. I admired the film's technical achievement but the film outside its opening minutes featuring the ape like creatures left me cold. The latter part of the film being even dull, the psychedelia enjoyed only by people who had popped pills.So after several decades I decided to heed Scorsese's advice and watched it on a high definition big widescreen TV for a more immersive experience. Again the technical achievements is outstanding and still dazzle, it leaves films like Gravity standing because nowadays these types of special effects is common with the technology available to filmmakers. Heck even my mobile phone probably has more computing power than that was available to NASA back in 1968.This leaves the story itself with the monolith appearing in different stages of history pushing human evolution. When a monolith is discovered on the moon it leads to a manned mission to Jupiter to find another monolith. But HAL the advanced computer sabotages the mission wants to get to the monolith instead of the humans so computers can enter the next stage of evolution.With the special effects on screen we have imaginative use of classical music to give us mood. It ranges from soothing to eerie such as when the monolith appears. Again as I get older I appreciate the music more.The film still has problems though. Obviously back in 1968 with all the effort they put into creating the visuals you cannot blame Kubrick for those lengthy shots of the space station or space ship. It does lead to pacing issues and make you feel bored. Even Star Trek - The Motion Picture did the same thing when it was released a dozen years later with all the lengthy shots of the refurbished Enterprise. However the story still gets lost as the film gets lost with its dazzling effects as HAL has to be challenged and then the astronaut enters the monolith. You then see the astronaut as an old man and then is reborn as a baby.I have no idea what it all means and maybe I am not supposed to know as its supposed to be all symbolism."
jakepanek,"Jun 18, 2018",10/10,"This movie has been my favorite sci-fi movie from the moment I first watched it! I gave it a 9 mainly because the performances could've been better. Sure, they're the less important thing about the film. Sure, there's not a lot of them. But they still could be a bit better. But the themes and effects overshadow them, making this the quintessential movie for all movie lovers (and not the ones who gave this masterpiece 1 star saying that it was mindless and meaningless; the REAL movie lovers out there)"
bilahn,"Aug 17, 1998",10/10,"This is such a unique movie, relying almost totally on mood, abstraction and sensory experience rather than plot, that it can really only be properly experienced in a theater, preferably with a lot of other people. It is certainly one of the great movies and I have seen it many times. But it really falls flat on a TV screen. My wish has always been that more of what is in the Arthur C. Clarke novel could have been made more explicit in the film.  Sadly, with the many in your face SciFi films made since 1968, this is not a movie that is going to appeal to the majority of modern film audiences, but any film buff must see this."
mattdenes,"Nov 2, 2005",10/10,"I was lucky enough to be first shown this masterpiece of cinema in my mid-teenage years, thus having a relatively broad mind, and the capacity to extend the limits of thought to understand the message that 2001: A Space Odyssey is telling us. First of all allow me to alleviate the common rumor or nowadays stereotype that this movie is boring. One simple unalienable fact that people must realize is that the differences contrasting between past and modern cinema are unlimited and infinite. The ever-present mood, emphasis and feeling that the 60s and 70s brought into movies is irreplaceable. In those days, if a movie was 2 1/2 hours long, the mindset of movie-goers wasn't ""Oh, this movie must be so packed full of action that the 2 hours will shoot by like lightning."" They were more along the lines of ""Okay, this movie is long, it is an epic, what needs to be said to us cannot be simply accomplished within minutes, things have to happen before grander things can happen, an we are going to be shown virtually every second of it."" The one thing people tend to forget about space and space travel and space technology is that it ISN'T fast. It cannot just happen as if it were on a timer as in the movie atrocity Armageddon. What happens happens at the pace it does to perpetuate the un-deniable fact that this movie, although a work of science fiction, is as realistic as it can be, regardless if it's about the possible futures that lay before us. These days, the audiences have been dumbed down by so-called logic in movies. It must all be explained to them, otherwise they leave confused and angry. Those who honestly dislike 2001 simply do not, or no longer possess the patience, nor the capacity to understand that some truths will NOT be merely dropped into our laps. What makes a fantastic film, the sole characteristic that classifies a movie as brilliant, is the fact that it leaves US to create OUR OWN meanings for why something in a movie is happening. The inner-depths to 2001's meanings range from knowledge of the universe around us, to the inconsistency of evolving technology. The rest is up to us to decipher, after we do that, we can believe what WE think is the true meaning."
poe426,"Sep 13, 2014",10/10,"I cite Douglas Trumball (though he was only One of MANY) because HE has gone on to great fame because of what he did in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY- AND because neither HIS name nor the names of any of the other visual fx technicians who worked on the movie are listed as they SHOULD be- as co-directors. (Would 2001 be the classic it is without those fx...?) Still, although it was Trumball and company who actually played the tune, it was Kubrick who conducted the orchestra. (Six of one, half dozen of the other...?) Storywise, 2001 leaves gaping holes big enough to house a million Monoliths. Why, for instance, did the aliens give Man his very first WEAPON instead of a tool that might make for a far brighter future (the wheel, say)? And was there just ONE Monolith, or THREE? Was the Monolith on Earth the same one that was later discovered on the Moon (or the one that appears at the end of the movie)? The entire Moon sequence could've been cut without adversely affecting the narrative in any way, but I must confess a fondness for The Blue Danube Waltz. Was HAL sabotaged by the aliens to somehow TEST Man's worthiness to make it to The Next Evolutionary Step? 2001 leaves a lot of questions unanswered (I saw it TWICE in theaters, hoping to pick up on details the second time around that I'd missed during my first go, but no such luck). The greatest success, early on, seems to have been with the very ""stoners"" who would make Tolkein's books runaway hits, but there are STILL a lot of unanswered questions."
seanmorkikawa,"Aug 5, 2022",6/10,"For the following minute and a half, you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some more, pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book.*Finally* we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand, yet here it feels absolutely agonizing). At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity.Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!). The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.*Seven* minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it's ""realistic"" to portray it as such, but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its ""realism"". Let me tell you about this ""realism"" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like watching people die, but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I'm supposed to care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.Anyway, now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal, chillingly villainous, ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He's great. And the ""Open the pod bay doors"" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings on."
Asphyxiod,"May 21, 2005",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick can be said as an Einstein of film making. 2001 : A Space Odyssey is more than a Movie. Its an unforgettable master piece, perhaps the most intelligently made movie of all time. More important for us is to applause Kubrick's effort as he has not made the film with a commercial angle but, instead brought out a learning experience through cinematic media. 2001 : A Space Odyssey can be said as a Mix of remarkable Documentary & a superb cinematic drama.The best part of the film is how Kubrick has documented the behavior in Outer space & in Zero-Gravity system. Its merely impossible to explain by words or novel to explain the behavior & perception which one can face in zero-gravity. When coming to fiction, Kubrick shows how humans in 21st century overcomes zero-gravity by using principles of centrifugal force. Difficult even to mentally visualize, but Kubrick & his team generously designed, crafted & shot the greatest scenes ever, of the Rotating Giant Wheel Space Craft & Discovery Space Ship's Crews Walking through the Rotating Deck.2001 : A Space Odyssey is a Film about ""Evolution of Higher Intelligence for a Need of Survival under influence of Unknown Phenomenon""The basic idea of Arhtur C. Clarke was that, evolution of intelligence on Earth, from Apes to Man was bestowed by some extra terrestrials (Aliens) and subsequently transforms them from man to the so called ""Star Child"" (Higher intelligence) at the end and after 4 million years.During a sudden Phenomenon in an early morning, the apes come across the Monolith, a Black Rectangular Object, standing erect on the Land. It was a very unusual object for the apes as in wide contrast to their present environment. The ""Curosity"" increases amongst the apes and by overcoming their ""Fear"" one of the apes touches the Monolith followed by other apes. Here is where they overcome their fear and gained confidence. Their brains achieves a second degree of intelligence. Soon after that incidence, the apes are able to ""THINK"" and then comes the invention of a ""Tool"", perhaps the best scene of the film blended with great music. With this ""Tool"" apes are able to fight and defy the rivals.The fast forward to 21st century visualizes the ""Civilised"" Man with his tool which is now sophisticated and in constant innovation. And there is a conflict between the man & machines (tools). Excellently directed by Kubrick, the dispute between the Discovery crew & Hal 9000 is remarkable.Try to understand our connection with the earth. If we don't have any tool with us we can still walk around and survive on land as gravity keeps us together with the Earth matter such as air, water & soil. But in Space, if one loose control of his tools, he shall not survive as there is no Air, water, land & gravity. Our organic form of life is designed to be in need of these.Here is the need of MUTATION. Its time, since man have reached its highest progress but is helpless in Outer space, there is a need for Another Evolution. A New species which shall require no tools to travel. And the Phenomenon again occurs after 4 million years.Jupiter & Beyond exhibits that ""Dave"" the last survival of Discovery space ship, after killing HAL 9000, visits the monolith and subsequently enters a new universe. This again unknown, Kubrick leaves on us to wonder. But the New universe is Multi-dimensional. In the present world we live is 3-Dimension and we are able to move in the space around us in 3-D pattern. This is the rule of our universe. But Dave's new world is Multi - Space-Time dimensional. Imagine if you could also have a Road of time in which you can move to & fro like the Highway on which we travel. The birth of Higher intelligence Life form is an origin from this world. Dave is influenced / mutated again the by the unknown monolith and incarnated as ""STAR CHILD"" in present universe which in the movie is a Giant embryo. Here is were the film ends.The Plot of the film is definite. A journey of evolution from ""Apes - to - Man - to - Starchild"" How it happens, Kubrick shows it as under influence of the Sentinel Monolith. But the evolution happens, Monolith is a fiction, but Genetic Mutation is true. Nature have always constantly mutated Life form to habitat its relevant environment. This is a story of habituating outer space."
purplepete,"Aug 12, 2001",7/10,"Yes, we have HAL, we have aliens, we have interplanetary travel and interesting philosophy on what it is to be human.  But the tunnel sequence with lots of colours is just played out *waaaaaay* too long.  The only way you could enjoy it is to be stoned; it just raises the irritation level way too much. Although we got the theme for the computer game Elite out of the space docking sequence, that's about the only thing that had going for it too. To be a truly great movie they should have slashed these sequences by about 2/3rds, and then they could have added some of the better parts of the book they ended up leaving out.  Read the book instead."
BA_Harrison,"Dec 12, 2015",4/10,"I was born in 1968, the year that saw the original release of 2001: A Space Odyssey; of course, I didn't really get into sci-fi cinema until almost a decade later, when that other movie—you know, the one with the droids, blasters and aliens—broke box-office records. Now aged 47, and fully prepared (or so I thought) for a more cerebrally challenging experience than George Lucas's space opera, I've finally caught up with Kubrick's celebrated sci-fi 'masterpiece'. And I haven't been so bored in a long time.It's not that I need bucket-loads of action and excitement to enjoy a sci-fi movie—I have deep affection for leisurely '70s genre efforts such as Silent Running and Dark Star (both of which clearly owe a debt to 2001)—but Kubrick's film takes pomposity and tedium to a new level. Perhaps if I was stoned, as I imagine many of the film's original fans were when they first saw it, and watching on a cinema screen instead of a TV, I might have been a little more impressed: the visuals are undeniably awe inspiring, the music is grandiose, the psychedelic finale is a trip, and there is much symbolism and narrative ambiguity for intellectuals to chew over, but at two hours and twenty minutes, with very little dialogue and a tortuously slow pace, I struggled to stay awake.In short: give me a lightsaber battle any day of the week.4/10, mostly for the surprisingly effective ape-man suits and the highly detailed spacecraft model effects."
greephine,"Feb 10, 2017",10/10,"This movie is incredible, I have never seen such an amazing film in a long time, amazing soundtrack, great acting, stunning visuals, etc...I was stunned when I realized that most of the references that I've seen in TV shows and all of that came from the film. The movie was so ahead of it's time, and, even if the movie is sometimes just filler, it's still the most important and most influential Sci-Fi movie of all time. After watching this film, Kubrick became one of my favorite directors of all time, besides directors such as Spielberg, Tarantino, etc... I honestly really don't care about the sequels, follow-ups, and any of those kinds of this, but this film will never get tiring and boring for me, it'll always amaze me."
jcjacob-37009,"Mar 29, 2017",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick had absolutely no knowledge of the Science Fiction genre. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) has been called the Grandfather of Sci-Fi films. George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and many others, have considered this film as an inspiration to their careers. The goal for Kubrick was to not only make an experimental film, but to take its genre very seriously (and realistically). Kubrick went beyond the limits with the film's photography and Special Effects.The framing of the movie is both geometrical and symmetrical, to a higher degree. Kubrick creates images that make us as the viewer question its meaning, instead of receiving an answer. 2001 may not be what people expect it to be. I also, struggled to understand its meaning, but the film should be viewed more than once. Kubrick takes us beyond our expectations, into something that is completely unknown.There are some things about this films that I do not fully agree on, but the experience was quite thrilling for me. There are some shots throughout this film that filmmakers are trying to figure out. I for one accept the film as an artistic observation, rather than it being a everyday usual talkie."
Hey_Sweden,"Sep 17, 2018",10/10,"A half-century later, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" remains a remarkable achievement for its visionary producer / director Stanley Kubrick, who wrote the screenplay with noted author Arthur C. Clarke. Its visuals were state-of-the-art at the time, and they are still impressive all these years later. It depicts the contact that mankind has with aliens over thousands of years, beginning in the ""Dawn of Man"" when various ape-men puzzle over a strange new artifact in their world. It then makes a hard cut to the early 21st century, when space has been colonized and something amazing has been discovered beneath the surface of the moon. Then, we jump ahead again to a mission to Jupiter, commandeered by astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). They will have their hands full, dealing with a problematic artificial intelligence named HAL (voiced by an eerily calm Douglas Rain), after which Dave is taken on a truly startling final journey.It's breathtaking to see the results of an obviously huge amount of work. Due to its widescreen photography (by Geoffrey Unsworth and John Alcott) and its sound design, this is one picture that would really rock on a big screen. Kubrick is quite daring in his approach, crafting a film that moves so slowly that it could bore people with short attention spans. But this does help in portraying a certain monotonous and empty feeling when people are working in deep space. Other elements lending ""2001"" distinction are Kubricks' use of many classic compositions, from the ""Blue Danube"" to (most memorably) ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"". The script by Kubrick and Clarke offers a stately, intelligent approach to the idea of working in outer space, complete with colourful but rather antiseptic environments. Described by some as basically a tale about evolution, and the role that these extraterrestrials played in it, it offers no easy, clear-cut answers, but instead leaves details (including the ending) open to discussion, which has kept viewers pondering it for decades. Provocative stories like this, that fire our imaginations and intellects, are often the ones with true staying power.The performances (the cast also includes William Sylvester, Daniel Richter, Leonard Rossiter, Margaret Tyzack, Robert Beatty, and Sean Sullivan) do not blow a viewer away, but are perfectly low key and do suit the material. Rain deserves a lot of credit for creating a legendary ""villain"" through just the sheer relaxed tone of his voice.Sadly, this is NOT going to suit all tastes, but audiences who favour sci-fi pictures that stress the ""science"" aspect, and attempt to appeal to adult intellects, will find it richly rewarding, no matter the run time.Originally screened at two hours and 41 minutes; later cut by about 19 minutes. The version on the Blu-ray runs two hours and 29 minutes, complete with an overture, intermission, and exit music.This delivers the kind of movie experience that discerning viewers don't easily forget.10 out of 10."
ronnoc-23739,"Jul 7, 2017",N/A,"I don't want to give anything away because I want people to have the same experience as I did when I saw this, so there are **no spoilers** ahead. I originally saw this film in the cinema as a reprint of the original 70mm copy. I had heard no reviews of this movie, but knew it was famous by all of the references in pop culture (SpongeBob SquarePants, The Simpsons, The Phantom Menace, etc.). I had no expectations for it to be good or bad, but I was still excited before the film started.The opening title sequence was so amazing that it gave me goosebumps and made my hair stand on end. 2001 had the best live action visual storytelling I have seen in my entire life. My jaw was dropped during the entire first half and it was the first time I had ever been completely silent and did not talk to anybody during a movie. In fact after the first half, I did not know what to say to anyone. My mouth made sounds, but words would not come out. There were no words to describe my experience so I just said ""I'm Speechless"".My expression changed wen I re-entered that universe to witness the second half of this masterpiece of art. It changed from shock and amazement to determined focus. I was trying to find the meaning was to me, as it was never made clear. I thought It was about the constantly changing world of evolution, and more specifically, the evolution of man.This is what visual storytelling is supposed to be like. The little amounts of dialogue allows you to be immersed in the setting that it gives when dialogue is not present. It also makes the dialogue have more Impact. I highly recommend this to any aspiring film buffs or dedicated science fiction geeks or pretty much anyone who wants a new way to hear a story. My only complaint is the sequel, 2010: The Year We Made Contact. It was extremely bland and probably explained things that were not meant to be explained in 2001's book or film. I say ""probably"" because I left in the middle of it from being so bored.. On the topic of the book, the film does not quite line up with it, so I would like to also see an adaptation that comes straight from Arthur C. Clarke's novelized version."
Matt_Layden,"Feb 14, 2005",6/10,"So, I finally saw this weird film and I still don't know what to think of it. I'm not sure if I liked it or not. One of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It's brilliant visually, but......nothing happens. The film has no substance, and it tries to fool you into thinking it does. The classic ""so weird it must mean something"" fits this one like a tie.It's hard to explain, but something about this movie I didn't like. There is VERY little story, and the little that is there is not interesting. It's an art flick, and a big leap in sci-fi films at the time, but for entertainment purposes I would have to pass on this one.I understand that it was not meant to be understood, but why make a film like that? Maybe I'll 'get it' ten years down the road.Very difficult to rate this film, because as an art film it warrants a 10/10, but as a film for entertainment value I see myself giving it a 4/10."
parcival-1,"Jun 28, 2005",10/10,"Certainly one of the finest films of all time.Sure, people expecting an action flick, or a simple plot, will be let down. But for a sort of contemplative experience, with the music and the film complementing each other, few compare with this masterpiece.The special effect, while perhaps not to the standards of today's computer graphics, were way ahead of their time.When I first saw this, in about 1967, I was immediately mesmerized. In 2003 I talked with a neighbor who worked at NASA. He said that if the enthusiasm that existed through the Apollo project after it's political objectives were met, we may have actually gone as far as ""2001"" predicted by that year. So, not only was it artistic. It was also prescient."
willow_chick88,"Apr 13, 2004",7/10,"I have tried desperately to like this movie. I have been told over and over again by my parents how ground-breaking the special effects were and how mind-blowing the whole movie was. I can see how the effects were amazing, given that they don't look cheap and shoddy even today. Still, a movie ,where the first words don't happen until roughly 25 minutes into the movie, is making a huge mistake. The plot is incomprehensible. I turned around and asked my dad what had happened when the movie finished. There is only one thing that comes even close to saving this movie and that is the perfect marriage that is ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and the discovery of bone as a weapon. Still, nothing can save the movie not the music and not HAL."
jlmmymack-1,"Jun 25, 2005",10/10,"2001 A Space Odyssey contains in two hours and twenty minutes what has happened to the evolution of humans in the past million years. You start with apes, whose primary function (in the movie) is the discovery of tools, albeit simple ones at that. You then move to humans, who, driven by their curiosity and scientific nature, venture into unknown territories after seemingly becoming the masters of their own planet.However, man, just like the apes, needs tools in order to function. Instead of the simple 'bone' for the apes, man creates computers, which become the backbone for this journey. Herein lies one of Kubrick's main points. Man invents tools; tools so great that they no longer need humans in order to function. Astronauts hibernating on the journey while the two awake struggle with boredom (i.e. sun-tanning scene). By this point, man has made tools so great that the thirst for knowledge depletes and is replaced with mild content. Hal 9000, the leader of all tools, does virtually everything now while man now becomes the tool. Man's function is now to observe Hal 9000, and fix it when needed. So the human is now used strictly for maintenance, while Hal9000 does the work.Kubrick's other main point in this fascinating work of art is that man, while being a master of his own planet, is just a baby in space. The astronauts eat baby food and have to be 'toilet-trained' (instructions on how to use the toilet). Earth holds no weight in space; man still needs to breathe to survive in a place where breath is hard to come by: back to the tools. Man uses his tools again to be able to breathe in this environment. Now it is man who is completely dependent on the tools he invented. Now without these tools, man faces certain death. Tools don't need to breathe in space...This film is both universal and timeless, perhaps more than any movie I have seen to date. It leaves room for discussion with its subtle nuances and reminds the viewer of where mankind stands in the evolutionary spectrum.10/10"
SpelingError,"Jul 27, 2016",10/10,"For over a year, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" has been my favorite movie ever made. It is one of the films which got me into reviewing films, and it still holds up just as much as it did on my first viewing. There are many people who say that it is one of the best movies ever made. I'd probably put it somewhere in the top 10. It has accomplished so much, and it's pretty hard for me to think of other films which could top it.This movie has a few story lines. The ""Dawn of Man"" sequence shows man-apes developing the first tool, and taking a big step forward in evolution. The next storyline shows a group of astronauts on an expedition to the moon. The third storyline shows astronauts investigating an object on Jupiter with the help of an intelligent computer named HAL. The final part of the film shows the famous Stargate sequence, and this is when the film gets really complicated.I really love ambiguity. Some of my favorite films have ambiguity. However, I feel like this film does the best job at ambiguity. What sets it apart from all the other films? The reason I say it's the best is because I feel like it has the most interpretations to it. Kubrick didn't leave any clues whatsoever in the film, and by doing so, he opened up the film to many answers. I feel like no matter how many times I watch it, there will still be more interpretations that could come out of it. I have not seen any film before which gave me the same feeling towards its ambiguous moments. Usually when films gets complicated, the transitions will impress me. However, 2001 impressed me a lot more by its visuals. The visuals of the Stargate sequence were hypnotic and impressive. It was made entirely through practical effects. It may seem easy to create it nowadays, but this film was from the 1960's. That was when computers still used magnetic tape storage. If that scene doesn't impress you, nothing will.Speaking of the visuals, they looked brilliant. In fact, more than brilliant. I already mentioned how the Stargate sequence looked really good. However, that's only the tip of the iceberg. There is hardly a single frame in this film which doesn't seem intricately designed, flawlessly composed, and superbly lit. It also has impressive framing and symmetrical compositions which makes many of its shots stick out even more. Even if the viewer gets confused by it at first, the amazing visuals will keep you coming back until you do. In my opinion, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" has the best cinematography in history. No film has ever topped it before, and this films' visuals feel untouchable. The only film which has come close to topping this one before is Terrence Malick's ""Tree of Life"". However, not even that film can top this. I have a feeling that it's going to remain at #1 for a long time.HAL was a really good villain. When you watch the movie, you have a little confidence that HAL won't be able to overpower the crew of the ship. However, when you're able to figure out what HAL's plan is, it's already too late. The lines he uses in the film are really good. Even when his life is in danger, he tries to use a normal voice to calm the astronaut down. Some portions of the film with him can be really unnerving for that reason. However, I think that the biggest reason why he works so good is that it's debatable whether he is actually evil or not. It's possible that his actions are all a part of self-defense. Because of this, the viewer would likely be unsure whether they're supposed to sympathize or despise his character. In my opinion, these kinds of villains (The Revenant for example) are the best kinds of villains. Also, let's not forget the hidden secret where if you replace every letter in ""HAL"" with the letter after it, you get IBM, an American multinational technology and consulting corporation.This films' soundtrack is brilliant. It is very iconic and it's easily recognizable today. ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" is not only iconic, but it feels very grand. Every time it's played in the film, important breakthroughs in evolution are occurring. The song perfectly lets you know that something spectacular is occurring. When you go back to try and interpret the film, the soundtrack is a good clue to figuring it out. Its also fun to listen to on your own. It never gets bland, and it always feels just as amazing as when you originally heard it in the movie. There are other songs which feel haunting. Those songs perfectly represent all of the weird parts in the film. They also work very good in the background, because they immerse you with many parts of the film. The iconic ""Stargate sequence"" is made even better by its ominous score. The soundtrack perfectly represents the movie.In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, and it's one of the greatest films ever. It accomplishes a lot such as handling ambiguity better than any other movie I've ever seen has, containing the best visuals out of every movie I've seen, containing one of the best villains ever, and containing one of the best soundtracks ever. Every time when I re-watch it, I feel like I pick up on a lot of new things, and it still feels fresh and original. The reason why it's my favorite film of all time is because I'd rather watch it than all other movies I've seen. A few of my favorites came close to topping it before, but none were successful, and it still sits at #1. This is Kubrick's magnum opus."
maxicrockgamingofficiel,"Nov 14, 2017",10/10,Most beautiful film ever... No more xD I don't even understand how it win just one little Oscar... What a great story from Kubrick and Arthur C Clarck (don't forget him^^) 10/10 without any doubt for me ! Warning ! You must see this movie in good condition if you want to really appreciate it ! Without these conditions it can be really bad for this experience ;)
bevo-13678,"Mar 31, 2020",10/10,Never really understood this movie. Some big black thing flying around space or something. And what's with the confusing title it was made in 1968
slowcando,"Apr 16, 2015",10/10,"No spoilers in case you're interested in seeing what all the fuss is about but have somehow managed to avoid the actual story.I first watched 2001 as a teenager almost 20 years ago, having understood very little, but remember enjoying the (seemingly) sparse show it offered.Couple of years later I got into Arthur C Clarke, starting with the amazing Rendezvous with Rama (how is that not a film yet??) before getting round to 2001. Oh my God, it's full of stars! At this line I understood what that whole psychedelic sequence must've been about, so onward to a 2nd watch forthwith it was. And lo, I now got the film much better. It wasn't quite up there with my absolute favourites (yet), but understood it to be a masterful piece of work.Fast forward 15 years or more to watching it a 3rd time (this huuuge film phase I'm having this year is thanks to procuring a HD-projector...highly recommended!).And ye Gods indeed, it's now my Number 1 favourite film.Older and (probably) wiser, in that 3rd watch there was so much more to appreciate: the use of György Ligeti's otherworldly music is hugely-immersive; the distinct, yet skillfully-linked, nature of each of the 4 parts of the movie feels like a proper opus; the epic presence of the monolith is fantastic, and - when you think about it - the utter vastness of the timeline is sheer incomprehensible. Above all: the film is hugely enjoyable, completely engrossing and beguiles like nothing else I've ever seen. Its ideas are as timeless as the universe itself.As with most Great films, it's also the little things that make an outstanding impression against hugely-ambitious intention: the apes' excitement when realising they can use scattered bones as tools; Floyd seriously cutting the gentlemanly exchange with the Russian group utilising a curt ""I'm afraid I can't talk about that""; the hypnotic circular weightless-walking (and running) of crew; the repeating trick of showing HAL's now-iconic red eye.Speaking of iconism: this movie offers an incredible amount of iconic culture. If you watch this for the first time you'll feel like you've already seen it, such is its influence. And for pure open-mouthed awe we don't even have to look at the riveting psychedelic wormhole: HAL's red room scene is the one that stays with us the most.To the 3 most common criticisms this film has:1) ""none of the characters are human/relateable enough, tho' some use this as a theory to posit this was Kubrick's intention, to allow HAL emotional room.""I don't buy any of this: Kubrick above all wanted realism: this means he wanted his astronaut and senior scientist characters to mirror the nature of their real counterparts: stoic, calm, formal. And check out Dave's stress levels later on, he's acting human alright. Plus Floyd's wonderfully-light exchange with his daughter is hardly the kind of cold, emotionless quality some amateur critics like to point at 2001.2) ""the sequences without dialogue are too long, with nothing happening. Additionally to this: the classical waltz music doesn't fit the space visuals.""I can understand this criticism, even if I never had an issue with it myself. I love those long sequences: they're enticing and mysterious, and really pull you into its world. But you either like it or you don't.Regarding the music choices: at first viewing I also felt the more traditional classical music didn't quite fit. But on the 2nd and even more so now on the 3rd watch I really appreciate the wonderful symbiotic waltz of the spacecraft with the, very much earthbound, instruments. It's symbolic and meaningful.3) ""the film doesn't make any sense, especially the final section.""Again, another criticism which I felt sympathy with after first viewing (and back then not having read the book). I recommend anyone wanting to understand the science fiction aspect of the story to read Clarke's novelisation before watching. On the other hand, Kubrick's films are well known in their individualistic interpretation of source material. You don't have to read the book if you're happy with your own metaphorical interpretation of what you saw....and, as Merlin would say, that's it.This might be my longest review...and it feels like I'm only scratching the surface with what I want to say about this monumental work. The most universally-truthful thing I can say about it is that it's not gonna be for everyone. Some of you may intensely dislike it, while some may struggle to watch it all the through. If you're one of those then it doesn't mean your taste in film is faulty, it just means 2001 isn't for you. And that's fine.For the rest of us, we can only be grateful to have it."
cooperkeith,"Aug 18, 2022",N/A,"To all you ""insightful"" ""brilliant"" reviewers out there.. those who like to parrot your media professor's interpretation of this movie... do us all a favour and direct your ""genius"" elsewhere. Instead of writing such poignant reviews of movies that were produced before you were even thought of, perhaps you could solve the world's energy crisis. Or maybe come up with something great to cure the environment. Since you're so much smarter than the rest of us.. to be able to understand such brilliance in a movie that doesn't even start for almost 15 min!If this was any other film, released today, and shown in any theatre in any country on this planet... every single ticket holder would want their money back before the first hour was up. But I guess they must be stupid not to see the genius in this film. Maybe they should spend their money on a modern media course at their local university to understand the complexities.Surely you ""geniuses"" have much better things to do with your time than write reviews for a 50 year old movIe you wouldn't even bother to watch if it wasn't part of the syllabus."
KUAlum26,"Feb 12, 2006",7/10,"I have always appreciated the visual marvels of this movie. The images are powerful and lasting,and the usage of classical music to add awe to the effects of mankind's venture into space was a very smart decision on the part of Stanley Kubrick and the editors of the film. HAving said that,I can think of far more engaging stories that have been committed to celluloid.The film,an adaptation of Arthur C.Clarke's 1963 bestseller,is probably best summed as a study in contrasts: the first,a dry look at the beginnings of man on Earth,learning to tame nature and each other,the second,mankind's utilization of technology and it's betray of man. The problems to me with this film are probably as much its most distinctive traits: namely,the pacing is glacially slow,there is precious little dialog and the visual image effects are drawn out to the point of tedium. If you are straining your ears for some sort of plot resolution or denouement from the characters involved,or seeking a central point of focus in this movie,you will be sorely disappointed.Having said that,this film is far better viewed on a large screen or an IMAX,because this film's qualities seem to befit a medium that allows for a sense of awe or wonder. Seeing this on a small screen broadcast or on VHS almost completely dilutes the experience.To true film fans,this film is AT LEAST worth a look or two. But I'd be lying if I said that this film was a very ingratiating film view"
davepoole-82655,"Nov 10, 2018",10/10,Beautiul in every way. Possibly the greatest movie of all time. It's ridiculous to try and put into words how good it is because I'd need to be a great writer to do it justice. And I'm not.
grtsantu,"Jul 19, 2010",6/10,"I watched this movie with lot of expectation after seeing all hype. But totally disappointed. Though it has a great visual and also shown in aesthetic way. Considering the time it was made, the concept for future and the way it has been shown is awesome. It feels so real sometime you feel like being in space. But that's the only good part. It has no story or at least I'm not able to find anything, staggeringly slow, and the overuse of background music sometime becomes so annoying. I have seen lot movies with great visual but they are not worth mentioning just because they lack story. Don't understand why this movie has been treated differently from those movies. Forgetting about the time it was made, I feel it very hard to appreciate it. Then again it all depends person to person and we agree to disagree."
VVB,"May 20, 2001",1/10,"I normally keep my movie thoughts to myself but this movie affected me to the point of voicing myself out.Movies are typically evaluated via (i) more/less objective attributes (plot, ideas, action, cinematography, etc.) and (ii) emotional impressions they leave. While the latter is extremely personal and diverse, some convergence can be achieved in the former. Unfortunately, this piece greatly fails in it: no plot, no original ideas, no action, horrible cinematography, and a very repetitive soundtrack. As far as the emotional impression goes: well, in my case, it gave me a highly unpleasant aftertaste: a very pretentious schizophrenic nightmare...Why is it so overrated then? I'd hypothesize that it is for the same reason as in the case of Malevich's ""Black Square"". When one sees something a piece of ""art"" of that type, there seem to be two typical reactions: (i) ""There is nothing there, it is junk."" and (ii) ""There is nothing there but it must be great because everyone else thinks it's great. Then it must be an art."" So what created this mob fame effect for this movie? I don't know for sure but it might have been the big names of S.Kubrick and A.Clark. Once such a ""snowball"" starts rolling down the hill and picks up the momentum, it is more difficult to stop it than to roll with it.Please trust your own independent feelings. Things don't become better because a million of other people say they are brilliant. Cheers."

iyerlakerfan,"Oct 10, 2015",10/10,"Admittedly, I never heard anything about 2001: A Space Odyssey until I saw a cameo of the HAL 9000 computer in the Epic Rap Battle between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates (nicepeter and epicLLOYD). I went to the library, borrowed a copy, put the DVD inside, and thought, ""Well, this ought to be the clichéd sci-fi story.And for the next two hours, I sat in amazement as I saw the breathtaking visual accomplishment of a movie. It never failed to enthrall me and keeping me on the edge of my seat. It was, in my opinion, a highly realistic view of one envisioning the year 2001 in 1968.I finished the movie, and immediately went into IMDb for the results, and I was fairly shocked at the amount of people who disliked the movie. Most of those dislikes said something along the lines of ""Overrated"", ""boring"", and ""someone tell me what the hell this is about.""Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick never really intended the audience to understand the movie completely: ""If you understand '2001' completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.""I completely agree with him. It isn't really much of a story of dialogue (which is kept to a minimum in this movie) as it is a visual story, along the lines of ""Metropolis"" or ""A Trip to the Moon."" The purpose of cinema is to provide a visual outlet to fascinating ideas and conceptions, relying on dialogue only to convey an actual story. 2001 manages to do both without the need of much dialogue, and therefore achieves what cinema originally intended to do.That is why 2001 is my favorite movie of all time. 👍👍 10/10 (and I would rate it 11/10 if I could."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Dec 11, 2004",10/10,"Having just seen this fantastic film, I'm left puzzled, amazed, impressed and in complete and utter awe of Kubrick's cinematic genius. I had not expected anything to impress me as much as A Clockwork Orange, but I was pleasantly surprised. While I do find A Clockwork Orange to be a better film, I must say that this comes incredibly close... and what determines this might be the fact that, while I fully understood A Clockwork Orange(at least after my second viewing) I'm quite confused by this film. I don't entirely understand the ending, and a few various things throughout the film, but that doesn't lower my score. Not the slightest. Do you know why? Well, partly because Arthur C. Clarke, the co-writer of the screenplay once said: ""If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered."" And partly because the very visuals of this film warrant a perfect rating of 10. I would be lying if I claimed to ever have seen such beautiful visuals as the ones throughout the film, and in particular the very end... stunning. Simply stunning. Something that I found interesting was how many times Kubrick simply used the visuals to tell the story(as opposed to dialog) and how often he simply let us enjoy the sight of the spacecrafts or the planets... instead of giving us a few unsatisfying quick cuts like a typical Hollywood director would have done. Kubrick is in no hurry to tell us this story... in fact, he wants us to relax and just be whisked away on this journey. He sets a mood like no other director has ever done, and he never breaks this mood. His use of music, while not as deliciously ironic as it is in A Clockwork Orange, is great. There are two scenes which have been referenced so many times, both content-wise and music-wise, in so many different mediums that I doubt anyone can keep track of how many parodies or references there are to them... this is, of course, the famous Dawn of Man scene, and a recurring external space scene. The plot is great. The pacing is good, considering that it's Kubrick... usually, his films are slower, but this one never really felt that slow. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is all great. The music/score is great. The visuals of the film are amazing. I know I'm praising every aspect of the film here, but I truly think it is that good; it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and definitely the best visually. Finally, I'll just mention that normally I hate science fiction that deals(even slightly) with extraterrestrial activity/life and space travel. I recommend this film to any fan of high-quality science fiction and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. 10/10"
jared_a_washburn,"Dec 21, 2006",10/10,"This move is absolutely, most certainly one of the greatest films of its, or any other, genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development. Just with visuals along, 2001 is able to present a picture of the future that is both sublime and horrifying. 10 out of 10, no doubt. For my money, it doesn't get much better than 2001: A Space Oddysey....now, the sequel, 2010...that's a different story."
Anibas-11,"Sep 12, 2024",N/A,"HAL is the early prototype of common day AI. Fortunately, one of the crew members manages to short-circuit this evil computer monster. After that, the space station steers towards the unknown. So good for the film's suspence, even if the trill is not just overblown but also in the long run a bit boring. But stylish, as I said. Sci-fi and therefore per definition kitsch. What does it need to be done well for? Science fiction = scientific fiction, a grave contradiction.The soundtrack in the overly pretentious pseudo-Darwinistic opening sequence combines the one classical composer ""Strauss"", Richard Strauss, composer of ""Thus spoke Zarathustra) with another Strauss, Joh. Strauss with theuse of ironical ""The beautiful blue Danube""-walz. Well, ""Zarathustra"" and ""waltzer-Strauss"" - and the two Strauss weren't even related!An anacronistic monolith in the desert looks like something between Trump Tower and Manhattan Chase Bank headquarters in New York City - Darwin's monkeys throw boomerangs (that desert must therefore be in Australia). The surreal journey in time and space, created on the basis of the real life Apollo journey to the Moon in the same year, 1969), ends up with a ridiculously high-pitched LSD-like pwycodelic grande finale. 70 mm Technicolor Luxury - what a waste! Kubrick's best films from my point of view are some of those in B/W. Space Odyssey is not the thightest told Kubrick-film, but visually beautiful.This space movie was a favouirite of the tech freak Classical music conductor Herbert von Karajan.For the opening fanfares of Richard Strauss' ""Also sprach Zarathustra"", Kubrick has happiily chosen Karajan's state of the art sound recording from 1964 with the Vienna Philharmonic, only surpassed by the Berlin recording from 1970."
misspudding,"Apr 22, 2018",6/10,"Brilliant but blah. The story line was brilliant, the cinematography was amazing, and the use of music and sound was immersive. Would give 10 for all of those. But the speed of this film made it painful to watch. I just didn't see the point of the last 20 minutes. Overall, I'm glad I've seen it but I'm never watching this again. LOL"
tomaskonicek,"May 10, 2016",10/10,"One of the greatest Kubrick movie. I enjoyed every second of this master peace. If anybody ever ask me if there's any movie you should watch, its exactly this one I would say. This movie is really hard to describe but if you are at least a bit fan of Sci-fi or mystery, this should be your pick number one. The visual side of this movie is astonishing. Even after almost more than 48 years its still beautiful movie with one of the best visual effects. Even while its not that important side of the movies in general, 2001: A Space Odyssey still can amaze even the most demanding viewers. For me this movie means a lot. I am very thankful for such effort which Stanley had to pull to bring us this film."
BigIsma,"Nov 1, 2025",6/10,"Picture this:
You are a man living in 1968 and go to the cinema to see this movie. You are completely stunned by its amazing visual effects, the portayal of space, the scientific accuracy of the equipment used and the way the emptiness of space is captured on-screen, even by the intelligence of the AI robot. This level of overall detail was unheard of. As the movie continues and you reach the end, the movie starts to make less and less sense. But you are so consumed by the visual effects and the cinematic beauty of the film that you dont really care about the slow pacing or the 20 minute long psychedelic trip. Maybe you think its all so thought out that the plot is way beyond your level of understanding. When the credits finally roll you say it was a masterpiece of visual effects and storyline.But its not 1968 anymore. We live in 2025. Think throught this:
If I showed you this movie and told you it is brand new, would you appreciate it the same? Probably not. Now that what seperates a masterpiece from a simply good movie. How does it stand in the test of time. We can all acknowledge that its visual effects and attention to detail was a milestone in cinema when it first came out. But now, those same effects cant compare with modern ones. The story is weak and the charactes lack development.So, as of today, we are left with a movie that has surely marked an era, but is otherwise extremely slow to watch, and doesn't provoke a strong emotional response from the viewer. It's more of an educational glimpse of the past, of what the limits of technology could offer."
mariairbrown,"Feb 6, 2024",1/10,"Visually, you can not fault this film. The directing, cinematography, set and costume design is perfect. Can absolutely see why so many directors were inspired by this film. It is a head of its time technically.However as a movie, it is absolutely terrible; the pacing, the disjointed story line, the flat acting makes for a boring 2.5 hours. Many, many, many scenes did not need to be as long as they were (ships landing, colour sequence). The obelisk are set up and then absolutely nothing with them. The cast is poor as the actors looks practically the same.The ending is very unsatisfying.Glad I've seen it but is a dreadful movie."

Lostman_815,"May 21, 2014",10/10,"I'm 23 and finally got around to watching 2001 for the first time last year...I had lent it to a friend who watched it before me and returned it to me along with the complaint that it was the biggest waste of time he'd ever spent.I didn't hesitate to get it watched and see what the fuss was about and I have never disagreed with someone as much. I absolutely loved it; the cinematography, the music, the (truly) epic-ness, the nostalgic-yet-unaging feel, the tension and unease throughout parts 2 and 3, the mystery and interpretativeness, the depth and the hidden meanings. Silence is used more effectively in 2001 than in any movie I'd ever experienced, the most chilling being when Dave is awaiting HAL's response to open the pod-bay doors. The universe I watched within that movie was more believable than 99% of anything else I'd ever seen.Never had I seen a movie that seemed so much a form of art.Everyone needs to see this movie.I still obsess over it, it has become my favourite sci-fi film, arguably my favourite over ALL genres. I'm constantly at odds trying to persuade my other friends to watch it with me. I'm just awaiting the day I can see it on a big screen the way it was meant to be watched.(A word of warning though, I can understand why some people would find it boring as there are long moments of panning shots, floating ships and no dialogue. I personally could have watched twice the amount more of it, but that's how art is, some can grasp and appreciate it, others can't.)"

lostngone4ever,"Sep 30, 1999",N/A,"2001 is complex for me. I am a huge Kubrick fan and I like practically all of his very few movies, except for this one. I can understand why it is a great achievement. At the time of its release it was an unbelievable breakthrough in both idea and in special effects and direction. For those reasons I can understand why it is a classic. But no matter how much I want to like it and see it as a masterpiece like so many others I cant say that I do. Its not that I don't like the movie, but that I actually hate it. I understand that it is tying to go beyond entertainment and make you think and not give you some fake ending that answers all the questions it raises. Instead it is trying to be very broad and give some sort of enlightenment about humans and the universe and creation. But to me it just comes off as very boring and pretentious film making. It put me to sleep. Now, many fans of the movie would just accuse me of ignorance, but I do believe I have quite a large following of people that would have to say they were more then just dozing off now and again while watching it. If you're going to watch this movie and you want to go REALLY deep with it you might as well take the advice of the original MGM tagline that went with it. It was ""the ultimate trip"" and as me and two friends of mine discovered (along with all the original hippies that saw it repeatedly in '68 who made it the box office hit that it was) its not nearly as dry when you are taking that ""trip"" while watching it."

averjee,"Apr 5, 1999",5/10,"I bet that Stanley Kubrick spent the last thirty years of his life laughing his tuckus off that of all of his works, this one most profoundly affected the cultural consciousness which he consistently satirizes.Evidence of this abounds: witness the instantly recognizable creations of the computer HAL, and its synthetic voice; the character ""Dave"" and the line ""What are you doing, Dave?""; and the stylized score based on Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra.""There is no doubt that this is a beautiful, confounding picture that says something about the dehumanizing effects of technology. What *else* it says is totally unclear - the screenplay is often quite witty, but feels like it was never thought completely through. Of course, works that are incomprehensible are often deemed to be profound, and Kubrick seems to have understood that; in fact, the emergence of drug culture and middle-class spiritual yearnings during the late 60s allowed him to create something really huge and really vague, and pass it off as something really deep.The film opens with ""The Dawn of Man,"" where it is implied that man's evolution was directed by either a) an alien life-force, or b) a God-like creature, represented by a huge black monolith.The former interpretation would be the less mundane, more sci-fi expression, but the relationship between man and alien is never developed. Instead, outer space is a setting - an excuse for an excursion by scientists (who discover a huge monolith on the moon), who end up battling against a computer (HAL - increment the letters by one and you get IBM) that turns on its creators.What the monolith means, or what is is doing in outer space, is bafflingly unclear, and Kubrick never bothers to explain its presence. In spite of this (or maybe because of it), many viewers have hailed the film as a religious experience; many more time their drug hits in order to be stoned during the psychedelic final scenes.2001 does have something going for it - its special effects are masterfully done and may be forever unsurpassed in terms of the visual spectacle they produce. (Kubrick garnered his one and only Oscar for this film, for Best Visual Effects.)Also, this is a lesson in how to tell a story through images and sounds. Though it runs 141 minutes, there are less than 40 minutes of dialogue.But as a commentary on the nature of humankind and the universe in which we live, it leaves a great deal to be desired."

andersonljundberg,"Nov 8, 2015",10/10,"The movie, at first glance, may seem overly monotonous and lengthy. I can see why one may think this. The first time I viewed the movie, I was certainly impressed with the visuals and message, but it all seemed a bit to dry and abstract for me.Then, I viewed it a second and third time. Each time, I become more and more amazed by the simple cynical message the film tells us about the human race, and how we shoot so high, and fall so low. The message is subtle, and the meaning behind the film has been interpreted in hundreds of ways because of the genius behind the film. This is a film you must be attentive to, you can't just idly watch it while sending emails on your laptop.Overall, the stunning non-CGI visuals, the complex message, the depth of the film, and the personal impact it has had on me is incredible. As such, this is the one film I will ever give a 10/10. I hate giving away 10 out of 10s, as it implies near absolute perfection, but this movie is deserving of such a rating."
estebanlopezlimon,"Sep 28, 2017",10/10,"The characters in this film pursue something that seems more an attempt to satisfy an eternal mortal's compulsion than an objective in itself. The senseless interest of mystery, risking life for a simple answer. The movie reaffirms this point by introducing us to the confrontation between AI's perspective and human's perspective on the mission.They are (mankind) looking for an object that could compensate the infinite darkness that conveys the existence of conscience. Our protagonist will conclude his life the same he started it: ignorant and confused. That remark shows a lack of sense in whatever the human being aspires.Does the comprehensible plot can distract you from the art? Probably. The story of the film is perfect for that reason.Those who hate this masterpiece are the type of audience that expect answers from a movie. In 2001 there's no attempt to give a concrete message. This film acts as an statement of ambiguousness and mystery, which composes the strange essence of everything that is considered attractive to the intellect. Stanley doesn't dare to give a definitive answer to our collective question; instead he offers more questions, so you can appreciate the beauty of it.I believe this movie defies our conception of cinema. Stanley comes to remind us the real sense of this art. 2001 doesn't not entertain but amazes."
droog57-704-79517,"Nov 25, 2021",10/10,"OK, so this was RELEASED in 1968, but was in production for what, 2 years at least, that gets it back to 1966 when it was concieved and executed. So, Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were brainstorming and writing the screenplay and the book simultaneously, but the end result is truly incredible.If you have not seen it, watch it. But prepare to have to think about grand themes when you do. Is could be reasonaby called ""slow"" but the cinematography fills in the slow parts, and remember 1966-68 time frameAs far as I am aware it was the first movie to show iPad type tablets used by the astronauts, and all of the displays shown in the all of the different spacecraft were flatscreens, never done before, and all of the susequent classic sci-fi used bulbous CRT displays (Alien and Aliens come immediately to mind).The first movie to depict artificial gravity, used in a ultra realistic way, to the point where the only flase depiction of zero-g is when the guy is on his way to the moon and drinks from a straw, the liquid goes back down the tube.. And not until recently have any films tried to depict accurate zero-g in a non-stupid way (like walk through a door and magically have gravity..etc).Then there is the cinematography..
Stunning.To the point where I use screenshots for my wallpaper every now and then.The story is well known by now but was challenging when it first came out, but that just encouraged repeat visits to the cinema. Eg: it played at the University Theater (amazing huge cinemascope screen and sound by Klipsh) in Toronto for 2 full years. I think that I remember that it did similar numbers in other citys around the world as well.So if you love film, this one is right up there as a candidate for top 5 ever.Better than Lawrence of Arabia ?A lot of the stuff shown was depicted for the first time in a competant, realistic way. In 2021 we have become so used to the tech, that we forget that not long ago, there was no internet, no tablets to watch SpaceX stuff on... y'know?Wonderful movie."
Horenzo,"Sep 23, 2020",10/10,"Watch it, it's probably the greatest movie ever made. Seriously, watch it, if you love film, you have to see this film!"
michaelheiser-25099,"Nov 10, 2021",6/10,"Good film of Kubrick that tend to love this long nothingness because of its artistic merits. And I somewhat understand this - I can understand praising ""2001"" for its uniqueness, its powerful narrative. But the fact of the matter is that as a movie it's simply not very good because of this! It has dated very poorly. E.g. The space station segments - they are one of the only moments in the film with extensive dialogue. The ""futuristic"" suits are laughably '60s-ish and some of the ideas in the movie about communication via video, etc. Are ludicrous. That happens in any movie after a certain amount of time, but ""2001"" almost entirely depends upon this. I feel the actual story itself is weak. Kubrick is at a loss for anything useful so he delays it by continually showing us exterior shots of spacecraft and planets in tune with classical pieces. It just gets to be too much after a while.This all said, please understand I am not putting down this movie. I still admire it very much for what it is and will watch it for years to come. But as a piece of entertainment, as a movie...I find it poor and self-indulgent on Kubrick's behalf. It lacks the satirical bite of ""A Clockwork Orange."" The end sequence is horribly outdated with drug-trip visuals (it was rumored to have been one of the movies stoners would go see on a regular basis!). Like everything in this movie, it goes on too long - look at ""Easy Rider"" and ""Midnight Cowboy."" Both have '60s/'70s druggie sequences but both end before becoming intolerable - ""2001"" goes on too long... ""2001"" is a piece of art, but it is not a good movie in any way. I have seen art house films with better plots (""Punch-Drunk Love,"" ""Magnolia"") and more involving stories. ""2001"" is a showcase for special effects and directorial styles - but now it is very outdated and alienating and this is my biggest problem with it."
IvanSamudra,"Dec 1, 2014",10/10,"i recently saw Interstellar, and since that i couldn't stop thinking about this Piece of Art.this is one of the most brilliant movies i've ever seen, maybe one of the most important movie ever made (arguably one of the best sci-fi movie ever made), Kubrick is a genius, Extraordinary filmmaker. if you live in the year this movie released, you might think he's crazy, just because this movie is already far more advance than it should be. the visualization is great with the help of classical music, it's gives you intense and it brings the seriousness. the original score is great too though. some people might find this movie boring because it's kinda slow pace movie, Especially in the first twenty minutes. for me that's art and technical at the same time, the camera work, his vision of the future is just incredible. the special effect is awesome too (for 1960's movie is a breakthrough).i agree with one of the review here says ""One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood."" it's a perfect description."
masoncheek,"May 5, 2020",10/10,"I seriously thought this film was way to good for it's time. I mean 1968? Dang. Nice effects. Anyway 10/10, great film."
Kiyotaka_,"Dec 6, 2016",10/10,"I've never seen anything like this before and sadly, I'm afraid I never will.This is by far the best movie of science fiction ever.Everything is beautifully arranged to please your senses in every way you can imagine. There are a lot details which are meticulously cared to satisfy you throughout 2 hours and 29 minutes.If it wasn't for this movie, I'd say it would be impossible to even think the creation of this kind of film, regarding the year it was released (1968). And due to that fact, I can't quite understand yet how Kubrick's masterpiece has managed to surpass decades of technology advance to be even better of many of nowadays films, in visual effects terms.There are no words enough to praise this masterpiece, it is simply perfect; From start to end.If you have not seen this movie yet, you are missing a visually striking experience."
gcarpiceci,"Feb 23, 2016",10/10,"This is for me THE sci-fi movie by definition, and I support my pitch with the following facts: # the movie has the ambition to tell the story of human kind from its very remote beginning four million years ago up to its far future; a huge ambition, an almost unbearable burden, but 2001 succeeds: the movie is at the same time highly epic and iconic... # epic: the story is a fantastic journey: four million years ago, a mysterious, superior entity has come on earth to chose the best among all pre-human beings (actually an ape, Moonwatch) to transition his species into its future, i.e. mankind as we know it. Four million years later, the same mysterious entity appears again and again it comes to select the best among all men (Dave Bowman) to do what his precursor had done millions of years before, i.e. to carry his species to the next level. The final amazing journey across time and space, culminating in the birth of the new species, symbolised by the huge phoetus- egg that Bowman has turned in, is a unique filmic experience # iconic: 2001 has changed sci-fi cinema for ever, sci-fi movie have never been the same since. The cinematographic solutions that Scott and his crew have created for 2001 have set new standards for any future sci-fi movie: just think of the way of portraying spaceships, moving very slowly against the infinite background of the deep space instead of being bullet-like objects as they had been shown up to then. Other visuals have been adopted by movies like the fantastic Interstellar (which I loved a lot!): think of the spinning space station, the docking scenes, and even the key visuals of the journey across the wormhole (is this Cooper or David Bowman...?). I watched 2001 back in 1969, and I keep watching it every now and then; another amazing thing of this movie is how watchable still is nearly 50 years after its production, even more so for a sci-fi movie, most of which become obsolete"
RobbyHegmann,"Oct 16, 2018",N/A,"""2001: A Space Oddisey"" is 1968 science-fiction film by genious Stanley Kubrick, the script was a colaboration between Kubrick and novelist Arthur C. Clarke. Time later, Clarke would release a novel about the same story althought you shouldn't take it in consideration when analizing this film.
I've never given a 10 in my life, and I'll never do it again, 2001 is exeptional in every aspect it's propoused to, the use of classical music makes this a movie without age, the wonderful photography, the magnificent scenes and space shots it's simply unforgivible; even if you don't understand it (which is/will probably the case) you can't help but admire the masterpiece in front of your eyes.
What is unique, is the amount of depth that this film can have, every time you'll rewatch it not only you'll find new details but also comprend a little bit more of what it is all about. At the first view it felt as a quick look at human's history, both past and future. At the second view I understood that Kubrick's made a comparason between our ignorance in our primitive forms and our behaviour in the outer space. Third view and I thought it was about humanity itself, you know, the AI as a new form of human thought, the fake discovery on the moon, the reactions, etc. And so on. What it is wonderfull of this take on Kubrick is that, as well as in 'The Shining', every one can have its own interpretation. In many ways the film treats the lies for self-recognition, the egocentrism of humans, our lacks of moral, our inmaturance, our insignificance, but in the other way it speaks about the screen, the proper mediums of cinema (althought it is very subtle), and so on; it is a must watch for everyone, specially because you'll be trying to find your way throught this marvellous puzzle we call '2001'"
seymourpantaloons,"Sep 15, 2023",6/10,"Old movies, slow movies, and profound movies can be great. Jaws, Blade Runner, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for example, are all fantastic.2001, however, is an old, slow, maybe profound movie during which I found myself falling asleep.Many of the shots are pretty and the music is iconic, but everything else drags - the way you feel during the 3 minute opening of black screen is indicative of how you'll feel during the rest of the movie.I read the book first and I found it terrible, but if I hadn't read it, I don't think I would have known what was going on. I'm not sure they properly explain why the odyssey even takes place in the movie.I'm not going to say you should avoid this movie, but don't expect it to be some great cinematic masterpiece."
Kingslaay,"Dec 31, 2019",8/10,"2001 is the deepest and most thought provoking film I have ever seen. I had to read a lot about its hidden meaning to truly appreciate what Kubrick was trying to show us. Kubrick relies on limited dialogue and conveys a visual experience instead. It will take the average viewer time and reflection to figure this movie out, if one can figure it out. 2001 is so ahead and transcends so much that we are used to in terms of plots, twists and so on when it comes to film.2001 is about the human experience and the spirit. It delves so deep into what we are as a species. It also shows how AI can be a hindrance to human evolution. It is only until the astronaut cuts this off that he can get closer to the next level. Kubrick shows that AI is not true human evolution, we are semi-civilised and never thought about our own progress. Philosophers have hinted at it but we've not considered the metaphysical and spiritual. A truly momentous film."
vikanov,"Jan 28, 2023",6/10,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a science fiction masterpiece directed by Stanley Kubrick, released in 1968. The film is a visually stunning exploration of humanity's relationship with technology and our place in the universe. The film's budget was reportedly around $10.5 million, and it was shot in a variety of locations, including England, the United States, and a soundstage in Borehamwood, England.The film stars Keir Dullea as astronaut David Bowman and Gary Lockwood as astronaut Frank Poole, both of whom give solid performances. The film also features a memorable turn by HAL 9000, an artificially intelligent computer, voiced by actor Douglas Rain.The film's visual effects and art design are truly breathtaking and have stood the test of time, with Kubrick using innovative techniques such as front-projection, slit-scan photography and realistic miniature models to create a believable vision of the future. The film's use of classical music, particularly Richard Strauss's ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" adds to the film's epic and otherworldly atmosphere.It's a film that requires patience, and it is not for everyone, but for those who appreciate it, it's a visionary and thought-provoking film that still resonates today. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards and won one for Best Special Visual Effects.In summary, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a visually stunning and thought-provoking exploration of humanity's relationship with technology and our place in the universe. With its groundbreaking special effects, memorable performances, and innovative filmmaking techniques, it is a film that continues to be celebrated and studied by film enthusiasts and critics alike.Unfortunately, I din't found it so epic and it didn't passed the time exam for my opinion."
james-asbury,"Feb 8, 2017",10/10,"I watched this film only once in an actual movie theater, and that was in 1968. I honestly don't remember seeing as much detail as I have seen in the Blue Ray DVD version, which is available online for less that $10.00. This film has not been seen as clearly as it can be seen now, on a UHD 55"" flat screen TV, it literally is a brand new movie complete with it's extra long running time due to the opening and closing musical scores being presented during a black screen. This device allows time for the theater audience to find their seats and get acclimated to the darkness. When the film begins it is a startlingly realistic vision of the distant past. Everyone knows what this film is about but if you've seen it on VHS, regular DVD or streaming video, you just have not seen it. Every second has been restored and the detail is amazing! I can't believe how a film being edited for commercial TV can be ruined so completely but now this masterpiece of cinematography and cinematic craftsmanship can be seen as it was intended to be seen, I think far better than ever expected by Kubrick himself. It is an amazing film.Younger viewers of this film will need to know that it's theatrical release in 1968 was preceded by the release of a thick paperback novel, a screenplay of sorts, written by Arthur C. Clarke himself and was a best seller and widely available and intended to be read as a helper to understanding the plot of this film. The book is still available in used bookstores. I suggest that anyone seeing the film for the first time also read the book first. It includes photos from the film."
Alsmoviereview,"Feb 24, 2020",10/10,"Wife: what you watching?
Me: 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Wife after 2 minutes: what a pile of s#1t this is.
Me: Not every movie should be like Guardians of the Galaxy.
Wife: Hate it when you get defensive, like I'm not intellectual or cultural enough.
Me: I just want to watch without you criticising it every 5 minutes.
(Movie ends. I pass her the remote)
(Wife puts on Judge Judy)I love this movie. Hugely influential and pioneering in special effects. Inspired George Lucas, David Bowie, etc. I think whether you will enjoy it depends on if you are patient and open minded enough to sit through long bouts of no dialogue and an unexpected ending which perplexes. My wife likes Adam Sandler and Dwayne Johnson movies, while I like Eraserhead which she still hasn't forgiven me for introducing her to. Hehe."
weanedon2001,"Aug 23, 2018",10/10,"I watched this classic film the other day on blu-ray, and all the things I love are there : the masterfully chosen classical music pieces (especially the Strauss pieces and Khatchaturian's Gayane ballet piece for the establishing shots of the Discovery ship), the intricate model work of the ships and moonbase - featuring those influential cut out shots to show tiny crews and computer screens - and the abstract ending, which has been dividing audiences for decades. I was taken to this film as a child in one of its 70's revival theatre showings (it was one of my parents' favourite films) and I can't really remember what I made of it then, but this film has been there with me at different stages of my life (like the monolith in the film at different stages of evolution) and probably always will be."
vivi_Zap,"Jun 2, 2016",10/10,"One of the greatest film I've ever had the pleasure to watch...Exceptional cinematography, a script way ahead of its time and of course Kubrick ingenious direction...It's definitely not for everyone, since there is not much dialogue and the first half hour may seem completely wacky...Nevertheless, after a careful watch, one will fall in love with every frame of this flawless movie...In order to fully comprehend its deeper meaning more than one viewing is required, especially since the last of the three 'chapters' can be extremely confusing for the viewer...I consider this movie to be a must-watch for every movie lover and a personal favorite...Hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did..."
adrian-43767,"Jan 23, 2018",10/10,"I first watched 2001 in 1970, and 13 I was then. It blew me away, taking me to a time, an atmosphere, a vision that far surpassed anything I had seen or read. Batman, The Time Machine, and anything else that even vaguely related to sci-fi promptly became scrap by comparison with this ode to spacial beauty, this timeless tale of man vs machine, and this celebration of human intelligence... and its limitations.Visually stunning, musically memorable, with a great director. Stanley Kubrick, in his greatest form ever, this is a movie that I have re-watched many times, and always I find new angles and details, and renewed pleasures. It is best watched on the 70mm Cinerama screen in a proper movie house, but the DVD and Blu-Ray versions already offer considerable quality, allowing one to take in the subtlety of photographic composition, and glorious special effects, that have been imitated ad nauseum, but never equalled.It is a most intelligent film, one that leaves you thinking for days, and me in awe of how human beings managed to come up with this visual wonder.Pity the most you can give this masterpiece is 10/10!"
The_Centurion,"Jan 26, 2009",10/10,"This is it: Kubrick's masterstroke. Science fiction's magnum opus and quite possibly the greatest film of all.The opening credits is a moment of perfection. Like nothing else in cinema it makes my hair stand on end and brings me close to tears. How Kubrick managed this, to birth such a powerful beginning in mere seconds, amazes me. The sun peaking over the planet's edge to the tune of Strauss' Thus Spake Zarathustra -- it practically screams ""dawn of man"" without ever saying a word.Out of this is spawned an incredible journey through mankind's evolution. Technically marvelous, every detail is accounted for and engineered for a purpose. The innovation of ""2001"" saturates the film in every frame. The silence of space, the technologies of the future, the foreseeing of man's utter reliance on machines. There is no other film with as great a scope.Before science fiction was tenable ""2001"" made it so. Before we landed on the moon Kubrick took us there."
Brogan,"Nov 16, 2002",N/A,"I was so fortunate yesterday to experience a miracle in the cinema. While thousands were flocking to see the latest installment of the HARRY POTTER series, I instead traveled over thirty miles to catch Stanely Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY on the big screen.  I've seen it several times on cable, video, and DVD.  But watching it yesterday on the big screen was a whole new experience, a experience that I will never forget. Some people will call 2001, Kubrick's best film.  I would disagree, I personally like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE as my favorite.  But 2001 is a hair-line fracture behind CLOCKWORK.  Both films are on my top 20 films of all time. I would have personally like to see 2001 on the Cinerama screen at the Hollywood Archlight Cinerama dome on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood, but beggars can't be choosers.  Seeing it on a big enough screen was pleasing enough. How can I describe 2001 to those who have never seen it before? 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is a film before it's time.  It's the most influental Science Fiction film of all time!  Yes, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is more of a influence than STAR WARS and MATRIX.  In fact, when George Lucas was directing STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE, he kept asking his crew about the space scenes in A NEW HOPE: ""is it as good as 2001?"" This is a movie that was released before David Lynch's career began, that required several viewings to understand the meaning of the film. Like I said before, I saw the film several times, and watching it on the big screen last night, I discovered new things with the plot. What other person could think of directing a movie in 1968, where a computer is the most reliable and intelligent instrument on a space ship? And thirty-three years later, in the year 2001, the computer is the most reliable instrument on the international space station. Or who else could think of showing a video game of a man playing chess on and with a computer, in 1968? Remember that this movie was released when The Beatles were still putting out new music, the Vietnam War was going on, and San Fransico was psychedlic central.  Speaking of which, this is the film that is dubbed, ""The Ultimate Trip.""  Since people who watched 2001 when it was first released, would drop acid, run up to the front of the theater to lay down and look up at the screen. I pity Warner Bros. for not giving a full re-release of this film last year in 2001, (or at least a one screen per city re-release).  But instead releasing SCOOBY-DOO and BALLISTIC on thousands of screens across the nation, I guess money talks. But why should I mention those pieces of garbage with this film review? I told people for years, and I'll tell you now that I would consider placing a video screen continiously showing 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, with a picture frame around the screen and putting it in a art museum.  When hundreds of years eariler, artists like DiVinci, Monnet, Van Gough, and 20th century artist like Picasso and Dali would express their art though paintings, Kubrick did his expressing through film. This is one of the best movies of all time.  If you ever hear or find out that 2001 is playing on a cinema screen in your area.  I highly urge you to catch it the way it was always ment to be seen, on the big screen.  And I'm sure, Kubrick would agree with me.  This is one of the best films of all time, so giving it ***** (out of five) is to little for the praise it deserves.  But see the film yourself and be the judge, and I hope you'll agree with me."
milgar-62247,"Feb 11, 2018",10/10,"As of now, I saw this movie about a year ago and it is still as great as I remember it. The special effects are all practical and they look so much better than CGI could ever do. The direction is some of the best ever. The imagery will stick with you. The cinematography is fantastic. The ending is my favorite part. This is a much watch, but not for everyone. But, if you like previous Kubrick movies then you probably enjoy this one."
shanusa,"Feb 24, 2016",10/10,"'2001' was my favourite movie before I joined film school, and the fresh perspectives I gained and learned while at school, only reinforced my adoration for this masterpiece. For a 2hr 45min film to have only 18 minutes of dialog is an incredible thing to achieve, and to think that this was made in 1968 makes it all the more impressive.I must have watched this film a dozen times, but the most memorable time was watching this in a theater during a festival at Museum of Moving Image in New York.Featuring some of the most iconic moments in cinema history, this film is an experience that will immerse the viewer.I won't give out spoilers, but do watch and enjoy this incredible experience."
masonsaul,"Apr 6, 2024",10/10,"2001: A Space Odyssey is an ethereal experience. What it covers in its 2 and a half hour run time makes all other films pacing seem bad by comparison. It's timeless and timely whilst offering a complex journey that tells so much of its story visually in a way that really trusts the audience.Keir Dullea is the ideal protagonist for a slow burning film like this. Since the film is light on exposition and answers a lot of his performance is internalised with his Kubrick stares saying everything. Douglas Rain as HAL 9000 is so unsettling from the first words spoken. His calm tone is perfect as it turns everything he says into a threat.Stanley Kubrick's direction is so confident, completely unafraid to take its time by letting the sound announce itself well before any image appears. The film not only holds up but also looks younger than it is with visual effects that feel ahead of the time and it contains the greatest match cut in cinema.By serenading the space travel with classical music it's never felt more serene in those early moments. When the music isn't present the reliance on diegetic sound or none at all for large stretches is immensely effective in maintaining tension. The sets are staggeringly good, watching the actors move around them and the sets themselves rotate never gets old."
mmerucci,"Apr 27, 2016",10/10,"2001: A Space Odyssey is without a doubt, the greatest science-fiction movie of all time. Many people who have seen the movie claim it is ""boring"" or ""too slow"", but the bottom line is- if you have a short attention span, you won't like this movie. The visual effects of this movie are truly beautiful, you could say it is the Mona Lisa of movies. The storyline was very interesting, and presented ideas and a plot that very few people can think of. The minimal dialogue is great compliment to a movie like this, every word that is spoken is important in order to understand the movie. The use of music in 2001 is genius, it feels like you are sucked right into the movie, as the film's artsy space scenes flow with the classical music it is shown with. The acting in 2001 is spectacular, especially by Keir Dullea (David Bowman). I don't think the cast could have done better job. Lastly, the ending is an absolutely mind-bending series of events that leaves you thinking of how to interpret it, a truly spectacular ending to an amazing movie."
parameswaranrajendran,"Feb 24, 2018",7/10,This film is proving that Stanley Kubrick has already bring the Hollywood on largest par based on the technology. I just wandering how he can erect this high tech sets in 1968 itself. Before Spielberg there was Stanley. Otherwise the screenplay is very dull and the first dialogue itself is only after 25th minute of the film. I watched this film by using headset and some of the sound portion gives me headache. It is watchable movie to encounter how intelligent is Stanley Kubrick in creating the space movie in the year that Hollywood film have no any technology improvements.
mwhiteman-34062,"Dec 27, 2018",10/10,"As a fan of cinema I have a long list of films that I love. But Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi epic 2001 is the best out of all them. From its direction, acting and visual effects that after 50 years looks better than most movies today, you can do no wrong with this film."
Lonelytunes,"Feb 10, 2025",2/10,"It was so boring i just couldnt watch it. I dont know what to say more about it. Yeah maybe at past when it first came out it was amazing but now i just couldnt even focus on it. I couldn't even pass the first 10 20 minutes. Monkey part is interesting and all but man everything in this movie takes it time. Every angle every scene is slow as possible, some new ideas for its time maybe exploring them with slow shots and no dialogues cool and all but today they are not so new. Spaceships and A. I and aliens engineering humanity and speeding up the pace of its cognitive evolution yeah nice ideas and all but uh sorry they are not enough for me to focus constantly on the screen. Monitors and spaceships was a pioneering ideas at the time but now ther are well beyond explored at this point."
Sheldon114,"Aug 18, 2020",10/10,"I have seen a lot people. Insult this movie. Saying it is one the most boring movie and he filmed dancing apes in the opening scenes.
To them I would just say if you didn't like it it does not make it a bad movie.
Cinema is subjective , if you like movies that are made with a lot of hardwork and best production quality , then this one is for you.
Yes it is slow in pace , but if you want to find why audience praise this movie so much and you too want to join them .
I may have a solution for you, first of all watch all of his films before this then you could watch this one. Because a lot of his trademarks are present in this film.
So in order tp enjoy this master piece you must be either a philosophy lover or stanley kubrick fan.And please don't spread bad reviews about this one, because this is one of the legendary films ever made . Not only Stanley but the whole crew has worked diligently to give us this magnum opus.
Great filmamkers like Christopher nolan , James cameron , Gaspar noé to name a few. Are inspired by this movie so if you didn't like this film it is your problem."
rchalloner,"Sep 13, 2020",10/10,"I saw 2001 when it came out in the cinema on a huge surround screen. The experience has never left me. It was epic then and it remains so today. People may debate the meaning of the ending, but that is part of the beauty and mystery of the film. Considering when it was made the cinematography and special effects are spectacular, but they never distract the viewer from the unfolding story and for the first time, the millions of viewers who saw it in 1968 had an idea of what space travel was like. The music is so perfectly chosen as well. Stanley Kubric was a genius, a movie craftsman and 2001 demonstrates how brilliant he was."
lucadavino,"Aug 28, 2017",10/10,"2001 Space Odyssey is one of the best movies ever filmed in movie history. Is one of the best films because it represents and staged one of the best views of cinema and space at the same time. It shows how much man is fragile to the evolution that often escapes us. The most impressive thing is that this film was filmed in 1968, by far anticipating other films made for decades. Stanley Kubrick has definitely exceeded every expectation when he decided to shoot this movie overcoming any kind of rival in the field."
MattBrady099,"Nov 18, 2016",10/10,"LIFF30 2016 #5""Daisy.""So I just saw ""2001"" at a film festival and it was kinda incredible. Why do I feel like I just ticked off my bucket list of things to die before you die. I've been waiting a long time to watch this on the big screen. I already seen the movie about 3 or 4 years ago, but my memory of the film isn't that strong. So when I was picking what movies I wanted to see at (LIFF), and this was on the list, as the festival also shows classic movies.Re-watching this movie was quite the experience. Nothing like a massive screen and loud speakers blasting off beautiful music while drifting in space. From the dawn of man till the end of human life. The cycle repeats.But seriously, what can I honestly say about ""2001"" that hasn't been said already. It's one of the greatest Sci-Fi films of all time. It's groundbreaking and pure genius. Even at the slower pace parts, I was still engaged. After it was over, I was contemplating on it.For a 1968 film, it's visual effects still hold up today and looks way more convincing than today. Well, there was a couple of effects that was noticeable, but the rest (which is mostly practical) still looks amazing. The ""Star Gate"" sequence is one example of a trippy and a breathtaking effect that it owned Kubrick an Oscar.Every shot in this movie is like something you would hang up on your wall. Kubrick has been known for being a perfectionist of his work. This is a work of an artist that doesn't just get praised for how much he dose, but how little. Three years of making this - you can get easily attached to your work that after awhile you find the hidden beauty of the story. Do it 40 or 127 times until you get what you want and exactly how you wanted. A similar method that Chaplin use for ""City Lights"". But it isn't just images that kept me attention and I don't think Stanley was intending on that. There's plenty of scenes that goes on forever, not for spectacle, but more of use to inhabit everything that's going on.It also helps that music in this is so beautiful, but very eerie at the right moments. I can take the monolith on the moon scene as a great example of the bone chilling music. It may be scary for some, because of ""Requiem for Soprano"" playing in the background, but I kinda see like this:Man discovers a 4 million year old structure buried under the surface of the moon. Perfect angles and a disturbingly flawless complexion. imagine if this event actually occurred in reality and you were sitting in front of your TV when a breaking news bulletin interrupts your program. Just imagine the weight of the emotions you feel. There is no explanation for how this structure could even exist. its impossible! It will be the most reality-shattering event in the history of the world.It's one of my favorite scenes of all time, because the scene alone perfectly captures that feeling. No explanation. No answers. No reason.Overall: Films like ""Space Odyssey"" is why I love movies. Extraordinary and beautiful work of art. ""2001"" isn't just a classic for it's effects or the show stealer Hal9000, but how it wants to inspire and enlarge us. A space voyage that evokes questions and kept the audience in awe for 48 years."
carlostiago,"Dec 27, 2016",10/10,"The first ten minutes of the film invites us to view prehistoric humans in a world thousands of years before civilization and technology. We are then suddenly transported forward in time to the year 2001.A mysterious monolith is discovered on one of Jupiter's moons and a team of scientists is commissioned to travel there to investigate and report.What can I say about my idol, Stanley Kubrick? In one word: Genius.And as for the film: A one of a kind master piece and a must see film for it's attention to detail and realism. One of the very few films made where you don't hear the roar of engine noise coming from the space ship. That's realism.The score: The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss is unforgettable and mesmerizing."
Michael_Elliott,"Apr 3, 2016",N/A,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)**** (out of 4)After discovering a mysterious object beneath the moon's surface, an astronaut heads to Jupiter with a thinking computer known as the HAL 9000.That doesn't sound like too much of a plot description but to be honest there's really not too much ""story"" here. Of course, the lack of a well-detailed story is something people use to attack the film and I agree that more of a ""story"" would probably have been good during the middle portions of the film but that doesn't take away the overall impact of the movie. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen in 2016 and it's just amazing to see this film and think that it was made over forty-five years ago.Needless to say, this film is all Stanley Kubrick as he pretty much did everything. This brain child is without a question a masterpiece on the visual level and it's just remarkable to see how well this film has stood up over time. I consider myself a major film buffs that enjoys movies from all eras but there's no way to deny that certain classics have fault with their special effects when viewed today. There's really not a single fault in regards to the effects and I must say that this film remains the benchmark for everything dealing with outer space.We could name dozens of science fiction films that 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY influenced but I think it would be easier to say that every sci-fi film that followed owes something to this. What was so remarkable is how the special effects look 100% here and even if you try looking for something that looks fake you're not going to find it. Kubrick did a remarkable job at creating space and so much so that if you learned he actually went to space to film this stuff you'd believe it. The sets are also rather remarkable and they too look every bit as great today as when they were released.The actors in the film are also very good but they really do take a back seat to everything else. This is a visual movie with breathtaking cinematography and I've already talked about the special effects. The film also works on your ears and we've got one of the greatest music scores ever recorded as well as some of the greatest sound effects you'll ever hear. Again, hearing and seeing 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is really an adventure and an experience all of its own.Kubrick created several great films in his career and while I don't rank this as his greatest, it's impossible to underplay its importance in history and how remarkably well it stands up decades after its release."
zrclzrcl-34421,"Jul 3, 2023",7/10,"2001: A Space Odyssey is only enjoyable if you like to expand on beautiful and simple ideas to understand and explore the perspectives of others. For those who want deep emotional connections and a character driven story this won't be your cup of tea. Most similar movie I've watched is Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"".The choosen theme ""the Future"" is envisioned through multiple vague concepts, that are connected through beautiful cinematography where lightning and angles create pictures that other movies could only dream of accomplishing. Although the movie seems realistic in general, the devil is in the details and it is here the magic of the moment lacks what is described in the movie ""The Prestige""."
Leofwine_draca,"Feb 24, 2015",8/10,"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is without a doubt the 'ultimate' space movie. Films like STAR WARS or ALIEN wouldn't exist without this, the first film to realistically portray what space travel is actually like. Yes, the film is incredibly slow, long, and extreme arty, but it's also a masterpiece and quite possibly Stanley Kubrick's greatest directorial effort.After a lengthy introduction that quite wonderfully shows off man's pre-history (and includes THAT famous jump cut), we're transported to the interior of a spaceship, where protagonist Dave (Keir Dullea) must contend with the machinations of his computer, HAL 9000. Everything that happens takes place very s-l-o-w-l-y, but this was intentional and I don't think there's any better way of getting across just how elongated being in space really is.HAL 9000 dominates the film and is my favourite computer creation in cinema; the most tragic too, I think. Dullea underacts to the best of his ability and is all the better for it, and of course Kubrick's direction is masterful, with incredible attention to detail. Yes, things get extremely psychedelic and trippy for the last half-hour's light show, but then it was the 1960s and you wouldn't expect otherwise. Great stuff indeed!"
EdgarST,"Apr 13, 2024",7/10,"I feel it is necessary to evoke the conditions in which I experienced «2001: A Space Odyssey» 50 years ago in Panamá, because today a regular spectator (at least, here in my city) can only see the film on video and, if possible, in a 35mm / Cinemascope copy, projected on normal screen.In those years, going to see «2001» was an event. The Panamanian public could watch movies in 35 or 70 millimeters in cinemas with large screens. On that occasion, «2001» was released in the Metro cinema, instead of the Lux, where the Cinerama system was installed, with the curved screen for which the movie was then intended. After releasing some films with triple simultaneous projection (like «This is Cinerama», «How the West Was Won», «The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm» and several travelogues), by the late 1960s the ""Cinerama experience"" could be duplicated with a single projection in 70mm, although it was also possible to do something approximate with anamorphic 35mm copies. So M-G-M took its product to its own cinema, which also had a huge screen for 70mm projection.In 1968, it was a ""far out"" experience to see a spacecraft to the strains of Johann Strauss' «By the Beautiful Blue Danube». In part, this was one of director Stanley Kubrick's main goals: to make the audiences live an audiovisual event the way music is experienced, trying to reach the subconscious without explaining or showing much, and allowing them to draw their own conclusions. However, the reaction to the film was not positive.In fact, the criticism, in general, was lukewarm. The film demanded active subjective participation, similar as when watching an experimental film, something rarely sought after by industrial cinema. Moreover, the movie has a free and even whimsical structure, in which the spectators go through a series of audiovisual sensations, including a prologue in a documentary style, until the film tells a story that comes closest to a linear narrative, in which two astronauts confront HAL 9000, a ""flipped out"" computer. Happily, over the years the film has been re-evaluated and contextualized in the global work of Kubrick, a maverick filmmaker who faced the studio system.In the 1960s, after having creative confrontations with the star-producers of «One-Eyed Jacks» and «Spartacus» (respectively, Marlon Brando and Kirk Douglas), Kubrick promised not to do more cinema if he did not have absolute artistic control. He moved to England and began the most illustrious period of his career, with movies like «Lolita», «Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb», «A Clockwork Orange», «Barry Lyndon» and this magnus opus.Although «2001» is sometimes seen as one of the first films that gave seriousness to science fiction --which is not true, for remarkable works as «Himmelskibet», «Aelita» and «Metropolis», were made during the silent era--, or as one of the films that revolutionized visual special effects, which is true, the formal approach is further enriched by considering it as one of the products that helped define postmodernist art. It achieved this with its iconoclastic blend of past and future, classical music, op art, anthropological reflection, direct allusion to consumption (with product placement of Pan American, the main airline of its time, now extinct), display of technology, metaphysical concerns about the existence of God, and beautiful utopias as the creation of the ""new man"". This postmodern aesthetic would come to complete fruition in «Star Wars» (1977), another space odyssey that did not have Kubrick's high philosophical aims, and opted for less sophisticated and more popular myths after Joseph Campbell.Thematically, «2001» gives continuity to concerns expressed in «Dr. Strangelove», about man and his relationship with the machine, man and his destiny, his spirituality and the control of his lowest instincts. In one of the most famous ellipses in the history of cinema, the conversion of the bone that serves as a weapon to primitive men, into a spaceship, points to the fact that humanity's technological advance has gone hand in hand with the discovery of tools and weapons. The film is a testimony of the naive fascination of humanity with machineries, computers and gadgets that, due to the inappropriate use of certain sectors of the earth's population, might destroy planet Earth (and our societies) of today.Now more than ever, the warning of the film (which, as some persons have well noticed, echoes the final speech of Charles Chaplin in «The Great Dictator») is relevant: men and women need to develop a culture of peace, we have to control our destructive impulses, feel as much as we think, or perhaps ""think"" less. We need more humanity, solidarity and kindness, than skill to operate machines and ""being smart"" (or, ""being the imperial boss""). The social balance of dehumanized technology leads to violence and spiritual poverty. It is therefore no coincidence that Kubrick's next film was the controversial «A Clockwork Orange», a premonitory masterpiece that showed a future violent society without values.Kubrick stated in this regard: «As somebody said, man is the missing link between primitive apes and civilized beings (...) We are semi-civilized, capable of cooperation and affection, but needing some sort of transfiguration into a higher form of life (...) Since the means to obliterate life on Earth exists, it will take more than just careful planning and reasonable cooperation to avoid some eventual catastrophic event. The problem exists as long as the potential exists, and the problem is essentially a moral one and a spiritual one».However, «2001» does not conclude on a pessimistic tone. On the contrary, the end centers its hopes on the emergence of that new being, of that ""elevated form of existence"" that we should look for in ourselves and not in the higher intelligences that astronomers tell us that exist in the vast space. Unfortunately, the trend is of the kind in «Close Encounters of the Third Type», where hope and change is expected from the skies, not from us. In 1984, Hollywood produced «2010», a sequel without Kubrick, poetry or the original mysticism, which tried to answer questions from everything external to us.For all this, «2001: A Space Odyssey», in the select company of William Cameron Menzies' «Things to Come» (1936), Robert Wise's «The Day the Earth Stood Still» (1951) and Andrei Tarkovsky's «Solaris» (1972), continues as one of the few intelligent films that, from fables of scientific anticipation, wisely reflect on the condition of humanity and our place in the Universe."
TechGeekAnthony,"Mar 21, 2025",4/10,The only thing that made the movie interesting was the middle part with HAL when things finally got good. Beginning was boring and just drawn out. Like I mean REALLY drawn out. Then finally mid way some drama then near the end Boring again. There's a part that makes you feel like you're in a fever dream and it's just ridiculous to the point I started skipping that part. Hearing that criticism of the movie was strong back then I can absolutely see why. Some people out there love this movie. Good for them! But for many and the majority. This movie could of been so much better. Just hard to like/love which it having so many dead space and dead moments.
SnoopyStyle,"Sep 20, 2014",9/10,"The monolith has been there on Earth throughout human history. It goes all the way back to the ape-man. In the near future, they have found a monolith on the moon which is kept secret with a cover story. Then 18 months later, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are on a long deep space voyage to Jupiter on Discovery 1. HAL 9000 is the computer on board that is almost human. HAL seems to be malfunctioning. It kills Poole and the rest of the hibernating crew. Bowman pulls out HAL's memory and only then does he discover the true mission. Bowman encounters a monolith in the darkness of space near Jupiter.It's hard to talk about this movie without pointing out that this is more than the normal fun space sci-fi movie. This is definitely not Star Wars but it has qualities that transcends popcorn movies. It's confounding at times. It takes its time which bored some people. Director Stanley Kubrick obviously is saying something but it's not so simplistic that one could easily explain it. One either loves the vast nature of the movie or one hates the meandering story. Nevertheless, there is no denying the profound influence of this movie and its enduring fascination."
blakebabe411,"May 3, 2006",10/10,"the movement into pure thought, the ecstasy of something so great it's nothing, the fetus, the icy blue and white of the celestial embryo. I have loved this movie since I first started loving movies, which was a product of my first starting to love life, love it with my consciousness, and how fitting that a movie about the development of consciousness in humanity would be associated for me with the development of my own consciousness. This movie is about the development of humanity's consciousness, as if humanity might be embodied in a single human, metonymy, a single part of a whole symbolizing the whole. It's really Hegelian and Darwinian. Read Hegel, the Phenomenology of Spirit, and think of how it resonates with this movie. Do the same with Darwin's Origin of Species."
highkite,"Jun 15, 2006",10/10,"I don't think ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" should really be considered a film, but instead, it should be plain art. By ""plain"" I don't mean boring or uninspiring. I call it ""plain art"" because even to consider this genius work in the same category as other movies is risking comparison, and placing this movie beside another movie is almost unfair, because no movie has ever come close to being as unique.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is by far the most original piece of cinema ever created. It not only represents an idea so creepy and so realistic, but also breaks barriers in movie storytelling. Everything, from a 3-part narrative to an ending that makes you think for hours, wows the audience and sends their heads flying back in shock. It's a movie that a few may find weird, disjointed and pretentious, but every good movie is criticized by the public.The movie tells the story of a major transition between apes, humans and technology. Apes evolve into humans, and humans give birth to artificial intelligence. Probably one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history, as an ape smashes bones and throws one up into the air, director Stanley Kubrick carefully crafts a flawless transition from a bone into a space ship. Kubrick then takes us through some creepy ideas about unexplainable events and technology taking over humanity. Though we see three different stories, they are all connected: the apes show the first sign of evolution into humanity as they become more aware of their surroundings and learn the nature of mystery. Then, fast-forwarding thousands of years later, we see the story of a spaceship traveling to the moon on a commercial craft, and as they arrive they are shocked to find a monolith, which then transitions into a couple of months later when a newer spaceship is traveling to Jupiter.Kubrick really shows his genius in this movie, as he both directs the movie and the special effects. For the year it was made, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" completely shocked the audience with one of the most advanced and complex effects ever seen, which wows viewers even to this day. In an age where special effects were all done by hand, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" makes many people skeptical as to how they achieved some of the scenes without computer help. Aside from the stellar special effects, the score is the most haunting and unique piece of music ever put on the big screen. It so closely fits in with the movie with some major key scenes.The movie plays like an opera. It sways the audience in an inspiring music frenzy while also focusing on a story. And as we watch this movie brought to life, we question our own faith and our own motives in terms of creating artificial intelligence and traveling to foreign planets. What if one day our own race creates a HAL 9000 (a supercomputer with the ability to think and feel)? Questions like this are very much discussed upon watching this terribly amazing movie.Stanley Kubrick's best direction and one of my top movies of all time. It makes any other movie about space travel or artificial intelligence look shameful. A perfect film and an inspiring piece of art, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" defines cinema as one of the most influential and visually stunning films of all time."
zetes,"Apr 6, 2000",10/10,"2001 warps beyond every other film ever made. I have seen it nearly a dozen times since I first saw it in 1997. I bought it right away on VHS, and when I got DVD, it was the only VHS tape I replaced with a DVD.So why is it the best film ever made? Simply because it transcends narrative. No other film has really done that. Even surrealist films are rooted in narrative. Avant-guarde films sometimes do not use narrative, but they become only moving paintings. 2001 has narrative, but it never insists on it. It lovingly displays the amazing visuals.The narrative itself makes me feel that humanity could be so much more. Kubrick usually is kind of pessimistic, but at the end of 2001, he shows Dave's transcendence. And he is moving towards Earth to bring the rest of humanity with him. Although it shows the state of humanity as it exists now as violent and unsympathetic to the plight of others, it shows hope for our future.I have a rather large complaint about how some people look at this film, though. The introductory comment to this film on this site mentions understanding it more since that person has read the novel. This is all misinformation! Kubrick was inspired by the Clarke short story ""The Sentinal,"" which I have read. It is not really worth it. If you've ever seen Clarke on The Discovery Channel's ""Mysteries of the Unknown"" or whatever it's called, you know how pompous he is. The visions in 2001 are completely Kubrick's. Arthur C. Clarke was just a trampoline off which he jumped. The novel is not an original. It was written alongside with the film, and it was published afterwards. The university at Champaigne-Urbana celebrated Hal's birth in 1996, the date it gave in the novel. It is 1992 in the film, of course. Those ungrateful losers. That is the difference between a technology nerd and a cineast. Then Clarke completely milked the greatness of this film to make a living. If you want to see how terrible he really is, see the sequel to 2001, 2010, which he wrote. It was so awful that I killed it after 20 minutes. Pay no attention to Clarke and his leech-like behavior to this masterpiece.Those complaints, of course, have nothing to do with the actual film. To me, it is the most inspirational film ever made. I would watch it over anything. infinite/10"
MissSimonetta,"Nov 7, 2013",10/10,"This definitely requires more than one viewing. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) not only boasts some of the most stunning cinematography and timeless special effects on film, but it has a story with so many layers that a revisit or two is mandatory if you even want to begin to understand it. The ending alone has been baffling people for over forty-five years. Another hundred could pass and there will still be discussions about this film.Just do yourself a favor, relax, and watch this. Don't expect lots of action or dialogue, or the sort of roller-coaster rides that science fiction movies have become. This is a film you are meant to reflect on and mull over in your mind hours afterward. It's not for everybody, but for those who are willing to go for something a bit more thoughtful, give it a whirl. The two hours and forty minutes are worth it."
MaxBorg89,"Jul 23, 2007",10/10,"When I saw this movie for the first time, at the age of 14, I actually hated it: it was too slow (I had to repeatedly press the fast forward button on the remote control, especially during the last 20 minutes) and I did absolutely not get the ending. It took me two more viewings to understand that was the point: nothing ever happens quickly, man's rise to power was a slow process and therefore humanity's decline (Kubrick's favorite theme), as depicted here, should require an equally long amount of time.In fact, the director's idea is that often our greatest accomplishments are in reality an anticipation of decay. This is shown most clearly in the (very) long opening sequence, where a mysterious black monolith appears and presumably affects the planet's inhabitants (apes), as they learn to use bones as weapons, thus getting one step closer to progress but also much closer to extinction.The movie then cuts to a different era, in one of the most beautiful images of sci-fi cinema: one of the apes throws a bone in the air and as it goes back down it morphs into a spaceship. Apart from skipping centuries or even millennia in a very creative way, this also has the purpose of underlining the connection between the prologue and the rest of the film which, as indicated by the title, takes place far away from Earth in a distant (at the time this movie was made, that is) future. In particular, the focus is on a space station where a group of astronauts, led by David Bowman (Keir Dullea), are helped by a supercomputer named HAL 9000. HAL is, by his own definition, absolutely perfect and incapable of doing anything wrong. Or at least he was before the black monolith started showing up again, causing the machine to behave strangely and put the men's lives at risk (this was later reused by Kubrick, albeit differently, in Full Metal Jacket). What is happening? What is that black object, and what does it do?These questions remain unanswered, and given the director was the most notorious perfectionist in the history of cinema there has to be a good reason. Perhaps the answer is to be found in Kubrick's personal opinion about films: he believed watching movies was similar to dreaming, which is why some of his most famous works feature dream-related material (A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and the nightmarish, pun not intended, Eyes Wide Shut). In his mind, images were much more powerful than words, hence the limited dialogue in 2001: like in a dream, what really matters is what we see, not what we hear. Kubrick lets the visual elements speak by themselves, with nothing more than classical music as a companion (the ""dancing"" space vehicles and asteroids are among the most fascinating and iconic shots ever). When someone speaks, it is merely to move the plot forward, even though in one specific moment (the last scene where HAL ""appears"") it is used to highlight the film's most ironically moving sequence.Dreams are intriguing because we do not always understand their meaning and usually only remember a few images. 2001: A Space Odyssey is exactly the same: maybe the epilogue will never make sense, but the visual memories that have been left behind ensure the movie has a well deserved place in any Top 50 list of the greatest pictures of all time."
theshives,"Jul 2, 2000",N/A,"If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother.  It has no redeeming entertainment value whatsoever.  There is no plot, no dialogue, no action, no deeper meaning.  Nothing.  THERE'S NOTHING THERE!!How 2001 gets such high marks is beyond me.  I'll accept the fact that it had groundbreaking special effects for the 1960's (and which are still pretty good).  I'll further accept the fact that it may have had greater significance then, being released before man had even landed on the moon. I'll even go so far as to say that it might take on a greater significance if you've read either of Clarke's books (The Sentinel or 2001), which I freely admit I have not.All that being said, I fail to see the attraction to this movie.  Even as a ""cult"" piece, it fails.  Typical of several Kubrick films, it is tedious with far too much static.  Is it really necessary to focus on the hibernation chambers for 20 seconds when five seconds would more than adequately make the point?  Or to show the probe flying through space for more than a minute when you already know it's there?  Some call this art -- I call it an effort to stretch a 30-minute Discovery Channel special into a 140-minute movie.The ending itself is totally incomprehensible, with the absolute lack of dialogue providing not even the shadow of an explanation.  There's not even enough there to be open to interpretation.  Again, not having read either book, I may be at a disadvantage.  However, translating a novel into a screenplay should at least leave some *clue* as to the conclusion, even if you want to keep the audience guessing.If there is a deeper meaning to this movie, it is overwrought by today. Maybe the point is that computers aren't perfect even though they're promoted as such.  Or that computers can take over if man gives them too much power.  Ho-Hum!  Haven't we been here before?Kubrick-philes may say I'm missing it here, but I don't owe anyone an apology or explanation.  This is a terrible movie that is worth viewing only if you like to see early generations of special effects, or if you want to see Kubrick's heavy-handed, pedantic, static filmmaking at its worst.  Take my word for it -- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!  You'll be glad you did (or didn't)!"

This film is not for the common audience as it has so many inter-linked layers which makes it suitable only for those who like decrypting the layers and finding out the linkages between the scenes and filling up the gaps with their our versions.
Thankfully, there are so many demystifications out there if you're not one of those creative types and the beauty of this film is that it fits into any of those decrypts, because that's how generic it is intentionally made by the creator such as to let the audiences to fill the gap as per their imaginations, which again makes this film as a very unique film."
fclarkehearn,"Oct 4, 2023",7/10,"This film is visually stunning. Especially when you consider it was made in 1968. If you look at this film from the perspective of a film watcher in 1968 then this film is the most beautiful amalgamation of colours, cinematography and a hopeful peek into the future. Because it was ahead of its time it got away with overly long shots of similar visuals due to it being an unseen spectacle up until that point. But when you watch it as a modern viewer these overly long shots appear to be a ""show off"" from Kubrick. This film is great but those who hold it to the highest of esteem indefinitely gaslight themselves into believing that it's something it's not...it's a great film, definitely a classic but not nearly as good as it's made out to be."

Sleepin_Dragon,"Jan 8, 2023",10/10,"You can only imagine what audiences first thought when they sat in cinemas back in 1968 to watch this epic masterpiece, and I would argue that this film is as profound, challenging and breaths as it was back then.If you're coming for cheap thrills and action, look away, this simply won't offer that, if you're here to experience the art of cinematic beauty and sheer imagination, you will find this film quite remarkable.I never fail to be blown away by the visuals, please compare what was in cinemas back in 68, and then take a look at this, even in 2023 I am staggered by what they created, it looks phenomenal still, in HD it is unbelievable. The visuals are the key element here, it's almost a piece of art in itself.Those opening sequences set the tone, visually appealing of course, but they are so profound and thought provoking, seeing the apes behaving as they do, I've always considered it to be a statement of man's need for power, and a propensity for violence, I'm sure there are several interpretations.So many stars here to enjoy watching, Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood are terrific, as are the likes of Leonard Rossiter and Margaret Tyzack.It's a movie you genuinely have to experience at least once.

""2001""was a ground-breaking event, visually-speaking, that had people talking big-time when it was released. In my college-age crowd at the time, all anyone could talk about was the famous ""light show scene"" late in the film on the trip to Jupiter.Admittedly, there are a few things that make this film less than appealing to some, and I've always found that understandable: mainly, the slowness of many scenes and the secular agenda. I've never let either one bother me. First-time viewers are warned: don't expect a fast-moving film. And don't worry about figuring out the ending. I don't know if anyone has an answer to that.The visuals - the ""light show,"" modern furniture, immense space craft, the ending bedroom scene, the apes learning to use weapons to fight each other, etc - are all fascinating aspects of this movie, but there is more. The soundtrack, the more one hears it, is extremely impressive especially as technology improves and he we hear it on a good DVD and surround system. (The Blu-Ray is fantastic.)Now that's the way to hear classical music! Strauss' ""Blue Danube"" never sounded better! Played during many of the slower parts of the film, the dramatic music enhances the feel of the immensity of space itself. Then, audibly, we hear these eerie chants whenever the mysterious monolith appears, whether its on earth, out in space, or in Jupiter. In other words, this film offers a fantastic assortment of visual and audio ""trips"" for the senses.Story-wise, it's all about HAL, the computer, and two astronauts who are under his leadership. The spacemen - played by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood - are good, but HAL steals the show. His ""voice"" is mesmerizing, a haunting monotone. In fact, Douglas Rain is the unsung ""hero"" of this movie, with his voice-work of ""Hal."" The more one sees this movie, the more cold and evil HAL becomes.All in all, this is a movie - like the controversial ""A Clockwork Orange"" - that is so unique that I would think it would have be part of any movie fan's collection of the memorable films of the 20th century."
Hitchcoc,"May 18, 1999",10/10,"So many  have commented, some quite scholarly.  There are few films that have been held up to such scrutiny as this one.  My reactions are emotional, although I think I could wade in the same waters as some of my predecessors. My approach to movies is to take them as they come.  I am so tired of all the talk about special effects that begin almost every review.  If you have a high profile film, the special effects are treated as if they are some a form unto themselves, as if they were actually removed from the film. Didn't like the special effects.  Didn't like the movie.  Sit down for a moment and look at this film.  It's wonderful that Kubrick was able to do what he did with those effects, but the way this movie unfolds is so  much more than that.  This movie is there to portray a sense of the awe of the universe and the future of humankind based on the increments that have led us there.  It is about a future that may occur.Everyone is talking about movie being a disappointment after reading the book.  Folks, the movie came out before the book.  The movie was originally based on a short story called ""The Sentinel"" by Arthur C. Clarke.  The movie borrows some of its thoughtfulness from ""Childhood's End,"" another Clarke book which deals with similar issues about the ends of humankind and the transmigration of our being.  If you are going to enjoy 2001, you have to put away that fixation on the conventional science fiction of the day, with foam rubber aliens and armies of extra-terrestrial implements of destruction.  Take a look at Star Wars sometime (by the way, I think it's a wonderful film).  It is really a space western, a World War II airplane movie, with a rite of passage thrown in, and the obligatory soap opera stuff with Luke and Darth Vader.  No-one can hit anything with laser weapons. Those storm troopers are the most worthless fighting force I have ever seen. It's a fun movie, but when you look at true speculative science fiction, there isn't much to think about, no metaphysics, nothing much to occupy your mind after its over.  2001 sets out to be different and shouldn't be compared to Star Wars; they are apples and oranges.  This movie has some of the most breath taking images that stand there in silent space, just getting a reaction.  If Independence Day is your thing and everything you see needs to copy it, don't bother to see this movie."
Boba_Fett1138,"Dec 24, 2011",10/10,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is truly a milestone in the history of filmmaking. It showed the possibilities of what you could do with the science-fiction genre, besides having aliens trying to conquer the Earth. It showed that there was a reason as to why the word science is in science-fiction. But not only just story-wise is this a great movie within its genre but also technically.It really is one of the most complex movies you'll ever see, which is however mostly simply because it leaves up a lot to your own interpretation. To me the movie has always been about the evolution of mankind. Every time the human species comes across a monolith, it marks a step forward in its evolution. But the movie never explains where the monoliths come from, or what it truly does. Does it come from space? Or perhaps it's a sign from God! It never turns into a religion versus science discussion but instead leaves everything completely open to your own interpretation. This especially goes for its ending, which director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C. Clarke themselves didn't even had a real explanation for.It's actually really one of the oddest movies ever made, once you really start thinking about it. It's really not a movie with a clear, beginning, middle and end in it. Instead it could be divided into different acts, of which most of them are involving different characters. Yet everything still feels perfectly connected and in perfect harmony with each other because the movie always remains consistent with its pacing and style. The action moments are not shot and edited any faster than its mystery moments and its science-fiction elements are not any more or any less exciting than its more horror-like moments.Yes, I think ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" actually has a great horror vibe to it as well! This is all thanks to HAL 9000, who basically is one of the best horror characters of all time, even though the movie itself is of course far from a conventional horror movie. Thing that makes HAL 9000 so great and such a scary character is that he is nothing more but a red light-bulb, who is yet more and more starting to show strange human tendencies. He is so unpredictable and also incredibly powerful, since he can basically control the entire spaceship, which all makes him a quite scary and threatening character.Visually and also especially technically this is a great movie. Most of the effects in this movie were thought up and created specifically for this movie and even now days they are still great- and convincing looking. But I especially love the realistic approach of all of its science-fiction elements. It's a very detailed movie, that thought of about everything it seems. From how space-food would be like in the future, to space toilets and ways of how humans would communicated with each other and with computers.It's also really a movie that lets its images tell most of its story. The movie starts off without dialog and also the last part of the movie is completely without any dialog. Some people will be bothered by its slow pacing, while others will be fascinated by the way the movie is slowly being told and developed, without ever laying out things clearly for you. It's truly a thought provoking movie, that deserves your full attention, so just don't watch then when feeling tired or not in the mood.One of the many great and truly unique movies, from the brilliant but complicated Stanley Kubrick.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
ruzhyo2000-1,"Aug 20, 2006",10/10,"Like all works of art, great or not, however, there will be those who prefer not the qualities that make this movie great. Some say it's excruciatingly boring, and that there is just not enough plot. There are more elements to movies than explosive action and a typical, dialog-driven storyline.This movie takes some of the core elements that make movies great and expands and perfects them in a way no movie before it, to my knowledge, has never attempted or at least succeeded in doing. Because of this, it is somewhat abstract, which turns off many viewers, much in the way many people do not like abstract paintings. People want too much to know what is going on. They want the work's meaning to be force fed to them so that they don't have to go through the confusion of discovering what it means for themselves.It really is a love-it or hate-it kind of film, and is not for everyone. Personally, I love the movie, I can watch it over and over and love it more every time I do because of the beauty of every scene. The music, the camera angles, the pace, it's all perfect in my opinion, I would of not changed a thing. Kubrick portrays even the most simple of scenes with perfection, unmatched even by some of best movies these days.Never before have I seen such a powerful portrayal of space. He fills it life and death, beauty and fear, all at the same time. In any other movie, you will see space as nothing more than a place, yet Kubrich manages to make it seem as though it is living.For potential viewers, I will say this. If you are a fan of movies with action or straight forward plot and don't tend to mind if they lack heavily in terms of core cinematic elements then you probably won't like this movie very much, but if you believe in cinema as art, then you must watch this movie. You will not regret it."
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Feb 28, 2005",1/10,"I'm sorry, good music and cool special effects do not make a good movie! What the heck? I mean, I saw this movie when I was a kid, and I didn't like it.

hammer-1,"Oct 2, 2001",N/A,"2001 a space odyssey is the best film ever made.there is no other film like it and i suspect their never will be.this is a directors film with director as the star.the visual flair of the film as still to be matched despite all the technological innovations that have been invented since its making in 1968.there is very little dialogue in the film,just enough to structure the story the rest is left to polemic direction and perfectly choreographed sound and visuals,the use of music plays a very important roll in this film,with composers as diverse as Gyorgy Ligeti,Aram Khatchaturian,Johann Strauss and Richard Strauss when Ligeti's Atmospheres begins playing as Dave Bowman enters the stargate sequence is one of cinemas enduring images,which once seen is never forgotten,the whole film from start to finish is an extravaganza that assaults the senses.i have heard many people comment on how boring this film is,but after all you need a little imagination to appreciate the finer things in life and this is certainly one of them.a true classic.this is the sci-fi film all others use as a reference....in a nutshell the BEST."
marcin_kukuczka,"Nov 1, 2014",9/10,"A movie fan at one of the cinematic conferences once spoke up and said that the best idea in a film is not to give any ready made answers but leave everything open to viewers' interpretations. In this case, we are all a part of art that we watch, we admire, we criticize but, foremost, discover. This assumption proves particularly suitable for Stanley Kubrick's 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY inspired by a short story by Arthur C. Clarke.What strikes viewers most about the film are the questions that the theme provokes and answers that we are likely to find in ourselves. But...nothing ready on a platter! Not much is given to us except for thrilling experience of a journey, a titled odyssey. The central theme-ODYSSEY the location-SPACESHIPS/THE UNIVERSE. In that respect, it seems inevitable to quote Roger Ebert who rightly pointed out in his review that Kubrick's genius does not lie in ""how much"" but ""how little."" Almost everything is left to us, which makes it a very difficult screen achievement and, simultaneously reflective, such ""a philosophical statement about a man's place in the universe"" (Ebert).From the first sequence titled ""Dawn of Man,"" we see apes with an obvious aspect of imprisoning our vision within a certain framework. Nevertheless, soon, we discover that these apes begin to think. A sort of Cartesius' ""Cogito Ergo Sum"" or rather an inner existence that blends with the outer reality. Something driven by some supreme power? While we begin with dawn of man, we don't end with twilight of man. Here, rather, one could quote Steven D Greyfanus who observes that the movie makes a point about our existence and consciousness which are not self explanatory. Questions arise when a black monolith appears: a challenge for the apes...some mystery which will appear more times in the movie. Is it some limitation that emerges from it? Or rather some superior reality to discover only when man drowns in it?Steven D Greyfanus interestingly claims that ""2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't just depict a quantum leap forward in human consciousness — it practically requires such a leap, on an individual scale, from the viewer."" The movie is a challenge in itself, a challenge to rise above any ready made concepts of what a movie should be like, what it should look like, what it should evoke but encounter something new, even in the genre itself. To develop this point a bit, Greyfanus goes deeper comparing this odyssey to classical Odyssey by Homer...while in the mythology, the destination is clear, it is home, in the film, it is unknown. For can any man grasp the indefinite reality of the universe and its mystery? Roger Ebert memorably notes: ""the film is not about a goal but a quest.""The characters are the heroes of this quest. Mind you that many of them, in particular Dr Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) or Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) in the star sequence are the characters who rely solely on the intellect. In a truly unforgettable 'communication' with the on-board computer HAL 9000, there is, however, an intense desire for meaning, a quest for reasoning, search for answers. At the same time, there appears intense care not to allow any 'violation' of the mission's goals. But...at one point, man breaks a certain limit and goes too far. The realms of technology are going, the realms of human mind are going, what is left if the gravity of mind does no longer occur sufficient?The infinite that goes with Jupiter (not only the name of the planet but, for some reason deliberate or coincidental, the name of the Roman god).At that moment, we may all agree with Roger Ebert who says that it is a ""transcendent film"" and a ""silent film.""Primarily, 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY relies on visuals and music. There is not much dialog and if it appears, it is reduced to the maximum minimum, almost to a pseudo computerized interaction. There is not much 'humanity' in the language, not to say feelings. Even the 'Daisy' song or 'Happy birthday' that parents sing to their son seem to lack the basic enthusiasm and result in something artificial, robot-like. Visuals and music! The former is a unique achievement that helps us all experience the film in an unforgettable way. Seeing the movie on the big screen recently, I felt its intense effects to a grand scale. Kudos to cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. Music, however, is an even more inspiring aspect.What a terrific choice of CLASSICAL MUSIC! Not only is it an undertone of a unique human ability, but there is another greater undertone to that. Let me quote Roger Ebert again. He observes that any music score would go with conventionalized methods of evoking action and would underline the storyline. ""The classical music,"" however, ""exists outside the action."" It is an ever present companion of man on his journey to the unknown, on his way to hear deeper, more profoundly. The waltz by Johann Strauss THE BLUE DANUBE seems to evoke a dance in the universe, outside of any gravity and within a greater power. Meanwhile, ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" by Richard Strauss marks the crescendo of emotions within phases of discoveries.The absolutely unpredictable finale brings everything to an uncommon conclusion, after all. You feel as if you have just started to watch this film. Time is not important but far more thought provoking is the fact that this art does not resort to pessimism of nothingness but appears to celebrate, inside us and outside us, the infinite mystery of human life.Prepare for something hard, sometimes vague and very odd, but worth enduring till the end."
mahmus,"Mar 19, 2020",10/10,"A thought-provoking exploration of the mankind's place in the universe, but most surprisingly, an incredibly entertaining and endlessly rewatchable audio-visual experience, despite its slow pace.This movie keeps my eyes glued to the screen for its whole runtime. Through the long sequence of ships moving through space, through the seemingly endless stargate sequence, even when it's literally just a black screen, I'm hooked; hypnotized, entranced. Once it's starts, there's no going back.This movie came out in 1968 and it still holds up. The effects are some of the best of all time. The sound is terrifying. The visuals are stunning.This is easily one of the most beautiful films ever. Everything comes together so perfectly. Lighting, set design, costumes, special effects, music, colors, sound, editing; It's all cinematic perfection.This is the ultimate Sci-fi film.
One of the few movies that I would call Perfect."
leslieadams,"May 14, 2005",10/10,"It was an intriguing experience, seeing this film when it first played my home city on a road show engagement.I always regretted sitting in the balcony, rather on the main floor for this 70 mm.presentation. I could only imagine the effect audiences had viewing it in true Cinerama.Kubrick made a film like none other, with a total of 88 non-dialog minutes, and exit music (of Strauss' ""Blue Danube Waltz"") that continues a good five minutes after the last credit roll.Arthur C. Clarke's comment that if one fully understands everything in the film, he would consider his contribution a failure, reminded me of Director Vincent Minnelli's answer to a question about an effect in one of his films, ""Yolanda and the Thief."" A studio exec asked him what did the mysterious ""dream apparition"" that emerged from the lake mean. Minnelli responded that he had no idea.Kubrick's choosing of the year, 2001, as a title because it represented the ""beginning of the next century"" proved less than prophetic: 2000 was the year celebrated worldwide for that event (though Kubrick was factually correct).As for actor Kier Dullea, his trademark blank-stare style seemed to work most impressively in a very limited number of other films, mainly, ""David and Lisa"" and ""The Fox."" Still, he'll be forever remembered for ""A Space Odyssey.""Ultimately, the film has won the plaudits of a majority of the public and critics. Those who either ""don't get it,"" or ""find it too slow moving"" now seem to be in the minority, and the film has ultimately won a place among the ""film greats."""

p-jonsson,"Jan 27, 2019",6/10,"I got this movie recently when it came out on Ultra HD Blu-ray simply because it was missing in my collection and, being a Sci-Fi fan, missing 2001 in my collection simply would not do. It is a movie that was made to rely almost entirely on the visuals. It could be said that it is a visual symphony if that makes sense. Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing. Thanks to this it actually made some sense to transfer this movie to Ultra HD Blu-ray since the originals were really good enough even though the movie was made in 1968.I remember watching this movie as a kid and was profoundly disappointed. I thought come on, where's the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part. The parts where gravity, or rather the lack thereof, was portrayed, that was really high tech movie making at the time. I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001.However, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance. No matter how great the visuals are, there's only so much boredom I can stand before it starts to get to me.In the last 30 minutes or so the movie starts to become very psychedelic. The part where Bowman is pulled into the vortex, the stargate, is going on forever and in the end it just becomes a blur of headache inducing color effects. The final parts of the movie with the three Bowmans of different ages is just weird.So,as this is a non-professional and personal take on the movie I cannot really motivate more than 3 out of 5 stars.I hadn't actually planned to review this movie. Everything has really already been said about it but I could not refrain after having read this crap at Rotten Tomatoes:""Critics Consensus: One of the most influential of all sci-fi films - and one of the most controversial - Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity - and folly - of mankind.""It's pretty well known that Rotten Tomatoes is the absolutely worst movie rating site around and the so called ""critics"" are useless culture elite morons with an over-inflated opinion about themselves at best and politically motivated SJW asswipes at worst but still.What the hell is controversial about it? Reality check, there's really nothing controversial about it at all. It is just a fictional story in the future. Then we have that crap ""the folly"". What bloody folly? If anything the movie shows a much better future than what we got. A future where the politicians apparently promoted advancement of science and space exploration which is the direct opposite to the money and oxygen wasters we have today.Sure, if you indulge too much in smoking funny mushrooms or are politically motivated you can probably ""interpret"" the hell out of any movie and ""find"" whatever message you want but it is still BS.Well, that was my (controversial?) take on 2001."
ms1720,"May 6, 2003",6/10,"I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and have to say I'm disappointed.  maybe for the time it was a visual breakthrough for film, and maybe it covered uncharted territory, but it's not that good.  this should have been a 45 minute movie, but Kubrick (who is overated on most of his movies) turned this into a load of crap.  like others, I found myself fast forwarding through most of the movie.  I really now can appreciate what Mel Brooks accomplished in Spaceballs.There are some positives...like when we see HAL reading the lips of dave and peter, that was pretty freaky.  the ending sequences are shot beautifully, and for sci-fi I can see how it influenced other films.But it is SO BORING TO WATCH.  if Kubrick had started the movie with a quick scene of the apes and monolith and then gone directly to the scene with the board meeting it would have made this a much better film.  it was grossly long and is not a great film overall.  there are great aspects, but not as a whole.  that is a fallacy of composition.  just because some parts are great, it doesn't make the whole thing great."
Andrew-166,"Oct 8, 1999",1/10,"I had high expectations of this film - having been told that it was a cinematic masterpiece, etc.Several hours later, I feel cheated - I feel I have wasted part of my life - time that could have been more productively spent sleeping, for example.This film has some of the worst acting ever to appear on screen, and is so slow moving as to be coma inducing.  I fail to see how anyone can be impressed with this - by leaving out any semblance of plot or progress, Kubrick has left the way open for a whole bunch of people to insert their own interpretations...I presume these are the same sort of people who can stare at a blank canvas and gush effusively about how it symbolizes the bleak emptiness of existence in the 20th century and other pretentious claptrap.  Personally, I expect a bit more effort on the part of the person making the film.  If I want to reflect on deep philosophical questions, I don't need a lumbering dinosaur of a film to act as a catalyst.I give it a 1, and recommend giving it a wide berth.  Maybe it's possible to get an abridged version which would condense it down to include only the significant elements - that would be a tolerable 5 minutes or so, but in it's long form, forget it."
Vogler,"Mar 20, 2003",N/A,"2001 is the proof that there is extraterrestrial intelligence. Because human brains are far too small to understand that movie.

What the hell is the point about that black stone? I've never been on LSD, maybe that would help to understand it."
dead47548,"Jan 8, 2008",10/10,"The word ""masterpiece"" doesn't even begin to describe the stunning brilliance of this film. It is more deep, profound and complex than any other work I've ever seen. I am still completely baffled by elements of it. I have my own interpretations, as everyone does, and I can see the connections between everything but I'm sure it is far more complex than my rather simplistic interpretation. Just everything about it (the ""Dawn of Man"", HAL, beyond the infinite, the monolith, the Star Child) is absolutely mind blowing. I still can't seem to grasp my head around the perfection that I just experienced. Technically speaking, it's a marvel. The cinematography and visual effects are sensational, and it is rare to find ones superior. I wasn't bored for a second. There are a few instances where the story seems to drag a little bit, but it's necessary to further the story and explain everything that is occurring. Without these little drags, the story would be just full of holes and situations that are left unexplained. However, Kubrick recognizes this slight dullness and uses remarkable visuals, cinematography and a booming score to keep the viewer thoroughly engaged no matter what the situation. It's been over an hour and a half since I finished the film and I am still stunned, basking in it's supreme magnificence. Certainly one of the finest achievements of all time, and easily the best Kubrick I've seen so far. Exceeded any expectation I had."
sanjulathish,"Jun 22, 2017",9/10,"To create a movie of this level in 1968, he deserves special recognition. It is an great accomplishment. Arthur c Clark also deserves the credit. I have only seen 3 Kubrick movie but this one is the best for me. yes it took me more than a couple of stop-reverse- play scenes to understand the theme (as it did for interstellar, mulholland dr etc). Thought Nolan was a sci fi hero but this just changed my opinion slightly. This is the kind of movie that u should see and experience rather than read a review and skip it. i did it for couple of years until i finally saw it today. worth every minute spent on it. The BGM creates the kind of tension filled environment around you, like you are there in space. The Graphics in this was near perfect for that age, watching in 2017 didn't even cause any problems for me. If you are onto the sci-fi movies this is a must watch, no wonder Nolan was inspired by this."
gab-14712,"Oct 11, 2017",10/10,"When it comes to discussing influential movies of all time, I'd call you crazy if you did not mention 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film influenced science fiction of the future, so without this film there would be no Star Wars. This film influenced the style of future directors like Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott, whom are fantastic filmmakers. Not only is the film influential, it's also a great movie in general. When it was first released in 1968, it was met with mixed reviews. People saw a vision that has not been seen before, and they had no idea what to think of it. I read reports of walkouts at the premiere that occurred and those who remained complained of boredom. The film is deliberately slow-paced, but my interest was held over the duration of the film. I loved the film very much, but there are so many complicated ideas. Your brain is meant to be put to use because of all these abstract ideas. I've seen the film three times already, and I'm still not sure if I fully grasped all the concepts of the film. But the bottom line is 2001 is more concerned about inspiring our awe, not thrills.One of the big reasons why we are supposed to feel a sense of awe is the music itself. You know, originally the film had an original composition by Alex North. Director Stanley Kubrick had a back up soundtrack he used to help him with the editing process. The problem is (in North's case) the music just worked too damn well with the film to not use it. He used various classical compositions such as The Blue Danube and Also sprach Zarathustra composed by Richard Strauss. The music played a huge role in the film. I feel as if it was used as the main dialogue. There is some dialogue of course, but the music tells the story and pulls the emotional strings. Kubrick's film has no dialogue the first and final twenty minutes of the film. It is all music, and the placement is right on the money.It's hard to describe what this film is actually about. There is no single plot line. Instead, the film and its themes are about the evolution of mankind. There are four main segments to the film. The first part takes place in prehistoric times. A group of apes discovered this shiny black monolith which of course is made by intelligent beings of some kind. Somehow, the monolith convinced the apes were able to discover that bones could be used as weapons. The next section takes place a few millennia later, and this is where we have the famous docking scene played to the tune of The Blue Danube. We are given a sense of realism of the docking because of the deliberately slow pace. After the docking scene, we discover a second monolith which delivers us to the next segment involving the spaceship Discovery and its intelligent mind, HAL. The ship is on a mission of some kind, although we don't glimpse many details. The final segment is the famous Stargate sequence featuring astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) as he travels through some wormhole to some unexplained space.This is one of those rare films where acting does not matter. There are not many actors present after all. Sure, I guess you could call Dullea's performance good, but he doesn't seem to matter in the film. The computer system, HAL probably shows the most emotion of anyone in the film. His voice even sounds panicked when he realizes he is about to be unplugged for good. This is one of the early films to use the theme of man versus machine. HAL believes he has good intentions, but at the sake of the astronaut's lives. He has been holding back information and later on in the minds of the astronauts, he is believed to be the bad guy.Ah, now lets talk about the spectacle of the film. The visuals are amazing, even today after all these years. We are now in the digital age, where CGI looks consistently impressive (or in some cases, not at all). But the special effects, designed with the help of Douglas Trumbull, look very convincing because the film gives off an aura of being a documentary, and the effects follows suit. They just look very real for the setting they are in. The spaceship itself looks real and I loved the docking sequence. Towards the end, where we witness the vast amount of colors and the Star Child, I was basked in a glow of delight watching the effects come to life.What I like about all of Kubricks film is that they ask us deep questions. For example, this film concerns mankind and evolution. The film asks us who we are and what is life about. Kubrick never gave in to tell us what the film is about. He opened the film up for interpretation and every idea is a plausible idea, according to Kubrick. We are just not skin and bones, but we are intelligence. We live not on planet Earth, but amongst the stars. These are just some of the ideas Kubrick was trying to convey. There are many themes to get out of the movie, being such an abstract film.This is Kubrick's most ambitious and most likely his greatest film he has ever made. I loved his previous film, Dr. Strangelove but he reaches news heights with this film. This is not a narrative story in the common sense so if you've never seen this film, just heed my warning. I love how the movie opens up for debate/interpretation and to this day, people debate about the themes and just how influential the movie is. Featuring amazing visuals and musical cues, 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest, most influential movies of all time.My Grade: A+"
elijahbutler-40119,"Nov 26, 2018",10/10,"2001: A Space Odyssey is among one of the GREATEST sci-fi movies of all time and has remained a masterpiece for many decades and for so many reasons! This film has so many mind-blowing visuals, fantastic classical music, phenomenally hidden themes, masterful direction and great storytelling. Directors like Stanley Kubrick have a special place in the history of filmmaking. Kubrick is one of the VERY few directors that delivers an extremely unique presence to ALL of his films with his direction and he also knows what his audience wants out of filmmaking and I absolutely LOVE that! Even if you watch 2001 by 1st viewing and even if you don't fully understand the film, it's SOO unforgettable to step away from and it's due to unforgettable direction, plot, music and breathtakingly GORGEOUS visuals and of course the Apollo moon landing! 2001 also captures an amazing and stunning feel of mankind interfering with something that's unknown and very fascinating and we've had so many films that have portrayed 2001: A Space Odyssey and NONE of them have been able to top this film. One thing that's very interesting about Stanley Kubrick is that he will show you AMAZING and FASCINATING images in all of his films and they absolutely keep you in on edge and focused and that's because all of Kubrick's films have a feel of ""realism"" and 2001: A Space Odyssey is a perfect execution! The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket and Dr. Strangelove along with all of Kubrick's other films have MANY things that make you follow along with their stories and messages and visuals and elements and that's what makes Stanley Kubrick a Master in cinema history! As a person who LOVES cinema and is a nerd when it comes to film, I'm gonna be completely honest when I say that ""In my mind, 2001: A Space Odyssey is the BEST directed movie I've ever seen!"" 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that has stood the test of time HIGHLY successfully with many mind-blowing and unforgettable elements that makes this film a TRUE masterpiece! 2001: A Space Odyssey gets a 10/10!"
John Matrix,"Dec 4, 1998",10/10,"Many people talk about how many times they've seen a particular movie as evidence of it's greatness.I've seen 2001 twice.I hired it out from the video store when I was about 13 (about 6 short years ago), and it blew my mind. Sure, it was technically sophisticated, but how was it that such a great reputation was bestowed on a film that was honestly just so weird-ass and boring???No dialogue for half an hour!F***ing apes running around hitting each other, and throwing sticks in the air!A mildly interesting segment with a mean-ass pod thing that tries to eat a spaceman, and a rad bit where one jumps into outer space, closes the door and all the sound turns on was the highlight of the movie.Then more bullshit!Weird noises and whines!Ten or twenty (felt like a hundred) minutes of flashing lights! Wakes up in an old room with an old man with a glass of wine! THEN A GIANT FLOATING PLANET BABY!!!WHAT WAS THIS BULLSHIT????This film LOOKED good, but made no sense whatsoever! And when a film made no sense when I was 13, I got bored! And when a film gets boring, that usually means it's ROOTED!!!My sister watched the film at about the same time, and I distinctly remember walking in during the movie's final moments and finding her sitting upside down on her head in her chair, apparently in an attempt to prevent her natural reflexes from clicking the 'eject' button.However, I read a bit about the film (""What's this 'rebirth of man crap', and how was I supposed to think of that?"" I was thinking!) and optimistically kept a copy of the film in case it might have later value for me when I was older and wiser.As it turned out, I never watched that tape again. The years came and went, and I saw many more movies (insert nostalgic montage sequence here), read many more reviews, and the movie even came out in a new 70mm print at a few cinemas a couple of years ago. I can't remember the occasion, but the flyer (I have it blue-tacked to the roof above my bed, I collect that sort of crap) reads ""Happy Birthday Hal."", but I still couldn't bring myself to sit through it again. And eventually, I realised that I needed to see it again, simply hoping to 'get it', suspecting that if I did, I might even like it.Then a 30th anniversary video edition came out in Widescreen, which I subsequently purchased and so it came to be that I viewed '2001: A Space Odyssey' the second time.And it blew my mind again.Every thing that I'd ever read about the film was right there before me, clear as day! Everything that I loved about Kubrick (by this stage I'd seen and loved Clockwork Orange, Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon, and to a lesser extent The Shing and Lolita) was there, mechanical characters and direction expressing extraordinary themes. It was like Kubrick concentrate! I loved every single frame of the movie, it was like he'd taken every shots and scenes that grabbed me in ways I never realised why, from every movie I'd ever seen, and thrown them together in an editing suite into 2 and a bit hours worth that just happened to privilege the most important, mind-boggling, revolutionary, ambitious and all-encompassing themes ever existent.I'd crap on about what it means, but I don't really know. I could think about it for ages, but I'd just end up at the same place again. If you want to know what it means, try reading someone else's comments here! But I don't think anybody, including Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke know totally what it means, I don't think that is possible with any movie. It reads specifically to each person who sees it, like every film or text does. And I think I should shut up soon, but not before I make a couple of points.This is probably a rash statement, and I've been searching for holes in it and haven't found any yet. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is the only true Science Fiction movie. If you take the Sci Fi from ""Star Wars"" (I film I admittedly love more, it is PERHAPS my all time favorite), you're left with what? An adventure movie, part western, part Japanese samurai film. If you take the Science Fiction out of ""2001"", you're left with nothing. ""2001"" IS science fiction.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is by critical consensus one of the best movies ever made (I'm sure you didn't know that), and one of the top five I have ever seen. I have placed the 'Keeping 2001 tape' incident as one of the wisest things I have ever done in my life, even if I ended up taping ""Hamburger Hill"" over it.Thanks for reading!I have now just realized that the time I spent writing this overlong review could have been better spent watching the movie again. Stupid internet..."
Mr-Fusion,"May 12, 2016",10/10,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is one of the most fascinating movies I've ever seen. Even when I first watched this, walking in with no familiarity, I was bewildered, but still couldn't look away. It asks huge questions and let's the viewer come up with their own answer (that's a gamble; rarely does it come off just right). Different interpretations of the film's meaning abound. Unconventional is a great way to describe this.But when all is said and done, it's an adventure, as grand as they come; space travel, artificial intelligence, evolution, the unknown It's one of my favorite movies, and I'm always pleased to see it being screened at revival houses. And if you happen on one showing this in 70mm, pounce on it; the argument can be made that ""2001"" relies less on plot and more on sight and sound, which means people aren't kidding when they say this is an experience.10/10"
steenwykjames,"Sep 11, 2021",6/10,"This is a movie that I heard so many good things about, I just had to watch it for myself. Was it a great masterpiece? Was it just an overrated piece of crap? Well the answer is yes and yes.First the pros:
1. The score is fantastic
2. The movie is beautifully shot
3. There is a lot of symbolism in this movie
4. I think all the characters do exactly what is required of them without ever being annoying.Now the cons:
1. Most of the scenes drag on way to long
2. I didn't really like the style of this movie it unfortunately makes me want to avoid other Stanley Kubrick movies
3. Finally the movie couldn't get me to care, if I don't care how the movie ends, something is wrongWhile I understand how some people can love this movie, I also understand how someone can hate it. I'm glad that I watched it and would suggest you watch it(if you haven't) so you can make your own choice."
mjneu59,"Jan 11, 2011",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's landmark sci-fi epic blew a lot of minds back in 1969, and at the dawn of the 21st century the film lends an even more compelling perspective to our place in the cosmos. Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke ask more questions than they answer, which is only appropriate, since their scenario follows nothing less than he entire evolution of human consciousness, moving in daring narrative leaps across time and space from the genesis of primitive intelligence (notably, an act of violence) to Mankind's first, enigmatic encounter with infinity.And yet rarely has a film drawn on such a monumental canvas communicated so much by saying so little. Kubrick embraces a truly cosmic vision of exploration and discovery, but the ideas are expressed with an equally cosmic reticence perfectly suited to the arid emptiness of outer space (the human astronauts show even less emotion than their renegade HAL 9000 computer). Ironically, it's the void itself that leaves the deepest impression, and the film is able to capture its intimidating silence and sense of disorientation using a spare economy of images and sounds: a spacecraft racing silently over the barren, blue lunar surface; the mammoth Discovery probe en route to Jupiter, floating through the loneliest reaches of the solar system; and above all else, there's always that compelling, opaque black monolith, hovering in perfect symmetry between the sun and the stars."
Lord_Borrington,"Sep 24, 2014",6/10,"Having read the book I understand what the end is about. However if you only saw the movie and didn't read the book I'd have to say it would be very difficult to understand the ending which really makes very little sense in the movie. Good special effects for 1968 and many memorable lines like ""Open the pod bay doors Hal."" ""I'm sorry Dave I can't do that."" Some find the movie slow and tedious even boring and it can be in parts but my main gripe is the silly ending which if you only see the movie I don't know how you're supposed to understand it if you haven't read the book where it is actually explained what is going on. I think a lot of people who rave about the movie yet haven't read the book don't know what the end means at all. And in fact the ending of the movie is a bit silly and does a very poor job of trying to explain what is in the book by A.C. Clarke."
forrestanfo,"May 21, 2011",1/10,"This movie, I have seen it at the theaters when it came out, and many times after. I strongly feel that critics, are falling into a ""The Emporor's New Clothes"" syndrome. Some great critic said it was good, and many others followed. To have the courage to tell the truth, and say it was slow, and boring would make them seem non intellectual. The fact is it is very slow, and boring. The fact that some have called it the BEST movie ever made, is not realistic. Anyone, who has, or can sit through this in it's full length (I have many times) is trying to see what the critics find so wonderful about it. it is not. Criminals should be able to redeem a year of their sentence for each viewing of this film. ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", look like ""Gone With the Wind""."
cinephile-27690,"Jan 3, 2019",10/10,"I saw this for the 1st time when I was 11. I liked it, but I did not fully ""love it."" Had I written this then, I would gave give this an 8. It's slow pace and little dialogue had appeal, but not enough for me to love it.I am 20 years old now, and after seeing reviews and researching it, I decided to see it again. (Look up Chris Stuckmann's review on You Tube for an example.)At a used DVD store, I got it on New Year's Eve, and than I saw it the next day. I now have a new proposal for this movie: This is the greatest film experience ever produced!The movie does not really have a ""plot"" per se, but it's rather a compilation of sequences of special effects that thread into a story about humanity, and how technology affects it over time.This creates many impressive scenes, one in which a monkey discovers how to use a bone as a tool, but then uses it as a weapon-first against other bones, and then an armadillo. Another with laser lights near the end, as well as the star child in the film's finale.I referenced Chris Stuckmann's review. In it, he mentions that the movie hypnotizes the viewer. This is absolutely true! Many scenes, like laser lights segment, put me in awe and filled me with wonder.There is very little dialogue, like I said. However, more is said with the images than whatever could be said with words. We see man evolve(I disagree with evolution but it fits with the narrative), advance in technology, the technology overcome man, and man overpower it, among many other elements.My Grandma saw a couple minutes of the movie with me, exactly 2 hours in. There was no dialogue, but a rainbow of colors flashed on the screen. She walked away to go in her room and said ""I think you wasted your money."" She said that about the American Film Institute's pick for the 22nd best movie ever made!Keep in mind that 2001 is not a movie you watch, but rather experience-and what an experience it its!Forget about 10 out of 10 stars, I give this an unlimited amount of stars. This is a wonder to behold. That's just a handful of the praise that this masterwork deserves! This is now my 2nd favorite movie, after Silence(2016)!"
evanston_dad,"Sep 30, 2005",8/10,"I used to think ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was a Great Movie, but now I'm not so sure. Now that I've seen it a few times, I feel like I've gotten all there is to be gotten from it, and the thought of sitting down to watch it again triggers my brain to begin thinking of all the other things I could be doing with my time. Is that the sign of a great movie? Shouldn't we be able to revisit great movies again and again and find something fresh about them years after they initially hit the screens? I don't know.Anyway, ""2001"" is at least a terrific movie and an important one. No science fiction film made since can deny the influence of this movie's vision of space. Many of the special effects look more realistic than the computer generated effects of today. And while I defy anyone to truly explain the meaning of this film with confidence (I wonder if even Kubrick could have), it certainly makes you feel *something,* even if you're not sure what that something is.On the first viewing, the pacing of the film seemed stately and fitting for a film about drifting through the cold depths of space; now it just seems ponderous. It's even more pronounced now how little the human actors register in this film, and how HAL (which is just a voice, really) steals the show. And when I was younger and more eager to accept the opinions of film scholars and other purported know-it-alls, I thought the ending was profound and full of meaning; now it seems pretty obtuse and vague.But when it comes right down to it, Kubrick's worst movie is anyone else's masterpiece. His movies never feel comfortable with human emotions, so the fact that this movie could almost exist without humans at all comes as little surprise. His style has always been slow, but it comes as a welcome change from all the frenetic, hyper crap being produced now. And at least this movie makes you think, even if it doesn't provide any answers, which again is more than I can say for most of the movies playing in theatres this weekend.So I may not rate ""2001"" as highly as I once would have, but I fully support its place as one of the most audacious and significant films of all time.Grade: A"
A_FORTY_SEVEN,"Jan 12, 2019",10/10,My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠The opening of this film is legendary and so is the ending. The movie can be interpreted as an artist's hallucinatory portrait of man's existence through time.One of the greatest work of cinema history.Multiple viewings.
Kashmirgrey,"Aug 21, 2007",6/10,"My father's favorite film is 2001. I was familiar with 2001 before most kids were probably potty trained. My dad had the album and other than Apocalypse Now, 2001 was the only film my father dared sit through.Well, I was adopted, and that is made plainly evident by the fact the I think 2001: A Space Odyssey is quite possibly the most boring science fiction film I have ever endured.Sure, the special effects and sets were revolutionary in the sci-fi genre. Sure the musical score was brilliant. Sure, the symbolism was profound at times. But the film moved along like a slug on ice! For me, the film began when HAL short circuited and ended with his demise. ""Daisy, daisy..."" and ""Dave, Dave..."" are classic. Some Kubrick I love and some Kubrick I don't fancy much. This film falls on the latter end of the scale. Sorry Dad."
moonspinner55,"Aug 27, 2005",6/10,"US spacecraft bound for Jupiter is controlled by ""foolproof"" computer. Audiences in 1968--mostly the college students who were becoming the country's foremost film enthusiasts--were determined to believe that Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" was a deep thinker (they came to this conclusion because it baffled and confused them--therefore it must be deep). The assemblage and presentation is remarkable, no doubt about it, but how deep the film actually goes is up for debate. Kubrick clearly has filmmaking prowess to spare, and his picture is a stunning achievement on a visual level (one can hardly comprehend how he managed to get this work on the screen without interference--and, if there was behind-the-scenes trouble, that achievement becomes even more heroic). Still, this voyage involving two astronauts battling a brilliant and power-mad computer of their own making is an abstract, psychedelic head trip, either intellectually stimulating or somnolent depending upon one's perceptions and patience. I found much of it, particularly the final act, cold and alienating. I also wasn't overly impressed with the elongated prehistoric prologue, even if the now-celebrated edit from flying bone/weapon to space station in the stars has become the stuff of legend (for the deep thinkers, this clunky-abrupt cut is Exhibit A). You cannot doubt Kubrick's mastery of the cinema (he also produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Arthur C. Clarke, from Clarke's uncredited story ""The Sentinel""), and yet the movie has no personality apart from HAL's dejected-spiteful-pitying voice. The terrific cinematography is by Geoffrey Unsworth, with assist from John Alcott. The voice of HAL is Douglas Rain (and it deserves legendary status). The actors--Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood--seem cast for their dullness (intentionally I presume), yet one does eventually tire of them. Kubrick also triumphed when he used classical music to punch up the visuals, putting a pop-art stamp on these legendary pieces. Four Oscar nominations with one win: Best Special Visual Effects (awarded to Kubrick). Five BAFTA nominations with three wins: Best Sound Track, Best Art Direction, and Best Cinematography (awarded to Unsworth). A follow-up, ""2010"", from Clarke's novel--but without Kubrick's participation--arrived in 1984. **1/2 from ****"
bob the moo,"Jan 3, 2005",N/A,"A group of apes feed together as a tribe, fending off other apes. The discovery of a tall black monolith, the use of a weapon and the sending of a signal see us jump into the future where a mission is being sent to the moon. The mission is in response to the discovery of an unnatural monolith that had been deliberately buried under the surface. When the monolith emits a high pitch signal we jump 18 months forward to a mission on its way to Jupiter. Drs Bowman and Poole lead, with the rest of the crew in hibernation and the ship under the control of a HAL-9000 series computer. Things are strange enough with the mysterious nature of the mission but an apparent error in HAL creates more immediate worries.If you will humour me for a moment I will state my interpretation of the plot before looking at the film. To me the set up is about evolution of man, here being either guided or monitored by an alien race for reasons we can only wonder about. Obviously the monoliths mark times where we have advanced to a point where we can go to the next step, with Bowman's eventual journey just being the next step in man's evolution. Now what HAL's malfunction has to do with this is beyond me, in fact I'd say that it is actually unrelated but is just a separate part of the same story. However this is not a problem because both parts of the story are full of interesting ideas and strands that more than fill what is, lets be honest, a rather slow and unnecessarily long film. The pace may infuriate modern, younger viewers who have come to this as ""one of the greatest sci-fi's ever made"" expecting it to be an Aliens or a Star Wars  it isn't, it is cold, remote, slow and built on ideas more than action.The film does have several sections that could have been significantly trimmed or lost altogether and it is hard to see why some of them were there other than to fill out the running time (the bit about the rumour of ""infection"" on the moon could have been lost as we are told this much briefer in the meeting in the next scene; and the apes could have been shorter) and this is always a problem to me while those scenes are on. However, as an overall film it isn't a problem because the time does move surprisingly quickly considering how little happens at times  and it does this because it is relentlessly interesting. The evolution thread is never fully answered and, for that reason, is interesting throughout even if some viewers will baulk at the idea of being left to make their own conclusions and not having it all neatly explained for them. This makes up the beginning and end of the film, but the middle 80 minutes have little to do with it and instead are more about a view of the dangers inherent in a cold future where computers are given too much trust, credit and responsibility. Looking back, this view has only become more and more relevant and is now such a part of sci-fi that it is so easy to forget how influential this film has been. It is never fully explained why HAL goes (to quote the President in Strangelove) ""a little funny"" but it works the better for us not knowing  it feeds our mistrust of him as a computer because it could have been deliberate, accidental, pre-programmed or just his application of pure, cold logic to an situation that, because it involves humans, can never be seen in those terms. I won't ramble on, but it provides so much food for thought that it more than makes up for the very cold, stretched plot and running time.Although it is easy to pick holes in it from our CGI-enhanced world, the film still looks great and, more than that is actually imaginative  something that CGI sometimes fails to be. Again there are probably too many long scenes of craft moving silently through space but generally they are interesting. The first cut form bone to ship to the Blue Danube is iconic and will be known even to those who have never seen the film; meanwhile the silence of space is well used. The Stargate scene is well known as a ""trippy"" scene but even straight it works and (despite being overlong and slightly dated) is imaginative and interesting. The cold mood continues with the direction as Kubrick uses a lot of very static shots to tell his story  without the style and interest brought out by the movement it is WHAT he looks at rather than how and he manages to frame all manner of interesting shots within the ideas in the script. Performances are very much secondary in this cold film but Dullea is suitably restrained even if part of me wanted him to be more human in the face of HAL. Douglas Rain only provides a voice but comes out as the single most memorable ""actor"" in the film as he plays HAL with cold, logical and unmeaning menace. Outside of these two nobody else really shines as they are never the focus, although it always amuses me to see Rossiter in there! Overall this is deservedly regarded as a classic and ""must see"" film. It is not a perfect film as it is overlong, is not edited as tightly as it could have been and does sometimes focus on visuals while leaving us to work out the substance ourselves, but these are minor complaints as the film is filled with imagination both visually and idea-wise. Its status and reputation mean it is a ""must see"" for cinema fans, it is just as well then, that it is a brilliant and intelligent ""must see"" to boot."
ehankins2147,"Mar 9, 2015",10/10,"Let me start off by saying that 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of my favorite movies of all- time. It is directed, co-written, and produced by one of my favorite directors of all-time, Stanley Kubrick, who has directed other masterpieces like Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket.2001: A Space Odyssey, along with a lot of other Kubrick films, is not for everyone. It is slow paced for the most part, has very little dialogue, and has a long runtime. This movie is not for the average movie-goer.If you do decide to watch this movie, you will be treated to: fantastic visual effects, impeccable cinematography, and an interesting story.One things for sure, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a complex film. The film is frequently interpreted differently amongst people. This is especially true with the oh so famous and confusing last 30 minutes of the movie.Whether you end up liking the film or disliking it, you will not forget 2001: A Space Odyssey."
sebland2,"Jun 24, 2002",10/10,"""2001:a space odyssey"" is one of the greatest works of art ever conceived. (Endless) possibilities, meaning, purpose, reason, sentience, the how & why of existence.... these are the notions at the core of this film. A movie unlike any other, it both challenges and compels the viewer to ponder all these concepts anew, questioning one's previous assumptions, while simultaneously leaving one with a wonderous sense of hope. All conveyed with a visual and auditory majesty beautiful beyond words. An absolute masterpiece to be experienced and reveled in again, and again, and again."
FilmLiquet,"Nov 7, 2018",9/10,"Starting with the Dawn of time, the history of mankind is portrayed as it evolves, encountering a mysterious black monolith in both, the pre-evolution humanity stages and the futuristic world of 2001. A timeless classic, the Space Odyssey is argued to be one of Kubrick's finest works, as it features one of the most well-known Match cuts in the history of cinema and was determined to be the ""ultimate science fiction movie"", as Kubrick said.Even after 50 years from the release, people are still talking about it and asking the same questions that still haven't been answered.In addition to an interesting plot, the movie was known to adapt groundbreaking camera techniques that would later inspire new filmmakers all around the world, seeing as Kubrick intended to break the set norms.Even though we speak of it as the timeless cinema classic, the Space Odyssey for many is quite hard to watch. It features long scenes devoid of action, to which the modern audience is not used. We have adapted the idea that films must always show us things and tell us what is going on, thus breaking the basic rule of filmmaking - show, don't tell. In doing so, the modern audiences have been desensitised and are not used to the film making us think. The Space Odyssey is still a brilliant film. First following a mysterious astronaut mission in deep space, it then comes to a tense showdown, paralleling Homer's Odyssey and even after the conflict is resolved the film takes the audience further than anticipated, giving each member of the audience to interpret the film differently."
Mediatation,"Jan 26, 2025",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's space epic harmoniously combines futuristic sights with classical sounds in a way that is the epitome of the film medium. Despite being made before man set foot on the moon, it manages to capture space with an insane amount of accuracy and is centered around issues that still feel impending today.The film that set and remains the pinnacle of science fiction films, continues to inspire the creation of modern sci-fi masterpieces. It's abstract nature and dedication to mesmerizing scenes makes viewers' interaction with it closer to a modern artwork than most films, as each revision of it will likely result in a new interpretation or realization for the viewer, as the best art does."
cardsrock,"Aug 28, 2018",10/10,"I had the opportunity to see this film in IMAX for its 50th Anniversary and boy am I glad I did. The special effects hold up tremendously well and it's so easy to be absorbed into the brilliant imagery on screen. The master Stanley Kubrick makes every single frame of this film into a beautiful piece of art. HAL-9000 is chilling as one of the best villains in cinematic history. While this movie doesn't give you all the answers one is accustomed to receiving in films, this is part of what makes this film so memorable and impactful. All of science fiction owes a debt to this innovative, remarkable film. 2001: A Space Odyssey truly is one of the best science fiction films ever and one of the greatest films of all time."

daryahorenko,"May 18, 2018",10/10,"This is hands down one of the most special movies I've ever seen. Despite the fact that the story is pretty good, what really makes it so outstanding comes to live in the cinematography, which is so good, there's so many beautiful shots, even in the beginning where there's no CGI. This movie looks top-notch amazing! Yhe sets are perfect, and I know it's sets, but it all looks like they're in real space ships, like they're actually in space, like they're in an actual savannah. Despite being released in 1968, this movie looks almost perfect and it's tied with another 1968 movie for the oldest movie I've ever seen, but despite all that, it looks gorgeous! The score is really great as well, the main theme is memorable andit seemed familiar and it tells us we're in for something extraordinary. I also like that they used classical music in the first half of the movie, it's so calming and the music in the second half of the movie, which I should call noises, make for a mystical vibe. The use of silence in later shots in outer space make those scenes even more gorgoes.I have some flaws with this movie though. At first I thought that the antagonist is Hal, the dictator-like arrogant computer, but then I realized it's the off-screen aliens. I don't really like the face that we have off-screen antagonists. Also, I thought that the intermission was entirely pointless. And a minor flaw is that I would've liked to spend some more time with the chimpanzees in the opening sequence.I'm a 100% certain that George Lucas and Irvin Kershner were heavily inspired by this movie. There's so many things in this movie that resemble ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"", especially visual elements, such as the outside of the ships, and I saw two or three similar shots in ""Alien"", too. Also, there's a shot on the lunar surface that resembles the shot in ""Revenge of the Sith"" right before we see Yoda medidating being interrupted by Bail Organa.If someone else made this movie it would be like an hour long without all the elongated shots, but it would lose so much, it would hardly be special anymore.I'll go watch the sequel immediately, I have sooo many questions, this movie leaves you thinking! I highly recommend it!"
redkiwi,"Sep 28, 2001",6/10,"Not having seen this film until 2001; I'm compelled to enquire as to what is the big deal?  We all know Stanley Kubrick was a weird man in many ways, but this film is just decidedly average.Other than some of the visual effects which are spectacular, and the fact that it was OK in parts aboard the spaceship, the rest of it was rather boring and nothing special.The video is true to the film ... down to the point of the 10 minute blacked out section in the middle with music playing and a title in the screen saying ""Intermission""!That's taking realism a little far."
anziano32,"Aug 21, 2024",2/10,"Anyone rating this pile of cinematic manure higher than a 2 is just a pretentious wannabe art film critic. Those giving it a 10 and calling it the greatest film of all time?... Those poor folks have their heads so far up their own rear ends that they don't know which way is up.This movie has stunning visuals - hence the 2.Everything else is either long periods of silence; long periods of grating, shrill alarms and labored breathing; boring dialogue; and/or nonsensical ""symbolic"" space babies.This is not a film. It's an acid trip, and anyone weird enough to enjoy it must be under the influence.Y'all are ridiculous."
plissken99,"Nov 29, 2001",N/A,"Give me a break. Why is this film considered a classic? I mean there is a completley unidentifiable plot, a ton of visuals that are ultimatley meaningless and music that was misplaced to begin with(Such an epic theme for a slow motion shot of an ape bashing the bones of a dead animal?).This is a classic example of films which are artsy, no one understands them or can make sense of them...so it must be good, right? Where does that logic come from, I wonder? I rented it 3 times, the first 2 I never got through the first 30 minutes. The 3rd time I made myself sit through it. I had to throw my shirt in the wash because of the drool stains! I mean it touches on some plot points(Alien life, the mystery of evolution...least it seems that was the idea) and them just trails off...REPEATEDLY.I cannot comment of Kubrick, I have seen several of his other films, non of which I enjoyed with the exception of ""The Shining"", which was still boring to an extent.I keep reading reviews that start out like ""Greatest movie ever made"", ""A masterpiece of cinema"". OK, I have no idea how one can come to this conclusion. But please explain what this film is about...You can't! Can you?! Any good film needs a plot, this movie is horribly lacking.I know I will get blasted for this, but if you want a movie which brings up simular type views and uses a simular style in film making, see ""Mission to Mars"". It is much more enlightening and features great actors like Gary Senise and Tim Robbins.I can't argue with the fans(sheep) of this film, because I don't know what they see in it or why. I consider myself a smart person, I like long epic style films that don't have to move at the pace of ""The Matrix"" to be good. I don't even ask for a satisfactory ending, I just want to know that some thought was put into a film."
dvehampton,"Dec 12, 2020",10/10,"How do I write a review of this film without sounding pompous, arrogant or a band wagoneer hopping fan boy? I am now 41 years old in 2020 so this movie came out 12 years before I was born. Starting from approximately 18-19 I was aware of the movie and it's reputation. From the little info I'd absorbed over the years I'd pegged it as a sci-fi artsy film that movie snobs liked to analyze and praise. I had no interest, assumed it'd be boring and lack a cohesive plot. Finally about 6 years ago I gave in and watched it with extreme skepticism. I had an experience I've only had a few times. It's like being so captivated and present that there's no thought just attention, on the edge of my seat waiting to see what brilliant creative theme will appear next. I personally can't say it's at all slow, a faster pace and it wouldn't have been what it is. However, for people who have aunts in their pants or can't appreciate the building of wonder and suspense through pace it may seem that way. The second time I was able to take how far ahead of it's time this was. The number of times my mind was blown by the thought that it was made in 67 easily set a new personal record. Even if you too weren't born yet but have the ability to imagine the world then it will bring the experience to a new level. So, it turns out I am a fan boy. Not because it's the popular thing to say but because in spite of my small mind and imagined preconceptions it won me over almost immediately. It is in my opinion the greatest movie of all time. Masterpiece, legend, maverick are the appropriate descriptions. I'm still stuck in my preconceptions of Citizen Kane. How could I like a movie from 31? Hopefully I'll realize I don't know ahit and it'll also prove me wrong. Take care."
Brian_McInnis,"Apr 11, 2018",10/10,"Over most of my life, I've studied this film and the conception of its story in both Arthur Clarke's scientific mind and in Kubrick's artistic mind, and I've learned about a great many subliminal themes and subconscious effects Kubrick wove into it. But I think that probably the most profound and unique effect of the film is this:It begins in a place before language, where a profound but inexpressible truth is communicated nonverbally, - to the Australopithecines and to the audience. It then jumps ahead to a time where language is universal and compulsory, but where it is also consistently platitudinous, shallow, (Heywood Floyd and others) deceptive, cryptic, (Hal) or purely technical in nature. Nothing of any deep truth or impact is presented in the film verbally, and most of the dialogue is distinctly mundane and, the deeper one looks into the film, duplicitous. Hal is deceiving his two astronauts, and later they are presenting a false veneer of cooperation to him. Dr. Floyd has a conversation with Russian collaborators in which all are extremely polite and friendly even as Floyd refuses to actually answer any of his companions' questions (and in which he is slyly given a middle finger by Dr. Smyslov as Smyslov moves a drink on the table).Floyd later gives a speech on the Lunar base in which he gives absolutely no actual information about the monolith, and in which are several quietly sinister references to the 'proper preparation and conditioning' of the public, the 'formal oaths' that need to be obtained and 'sacrifices' made by those privileged to be present at the meeting (Kubrick was greatly fixated on the secretive, Freemason-like enclaves of the rich and powerful). Floyd's small daughter (whose mother is currently away shopping) wants a telephone for her birthday, but he reminds her they've already got lots of telephones - so many ways to talk, but the girl still seems to desire real communication (communication and its failure is another recurring theme in Stanley's work). On and on it goes.But when we finally arrive at Jupiter and its orbiting monolith, speech drops away completely for the last twenty-three minutes of the film (about the same length as the pre-verbal prologue). Bowman passes beyond speech into the most stupefying experience in the cinema - an experience of incomprehensible images and music, (and an experience whose connection with the audience is strengthened by the fact that Bowman isn't a Specific Character, with his own personal and emotional history the movie's supplied him with, but a blank, prototypical human we can read anything onto) and even more bewilderingly, he encounters himself at the end of this journey; and the movie itself seems to pass beyond its own logic.The subconscious feeling one's left with from a full, uninterrupted viewing is of a film largely about the treachery and emptiness of speech in which we finally escape the verbal universe entirely and arrive at a place of profound but inexpressible truth; that nearly all the film before this has had a distinct falseness and superficiality about it, and we have finally found a great Secret far beyond any word. I've never seen another film that's achieved this feeling.I've studied Kubrick's other films for some time now, and 'The Shining' and 'Eyes Wide Shut' may exceed '2001' in the richness of their subliminal thematic and aesthetic tapestries (and days before he died, Stanley himself said the latter would be his greatest contribution). But none of his other movies go nearly as far down the rabbit-hole of raw experience and mystery as the Odyssey does. Emily Dickinson wrote that 'Nature is a haunted house--but Art--is a house that tries to be haunted.' Of the artists who've worked with film, Kubrick is the most skilled I've seen at haunting his houses.Einstein -'The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead - his eyes are closed.'"
vishnu-dileep08,"Oct 4, 2017",10/10,This movie is about humans discovering a mysterious artificial object on the surface of lunar and with the help of an intelligent computer HAC 9000 and some astronauts sets out to find out what it really is.The plot of this movie is just too good to explain as I said before I felt like I actually travelled to space and back. There were such beautiful BGMs throughout the movie now I understand from where all this BGMs erupted elsewhere. I just can't believe this movie was made in the year 1968 what great ideas it had. Even at the year 2000s we don't get to see such mesmerizing plots. I just felt the ending was a little dragged but no complaints. Recommended that you wear head phones or headsets or the best option would be a home theater system while watching this movie to get a full space experience. Exceptional acting by everyone in this movie with a perfect ending.YES I would recommend people to watch this movie.My Rating 10/10
kiekeo,"Aug 27, 2018",10/10,"I don't know why anyone would say this is a waste of time or overhyped. Maybe they didn't get a good viewing experience because I definitely recommend watching this for the first time in theaters. This film surpassed the hype for me. I saw it with my friend a couple of days ago, he said that he didn't want to see it and he'd rather see a new movie, but, when we walked out of the theater the first thing he said to me was, ""I think that's now my favorite movie."" It was amazing, it's all I could think about for the past couple of days. There's no other movie like it. It uses the silence of space so well as awell as The Blue Danube for the elegance of space travel. See this movie in a theater ASAP!"
Hawkeleven,"Oct 17, 2019",6/10,"This movie was made in 1968, and for the time it have a great concept and a clever looking into how human race looks at it's own existence. But it's really boring most of the time nothing happens, you will watch two and a half hours of movie, but only 40 minutes or less of it really matters, it's too much time watching planets, stars and ships. In my opinion it had the potential to be a great movie, the idea it's really great, but it's not the masterpiece movie everyone says it is."
twirl-46573,"Aug 31, 2019",10/10,"2001 is a very important movie and very dear to my heart. No film can and ever will top 2001: A Space Odyssey. Not EVEN ENDGAME can top this masterpiece. The music was WAY ahead of its time and the sound felt like it came from the future. If you think this is boring, you have NO CLUE what a TRUE MOVIE looks and feels like. Movies these days are complete and utter GARBAGE, but 2001 will always seem to be unbeatable. If a movie ever topped 2001's amazing stuff, that would blow my MIND. I don't think it'll ever happen, though... 2001 will always be #1, NO MATTER what salty critics have to say."
jacobs-greenwood,"Dec 6, 2016",7/10,"A visually stunning film, told in several distinct yet interconnected parts, with an excellent score ... though the world didn't turn out quite like this, at least not yet;-) Keir Dullea in his career role as Dr. Dave Bowman, and Gary Lockwood as Dr. Frank Poole, travel into deep space to Jupiter, in order to explore the origin of a strange black monolith (the object which connects the film's story-lines), found on the moon by Dr. Frank Lloyd (William Sylvester).This masterpiece by director-producer Stanley Kubrick earned him his only Oscar, for Best Effects, Special Visual Effects no less, though he also received a Best Director nomination, and shared a Writing nomination with Arthur C. Clarke (his only nomination). The Art Direction-Set Decoration was also nominated. Kubrick had previously received director and producer nominations for Dr. Strangelove (1964) and went on to earn 7 more nominations, in various categories, before his death in 1999 (two years before this film's title;-)The real star of the film is the HAL 9000 computer (AFI's #13 villain), who at first assists astronauts Bowman & Poole, before something goes wrong and ""he"" takes over the mission, with tragic results. The film is #22 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list & #40 on AFI's 100 Most Heart-Pounding Movies list.

Is the point that we are supposed to decide for ourselves what the point is?The space scenes are slow.  I could do without watching a pod land on the moon while listening to classical music.  And yet those scenes last for seemingly forever.  Get on with it!  Hire an editor.  Get over the self-glorification of special effects that add nothing to the story.What is the point of the ending?  Did Kubrick want to give acid-laced hippies an alternative to Fantasia?  Let's get real--the last 20 minutes are a waste of time.Maybe there was something redeeming about this movie, but there are 2 1/2 hours that can be much better spent."

jgcorrea,"Aug 22, 2018",10/10,"As far as meaning, significance and cultural instigation are concerned, 2001 features innumerable referential approaches: to mankind, to God (and/or to the Demon), to the future, to our responsibility as of 1968 as we faced new realities; to the rediscovery of language; to the brand-new systems of knowledge; to the man-vs. -machine struggle. Stanley Kubrick directed this iconic film, in which mankind finds a mysterious, obviously artificial object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the help of an intelligent computer HAL 9000, sets off on a quest. Hal is error-proof - his ontology is infallibility. (And Nota bene the homophone pun: Hal is pronounced as hell. Beforehand, during the Paleolithic period, primates faced the mechanics of their primitive, primary life, and their capital objective = simple resistance, at a biological level. Those mankind precursors were not yet fully superior to other animals because they did not have the capacity for symbolic communication; they only communicated through signals. They mastered no connotative capacity at all, only some kinda denotative capacity. Their booming intellect was still impotent for making abstractions. Then an immense, polished, geometric, rectangular monolith, - the revelation of the newly coming Neolithic revolutionized universe (the Polished stone Era) - and subsequently the discovery of the media and the instruments - extensions of our physical members. The unknown monolith is almost an apparition of God. Also the germ of thought. The ape-man assaults the skeleton of a dead animal, picks up a bone (which had previously been used as a weapon to win the battle for a water pool ), begins to brand it euphorically, while disrupting the skeleton, throwing it up in the air and - incidentally the greatest anecdotal ellipse in the history of cinema: - and the bone fuses into a 2001 spaceship, sliding through the imponderable silence of the cosmos, to the sound of Johann Strauss' Blue Danube. The phenomenon is then repeated: the monolith is found on the moon, and the astronauts who approach it exhibit a similar behavior to that of the primates, when they touch it. An expedition to Jupiter, with three crew members in hibernation, only to be restored to their vital faculties when they arrived at the destination, the other two alive, and the electronic computer (Hal), leading the ship. Kubrick & Arthur C Clarke conceived the behavior of the Cyclops-eye machinery by, say, matching Homer's Odyssey. Something like Hal may indeed become reality and be capable of own emotions and mental initiatives. There resides the impasse for mankind, with its philosophical implications."
RiffRaffMcKinley,"Jun 9, 2007",10/10,"Even in a world full of ""Independence Day""s and ""Star Wars"" flicks, the special effects of ""2001"" are still inferior to none. However, the effects of ""2001"" are not the only mind-blowing element, thanks to a top-notch director, an astounding story, and a small but wondrous lead cast.The stars in front of the cameras may seem to be Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood as the bold Jupiter astronauts, but the real stars of the show are two inanimate objects: ultra-logical computer HAL-9000 (""whom... one addresses as Hal"") and the ultra-enigmatic black monoliths scattered throughout our solar system. Stanley Kubrick rightfully favors a cerebral style over cheap mile-a-minute thrills, even though there comes a time late in the film when thrills do come around. The reason it's so good is that the thriller element never overpowers the drama, the sense of discovery, or the general legitimacy of the film's artistic capacity. Kubrick's use of classical music instead of an original score doesn't hurt, either (this is the only time I could ever actually listen to any of ""The Blue Danube"").The most awesome scene ever captured on film is the earth-shattering climactic sequence when man first meets something truly bigger than himself, a nonstop barrage of incredible sounds and colorful sights that still can't top the rest of the film in general. I don't know how else to explain it-- ""2001"" is spectacular entertainment at its best."
justthenaughtystuff-44694,"Oct 13, 2023",6/10,People say you just don't understand if you disagree with it being a masterpiece. That is comical. It is VERY slow at the beginning. Literally up to about the 40+ minute. Then after that it gets a little interesting. Still the pace is slow. Throw in some misdirection. Then finish with non sense even for a sci-fi movie. Some people have also praised the music and visuals. Perhaps back when it came out maybe they were great but not really nowadays. Most visuals add nothing to the movie and the music/sounds are often excessively loud. It has some interesting elements but not enough to come close to putting this in a top 1000 list.
mwagrp,"Mar 12, 2006",9/10,"The only reason I give it 9 and not 10 is because of the ending. Too weird! It does lead me to believe that one or more of the production team were taking recreational drugs.But other than that, it is a wonderful rendering of what could have been and perhaps what might be. Rich in detail, stunning special effects and great sets. And all from 1968... heck, I was still in high school and, as a timeline reference, the Japanese hadn't yet brought their first 4-cylinder motorcycle to market yet.The one prediction which they had completely wrong was the operator/ownership of the shuttle - PanAm was strong in 1968 but would be long gone by 2001. And we haven't discovered any remotely controlled monoliths yet.Philosophically, the film contains several messages, but one pervades all : ""we are mere puppets of the Universe"".Don't plan on watching this movie quickly, or even once. You'll miss way too much of what makes it a Sci-fi benchmark."
Abdulxoxo,"Nov 1, 2020",6/10,"There really isn't anything that I'm going to say that the other reviewers didn't already said. it's really boring, it only started to get interesting after the Intermission, and the conflict between HAL and the crew is the highlight of the movie. Some scenes were really drawn out, at first it's fascinating and then it's started to get frustrating. But the Cinematography, set, and the visuals were absolutely brilliant, very ahead of its time."
MrMovie-2,"Jul 30, 1998",N/A,"2001 is probably the most technically perfect film ever made. It is a study in the intellectual evolution of mankind. The premise is that an outside entity is enabling our journey through the use of the monolith. The monolith gives the apes the ability to reason. Not insignificantly, Moonwatchers first thought is the use of a weapon (the bone). This changes everything. This new species is able to conquer its rivals, changing itself from hunted to hunter, allowing the species to flourish. Moonwatcher throws the bone in the sky and it morphs into a nuclear space station. Eons have gone by in an instant but man has not changed at all. The rest of the movie deals with the next step in man's intellectual evolution beginning with the discovery of the monolith on the moon. This can be seen symbolically in the ships that are used, signifying man's ""re-birth"". The space station is an unfertilized egg and Floyd's shuttle is the sperm. Conception occurs at docking. The probe to the moon is the fertilized zygote implanting itself in the womb (the moon). And of course, Discovery is the soon to be born child, the monolith by Jupiter the birth canal. New man no longer needs a body and is pure energy."
dbdumonteil,"Jun 22, 2001",10/10,"On a scale from 1 to 10,a ten would not be enough for such a masterwork. 1968 was the definitive landmark for sci-fi movies.So innovative was the screenplay,so devastating were the pictures,so haunting was the score that Kubrik's movie took our breath away,mesmerizing us ,turning us into creatures in rapture,in awe .Some scenes are so admirable,so sublime,that they make you cry:remember the ape discovering the power of a tool,the spaceships floating while exotic ""Blue Danube"" is heard. This movie could go on four hours and hours ,no one would notice.One hundred years from now,future scholars will write exegesises of the bewildering finale.As vain and futile as the quest for the Holy Graal.Our connection to the movie is subliminal,the long ""psychedelic"" sequence comes as a perfect metaphor.Remember ,in Ingmar Bergman's ""seventh seal"",the lines :""questions are more important than the answers"".Kubrick wanted the movie to stir something inside of us,to speak to our subconscious.And AC Clarke ,who co-wrote the screenplay mischievously added;""this is a fiction;reality will be certainly stranger"". No sci-fi movie comes close to 2001:""star wars"" does not really appeal to adults the same way ,by a long shot .""Close encounters"",while aping some of Kubrik tricks,remains puerile and spoils everything by showing almost everything in its turgid finale."
Captain_Couth,"Feb 5, 2005",10/10,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a breath taking look at a possible future through the eyes of Arthur C. Clarke and under the direction of Stanley Kubrick. The movie itself is more of a visual work of art than anything else. All of Kubrick's future (no pun intended) trademarks can be found in this film (cold sterile sets and the Kubrick ""stare"" to name a few). The two made an awesome team. A shame that they never worked with each other again. Imagine the possibilities.The movie follows the stages of man's evolution under the watchful of the ominous monolith. Who or what exactly the monolith is or what it represents is up to the viewer to decide. I have an opinion but I'll keep it to myself. Beginning with the dawn of man and civilization, the evolved simian and to the year 2001. Man has reached the stars but will they enjoy what they discover? From Earth to the Moon to Jupiter, man has traveled hither and yonder. But they still don't grasp the basic understanding of life in general and it's continued evolution Does the discovery of the monolith on the moon have anything to do with it? Will Dr. Heywood Floyd and his men learn the meaning of it? What about Dave Bowman and his crew that orbit Jupiter? You'll have to find out when you watch this classic science fiction flick.I enjoyed this movie ever since I was a child. I have never seen anything like this before. The visuals and the music are extremely haunting. Kubrick has made a masterpiece (only to be topped by his brilliant film Barry Lyndon). A cinematic enigma that's has so many possibilities.Followed a few years later with a direct sequel. Not as brilliant as this one but satisfactory for die hard fans of the novels.Highly recommended."
p-flaherty,"Apr 8, 2006",10/10,"""2001, A Space Odyssey"", is Stanley Kubrick's Masterpiece in a list of masterpieces (Dr.Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut, Lolita, etc.),which combined places him in the exalted role of ""greatest filmmaker of all"". This 2001 extended journey within man's existence, and into degrees of space, still seems to stand atop everything made in film history despite 37 years passing since it's release. It travels from the beginning of man's evolution through apes, to modern day space-walkers, in the blink of an ape-man's tool. And with the help of a silver monolith, possibly planted on Earth by ancient Alien visitants to trigger intellect in future humans, a trip that takes millions of years to evolve is unleashed. The apes learn about the use of power through weapons, how they can gain property, and how to kill their fellow creatures through violence. Thus four million evolutionary years later, and not that much wiser, the intellect that was released has brought them from apes to moon-dancers. Of course the astronauts are still eating slaughtered packaged meat as they ride to investigate another monolith that has been discovered buried on the moon. Things change . . . things stay the same.Everything is brilliantly done up through the 2nd monolith's arrival, including wonderful choices and uses of music and silence, but the most interesting, calculating character in the movie is waiting to be introduced. The new monolith is pointing to Jupiter, and a human mission is sent to explore the giant planet under the supervision of Hal, an extremely intelligent computer who is put in charge of the entire expedition. While most of the spacemen are in a hibernated state, Hal interacts with the few that are awake (chrushing them at chess), as he runs the entire ship.But . . . Hal begins to make mistakes, and here's where Kubrick combines inner and outer space and elevates his movie beyond simple adventure. The astronauts realize that Hal has to be shut off, and of course Hal (who is a monster at lip reading) realizes that they will try to do just that. He begins one by one to kill the astronauts air supply, rather than be put down himself . . . just as a logical egotistical mind, that is caught making mistakes by the inner man, will try to destroy a person's body and suppress the truth rather than allow itself to be quieted. It takes a man of immense will and a calm deliberate approach to dis-engage the ego in both spaceship and in a human being, and this role goes to Keir Dullea, the astronaut who both physically and symbolically breaks down the doors blocking the essence of the ship's mission, and man's mission into the future.Once Hal is placed under control, the truth is revealed . . . and man's evolution rises into the next step and beyond . . . seemingly transcending both time and space.When this movie was released it created much confusion and didn't get the critical acclaim it receives today. It's slowly unfolded into our consciousness because it's really the story of man's entire history and of our individual personal lives and dreams rolled into one......a work of genius, that continues to stand the immense test of time in an art medium that re-invents itself continually.Hats off to you Stanley Kubrick.........a work unequaled."
EThompsonUMD,"Apr 19, 2008",10/10,"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) is indisputably a landmark film in the history of cinematic special effects and in the rise to prominence of science fiction as a narrative genre in American popular culture. Released in the midst of America's initial thrust into the frontier of outer space and one year before the first moon landing, the film's special effects range from the psychedelic ""Stargate"" sequence to nearly documentary realism in the rendering of spacecraft and space travel. Several of the artists and technicians who helped create the film's special effects (especially Douglas Trumbull) were to become the gurus of SF special effects for the next several decades.Among its many distinctions, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was the first commercially successful art film in American motion picture history. Curiously, its late '60s popular audience was instinctively more receptive to the film than the mainstream newspaper and magazine film reviewers, most of whom complained about the film's obscure plot, minimal dialog, and cardboard characters (excepting the H.A.L. 9000 computer and maybe a hominid or two). What was clear to many in the film's largely youthful and college-educated audience was that 2001's director, Stanley Kubrick, was deliberately rejecting the established Hollywood mode of storytelling and challenging his audience to a cinematic experience that was largely non-verbal yet, paradoxically, searchingly philosophical. Among a generation feverishly seeking alternatives to the established social/intellectual order, the film was hailed as a profound mind trip of perception and concepts. Astonishingly, much of 2001's visionary power remains despite the passage of forty years, seven beyond the portentous date in the film's title.Regarding the film's non-verbal communication, here are a couple of startling facts: no words are spoken until nearly 30 minutes into its 139 minute running time and a total of only 40 minutes contain dialog, much of which is either minimal or emanates from a non-human source. In place of words, Kubrick uses the ""pure cinema"" of image and sound (and silence). His distinctly original marriage of a classical score to the film's primitive landscape and futuristic space imagery is justly cited as among the film's crowning achievements. The emotional reverberation of such key compositions as Richard Strauss's ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" (opening sequence), Johann Strauss's ""Blue Danube"" (first space scene), and Ligeti's ""Atmospheres"" (distorted voices in the ""hotel"" sequence) cannot be overstated. Nor can the prolonged silences of outer space that greet the astronauts and film audience once outside the human cocoon of the spaceship.Perhaps most importantly, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY brought to film the philosophical dimension of prose science fiction that with rare exceptions (like The Day the Earth Stood Still) had largely been ignored by Hollywood in favor of more adventurous or horrific modes. Deriving its initial concept from ""The Sentinel,"" a short story written by the renowned British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY paved the way for science fiction's now common use as a vehicle for the serious analysis of such heavy themes as human nature and evolution, man-machine interaction and differentiation, and the possibilities/implications of extra-terrestrial intelligence. From such a bizarre assembly of objects and images as proto-human cave dwellers, recurring monoliths, mammoth spaceships, an advanced but neurotic computer, a mysterious hotel suite with invisible staff, and a star-child gazing with supra-human wisdom on the universe, Stanley Kubrick forged an endlessly fascinating and provocatively ambiguous epic of mankind's quest for its place in the cosmos. Few, if any, films have had greater or more lasting impact."
