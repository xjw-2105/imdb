Lejink,"Nov 9, 2023",8/10,"My old dad used to treat this Mel Gibson Best Picture Oscar-winner with utter scorn and derision, especially with reference to the actual facts as known. He always started off with the respective differences in size between the real William Wallace's true dimensions and the much less imposing Mel Gibson while anyone who does the mildest of diligence into the historical facts will see just how much licence director Gibson and his screenwriter Randall Wallace took with the Scottish rebel-hero's story. I know and knew all this even as I rewatched the film again but despite the overwhelming number of plot contrivances served up, I have to admit as an independence-leaning Scot myself, the film never fails to stir my own blood.We follow the young Wallace from his early childhood, almost literally blooded early in life to hate the occupying English army under the rule of their despotic King Edward Longshanks played with real brio by Patrick McGoohan. When he loses his father and older brother in another betrayal by Edward, it's clear that the now fully-grown, long-haired Wallace is only awaiting one final provocation before he accepts the freedom-fighter mantle and takes up the cudgels on behalf of his downtrodden people.For those who don't know very much about Scottish history, it is filled with glorious failures and almost as often double-dealing, back-stabbing intrigue so that it's no surprise when his heroics are brought to an end by a combination of underhand scheming on the part of Edward and the connivance of the corruptible Scottish nobility, in particular the treachery of the future ""try, try again"" hero - King Robert the Bruce. But Wallace has the last word in more ways than one with his martyr's death and impregnation of the future English queen.Certainly one of Hollywood's more outrageous retellings of a story from history, the movie bludgeons its way into the viewer's consciousness down to the twin combination of Gibson's muscular, gritty direction and his athleticism and conviction in the lead role. Sure, the accents across the cast are occasionally as convincing as a King's promise, but with effective use of crowd scenes and the gory, no holds-barred depictions of battleground warfare, laced with earthy humour and even a good old Highland romance, Gibson delivers a powerfully uplifting if historically inaccurate feature which has thrilled the Scottish national psyche and no doubt the freedom-seeking aspirations of many another country ever since."
klindon-38400,"May 3, 2023",9/10,"I'm a fan of super intense acting performances. Intensity to me is what I think people call star power or charisma. Lethal Weapon is one of those movies where his intensity is on full display but he has a different kind of thing going on here. He's a tad older, wiser, gets accosted personally and his livelihood, so his intensity is of a different ilk. He's crazy in Lethal Weapon but in Braveheart he's completely intense while being completely sane at the same time. All of his actions in this film are justified. You're rooting for him from frame one. This is the best film he's ever been in and possible ever will be."
Xstal,"Sep 6, 2020",8/10,"A simple message but even today, over seven hundred years later, there are far too many captive to their cultures, governments and institutions. They take a large slice, sometimes all of the freedoms William Wallace and so many others fought for. Keep up the fight because, like the tide, those oppressive forces wont curtail.A rousing piece of cinema, you can forgive the historical inaccuracies in order for it to tell a hugely engaging and inspirational story full of hope, although it leaves you under no illusion of mans inhumanity to man and the vile and despicable things that can be done in the name of greed, power and control."
0U,"Feb 24, 2020",10/10,"The Academy Award winning war epic Braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. The story follows a Scottish peasant named William Wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of English rule when his wife is murdered. Starring Mel Gibson, Patrick McGoohan, Sophie Marceau, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. Additionally, the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent, which adds to the authentic tone of the film. And, composer James Horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. A groundbreaking film, Braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war."
brentcollyer,"Mar 12, 2021",10/10,"It doesn't get any better than this. Mel Gibson didn't just star in this movie but directed and produced. No one will ever forget...Run, and you'll live... at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willin' to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!"
rutan07,"Sep 13, 2005",10/10,"Most on this site pick the Godfather, or the Shawshank Redemption, but this is it, this is the best film ever made. People will complain, will argue that I am wrong, but I will say it again...Braveheart is as close to perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man who played Lonshanks, the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce, both should have been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil and a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) by meeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction, the cinematography. Braveheart is glorious, beautiful to look at. The slow motion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants, the entire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera. Braveheart is artwork, it is as good as any picture. That the film is number 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible, to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's list of greatest films."
damianphelps,"Jan 21, 2021",10/10,"What to say about Braveheart?This movie holds up against the challenge of aging, its exciting, adventurous, funny and passionate.
The movie is beautifully shot and sounds incredible.Is it violent? Sure but what war isn't. I think Mel makes violence as much a part of the story in all his (relevant) films. The characters struggle through great violence and the impacts that is has on them, by not shying away from it we are allowed to get a small appreciation of it and them.The movie isn't OTT but delivers great action that serves the story and entertains the viewer.Its considered a classic film and so it is."
high_voltage_41,"Nov 19, 2005",10/10,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time in late 2003, and I was impressed. I saw it again last night, and I was even more impressed. The acting is amazing, and the ending was brilliant. For me, all my guesses were incorrect. Everything that happens in this movie in unpredicted. The last half hour itself was highly unpredictable, and it had a powerful message. When a scene was meant to be dramatic, they did a great job at it. I don't know about everybody else, but the ending did make me cry. The message the movie sent kept me thinking for a while. The amount of courage and bravery was inconceivable, there was barely any faults or anything wrong with the movie. For a movie of 1995, they did a great job.I absolutely guarantee this movie to anybody who enjoys action and war with a bit of drama mixed in. One of the best, or maybe even the best movie of the 20th century."
riddler_1138-3,"Nov 19, 1999",N/A,"On my list of the greatest movies of all time, BraveHeart ranks as number 3. It is by far one of the most epic stories ever told.  Mel Gibson deserved all the credit he recieved and more. His portrayal of William Wallace, one of Scotlands most mightiest warriors, was spot on.  The only part that lacked was the romantic affair of Princess Isabella and Wallace.  It historically never happened.  This movie also has other historical errors but WHO CARES!The Battle of Stirling has to be the second most graphic piece of footage ever shot next to Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. I love the part where the English Commander gives the order to charge and Wallace sees this and raises his broadsword into the air and starts yelling.  He charges the field with the Scots and I'll let you see the movie to see what happens next.Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational and I think that the REAL William Wallace would be proud of the way Mel Gibson portrayed him.My hat goes off to Mel Gibson.  I hope he makes a few more movies like this one.Out of ten............10/10!"
GoonerMan,"Dec 19, 2000",7/10,"I am a fan of this particularly period in English History and when I initially saw Braveheart I recognised that this whole story is a complete fabrication and bears no resemblance to the truth at all. But I didn't worry too much - surely everyone would recognise that this is just a film? But no - it seems that a lot of people have swallowed this drivel and think that its all true.This film is not just a little bit inaccurate, its a complete and utter joke historically. Just because Edward I (or Longshanks as the film constantly refers to him) died nearly seven hundred years ago is not an excuse to assassinate his character and to depict him as a coward is a complete disgrace. Edward had another nickname apart from Longshanks - The Lion of Justice - now I doubt he got that from being a tyrant!!!! This film makes the classic mistake of judging historical events and characters by todays standards rather than the context in which they existed. The political and social environment of medieval Europe was a lot different to modern-day USA, and do not be thinking that the Scots themselves were averse to invading weaker countries - they attempted to invade Ireland while Bruce was on the throne under the pretence of 'helping' them (they lost!). Now, I have the utmost respect for Wallace, but to depict him as a moral crusader is way off the mark - he was certainly capable of acts of brutality and barbarism himself. The character of Robert Bruce is equally inaccurate - being depicted as feeling guilty over changing sides when in fact all of his actions were for his own gain - and this is a man who murdered another Scottish claimant to the throne in cold blood - hardly a nice guy!The storyline and characters in the film are also terribly one-dimensional. Every single Englishman in this film is evil and cowardly - there are no good English people to create a conflict in the English camp that would have made things more interesting. The English, like all European and World powers have been guilty of their fair share of atrocities in the past, none of which I am proud of, but to cast us as complete villains is clearly racism.  Also, the plot has far too many holes and the characters do not behave logically - for example a royal French princess (Isabella) falling for a common Scottish peasant (although in reality Wallace was not a peasant and Isabella was only a child when Wallace died anyway and she certainly never met him). Edward also behaves illogically - loosing arrows on his own troops and throwing a young nobleman out of his castle window. The barons in England were immensely powerful at this time, and the king could not just do as he pleased without repercussions. However, perhaps the best joke of all in this film is the suggestion that Wallace was the father of Edward III. Apart from the fact that Edward III apparently looked very similar to Edward I and every bit a Plantagenet, he was born about 7 years after Wallace died anyway. There are enough historical inaccuracies in this film to fill a book.As a piece of cinema this film is highly entertaining, if a little simplistic in plot. The battle scenes are exciting (although not accurate re-enactments of the battles they represent) and the story interesting enough to keep you watching. So, watch it and enjoy - but please treat it as a work of fiction, as apart from the names of the characters this is clearly what it is. History has always contained more exciting stories than fiction ever could - but the fact that the scriptwriters of this film needed to be so economical with the truth tells its own story - Wallace's life, although historically important, wasn't that interesting at all in reality."
raidbers,"Sep 2, 2005",10/10,"This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. I recently purchased it and have watched it at least five times since then, and each time i pick up on things I did not see the other times. The fight scenes are great, the plot is both interesting and thought provoking, there is romance and comedy. This is a movie that any person can appreciate at some level.True, the historical content may have been distorted, but even though, this movie is meant for entertainment. It is not a history lesson caught on video.The acting is absolutely superb, this movie is guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat for the entire three hours."
zwei,"Nov 17, 2004",10/10,"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to watch Braveheart till 2003 when it was on TV. However, the lack of theatrical effects never stopped me from being mesmerized by this epic for one moment. So mesmerized, I literally sat motionlessly on the couch for two minutes after the movie. Any normal audience would likely to cast his/her sense of reality away and be captivated by this distant Celtic saga.Beside proving himself as a brilliant director, Mel Gibson more importantly gave life to a historical hero whose superb gallantry, vivid character and magnificent spirit shall never be history. Along with the unforgettable 'Alba gu bragh!' and the unprecedentedly heart-stopping 'Freeeeedom', Braveheart unquestionably is one of the greatest movies ever made."
EVON1TY,"Mar 2, 2023",10/10,"Most of the times Hollywood movies is sided. I don't know what you believe but sadly this movie based on the truth. Only some of the minor subjects are added to make the movie more interesting. The additions were pretty minor most of the times, the main subjects is based on the truth.Doesn't matter which nation you are, I think you could love this movie so much. It's actually not only about wars and battles. It has so effective Romance subject. For me the actual subject. Also the movie shows how Freedom is important.Mel Gibson did something special. I don't know is there another movie like this? I'll explain the success I like in this movie. I don't have another example that any movie with great lead actor with achieving so many things. It has James Horner's brilliant scores, (that I don't know how didn't get the Academy Award) has amazing Cinematography, has amazing Costumes and Makeup, also has magnificent Set Decoration.I don't know how Mel Gibson managed to do all these when he's acting superbly. I know making a movie is not a personal job, It's more of a team job but I'm saying Gibson directed the movie so good while acting superbly. I think that's a real special achievement."
jcrap,"Mar 11, 2005",10/10,"This is simply the best movie ever made, containing all the elements a perfect movie should, even considering that every person has a right to his/her opinion. The soundtrack is amazing, the scenes are ingenious and the story is simply excellent! This is a story about a Scotsman named William Wallace (Mel Gibson) and his fight for the freedom of the Scottish people, from the oppression of the English ruler-ship. After seeing the death of his wife at the hands of an English nobleman, William Wallace (Mel Gibson) sets out on a quest for vengeance that quickly turns into a crusade for freedom for the entire ""country"". The extreme violence as well as the human compassion in this movie are overwhelming in its brilliancy."
freethinkingworld,"Dec 14, 2022",7/10,"So look, I like this movie, I even have nostalgia for this movie......it shouldn't be on the list for greatest movies of all time 😅😅. It's a good, fun film. The effects and battles are fun and exciting. I love reqatching the battle sense. But this movie can be rather dull in some places, and like everyone says, it is historically inaccurate. But! I don't penalize it as much as some people do for being historically inaccurate, I just had to point it out. I find that hardly any movies are accurate to History as it would make a dull film, so I understand where they are coming from. But non the less, fun great film....just overrated a bit."
Jakethemuss,"Nov 27, 2005",9/10,"This epic tale of patriotism, love and conflict opens with a birds eye view which takes you through mist and air out onto an open loch with scenic mountains in the background. This is accompanied by stirring bagpipe music, and shortly by the start of a narrative by Robert the Bruce.After a short introduction of a young William Wallace, involving his fathers death and his first step into warrior-hood, we are taken to present day England where Edward Longshank's tight rule over Scotland is getting increasingly harsh. Enter a fully grown Wallace (a rugged long-haired Gibson) who is back to start a family and a new life. He soon meets Muran, a girl who he remembered from way back. He and Muran fall in love and shortly get a private nighttime marriage, as a public one would result in the 'Prima Nocte' rule being enforced.Unfortunately, one of the English soldiers controlling their village confronts a scared Muran and forces her into a quiet spot. William leaps to Muran's rescue and all hell ensues. The commanding officer executes Muran promptly for assault on one of the King's men as she bit him whilst defending herself. She was supposed to meet William at a secret spot after she was rescued but was knocked off the horse.William returns to the village on horseback to give himself in, but he has other plans. The uprising that ensues is one of the most pulse racing and exciting fights that has ever graced the silver screen IMO. This is the spark that starts off the Scottish revolution for freedom. Soon, other clans join Wallace, then whole towns stand by him. He soon finds himself on the fields of Stirling for a real showdown. I thought I'd give you the first hour in a nutshell, the rest of the movie revolves around Wallace, Longshanks and the Queen of France as they all fight for their own cause.The battle scenes are ground breaking and upfront, the senses of comradeship, love, patriotism and courage all take a stand throughout the film. The music adds further to the epic, be it sad and haunting tunes, or strong and stirring bagpipe anthems. Wallace is portrayed as a beacon of strength and power, not to mention a much honoured leader. Sometimes Gibson takes his character a little too far, but the title Braveheart is one that is implied to Wallace's qualities. The films dramatic and moving ending is a good finish to a superb and powerful film."
chris.murray3,"May 30, 2001",1/10,"I think that to even things up Hollywood should finance a motion picture in which Sean Connery, playing an Aborigine, leads his people in an uprising against their white Australian oppressors! If nothing else it would give Mel""Patriot"" Gibson an overdue taste of his own medicine. Now if you will kindly excuse me, being English, I have some evil to go and do."
katari24,"Dec 27, 2020",10/10,I watched it years ago and just now and will definitely watch it again.. I feel like you can't rate it it's just beyond that it's so beautiful and it's epic. One of the best movies ever made. Mel Gibson is a true legend.
lyesilpinar,"Jul 2, 2006",10/10,"The Best film I have ever seen. And the most successful one which has stayed in Turkish cinemas 2 years in a row. Having watched this movie more than 200 times, I am declaring it as my whole life's movie. Special side characters, as Steven, Hemich and most of the rest remind me of a huge history ""wirtten by those who have hung heroes"".When dying in your beds, many years from now; Would you be willing to trade, all the days -from this day to that-, for one chance -just one chance- to watch this film and tell everybody we know, that they can watch lots of movies but they will never watch any Braveheart quality movie again.."
hitchcockthelegend,"Jan 6, 2010",10/10,"So it comes to pass in the year of 1995 (not a year of our lord I think) that Mel Gibson would craft the award winning epic that is Braveheart, a film that is historically bent in the extreme, that is directed by a man who would go on to have a less than favourable character reputation, and a film that has a heavy handed approach at times. It's also as choppy as a boat ride during a tidal wave, so yes, Braveheart is far from flawless folks. Yet the structure, the epic emotional swirls and sheer spectacle of it all marks it out as a rousing treat.It's a lavish gargantuan epic that somehow seems out of place for the year it was made, perhaps the secret of the films' success is because the 90s were crying out for an epic to get us hankering back to those halcyon days of Spartacus et al. Or just maybe the film punched the buttons of the public psyche because it is a great and grand thing to see the little people rise up and kick some ass? The oppressed and the bullied strike back as it were, surely that theme works for the normal human being? It's a sweeping tale that involves love, loyalty, honour, dishonour, treachery, death & heroes and villains. In short it ticks all the boxes for the genre it sits in (clinical bloody battles superbly full on). Gibson is William Wallace, and although he may struggle to nail the Scottish accent to fully convince at times, he more than makes up for it with his verve and vigour when delivering his lines - with the Sons Of Scotland speech at Stirling a particular iconic highlight.Patrick McGoohan is pure egotistical villainy as Longshanks, King Edward I, and the supporting cast also do sterling work (or should that be Stirling?). Brendan Gleeson, Tommy Flanagan, Catherine McCormack, Angus Macfadyen, and the wonderful James Cosmo all add flavour to the delightful scotch broth on the screen. The score by James Horner is appropriately tight to the themes at work in the piece, and the cinematography by John Toll was rightly awarded at Oscar time since he captured the essence of the film. Be it the lush rolling hills or the blood stained field in the aftermath of battle, Toll's work is critically in sync with the unfolding mood of the picture.So yes, damn straight, flaws and all, pic has the ability to lift and inspire many a discerning viewer. It does kick you at times, but as it does so, it also emotionally engages you from start to finish - to which the film deserves every accolade and award that it won. Because the grandiose epic had seemed long gone, but Gibson and his army brought it back to the modern era and made a genre piece fit to hold it's head up high with the greats of years gone by. 10/10"
barquing,"May 19, 1999",N/A,"Someone really missed out on a good story here. The William Wallace story is exceptional so why do Hollywood have to ""improve"" it and turn it into a second-rate, overlong mess of a film? How can you have the Battle of Stirling Bridge _without_ the bridge? Producers have claimed that the bridge ""got in the way"". Funny, the English army discovered that too. And why demean the hero by having him up against such a pantomime villain - sure Edward was a twisted b*****d, but the filmmakers might as well have given him a sidekick called Igor and have him cackle at choice moments throughout the film, he was that unsubtle. Most importantly, however, it seems a real shame that it should be this film that should have captured the hearts of the Scottish nation, they deserve so much better. Would you believe there is now a hideous statue of Mel Gibson at the foot of the Wallace Memorial in Stirling? Would you believe people are leaving flowers beneath it? This film is a travesty of both a good story and history itself. Scotland deserves so much better."
r-fronimides,"Oct 21, 2019",7/10,"...but this film is perhaps the one with most historical inaccuracies, ever!!!First, the NATIONAL HERO of Scotland William Wallace wasn't a poor peasant taken by an uncle to visit... Rome or Paris. There was a Wallace HOUSE, the man was NOBLE. Not too much important, not so much rich, but wasn't a ""simply nobody man"" as the film portraits.Second, obviously, he didn't had emotional/sexual relationship with the... Princess of Wales, the future QUEEN OF ENGLAND!!!!! King Edward's son was a moron, a stupid arrogant lad,... but there is no evidence that he was a homosexual - as the film wants to mock him.Third, the Scots did fighting ""painted"" like that. That was the traditional way of fight of THE SCOTTISH ANCIENT ANCESTORS, the ""Picts""; which a nickname from the Latin word ""Picti"" which means ""PAINTED"" (FOLK). The Roman Legionaries started calling them ""Picti""/""Pict"", because the ancient Scots were fighting NAKED with full body paint job (traditional paganistic protection designs)! And the colour was dark-blue or black, nothing like that cyan of Mel Gibson.Fourth, the modern MARK of Scots, the ""kilt"" skirt with the clan ""tartans"", were found around 17th century, ""just... few"" (four!) centuries later! There were NO CLANS/HOUSES' specific clothing or emblems, in the era of Wallace.Fifth, the Sterling Bridge battle took place on... guess what?... a BRIDGE!!!! That was the (clever) plan of Wallace. There was a SINGLE semi-stone-semi-wooden VERY NARROW bridge, leading folks from Northern England to Southern Scotland. The English army had to use that narrow bridge to cross the river and invade Scotland and THERE was the place Wallace abused them. The (much more) greater army had to be a narrow line of 2-men-weight and cross the bridge... which was an easy task for the waiting Scots on the other side of the bridge! They also used the ""schiltron"" formation (a pack of men carrying large lances/spears) and they massacre the English army.In the film, they do have a ""short of schiltron"" formation but they're facing the HEAVY UNDEFEATED ENGLISH CAVALRY... in open field!!!!!! They would CRASH the Scots like a bowl of crapes!Five, they showing (as the Scots) the English having UNIQUE ONE design of uniforms, as a modern army. Nope. NOBODY HAD unique single design uniforms at that era! Not even in Napoleon's era, they didn't had unique single design, but many many designs (and most of the times, the men were confused who was the enemy on the battlefield).(Its the same ""classic"" mistake they're doing in US CIVIL WAR films!!!!! They're always showing the North wearing the dark-blue uniforms and the CSA Rebels wearing the Grey! Nope! Everybody was wearing HIS OWN CLOTHING, mostly grey-BROWN clothes. SOME Northern Regiments had the famous dark-blue uniforms, but only at the late of the war. And most of the GENERALS (North & South) had the VERY SAME UNIFORM, the early-days WEST POINT grey uniform, which BOTH (North-South) were wearing the same, since they both were students of the ONE ONLY MILITARY academy!)...I could write for ever. As I wrote in the start, this film has the MOST historical inaccuracies, ever! But... but... still, remains one of the MOST ENJOYABLE films I ever watched.And VERY EMOTIONAL!!!! Even if you are not Scot, you'll cry in many scenes! Especially in the very LAST SCENE (no spoils)... which I'm crying like baby EVERY time I watching the film!Overall? Horrible Historical film... but AMAZING to watch it."

stabb666,"Apr 24, 2010",6/10,"There are times when a movie can be watched for its pure entertainment value, but it's usually when we're talking about epic scale fantasy-land type stories. With historical adaptations, it would be a refreshing change if movie studios, writers and directors could actually stick to facts for once in a while.Too often, we get served a mishmash of explosions and/or overly dramatic performances trying to make up for the lack of any real acting talent. Braveheart is one of those ilk and as a Scotsman and student of history, I can't get past the blatant revision of important events in a vain attempt to make up for a terrible script, distinctly average direction and an accent that would get you killed if you used it in any bar in Scotland.This film is rescued by some great cinematography, but there is really no need to redo the story of William Wallace, as the truth is every bit as dramatic as this pandering to an American audience's need for the hero to be a glorious warrior for justice and almost without sin. It seems to be that 'Hollywood' can't seem to realise that anti-heroes, as the real Wallace was, can be every bit as entertaining, if not more engrossing for their character flaws, than these sanitised, lily-white warped reflections could ever be."
NEFARlOUS,"Jul 18, 2001",1/10,"This is a well-constructed film with many fine performances - I truly enjoyed it the first time I saw it. In fact I enjoyed it so much, I was curious to find how much of it was true - unfortunately very little.There are too many inaccuracies to list here, but I will limit myself to a few main ones:1) Robert the Bruce was no traitor. Portaying him as such is quite   simply wrong and disrespectful to his accomplishments - particularly in Bannockburn (a far more tactical affair than represented in the film. ) - his father, who did not betray Wallace either and was not a leper - and his memory as a whole. Confusion with John Balliol perhaps? Or deliberate ""artistic licence""2) The Irish fought against the scots - not just during this period but also for the next two centuries - and the crazy Irishman character in the film is the only truly annoying one in the entire length of the picture.3) Edward the second (Longshank's son) was 13 years old during the time portrayed in the film and his bethrothed was 5.4) Mel is about 11"" too short - Wallace was exceptionally tall and usually wore metal armour.5) His followers were not a bunch of wild men from the hills - the majority would have been kitted out very similar to the English irregulars.6) Wallace's first kill was not in retribution, in 1291 the son of Shelby, an English knight with control of Dundee Castle - approached Wallace in the marketplace and demanded his dirk. Wallace stabbed him through the heart although he was much larger and his opponent had no weapon drawn.7) Wallace continued attacking anything (or anyone) English - Soldier, commoner or merchant. In Lanark he fell in love with Marion, who was 18 years of age. This did not stop him from attacking the English in Lanark, a battle during which he and his men fled back to Marion's house and continued to fight there before escaping. Unsuprisingly, Marion was put to death as an accomplice. Wallace returned to Lanark during the night where no guard had been kept (foolishly), killed the Sherrif in his bed, killed his son and then burnt everyone else in the house to death, including women and children. By the time he finished in the town, 240 people were killed, armed or unarmed - only the priests were spared. (Wallace almost ended up in the priesthood)8) The battle of Stirling. During the filming, Mel was asked by a local why they did'nt film on the original site. Mel responded saying that he felt that the bridge would get in the way. Ay - said the local, That's what the English found....9) Who in reality betrayed Wallace? Sir John de Mentieth, one of his friends.This film could have been so much more, without losing ticket sales - never mind....."
Leofwine_draca,"Dec 13, 2015",10/10,"One of the early ""historical epics"" to set off a still-current wave of ancient adventures, this is epic, grand stuff spoiled only slightly by a twinge of Hollywoodian uneasiness and a little overloading of sentimentality. It isn't as bad as in something like, say, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES but it isn't mastered to the extent it was in GLADIATOR either. Although history is sometimes rewritten and distinctions are blurred, this is a moving masterpiece with a sweeping score and splendid visuals to boot.War is hell here, literally; bloody and violent, with limbs flying and bodies torn asunder. Yet for a film chock full of gruesome violence and obscene torture, it's remarkably good-natured, focusing on the characters foremost and being successful with it. Gibson is fine in the leading role – if a little too old – and the supporting cast are great. The plot is complex and wide-reaching and the characterisations and script are both spot on. A perfect blend of heroic escapism and back-stabbing politics, this is a modern classic of the genre and it proves Gibson's worth not as a star but as a director because his direction is exemplary."
kosmasp,"Jul 21, 2009",9/10,"Mel Gibson not only stars, but also directs one of the greatest historical movies, that have ever been made. While I'm not aware of the historical facts and what parts might be true or not, the appeal of the movie is undeniable.The mix of drama, action and sometimes humor, is perfect. The action scenes are shot great and the intense feeling of being right there, in the battlefield ensues. The movie follows through, from start to finish and movie deservedly got many awards. Be it the acting, the costume department or any other aspect of the film, if you like action movies and/or historical movies, there is absolutely no reason for you not to watch this!"
cgarman31,"Feb 9, 2007",10/10,"OK, so it was not 100% accurate in content or historical detail but that aside, it was one of the greatest films that has yet to be truly matched. The cast performed very well as this well written tale was told. Even though it is over 10 years old now, it still holds a place in my heart as one of the best. The accuracy of the battle scenes are only eclipsed by the expressions of the actors faces as they share this story. Stephen the Irishman steals the show with his plucky comic relief. Hamish the sidekick does a great job playing against the over the top performance of Mel Gibson. The predominantly European cast does a great job of not needing to fake accents and mannerisms. I have watched this film several times and every time I see something more special."

Sleepin_Dragon,"Jul 24, 2023",10/10,"William Wallace leads a rebellion against King Edward I of England.Is this the greatest historical movie of all time? It's surely a contender, it's one of my top twenty greatest films of all time.It's an incredible story from history, it's perfectly brought to life in a hugely credible and successful manner, it's almost as if you're there with them, witnessing the struggle first hand.In the hands of a lesser Director, this could easily have been a gore fest, and don't get me wrong it has its moments, but the balance between blood lust and story is perfect.The scale of this film is quite something, no wonder it is still loved by so many fans.The visuals are sublime, this is one incredible production, it looks phenomenal from start to finish. It's a long running time, but never at any point does it feel long or dull, it holds your attention from start to finish.The only criticism I ever had, there are some incredibly white teeth, I was asked to find a flaw, that was the only thing I could ever come up with, in every single aspect, this film delivers.It doesn't perhaps have the same sweeping score of a film such as Gladiator, but the music works incredibly well, it's subtle, and the film doesn't need heavy music.Mel Gibson has delivered for so many years, a multitude of incredible performances, for me though, I'll always consider this his greatest achievement."
balformatted,"Sep 17, 2003",2/10,"I was very surprised when this won the Oscars for best picture and director. It's a fairly standard action movie.  The battle scenes are gory but not very realistic -- somehow, long, drawn out affairs are over in about 15 minutes, the good guys are super killing machines, etc.Gibson is a good at playing cool, restrained characters like Mad Max, but not good at playing a romantic lead or inspiring leader -- he was trying to be Kirk Douglas in Spartacus, but ended more like Graham Chapman in Life of Brian.The entire portrayal of the agonized Robert Bruce was very dopey.The direction is flabby, and uncertain, the pacing off, and the costumes aren't even terribly interesting or authentic.Historical dramas tend to work best when they don't try to turn their stories toward universal truths, but focus on the characters and situations at hand.  Gibson tried to turn Braveheart into a rousing statement about honor! truth! passion! freedom! but ended up just parroting the standard Hollywood line."
Ewan54,"Mar 18, 2021",N/A,"An incredibly interesting story and many moments of rich dialogue Braveheart was film that not only kept you entertained but kept you feeling for the characters (This is mainly due to the directing and acting from Mel Gibson). The film really showed the true evil and good of the world (Which some films of good vs. Bad struggle to do). I don't think they ported the battles or William Wallace very well (It wasn't historically accurate). I think their use of humor in some scenes just felt out of place and while many people are against violence in movies I think for this film they easily could've had more to emphasize the brutality of the story. The score was fantastic one of the best I've heard it was fitting to the film it had a calming, Celtic and warming film yet you knew it was brutal. Hearing the score in my opinion was like looking at a battlefield after the battle it's quiet and its peaceful yet you know what really happened there. Overall it's a great film that I think most people should see the plot is great though some of it isn't true, the score is great and the ending is great (See for yourself)."
ma-cortes,"Feb 7, 2015",8/10,"In 14th Century Scotland, when his secret bride is executed for assaulting an English soldier who tried to rape her, William Wallace begins a revolt and leads Scottish warriors against the cruel English tyrant , the nasty ruler Edward I (Patrick McGoohan)the Longshanks (as he was called ""The Longshanks"" -long legs- since he was uncommonly tall for a man of the time , Edward I was at least 6 feet, 2 inches) who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself , ruling Scotland with an iron fist and succeeded his effeminate homosexual son Edward II Prince Edward (he was indeed the first English prince to carry the title Prince of Wales, although he did not marry Princess Isabella until 1308, after both Wallace (1305) and Edward I (1307) had died) . As William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all, along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. There took place several battles such as Stirling , York (though the sacking of York was invented for the movie ,Wallace never got as far south as York during his invasion of northern England) and the famous Battle of Falkirk (July 22, 1298), in which the English army was personally led by King Edward I, who decisively defeated the Scots , the real-life King Edward I was a military genius who learned combat tactics while fighting the Mamelukes during the Eighth and Ninth Crusades . There also appears Robert the Bruce , though many Scots were offended by the film's portrayal of Robert the Bruce (Angus McFayden) , who is considered a National Hero of Scotland .This epic movie contains thrills , emotion ,romance , breathtaking battles and being based on historical events . However , some reviewers often cited as the least accurate historical epic of all time and more than 90% of the movie is fiction. This is the classic story about confrontation between good guys , the Scots , versus bad guys , the Sassenachs . A simplistic and pure tale with rude stereotypes and offering a stew of Hollywood clichés , being overlong but well played and directed by Mel Gibson . Interesting script by Randall Wallace , this screen-writer had been visiting Edinburgh in 1983 to learn about his heritage when he came across a statue of William Wallace outside Edinburgh Castle; he had never heard of the 14th-century figure who shared his name but was intrigued enough by the stories told to him about ""Scotland's greatest hero"" to research the story as much as possible. The film was heavily fictitious but Gibson claimed the changes had been made for dramatic purposes , he also admitted he had always felt he was at least a decade too old to play Wallace. Impressive production design , including thousands of extras , a majority of the actors and extras in this film were actually Irish - members of the Irish Army - although they are supposed to be Scottish or English, as many as 1600 were used on a given day. The film is very crude and brutal , including bloody battles , strong tortures with disembowelment provoking brave grimace and violent scenes as when Edward I threw his son's lover out of a castle window was particularly criticized for inciting homophobia , the lover was based on Piers Gaveston, who was allegedly Edward II's lover. Colorful and glamorous cinematography by John Toll , showing marvelous outdoors , including glamorous opening shots , snowy peaks , silvery lochs , dark mists and many other things . Evocative and sensitive musical score by James Horner ; despite the film being set in Scotland, and based on the life of a Scottish folk hero, the primary instrument heard throughout the soundtrack -most notably at William's father's funeral- are the Uilleann pipes, which are a smaller traditionally Irish version of bagpipes rather than the ubiquitous Great Highland Bagpipe.This motion picture was very well directed by Mel Gibson and he picked up two Oscars for Best Film and Best Director ; though this film has been accused of promoting Anglophobia. Mel said that was influenced by various classic and historical flicks , among the films Gibson watched in order to prepare to direct ""Braveheart"" were Polanski's ""Macbeth,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Chimes at Midnight,"" ""Alexander Nevsky,"" ""A Man for All Seasons,"" ""The Lion in Winter,"" ""Seven Samurai,"" and ""Throne of Blood"" . Rating : Better than average. Worthwhile watching . The picture will appeal to Mel Gibson fans ."
calcheesmo,"Jul 18, 2006",10/10,"Personally, this is my favorite movie of all time. I'm not going to ramble on and on about this movie...I'll just lay it on the line for you. It's great. Most importantly, it has a little bit of everything.In my mind, it's the ultimate movie, it has all aspects of humans. Violence, courage, betrayal, love, death, comedy, it has it all. It's more action based than anything, but there is a love plot and friendship plots and everything. All in all, it's a very deep and touching movie with large amounts of killing.If you like action movies or just great movies in general, then definitely check this out, it shouldn't disappoint."
mmozaffari,"Oct 29, 2023",10/10,"An enduring epic story
A film that is free for every person and every person who is concerned about happiness, growth and excellence should watch this masterpiece.It may always fail, get killed and die in the right appearance, but the blood is holy and it finally wins over blackness and oppression, and this movie expresses this truth.This movie is always fresh and new with its dialogues
I have watched it many times since I was 10 years old, and I have practiced epic and bravery with its unique song.For me, who lives in the Middle East, this story is a bit repetitive, because the history of my country is full of epics and arrogance, and when I see that epics and efforts to save our countrymen are sacred everywhere in the world, my hope for the future of human life increases, we are not supposed to destroy the world. Let's blacken each other, but we are going to establish the best kind of human life on earth one day."
pjseverino,"Nov 17, 2019",10/10,"What can I say... The soundtrack in itself is a masterpiece. The story, from the very beginning to the last second it's told in a way you cannot quantify by words.. And it just gets better and better the more times you watch it.There is love, friendship, trust, betrayal, sadness, laughter... You can't stop but feel you are in a journey from which you don't want to get out of.Well done Mel Gibson and thank you for the amazing care taken into producing this beautiful film."
spout-2,"Dec 16, 1998",10/10,"This True Story of William Wallace has inspired millions of people around the world. This movie has everything on the surface for people who just want to see a great flick, your romance, your violence, humor, you name it. But for others with a deep sense of reality with a more open mindedness, this movie captures them. It grabs hold and doesn't let go. I've personally seen it over 45 times (and it's a 3 hour movie). It inspired us to go to Scotland and visit the places where it all really happened. Ignoring the lack of money, fear of flight, no support from parents, we had to go! Braveheart is THAT powerful."
belroth,"Sep 22, 2000",1/10,"Honestly, it's not that good. It's too long, too trite, too formulaic and too revisionist.Wallace WAS seven feet tall (more or less), but as far as I can tell he was a racist thug - the film conveniently skips over the fact that he had an argument with an Englishman who he murdered, along with five or six others, and then ran away. So much for 'Freedom'. More like ""I can't control my temper and the English are after me,so I'd better get some help"". He was about as popular with the Scots nobles as he was with the English. Oh, and he wasn't a peasant either.Anyone saying ""it's only a movie""-well read how many comments are praising this film for its historical accuracy. I can take historical fantasy, most ""Robin Hood"" films for instance, but not when they're touted as 'accurate'."
Idaho-2,"Nov 10, 1998",10/10,"For sure it's my favorite movie. The picture and music are perfect. I saw the movie twice at the theater, I've rented it and I've bought it. I saw the movie 20 times and I'm still enjoying it. The battles are greats. My only deception is that I can't jump into the movie to help Wallace kick some english's butts. This movie is marvellous."

Intentionally and unintentionally it was simply emotional in the ending when he say freedom and see his wife after his death its to touching..i.e it is magnificent, visually emotional and so touching i will always remember this name WILLIAM WALLACE::"
SnoopyStyle,"Jan 8, 2014",8/10,"William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is the son of a minor landowner who was killed by Longshanks' treachery. He would start a revolt after his secret wife was executed unjustly. The revolt would grow to an all out war against the tyrannical king of England.Director Mel Gibson is pulling all the stops to create this epic historical melodrama. It is rip roaring fun. The action is blood splattering joy. The scale of the battles are actually quite impressive with real people. It's the kind of sword swinging that every boy dreams of playing. The story is full of melodrama starting with avenging his great love, to a romance with a princess. Historical accuracy is unnecessary when it's so much fun. It taps into all of the archetypes of heroes and villains putting them into a compelling historical drama."
urban-31,"Jun 30, 2006",10/10,I think Braveheart Is the best movie ever made. It has a unique story cast and crew.But what made it so good and emotional was the beautiful music to describe the feelings and energy that went on in each time. I think that the music in Braveheart is the best i have ever heard in theater. I have seen many films in my time and this one has not only given me entertainment but inspiration to do things. Mel Gibson will always be William Wallace to me. He is a brilliant actor as well as a director and i think that in Braveheart he did the best anyone could ever do. It keeps you exited as well as overwhelmed with grief over the things that William went through and the legend he grew into. It's a movie of honor and a story about a man who stood for the things he believed in and never went down. Although the justice was not served freedom was.
kevin_robbins,"Oct 29, 2023",10/10,"I recently revisited Braveheart (1995) on Max. The storyline revolves around a Scottish warrior who's had enough of weak leadership and the oppression imposed on his fellow countrymen by the King of England. He takes it upon himself to lead a rebellion against seemingly insurmountable odds, hoping to inspire his leaders and fellow Scots to stand up for their rightful freedom.Directed by and starring Mel Gibson (The Man Without a Face), the film also features Brian Cox (Succession), Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later), James Cosmo (Highlander), Sophie Marceau (The World Is Not Enough), Angus McFadyen (Equilibrium) and Alun Armstrong (Krull).Every aspect of Braveheart is pure cinematic magic. The cast and settings are perfectly chosen, immersing the audience in the unfolding events. The costumes and props align seamlessly with the film's premise, bringing the scenes to life. The action sequences are stunning, striking a balance between intensity, humor, and gore. The well-written storyline offers both great epic elements and meaningful subplots. The dialogue is lighthearted and effectively paces the movie. The ending is a masterstroke, blending sadness, warmth, and triumph. There's nothing I would change about this film.In conclusion, Braveheart is a unique revolutionary movie that delivers everything an audience could hope for: action, a compelling hero, a detestable villain, and a touch of love. I would confidently rate it a perfect 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
wwwfakephonenumbernet,"Mar 4, 2016",7/10,"My point is which group of villains rule over a country could not interest me in the least. Where on earth do you imagine all this iniquity flows from? Human Nature, good luck improving it. The glorification of the Scots and the concomitant delineation of the English as Satan's imps, forgive me, speaks more to Mel being an Australian than to historical veracity. There is this unrelenting demonetizing of the English right out of a comic book. The Lords Of The Congregation who ruled over Scotland, for a time, were not renowned for their heavenly saintliness towards papists. This is the other problem the movie's deep sense of historical unreality about it. You feel right away that you are getting a parallax view, a very biased one sided picture."
byght,"Sep 24, 2004",5/10,"Why this passable but completely forgettable film has apparently garnered a reputation as a classic in the last decade is beyond me. There's really not much to write home about here.There's no complexity or levels or anything, just good vs. evil, fight fight fight, freedom freedom freedom. Gibson, of course, is as limited an actor as he's ever been. His corny pre-battle speeches have become wildly popular, to the point where you might be fooled into thinking they constitute great moments in cinema, but in actuality they're somewhere above Bill Pullman in ""Independence Day"" and below Al Pacino in ""Any Given Sunday"" on the scale of dramatic pep talks. And in case you're wondering, no, that's not a prestigious slot to be in.I'm not trying to say it's unwatchable like ""The Patriot"" or anything--it's OK. Probably about as good as, say, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."" But I don't think anyone who's seen a real epic with real actors would consider it anything special. This is a classic example of how the Oscars can inflate the reputation of undeserving movies in weak years (see also, ""Gladiator, The"")."
baturkaganozak,"Nov 2, 2023",8/10,"The film effectively transports the viewers to the atmosphere and historical details of 13th-century Scotland. Mel Gibson's acting and directing make the film even more captivating. Additionally, James Horner's film score adds to the emotional intensity.""Braveheart"" is known for its battle scenes, especially the epic confrontations between the Scots led by William Wallace and the English. These scenes provide unforgettable moments with stunning visual effects and action.However, the film tends to play with history and deviates from some historical facts. The real-life of William Wallace might not have been as romanticized as portrayed in the film. Additionally, the Scottish independence war and the motivations of the characters are somewhat dramatized."
ditty-61563,"Jan 9, 2022",10/10,"It took me years to watch this film, but when I finally did I was amazed! It is definitely a legendary classic and arguably Mel Gibson's best film! The story is remarkable and the does not disappoint!"
tomas_koszeghy,"Nov 8, 2004",10/10,"It has it's reason, that I'm writing my first comment about this movie: I was 9 when I saw the Braveheart for the first time- now I'm 17,and I still like it. Why? I think everybody who saw this movie knows whether he like it not; I just want to say some words about that.The movie is not just about showing the lifestyle in the 13th century; not just about showing the pain...-how much does it hurt, how hard is it to take,when something happens to our love, when we can do nothing to help her when she is dying; how cruel is to fight a war; how BRAVE it is to stand the torture-it's not just about these things...What we can see in the movie,or what we can FEEL the feeling inside our heart, how are we just falling apart when we are watching it,just watching the people dying for FREEDOM. We can be there,stand in the middle of the battlefield and feel the warm blood in our face and passion in our soul,because we are fighting for our homeland. We see the pain in the eyes of our friends, who are watching us dying....and the last word...FREEDOM. Everything what's important in the movie is inside that one single word,all the feelings; everything.In the last battle,in the end of the movie we cannot even sit in our chair.We need to stand up,or do something with our hands (we are just so excited) ,because we haven't seen the movie yet but we can feel it, feel the incredible power of people who want to be free,and we know who's going to win the battle.That the reason why I like that movie so much. It makes you FEEL."
gnperuti,"May 26, 2025",9/10,"Mel Gibson can't seem to catch a break when it comes to movies that are based on history, can he? Every time he makes one, they tend to take massive liberties with the facts. This film is no exception; however, as so little is known about the real William Wallace, you could argue it's based more on the legends surrounding the man than the truth. They even acknowledge it through characters in the film talking about the many myths surrounding him. All that aside, the film is a blast to watch. It's extremely well written and moves at a reasonable pace for a film almost three hours long. There are plenty of great lines, too.Gibson is about as capable of a Scottish accent as Keanu Reeves is of an English one. It's laughably overly exaggerated to the point of goofy, especially when he acts alongside actual Scots, or even actors who can actually do a decent accent, like Brendan Gleeson. But, embarrassing accent aside, this is still a great performance. He plays Wallace as he should be: a brutal, savage, yet intelligent man with charm to spare. It's easy to believe he could bring people to his cause. The rest of the cast is great too. Sophie Marceau plays a very complex and charming female lead. Patrick McGoohan is terrifying ad the ruthless English King. And Angus McFayden is likeable and manages to make us believe his eventual turn to Wallace's side.As good an actor as Gibson is, he's an even better director, and this film is easily his crowning achievement. Scotland looks gorgeous, at least the scenes that were actually shot there. And to the film's credit, I honestly can't tell the difference, though that may be because I've never been there. The sets and costumes may not be historically accurate, but they all look great. The music by the legendary James Horner is wonderful and has a feel to it that suits the setting. And the battle scenes are brutal, massive, and full of fantastic choreography.Overall, Braveheart is yet another film based on a true story that proves they don't have to be accurate to be good. It may not have deserved Best Picture (it should've been Apollo 13), but it still stands as one of the last true great Hollywood epics."
AshleyO-699,"Dec 5, 2025",9/10,"This movie will be and should be looked at only in one context, as a incredible piece of filmmaking. As a honest depiction of true historical events? Well, room for improvement is a understatement, I think the only fact it gets right is in summary that William Wallace was in fact Scottish, almost everything else is fabrication.But watch it and enjoy it for just being a movie. And what a terrific movie it is. Mel Gibson is incredible both on camera and behind the camera. I will say arguably it has some of, if not the greatest battle scenes filmed on camera, so even if your not a fan of the drama, any action junkies out there will absolutely love the battle scenes, that are loud, expansive and incredibly brutal.But I love the very fabricated story as a whole, pure Hollywood fiction at it's finest. American actor Mel Gibson gives one of his greatest performances as Scot legend William Wallace, I read that some are critical of his Scottish accent, personally, I noticed it early on but I became so engrossed in the picture that it never became a distraction or a problem. Accents aside, Mel professionally balances a patriotic and vengeful Wallace at ease.It's a epic sized movie that has the perfect balance of drama and action. And confessions from a man closing in on becoming middle aged, I still find the ending to be one of the most emotional moments in cinema.I also have to praise the score from James Horner which has to be one of the most beautifully orchestrated pieces of music in cinema. Another confession, I actually listen to the music when going to bed as it relaxes me through insomnia episodes. I will acknowledge as a keen ear may observe, some of the score is very similar to another Horner constructed score, that of Titanic. But I enjoyed it nevertheless.My only criticisms, and I really only have two. I wasn't the biggest fan of Sophie Marceau's performance or character Isabelle, I actually found the character unnecessary. And up until the movie's terrific memorable climax the movie's pacing had started to drag out a bit and decline in quality.But as a whole, I think arguably, that yes it's a long movie, but absolutely one of the most memorable movies in the last 50 years. Incredible."
MGraversen,"Oct 3, 2015",7/10,"I can somewhat forgive the movie for being considered the most inaccurate historical blockbuster ever made. Without even knowing this while watching the movie, I couldn't help feeling that 40-something Mel Gibson was close to 20 years older than the 20-something young buck he was supposed to portray.It's also a very cheap shot to make the enemy so incredible evil, with the whole hanging children, killing innocents, and raping wives (Prima nocte: which for the record never happened), so we don't mind when they brutally kill them however they like Moreover, what's with the whole homophobic and womanizing explicit scenes of the movie?It's clearly overreaching at times, yet is still has its moments and it's at times artful in its brutality."

Some say it is historically inaccurate, yet there are many historians who say otherwise. The one major flaw is that everyone has perfect white teeth, but hey it's Hollywood. There are only a couple reasons why you might not enjoy this movie....You don't like Mel Gibson, which causes you to be unable to look past how you feel about him and focus on one of the finest jobs ever done. Just watch the scene in which he discovers that Robert The Bruce had betrayed him. Another reason why you might not like the film is that you have actually never seen it or haven't seen the whole film. And finally you cant get passed the gore because you have a weak stomach. Please just watch the movie with an open mind and you'll see the greatest movie of all time."
anonreviewer,"Feb 1, 2005",7/10,"This movie is a well made and rousing movie. It is a gritty movie.And it taps deeply into the Scots-Irish socio-political background of America. And I would know--I am an American of mostly Scots-Irish descent.The Scots-Irish socio-politics is maybe the biggest single problem with America, and the biggest problem with the world, at least right now.There is a massive reservoir of cultural stupidity in the Scots-Irish culture. You can see it ALL OVER this movie. It is central to this movie. What it is, is the idea that fighting and dying for this ephemeral concept, freedom, is a Good Thing. What a sad sad idea that really is. Better to live and sabotage and fight a low profile cultural fight, rather than fight and die as they did in this movie.Unfortunately, the Scots Irish has bought into this fantasy time and time again. But throughout history, it has never been the brave warrior-patriot-citizen who has exhorted the Scots-Irish and the American people to war for fight for ""freedom."" No, indeedy. Instead, it has been the rich, the powerful, and the corporations who have used this subterfuge in order to persuade the SCots Irish to fight and die. Corporate profits and more riches and estates for the wealthy have almost always been disguised as ""freedom."" Those Scots Irish wound up immigrating to America, and now they form the base of the Republican party. And now we have yet another faux warrior-patriot-citizen in George Bush, exhorting the Scots Irish to die for freedom. And once again, they are falling for the manipulation.

One of the most successful aspects of this film is composed of scenes of extraordinarily well synchronized and arranged battle involving thousands of participants. Filmed in impressive fashion, with a touching story and wonderful performances by the entire cast, this masterpiece of Gibson became a colossal epic winner of numerous awards (Oscar included). ""Braveheart"" is even better and more epic succeeded in living memory in the history of cinema. Anyway, in my opinion ""Braveheart"" is the most complete epic film in living memory and those who have not seen it, do not know what you're missing!"
anakatta,"Nov 11, 2024",10/10,"This is probably my first public review of the film.I won't write much because I don't see the need for it.I want to start with the fact that I saw this film for the first time when I was 10 years old and at that age it impressed me.The film is ideal in all respects, both in terms of the plot and in terms of direction (Mell Gibson deserves special praise both as an actor and as a director), also the setting of those times is also top notch and most importantly everything was filmed on real territory and in real rooms, no computer graphics.I would say it's a classic of all times and centuries."
nytemare,"Nov 1, 2004",9/10,"Review: This is one of those types of movies which will give you the 'good goosebump' feeling after watching it. It's a typical epic that details a certain hero fighting against all odds for freedom of his/her country. Although the story is pretty typical, its ability to entrance you in it is not. Not many movies are able to accomplish this. Mixed with a powerful musical score (which also won Best Score at Academy Awards for information sake), the movie delivers an amazing experience to viewers satisfying epic lovers, and action seekers. Acting by Mel Gibson is spectacularly superb (he has an edge since he IS partly Scottish). It loses 0.5 points however due to the constant playing of the musical score in some situations which do not seem to fit well with it. What many people complain about is that it is historically inaccurate, I don't remember this movie being brandished with a ""True historical story"" or even a ""Based on a true story"" logo. Watch it for the 'good goosebump' feeling.9.5/10 - Freeeeeeeeeeeedom!!!!!!"
KatieScarlettButler,"Mar 10, 2006",10/10,"favouritist film ever in the whole world ever! There is blatant disregard for historical accuracy here, which would normally wind me up, but the sheer scale of the film makes up for it.It is gorgeously written, beautifully directed, and magnificently acted. So there. I'm not entirely sure there's much else I can say! Only there's something for everyone; action, romance, drama, even some humour. I've never met anyone who isn't a fan of the film!One last thing, James Horner's music is stunning. I've got the CD, and it's an excellent investment, even if you don't like the film (something I highly doubt!!)"
hasta,"Oct 30, 1998",N/A,"Despite taking certain liberties with historical accuracy, Mel Gibson, that cheeky Australian chappy has created a wonderfully powerful film, full of thunder and passion.  The haunting score by James Horner is a knock out. Well done all"
osterfelder,"Mar 26, 2015",7/10,"I have no problem with the film as entertainment, what I object to is how the film was used by the SNP in the recent referendum, to condemn the English out of hand:I should like readers to know that it was Norman-ruled England led by Edward 1 of the Norman line of succession to the throne, that inflicted injustices on Scotland. The English(Anglo-Saxons) before then, had little desire to rule Scotland, yet to the present day it is the England of today that is subject to the vitriolic hatred from the Scots. These attacks are then misguided, by reason of their original premise, that Edward was as English as Churchill. In movies it is artistic License, in politics it is false accusations and fomenting of trouble by inaccuracies and this is dangerous folly!"
CinemaSerf,"Aug 27, 2023",7/10,"I am afraid that as a Scotsman, I had way more problem with the factual elements of this than perhaps I ought to have had. We have this history drummed into us as bairns, and so when a grand-scale depiction like this comes along, I excitedly expected more. It doesn't matter a jot that the eponymous Mel Gibson isn't a Scot - that is the acting equivalent of a red herring. What matters is that the story is largely a work of fiction. Gory, beautiful, authentic looking, certainly - but fiction nonetheless. Taken on that basis, then, it is still an entertaining mediaeval drama depicting the struggle of the king-less Scots against the oppression of England's King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Using a panoply of familiar faces, it gradually demonstrates the brutality of the English over these vassals, and introduces us to ""William Wallace"" (Gibson) who is one of the few who wishes to fight back. The killing of his wife at the hands of his local magistrate (Malcolm Tierney) is the last straw, and soon he is working with his kinsman Argyle (Brian Cox) to formulate a plan. What now ensues is a well produced, stylishly filmed drama offering us plenty of scheming and plotting and some seriously gory battle scenes before it all culminates in the unavoidable denouement. It takes it's time to get underway, but once it is up and running it is well paced, there is a minimum of romance, plenty of swordplay and lots of unadulterated freedom-fighter jingoism. Why not? It is a film about a man who fought for the freedom of his people against the tyranny of an interloper, and is effective at that. The historical timelines are a bit all over the place, as are many of the characterisations, but again that's another matter of fact that we have had to ditch at the opening titles. ""Braveheart"" is exciting, fast-moving and bloody - just what it is meant to be, and for that Gibson ought to be commended. Just a shame it couldn't be just bit more rooted in fact."
matthewpr06,"Apr 15, 2008",1/10,"watched Braveheart for the first time in many years recently and it's fair to say that I was genuinely surprised by how utterly and irredeemably bad this movie actually is. If you need reminding it won a whole host of Oscars way back in 1995 (including Best Picture).I'm not a fan of Mel Gibson, not just because he hates me, but because he really doesn't float my boat in a dramatic sense. I think Braveheart is a really good film to highlight his chronic lack of on screen charisma and the notable absence of any real acting ability (that doesn't involve looking solemn or crazy). His performance in this movie is almost a parody, at points I felt like I was watching something from the people who made the likes of Date Movie etc. (which incidentally is probably a better movie than Braveheart!).Mel's lack of charisma and ability are just two of the reasons I dislike this movie. There are however many other reasons. Firstly we are supposed to accept that it is perfectly fine for William Wallace to express indifference at the English occupation so long as his wife is with him. When wifey has her throat slit by an evil Englishman (more on them later) suddenly Wallace catches the highly infectious 'freedom at any cost' disease. He gets rival factions of Scottish tribes together and with no real chance of victory, he murders the English and drags his countrymen into a evidently and ultimately futile war in which thousands will perish and all to avenge the death of his wife; whose memory he abandons/desecrates half way through the movie when he sleeps with Princess Isabelle (who of course finds his ruggedness irresistible).Wallace is portrayed first as an abject coward unwilling to oppose oppression and then as a selfish madman who gets off on butchering people with a large variety of obtusely shaped metal objects, and finally as a man-whore who can't keep his genitals concealed under his kilt for more than 5 minutes. And we are supposed to believe this man is a hero and that his acts are heroic? Come on!Now I'm not really that fussy when it comes to historical inaccuracies in Hollywood movies; however I think artistic license is probably taken a little to far in this movie, particularly when every English character is represented as an inept, bloodthirsty, paganistic murderer and every Celt as a loyal, rugged, family orientated, God-fearing freedom fighter. Also Gibson, as director, seems to present, with the Prince Edward character, homosexuality as either a) a weakness or b) as being part of a type of madness. Seriously, this is straight from the Rambo textbook of social and geo-political representation. In other words; the complex Anglo-Celtic relationship is dumbed down so much that it becomes a laughable parody of a serious and interesting subject.On a technical level Braveheart also falls foul of anything resembling a coherent narrative structure. As I have mentioned, Wallace's motivations are at the very least muddled, at worst incompressible. One event (usually a big battle or a shot of Mel's arse, or Mel stood on a mountain, or Mel holding a sword, or Mel giving a monologue about those pesky Jews, sorry English) leads to another with no real logical progression or explanation or fathomable reasoning. It's like watching a movie with every other scene missing.Overall, I would love for someone to explain to me why they like this movie because I'm totally baffled as to why anyone would."
pouyan-arephpoor,"Nov 14, 2025",10/10,"First of all you there will never be such movies because we dont have ""James Horner"" anymore!One fantastic thing about this film is that the story is nothing creative or itself, it is not something to give a good movie and this is when you realize how the cast and crew were that good to make it something this good to watch.It is that good that even if someone spoils the whole movie for you, you can still watch it and enjoy.In short, if someone asks ""What's the best movie ever, everything considered?"" My answer is ""Braveheart""."
Alanfrize,"Jun 22, 2004",N/A,"Complete and utter dross. The film decides to bypass the actual story, and go along with some made-up rubbish that Randall Wallace came out with. It's interesting to note that the film originally hired Professor Tom Devine of Glasgow University as the historical consultant, but then sacked him because his version of what happened (based upon the facts) was completely different to what Randall Wallace was spouting.As to the film itself, Mel Gibson's accent is execrable, and that's just the start. Other problems occur - the Scots wear Woad and tartan - the earliest recorded wearing of tartan is in 1595. Woad had disappeared not long after the Roman invasion, over 1,000 years earlier. They also wouldn't have had the plaids or Great Kilts - these don't appear until the latter years of the 16th century.The film takes more liberties with historical fact than is good. The battle of Stirling Brdge is moved onto land without the Bridge in sight. At the end Robert the Bruce throws William Wallaces' sword onto the field, and Scots charge in. Yet Wallace had introduced the use of 'Schiltrons', which were huge blocks of spear men, and which were instrumental in Scottish victory at Bannockburn.All in all, terrible. If you want a good film about Scottish history, watch Rob Roy with Liam Neeson. While it has many mistakes, it doesn't try to portray itself as fact."
ketekete,"Aug 28, 2019",9/10,I truly love this film it's one of the best the acting the story and the beautiful soundtrack is all on point i recommend this movie to any one please watch it it's one of the few films that I wish I can lose my memory just to watch it again
gavin6942,"Mar 21, 2010",7/10,"William Wallace loses his father at a young age. After going away for a while, he returns (now as Mel Gibson) to raise a family. That dream quickly comes to an end when his wife is assaulted and killed by English soldiers. He becomes a patriot in a romantic rage, not resting until England gets its boots off the throat of Scotland.Historian Sharon Krossa notes that Scotsmen did not wear kilts at this time, saying that this is akin to ""a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits"" and further that ""The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate -- in short, just about nothing is accurate""... which more or less sums up my primary complaint about this film.I enjoyed it as a story about an oppressed people rising up against their masters, even if it didn't really have any basis in reality. I was a bit confused about Gibson as Wallace, with hair styled by the same person who helps Dog the Bounty Hunter. And I'm not sure how this received ""Best Picture"" or ""Best Director"". I do not think it's a bad film or bad direction, but I have to believe the other films this year must have been considered pretty bad for Mel Gibson to enter the list of legends and giants. I would say, for example, that ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" is a better film.I had the film presented to me as ""chick flick"", and I can see that. Despite the violence and political message (about freedom and independence and nationalism), the underlying theme is that Wallace loved his wife and fights in her honor... though he doesn't really take issue with hooking up with his enemy's wife. I guess two wrongs make a right?I see this film as a bridge between ""Spartacus"" and ""300"", as a story of a small number of people fighting against a much larger enemy. Like Spartacus, Wallace is to some extent a slave. Like the Spartans, the Scots have everything against them when fighting the English. Despite the parallels, the sad fact is that ""Spartacus"" is the best film, and ""300"" the least... seems that uprising films are becoming less grand."
General Comment,"Jul 8, 2000",3/10,"Several people recommended this film to me and I was looking forward to watching it. But I was disappointed.For a start, I found it difficult to take the hero seriously. That wasn't William Wallace fighting English tyranny. It was Mel Gibson. The film had ""Made in Hollywood"" stamped all over it, taking crowd pleasing liberties with the historical truth. Crowd pleasing liberties can be forgiven sometimes, but these were just so, well, *corny* is the word that springs to mind.Good battle scenes though, and the evil king played a good part. But I wouldn't watch it again."
bengal,"Dec 6, 1998",10/10,"I will never forget the look on Gibson's face after the first losing battle.  This movie can reach out and touch someone.  I don't know if I've seen any movie as many times as this one.  If you never see any other movie, see this one.  It is one of the greatest of all time."
RossRivero99,"Apr 26, 2014",10/10,"Mel Gibson's Braveheart is a powerful historical epic that tells the story of a man named William Wallace and how he fought for the freedom of Scotland. The movie stars Mel Gibson as Wallace a man who was devoted to his country's natural rights. Director and star Mel Gibson really knows the history behind how Scotland got their independence from England, this movie has a similar story to Gandhi by Richard Attenborough in which both of those films had only one thing in common both Scotland and India wanted independence from England but in different centuries. What Mel Gibson tries to teach us from this film is how much of a hero that William Wallace was in real life at the time he was alive. Also the musical score by James Horner was just plain perfect for the movie itself. Also the movie compares to epic historical masterpieces like Schindler's List, Lincoln,Gandhi,Saving Private Ryan, The Great Escape, and many more.A Definite A+"
crescipeter,"Jun 19, 2024",10/10,"Mel Gibson's Braveheart is in my opinion one of the best movies ever made. The first thing I can say is that the movie was extremely inspiring, whether the story was 100% accurate or not if you take it as it is, the story is inspiring. It is also action packed and still to this day 29 years later it still holds up action wise.The movie is also shot beautiful the cinematic feel of the movie is better than 99% of what is being put out today this movie just screams cinematic in all aspects. The best part of the movie for me is how moving it was. I have never been more moved by a movie, when it was over I was speechless and Just sat there taking it all in. The amount of emotion that was captured through the story and actors left me moved and it touched my heart. I highly recommend it and even if it doesn't become your favorite movie you can still watch it and appreciate an amazingly made film!"
salvation-1,"Jan 7, 2008",10/10,"This movie is the best movie I have ever seen.It's a combination of several things that made this movie so epic for me. First of all, the uniqueness of the story is what made me love seeing this movie over and over. The story of William Wallace has got to be the most heroic and captivating story I have ever seen. What amazed me is how from the beginning to the end, William Wallace fought for his freedom and for his love. He yearned for a peaceful life after years of war and misery, yet this wasn't a path that had been set out for him.This is all wonderfully brought into picture by Mel Gibson, who was the perfect match for a character such as William Wallace. The music in this movie has yet to be beat by any other score in another movie. It really makes you feel the atmosphere of Scotland in the brutal age this movie was set in. The combination of the breathtaking music, the Scottish highlands (Irish, Scottish, who notices the difference? :D) and the epic battle scenes are one of the best things in this movie. I also think the character playing Longshanks deserves an honorable mention, he was just utterly fantastic in this movie.All in all, if you haven't seen Braveheart, I suggest you order the DVD, because you will be wanting to see it over and over again."
dk777,"Feb 17, 2021",10/10,"A visually impressive film filled with interesting characters and spectacular battles.A tense and interesting story with a great cast that perfectly portrays these striking characters. Mel Gibson excelled as an actor and director in this epic historical story. The violence is brutal and realistic, as it should be in a film like this, and it evokes the cruelty of that time.Randall Wallace wrote an interesting screenplay, and Mel Gibson brilliantly transferred it to the movie screen.The characters are interesting, and the cast portrayed them superbly. The battles are spectacular, and Mel Gibson has proven to be an excellent director.The actors are excellent, and I was especially impressed by Angus Macfadyen in the role of Robert the Bruce, he brilliantly portrayed the emotions and inner struggle of this interesting character. The film evokes universal values, sacrifice, courage, love and the desire for freedom.The details are great, the cinematography is excellent, and the film is masterfully directed.A visually impressive epic story that gets better with each viewing."
Corky1984,"Jun 10, 2005",N/A,"Mel Gibson has an awful lot to answer for. Braveheart is despicable tosh that distorts historical truth beyond all decent conventions. So much in this film is a lie that the uneducated masses with no previous knowledge of the period will believe something that just didn't happen. There is so much that is inaccurate in Braveheart that I shall only mention a few key errors, all of them unforgivable. For a start William Wallace and Edward I did not die at the same time, as is implied, in fact Edward died a couple of years later! Also, Willy Wallace certainly did not father the future Edward III that is also alluded to. The English thrashed the Scots in 1298, but in this film it appears that the Scots put up more of a fight. Wallace certainly did not fight with Robert the Bruce after the battle either! Gibson distorts the truth to satisfy his rabid anti-English opinions. The man is a bigoted idiot with no respect for history. Moving on to the film itself, there are a few so-so battle scenes, but the rest of the film is essentially false junk. The dialogue is ponderous and moronic, whilst the first hour is utterly soul destroying so boring is it. There is a nice scene when Edward I throws a chap out of a window, but if that's the highlight of a film you know there are problems! People should not be taken in by this rubbish. Had Edward I survived a little longer in reality he stood a good chance of conquering Scotland so weak was the Bruce dynasty. Anyway, avoid this movie, it is nothing but anti-English propaganda!!!"
scotsexile13,"Nov 3, 2006",7/10,"Great romp with a hilarious take on reality  but where's the bridge Mel???? Mel's accent is funnier than this acting - lethal weapon 1297 Cosmo well hey he's great at playing Cosmo and woad a millennia after the Pict sensational.A major gripe more than the lack of the bridge is the total absence of the real 'boys own' hero of the time Andrew Moray, (Murray as you may want to write it)On the real funny side - to see the aftermath of the film just get down to Edinburgh airport when you get a flight of yanks  even a decade on there are still American 'Scats' wondering around in ill fitting kilts packing their cases with Malts and Iron Bru chews - However this is a great romp and as far a totally inaccurate historic films go, leave Alexander on the shelf, check you brain at the doors and grab a few ODIs."
Quinoa1984,"Apr 28, 2000",9/10,"It was too much to take in upon first trying to watch Braveheart when I was younger. It's story is not terribly complicated, in fact it almost resembles (when taking it out historical context, which is not completely accurate to the film anyway) a 13th century Scottish version of the Mad Max series- Wallace's wife gets killed by the English, he gets revenge, and then some; he faces off in battles to finally gain freedom for Scotland. Clad in blue make-up, using his ""they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"" speech, charging ahead, and getting into a truly bloody battle that is only rivaled in 90s war/epic movie-making by Saving Private Ryan, this was what I remembered most from Braveheart when also first writing my comments. Seeing it today it's a totally different experience, as taking in the story it's very well told, with excellent performances that emphasize- unlike in Gibson's Passion of the Christ- that he can really get belief out of melodramatic performances. And when he does get his cameras up into the nitty gritty of violent confrontations, be them small (when he first takes his vengeance on the British after his wife's slaughtered, which itself is a very powerful scene) or large (previously mentioned battle), it's with a vitality and viciousness that rarely gets into Hollywood productions. There are even moments of fun (flashing the British, to 'kiss arse') and close-to-poetry (Wallace's death). It's a handsomely done work that should stand the test of time in Gibson's oeuvre. One of the best films of 1995."
RubenMovies,"Jul 26, 2022",6/10,"The film is ok, after watching it I just checked the accuracy which is far from the real story other then the ending.Whist the characters are real, they aren't correct in the timeline. So then I will judge it as a fairytale based on true events, like Pocahontas. And for that it did ok.Acting is ok, but the plot is meh. It's just not as interesting as a movie as for example Game of Thrones. One of those stories that could do with a modern day version but this time much more accurate to the source material The film has some violent scenes in it but it still feel like it is glossing over event and not working with enough characters.A solid 6."
m.cordell,"Jun 4, 2000",1/10,"Mel Gibson, instead of stirring up trouble in the UK, should instead go back to his own country and perhaps make a film about Aboriginal oppression and their struggle for land rights. The Americans love this movie because it is a simplistic and factually incorrect representation of freedom fighting that they think fits in with their own struggle against the British. Why are we always the bad guys?Britain abolished slavery before America, Britian has the oldest democracy in the world, yet we always represent the evil West so the Americans dont feel guilt. Anyway, onto the film... Factual inconsistencies: The English king outlived William Wallace and the Queen only gave birth YEARS after Wallace died. The portrayal of the homosexual prince as weak and incompetent is completely offensive and probably inspired by Gibson's sense of machismo. The homosexual men of the Roman Empire were weak, weren't they? No, no they were not. Much is made of English cruelty but when the Scots sack York no mention is made of English suffering in the film. The fact is, life in those times was cruel, and the Scots would gladly have enslaved the English if they ever got the chance (Mary Queen of Scots, anyone?) This film is over-sentimental, predictable and depressingly obvious. I gave it 1 out of 10 and was thoroughly bored when watching it."
joiningjt,"Jan 2, 2021",10/10,"This is a movie that no matter how many times you watch it you still get fired up and emotions are at full tilt!! Every actor was phenomenal and how it didnt get oscar nods for best actor and best supporting actor is a travesty, Brendan Gleason was easily a winner, so was mel Gibson he was portraying a legend who was much bigger in stature and larger than life itself yet mr Gibson pulls it off with ease. He should have been nominated for best actor but as always the case with the political Oscar's this movie got ripped off. They knew they had no choice but to give it best picture and director but it deserved more. With out a doubt in the top 10 best movies ever made!!!!!!!!"
Beernuts,"Oct 7, 1998",10/10,"As all the other comments here have pretty much said how I feel I will instead just draw attention to what I consider to be the best sequence of the film: when Wallace rides into town in slo-mo to avenge his wife. This is without doubt one of the finest examples of mounting tension ever, combining perfect use of heightened sound, slo-mo, rising music and great acting: Gibson looks absolutely without emotion as he stares at the first soldier and then kills him. From there the film doesn't let up. Yep, I love it! For once the Academy were right......"
vanhail,"Apr 10, 2006",9/10,"Around 700 years ago, the brave Scotsman named William Braveheart Wallace rose out of oppression by the tyrannical and pagan king Edward Longshanks of Briton, and united the people of the north (Scotsmen, Celts, Irish, and Picts included), driving the English out of Scotland and onto their own lands. Mel Gibson's portrayal of this warrior was next to perfect, he showed savagery, compassion, love, and hatred, all key elements held by any true Scot. During the fight scenes, he showed the heart of a warrior, and in the many love scenes, showed his deep and everlasting adoration for his deceased bride. During the opening of the Battle of Stirling, Mel gave the speech that would set in place the standards for many movies to come, including Aragorn's speech before the Battle of the Black Gate in LOTR: The Return of the King (this only includes the actors actions, as it is obvious that this speech was already told in J.R.R. Tolkeins book). The true brilliance of this movie ends with the remarkable and heartbreaking torture and then execution by means of beheading of Wallace, and then the narrator telling the prologue with scenes of Robert the Bruces army preparing for the final battle against the English, that would result in Scotlands freedom from British rule. The final scene shows Campbell (Brendan Gleeson) hurling the legendary Wallace claymore into the battlefield, sticking into the soil, representing the separation of Scotland from England, and an eternal reminder of the great deeds William Wallace did for his country and his people."
misswhiplash1212,"Mar 6, 2006",10/10,"this is one of the most amazing films i have ever seen. it captures emotion on a new level. Gibson portrays feeling through intense stares and slow motion. this film makes it impossible to be patriotic about england. i do not like excess gore but i hated the English (i am English) so much in this film that i felt it was well justified. Gibson's power and conviction combined with the script draws you into a wonderful story of passion, honour and love. it is a long film (approx 3 hours) but i could barely remember where i was by the end. if you watch only one film in your life let this be it, don't bother renting it just buy it its a safe risk, I've never heard a bad review and this is definitely one you'll want to keep!"
rcbbo,"Apr 17, 2006",10/10,"This movie is incredible. Mel Gibson does an incredible job as William Wallace, and how he didn't even get a nomination for best actor in 96 is beyond me.This is a long movie (Just short of three hours) but unlike a movie like Titanic, it is not a slow movie. Titanic is long and slow, but Braveheart is long and keeps moving.Tons of action! Best Battle scenes ever! Best acting ever! Best movie ever! Best score/soundtrack ever! If you have not seen this movie, get up from where you are, right this second, and go buy it or rent it. This movie is brilliant!"
alen_tab,"May 29, 2015",10/10,"I watched the movie again the other day, and I had to write a review. This movie is as close as it gets to perfection. It's a combination of so many genres and so beautifully combined. You have history movie, spectacle, drama, action, love story...(i'll probably forget some) going on at the same time. The acting is perfect, the directing is amazing, the scenes of Scotland are beautiful, even the fight scenes that are full of blood (like you can direct violence without blood?!) are spectacular. Mel Gibson really did an amazing job here and every time I see some good movie I use Braveheart as a reference point - that explains how high this movie is on my list! People can argue and it's good that they do but for me this is the best movie ever made and I can give countless of reasons to back up my statement!"
craigsomerville,"May 8, 2007",N/A,"This movie will always feature in my Top Ten of All Time. The film is extremely well made, with out-standing Direction, a very strong script (if inaccurate in regards to the subject matter), the acting is top notch as is the score (in fact its exceptional) and all these elements make this an amazingly passionate and emotionally charged epic. As a Scot I find myself being slightly bias about the film of course. The historic inaccuracy's are rather large and the film-makers do make the English out to be rather like cartoon bad guy's at times. The final scenes are very powerful and the battles are fierce and believable.I have watched the film many times, and every time I find it as emotional as the first time. So credit to all of the people involved in this one, it will turn out to be an timeless classic I'm pretty sure.10/10, Oozes Quality from all departments.............."
richard-mason,"Aug 22, 2002",6/10,"Historically inaccurate, ridiculously romanticised, overblown, overlong, and full of Mel Gibson's obsessive homophobia. (What is that man's problem?) How did this film full so many people, as well as the Academy (OK, so it's not so hard to fool the Academy.) It was around about this film (on top of the Lethal Weapon cartoons) that I decided not to bother with Mel anymore."
iranger,"Oct 4, 2005",10/10,"This movie dignifies any and everything that is passionate and moving. An epic film so paramount that its character has set precedent in my own life philosophy. The movie is unfettered with complicated symbols and deep metaphor leaving the viewer so connected to the protagonist that only pure uninhibited emotion can result. I reject any criticism of this movie as if it were criticism of my own virtue. The plot, the characters, the dialogue, and the music are almost inseparable as different parts of the film. Although there might be better stories, I have never experienced someone tell it so well. Simply put the best movie ever made."
liquidsnakemi,"Apr 8, 2008",10/10,I first saw this film when it came out. When it came out I just loved it. Even now 13 years after it originally aired it is still as good as ever. This film deserves a 10/10. The directing in this film is superb. Mel Gibson is one of the greatest directors of all time. The acting in this film is also exceptional. I think Mel Gibson might have gotten an academy award for both his acting and his directing in this film. Apart from Mel Gibson all the other actors played their parts brilliantly. One thing I loved about this film is how it focused on the human side of William Wallace that was a definite plus. I also enjoyed the cinematography of this film. It captures the landscape beautifully. Overall this must be one of the greatest films ever made. A definite 10/10.
daanu123,"Apr 18, 2006",9/10,"This is surely one of the best i have ever seen if not the best. flawless is the word for the movie.Mel Gibson has given it a tremendous direction along with his supreme acting skills. I got to say i have seen many but the impact that this film generates is simply amazing.The story is based on William Wallace, a commoner, whom unites the 13th Century Scots in their battle to overthrow English rule.It's definitely a must watch for every movie lover as well for those also whom do not watch movies that much. I must admit that this is perhaps the greatest action/drama movie ever made. It is hard to believe that it was made in the year 1995.So folks if u have'nt seen this movie u are surely missing a great movie. Go and see it because this is the BEST."

And it is now eleven years, and all these special effects, and yet there is no match to this one. It has timeless story, it is very well recorded and it has great actors! You wanna see god battle blooded film, take this one. You wanna see what can love make a man do, take this one. You wanna see a good story about disregarding might and position in order to bring righteousness, you must take this one, a story about a little man spiting in a big ones eye.What you haven't watched it yet?! Then what are you waiting for!? It didn't come to you for these eleven years, and it wont now! Hurry to your nearest video club!"
parambirsingh-04906,"Dec 11, 2021",10/10,One of the finest movie I have ever watched. William Wallace was a great freedom fighter of 13th century. Mel Gibson justified the character in excellent way. Must watch movie.
Eilidh77,"Oct 21, 2002",N/A,"This film does not do the story of William Wallace justice.Yes, everyone always says that it does not matter that the film wasn't fully accurate in Historical terms, but I feel it was not adequate enough to make this a very good and enjoyable film, amongst other weak points.Firstly, I don't feel the acting was good enough to carry `Braveheart' along. Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace was not, in my humble opinion, good enough. Firstly, he cannot do a convincing Scottish accent. I thought his accent was awful. His attempts at a decent Scottish accent made me cringe throughout the film, and often distracted me from what was going on. That said, I do not have problems with a non-Scot playing a Scot, I just think Gibson was the wrong choice for many reasons. I think he put a lot of effort into playing this role, but the effort does not pay off. However, some acting from the supporting cast is good, notably from Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks), and Catherine McCormack (Murron) {who did pull off a good Scottish accent!}.Secondly, like I mentioned above, I feel the storyline was too historically inaccurate. I wouldn't have minded if the film was slightly inaccurate, but this is just a joke.That said, the film does have some strong points. The scenery is wonderful. Note, I believe the film was shot mainly in Ireland, so it is Irish scenery, not Scottish scenery, but I believe the two are similar, anyway. The battle scenes are well shot, also. I think Mel Gibson's directing was better than his acting.Therefore, I believe this is an average film. It does have it's good points, but these are weighed out by it's many weak spots.Please note, the whole William Wallace era was BEFORE Scotland and England were UNIFIED as Great Britain. Therefore, these were battles between Scotland and ENGLAND, NOT Scotland and Britain! Britain didn't exist in this point of time! Also, in the modern day, Britain, or England, does NOT rule Scotland - they are UNITED in the British Union. I just wanted to make that clear. *Wink*.In conclusion, I rate this film 4/10."
church_boy,"Apr 24, 2016",9/10,"Braveheart was quite simply Mel Gibsons best movie of his career, it also goes on the list of one of the greatest films of all time. The soundtrack was absolutely fantastic as well as the acting. Showing the traditions of the Scottish and the brutality of England back in Medieval Times. Mel Gibson delivered a patriotic, stellar film for the ages showing the determination and love of one man that changed an entire nation and gave it the strength to gather together and stand against tyranny. Love for country, love for family, and love for the only one that he ever wanted. The sets used were perfect depicting the environment in which they lived. Braveheart leaves an impression that can't be beat!"
mm-39,"Apr 5, 2002",7/10,"This film is a good epic, but not great, as many believe.  It is entertaining, and has outstanding acting.  The only weak link is the length, which bogs down the film.  A good scrip, but they could cut 20 minutes out of this film.  Mel Gibson, will be remembered as a great actor. I believe he has yet to perform his best work, and will act in many more successful roles. (he knows a stinker script when he see it, and his acting gets better with age)  I would rent this film, but hesitate to buy it. 7/10"
jimmydavis-650-769174,"Mar 21, 2010",5/10,"Having seen this film umpteen times and seeing the very POLARIZED opinions it generates, here are the facts as I see them.It IS an entertaining film, whilst Gibson is as wooden as usual other members of the cast are good, particularly the under rated Mcgoohan.The battle sequences whilst inaccurate are carried off well and visually it all looks great.So it is a pity that an otherwise good film is spoilt by it's sadly one sided view of history. Firstly Edward I behaved no differently to any other monarch of the time in protecting his interests. He was arguably the most effective ruler during a turbulent period of civil war in England itself. His son, the unfortunate Edward II was lucky to have outived his father at all, the crown had to be protected at all costs. The Scots as well as the English perpetrated some terrible deeds, but this was typical of the time and practices such as 'breaking on the wheel' continued in France into the 18th Century.As in most conflicts no party had a moral high ground. It was inevitable that Scotland would become a vassal of England, in the same way that France was eventually enlarged. At the time Wallace may have represented an ideal of Clan freedom and independence but the Nation State was already becoming the currency of power within Europe.A more balanced and investigative approach would have yielded more satisfying results and left a less bitter aftertaste for viewers of an English disposition.I"

wilson-mclean,"Jul 24, 2006",10/10,"As a Scotsman i should probably point out that this film is horribly, as history would point out, inaccurate!!!! However the important part of our history was remembered as far as the battles were concerned. The film is the only one, i am sure, that will be the only one i see that received a standing ovation at the end(at least in this country). Willam Wallace is an important part of our history and he will always be remembered as one of the men who always reclaimed our land from the English. (I have nothing against our neighbours by the way!) The film itself boiled a passion in me that could never be re-ignited by any other! Despite the fact that many of my friends are English!!! If by some small chance you've never seen this classic please, please, give it a go..... You'll feel some patriotic soul, even if you're not a Scot!!!! By the way... I'm in the film ... I was unemployed and desperate!!! Mel gave me a part!!! I'm third buttock from the left!!! That's what i get for being a tall muscular highlander!!!!"
Falcador,"Dec 3, 1998",10/10,"A well, acted and well paced movie, such that you don't notice its near 3 hour length.  The real strength, though, is its visual imagery.  The blood and gore of the battlefield, the glorious Scottish highlands, the medievel castles and villages.Gibson thoroughly desrved the Oscar for best director, the imagery and camera work is stunning.  While the direction itself is not innovative it is far more than merely effective.  The battles are well depicted, using thousands of extras.  A personal highlight is the depiction of the battle of Stirling as for the first time in living memory cavalry is defeated by infantry.The dialogue feels great to listen to, and the plot is cohesive and flows well.  While the movie could quite easily down without the Princess sub-plot - it does add to the feel of the movie.Mel Gibson takes the lead role with a fire that was absent in some of his other historical work, for me the pick of the acting is Angus McFadyen as Robert the Bruce, the young would be king torn between yearning to follow William Wallace into the teeth of hell, and the brutul common sense of his ailing father.  A young man yearning to be a warrior while being forced to become a politician.  Also veteran British actor Patrick McGoohan is a joy to watch as King Edward the Longshanks.  A character to love to hate.While filmed as an epic not all epics live up to the tag.  This movie is an epic in every way."
Damfino1895,"Feb 24, 2005",N/A,"This has just been named the most undeserving Oscar winner and I agree wholeheartedly. I have always wondered how on earth this English bashing drivel by an Aussie director who is one of life's true bigots beat the magnificent Apollo 13. It is no closer to true historical fact then Monty Python and the Holy Grail, unfortunately the former isn't half as entertaining as the latter,,still I did find Wallace's death scene as funny as anything Python produced. I guess that the Yanks still haven't forgiven the English for the War of Independence and tend to praise all Gibson's Limey bashing tirades masquerading as ""history""(The Patriot is another example) By the way, I'm welsh and have no love for the English either, but, I like my history in movies to be at least a little bit near the reality. How the heck did this garbage get into the top 250 movies of all time?"
marcus-687-18743,"Mar 26, 2025",6/10,"There are movies that are fantastic even after 50 years and there are those who are clearly influenced by the time of their making. Braveheart is a typical 90ies movie: The humor that is part of the story, especially in the beginning, the light hearted buddy-behaviour among the men to make viewers feel good and other stuff is typical for the movies back then. In general it is of course well made regarding costumes, camera and more but also a lot of the spoken word is clichee adventure/historical movie of that time or the 80ies. The speech before the big fight and everything is as far as i know not historical fact but more to give goosebumbs to in that case probably almost only male watchers. The love scenes and story are clichee. The way the prince is presented leaves a bad taste, i think that would not be possible anymore nowadays since it's full of homophobe clichees. And sorry, but i agree with Mel Gibson that he was not the right one for that leading role. To me he always looks like an old guy who is wearing a wig. Somehow he reminds me also of the typical presentation of metal guys in movies in the 90ies, Airheads or Waynes World. I waited the whole movie for him to pick up a guitar and play some 80ies metal. So watching it nowadays, some stuff is kinda rediculous. In the end still watchable but not that great. I think Mad Max aged better."
mrmoviefreak261,"Nov 20, 2006",10/10,"When I first watched his film, all I could say was, ""Wow! This movie is so cool!"" The film is such a great way of showing the history of Scotland. Mel Gibson stars and directs this fine film. His portrayal of William Wallace is really awesome and his acting really moves the viewers. I love the part in the Battle of the Stirling, where his face is painted blue with his shield and up. I have to admit, there is some funny parts in the movie that could make people go nuts. The mooning part (it is only a brief scene of nudity), makes people go crazy, laughing and crying. The scenes of the Battle of the Stirling and the Battle of Falkirk, were amazing and the cinematography is absolutely amazing. The scenes are brutal and barbaric, but the violence supports the story-the want of freedom from the evil rules of the King. Edward the Longshanks is an evil king who is a seriously corrupted person in the movie, but the acting is really great. I'd have to say that the movie is a fantastic achievement and people should watch it, (people who can stand brutal war scenes) because this movie is 100% AWESOME!"
LeonLouisRicci,"Jan 6, 2014",6/10,"There are so many Historical Inaccuracies in this Film, as many Scholars who know such Things have pointed out, that they won't be listed here. A small amount of Research will shed some Light. But here is one, and it's a DOOZY.The Title, is actually from a Poem Written about and Titled for Robert the Bruce, not William Wallace. Want one more? Robert the Bruce never Betrayed William Wallace. That's enough Egghead stuff, now there is the Movie. Best Picture Oscar Winner, by the way, in a very very Slim Year.The Movie is Entertaining Enough and has been sighted for Rousing, Bloody, You are there Battle Sequences. OK. But most of the Movie is Over Acted, with Mr. Gibson taking the Worst Actor Honors, but not without Strong Competition. The Story is pure Claptrap, Pulpy, Romantic, Sentimental Nonsense. It is Manipulative to the Point of Dreariness for almost its complete Three-Hour Running Time.It all makes for some Big Screen Excitement and the FREEDOM Plot Motivating the Movie is a sure Crowd Arouser, but it all Smacks of nothing more than a Big-Budget, Battle Cry Behemoth that is Shallow, Sophomoric, and all Made-Up Underneath.That's because it is. It is all Made into some kind of Superhero Epic, but even that is Undermined because here the Hero not only gets the Girl, He gets any Female who happens to be on the Screen.Mel Gibson, Our Hero, not only gets the Girls, He got a few Oscars along with. But at the Expense of an Overrated, Good-Looking Movie that throws History to the wind and is at its Heart not very Brave about Anything approaching Reality to tell the Story."
enzedder,"Feb 26, 2002",1/10,"The fact that Mel Gibson is in it might be enough to dissuade anyone from watching, but if you continue to watch, you're in for a nasty fright. Although against the best recommendations of British historians, millions of Americans still view this movie as accurate history.  Thanks Mel - you've rewritten in 3 hours a nation's history that took thousands of years to form.  Some strange facts about this fiction were that the English king actually spoke English, as did his soldiers, who themselves identified as English, when historically you're looking at a would-be further Norman conquest further into Britain.  Also, it appears that many Americans, and now many other nationalities (thanks Mel) seem to think that Scotland and Britain are separate entities.  If ever there is a Braveheart II, which portrays Scottish raids and invasions into pre-Norman Northumbria, Cumbria, Yorkshire, which shows how the Scots conquered the English city of Edinburgh and made it their capital, which awakens in 50 million Irish Americans a sense of their English heritage (hahaha), I'd watch it.  Trouble is, Hollywood doesn't make those sorts of reality films as they're just too real.  The English as victims?  Perish the thought!"

danqskills,"Oct 11, 2021",8/10,"Braveheart - the definition of the word 'epic'. Braveheart is a beautifully made film, with Gibson making a career performance. It follows a simple (almost cliché) revenge tale, but the cinematography, acting, music, and so much other elements make this movie great. While the film can get a bit slow at scenes, it makes up James Horner's amazing soundtrack, and for it's beautiful cinematography and atmosphere, it makes you feel like your right there. The slow scenes don't necessarily make the movie 'worse', but it makes you feel ingested in the screenplay. The movie is not historically accurate at all, and even though I'm not really into the historical accuracy and everything....... it can get really annoying. Barely anything in this film is accurate, the only thing being William Wallace is Scottish. That's why I give this film 9 stars, not 10, being my only complaint. Rest of the film is superb.If you haven't watched it, what the hell are you doing? Go watch it!"

arebellion,"Jun 26, 2014",10/10,"This is the best of all Mel Gibson's movies. And will always be remembered as one of the best/a landmark in the US cinema.A single word Freedom holds all.It is not just a story of a freedom fighter but an adrenaline pumping journey that inspires and invokes rage against the system-could be contemporary. Story of a normal guy who stood against the system after the loss of his family and of a friendship that betrays then repent and then take charge. Ophhh- hell of a story. Will see highs and lows of relations that too in the era of kings-politics. Rebel dies and his last word- Freedom, that's enough to stand against the wrong. Believe me a long speech before war- we have seen it all. But just a single word with a passionate outcry overshadows all of those famous dialogues of all in the history of cinema.The movie has all. Story, direction, acting- everything and believe me, it will cast a spell. And you will remember this outcry for all of your life.Not denying the fact that Mel is one of my favorite and this is one of the best of my life. It really sets the standard for cinema and is totally/completely a different level."
cwlovelace,"Dec 20, 2006",10/10,this movie has all the working of a master piece and it is truly all spearheaded by Gibson the emotion and passion he shows in his character i do believe have never been duplicated many movies are great but i must say this one for me ranks at the top of the list. i have seen many other movies that i was told are the best and they are great no question movies such as shaw shank redemption and such and they are all great and usually quite powerful but this movie is tops for me the acting maybe paralleled else where but like i said what make it so amazing for me is the passion shown throughout the movie completely breathtaking.
Kirpianuscus,"Aug 22, 2018",N/A,I see it as one of most inspired films about faith. The faith to an ideal. The faith as expression of love. And duty. that does it special. And defines Mel Gibson as a great director. The science and courage to give an impressive fresco of ideal and sacrifice and vulnerability as source of force. A film of a religious man because Braveheart is a Christian film not only for the presence of priests and prays but for its entire nuances of its message. A powerful film. Scene by scene. Impecable made. Great using each detail. A film about the essence of freedom. And about the price for give to it sense and form and blood.
corey-stark,"Jan 24, 2007",10/10,"I agree with you 100%, at least a top 10 movie of all time. Don't worry about their top 250 however; The Empire Strikes Back is #9 and is the worst of the originals and probably worse than a couple of the re-made first three episodes. My father, born just outside of Glasgow, was nearly brought to tears when he saw this movie for the first time. A man I've only see cry once when my oldest brother left for college. It remains one of the handful of movies that he will watch over and over again. You're exactly right, the violence is necessary, it only makes the movie more powerful and the hardships that the Scotch had to endure while fighting for their independence hit home that much more. So keep fighting, this movie will find its rightful place at the top."
Servo-11,"Oct 16, 2001",2/10,"I finally watched this movie after hearing about it for years and I really wish I'd spent my time watching something else.  Braveheart ranks right up there with Titanic and Pearl Harbor as prime examples of what's wrong with Hollywood historical epics.  They take a rich and complex history or event and dumb it down for the viewing public into a shallow tale of revenge, love and death.  Emotions are over-the-top and characters are either good or bad. Strangely enough, considering its reputation among some people as being mindless entertainment drivel, I feel Gladiator is a much better film, despite all the sneers that Gladiator aped Braveheart.  Gladiator took the elements that floundered in Braveheart and made it much more satisfying, visually and dramatically.  Compare Maximus's quiet death, as he finally reaches his family on the other side, with Wallace's leatherlung scream of ""FREEDOM!"" delivered on the soaring wave of a pulse-pounding, throat-catching orchestral surge that you would find only in a Hollywood epic.  I look at Braveheart as a supreme egotrip by a moderately talented actor.  Mel Gibson needs a good director to keep him in line so he doesn't grandstand, and Emmerich succeeded to some degree in The Patriot.  Throw in the shameful historical inaccuracies and the blatant gay-bashing (Mel has a few personal agendas) and you have a long film that bores and exasperates.Still, I gave it 2/10 for the cinematography.  The scenery is beautiful. Oh, and the gut-wrenching bellylaugh I got from Wallace's final word made the rest of the movie much more enjoyable.  Too bad it didn't come earlier in the film.If you want to see Braveheart summed up in about 5 minutes, watch the ""Starvin' Marvin"" episode of South Park.  It's infinitely more satisfying."
profocy-2,"Oct 14, 1998",10/10,"There isn't a whole lot to actually say about this movie.  It truly is a masterpiece.  A true work of art.  There isn't a film out there that affected me the way this one did.  The acting, the plot, and the costumes were sensational.  I just wish I could personally thank Mel Gibson for making one of the best films ever."
sme_no_densetsu,"Oct 27, 2014",8/10,"Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" tells the story of William Wallace, a near-legendary 13th century Scottish hero who fought for his country's independence. While based on actual people and events, the story departs from history in some respects as it hews closer to myth than to reality.The Oscar-nominated screenplay by Randall Wallace was admittedly written with more attention paid to creating dramatic situations than to being as factual as possible. I won't argue with dramatic license when it produces a story as compelling as this but I do think that Wallace stretched the facts beyond the point of credibility on at least one occasion. Others are even less forgiving. So, if you get hung up on stringent historical accuracy, this is assuredly not the movie for you.If you can get past that, you'll find that Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning direction is surprisingly well-handled, particularly given his relative inexperience at the time (""Braveheart"" was just his second directorial effort). There's no doubt that renowned first assistant director David Tomblin also proved a valuable asset to the production. Furthermore, the film is also impressive from a musical standpoint, with James Horner's Oscar-nominated score effectively utilizing Scottish and Celtic influences.Apart from directing the movie, Gibson also delivered the goods with his portrayal of the larger than life lead character. He didn't do it all on his own, though; he had a fine cast supporting him. Patrick McGoohan played King Edward I with villainous relish, Sophie Marceau was stunning as Princess Isabelle and Angus Macfadyen gave a complicated portrait of Robert the Bruce. Among Wallace's men, Brendan Gleeson & David O'Hara both stood out. Catherine McCormack was also notable as Wallace's secret lover.All in all, ""Braveheart"" amounts to a well-constructed epic the likes of which we don't see enough of these days. It may take some liberties with history but they don't detract too much from the overall picture as I see it. While Gibson has fallen out of favour in recent years (through no fault but his own), this movie shows him at his best and deserves to be fondly remembered."
shoktart,"Feb 18, 2001",10/10,"Braveheart is a wonderful blend of action, romance, and drama.  Mel Gibson is amazing in his portrayal of William Wallace, the Scottish hero who inspires men to fight for freedom.  Although this movie does not give a very accurate description of historic events, that shouldn't make it any less enjoyable.  If you want an exact description of Scottish and English history, or you tend to be critical and analyze historical accuracy in films, then this movie is not for you.  However, if you want to be thoroughly entertained and inspired and feel every range of possible emotions in a 3-hour span then this movie is definitely for you.  I have never before or since seen a movie that can grab hold of your emotions and keep them captive for the full length of the film like Braveheart can.  I am envious of any who have not yet had the pleasure of seeing this great film because there is nothing like the first time. If you rank movies on how they make you feel, then Braveheart is simply the Greatest of All-Time!!"

suicidea,"Oct 24, 2018",7/10,"I was in my early 20's when I had the chance to see Mel Gibson's Braveheart on the big screen, sadly along with a classroom of young giggling girls behind my seat. I still remember what a huge experience it was on first viewing, full of excitement, great scenery, incomparable battle scenes, and wonderful dialogue with a very memorable scene after scene every minute. The story of a commoner who rebelled against a huge kingdom when his secret bride is murdered was, in one word, majestic.Years later, however, most of these views changed. First, the Internet came into our homes, and as I did a bit of reading about history, I began to realize the mind-numbing historical inaccuracies that Braveheart has. Now I don't mind altering history a bit in movies for the sake of entertainment, but certainly not to this extent. Braveheart, in fact, is not an historic film at all: It uses names, characters and events from history, but rearranges them to fit its story. In fact, it's not too different from Tarantino's excellent Inglorious Basterds in that aspect.Second, DVDs came into our homes, and upon a couple of repeated viewings, those ""incomparable"" battle scenes turned out to be somewhat ordinary, then bad, then straight up laughable. Full of unforgivable editing mistakes, continuity mistakes, background actors playing sword among themselves like children... I'm not talking about ordinary movie goofs that you can find even in Kubrick's films if you try hard, I'm talking about mistakes that could be avoided if you simply took a bit of care.I still gave it a solid 7 stars, though. Because despite all its flaws, Braveheart is still a damn entertaining movie. While making every possible mistake a first-time director could make, Gibson also managed to pull off something very difficult: make a thoroughly engaging, entertaining film. It's fun, it has a once-in-a-lifetime score, and despite its appalling flaws, it's still an unforgettable movie.Final word: Although Gibson directed, produced and starred in this, making it ""his baby"" so to speak, for me it will always be Patrick McGoohan's movie. He's more of a king than some actual kings. A very fine actor giving a chilling performance, stealing every scene."
jimbub88,"Sep 4, 2006",10/10,"This film is modeled on possibly the greatest freedom fighter of all time, Such scenes are so well backed up by the background music and many scenes can bring you to tears. After watching this film and if your that spellbound by William Wallace you would wish to have known him in person. Its such an indescribable feeling that you have after you have watched this great film. ""you cant have life without freedom"" well said. many themes and very significant points are also made in the film. So when watching perhaps the 100 time make sure you pick up on them and bring yourself a much stronger intellect. Cheers to Mr Gibson on perhaps his best film ever directed and acted."
goreilly40,"Jun 21, 2015",6/10,"As a history lover I found elements of the plot simply absurd. As said before it couldn't have been more inaccurate if Wallace had ordered in the heavy artillery or sent in the air strikes. Historically it was a nonsense and probably one of the most inaccurate movies I've ever seen. The story seems to be hand picked from various periods of history and mixed together to make what can only be described as a curious hybrid time piece. That said however this is a movie whose main aim was to entertain the viewing audience, not an educational documentary, and it succeeded in its aim. The acting was good, the battle scenes were brutal, memorable and exciting, the antagonist was conniving ruthless and cunning, all must have qualities for any villain, and the protagonist was brave, noble and charismatic, the plot itself wasn't overly complex and captivating enough to see the movie through to the end, it spawned a number of memorable quotes and the ending was very moving. So by all means watch this movie as it is entertaining, but don't take it as an accurate portrayal of the actual historical figures and events its based on."

A lot of endearing authenticity is also thanks to great acting and costume designs as well. It's hard to find a war film that's so focused and emotionally driven as this one. The only flaw I have is that there's a love scenario that develops towards the end of the movie that's totally unnecessary and even takes away from some other emotional tendencies that occur earlier in the film. But it's hard not to get swept up in the grand spectacle that's known as a masterpiece. This is one that shouldn't be missed."
solidsnake_971,"Aug 14, 2006",10/10,"I'm one of those who can watch movies more than once. I have now just watched this movie for the 5 time, and i still love it. Due to the dramatic, sad, romantic and most exiting story. this movie is something to come back to. Leaves you with a reminder of what still happens today. with guns instead of swords. Mel is a genius! This movie combines history with action, and makes the movie worth seeing. If you are one of those who haven't watched this movie, you must do so as fast as possible. This is a movie not to be missed. The acting and scenery is great. Everything is really well made, considering the year which the movie was made in. Tremendous acting from Mel, and superb direction makes this flick one of my favorites!"
welsbyadrienne,"Aug 6, 2019",9/10,Great movie and a must when you need a good cry. Love that there is a love story to go along with all the war.
rkoch,"Aug 15, 1998",N/A,"Mel Gibson's generally known only for his acting, but this project proves that he's got the talent to be a top director as well.The screenplay, acting and score all excel; an easy pick for best picture.More than just a movie, Braveheart is film-making as an art.  This is a cinematic experience -- a true composition of sight, sound and excitement.  Oddly, I've never known an action movie that could move men, in particular, to tears so effectively.Be warned: Braveheart contains a lot of bloody medieval hand-to-hand combat. If this type of content offends you, it could ruin the experience."
Calicodreamin,"Jan 4, 2022",7/10,"An epic no doubt, visually captivating with multiple large scale battles and moving moments. Though a bit long winded and repetitive (same characters shuffled around for battles). The characters were well acted and the costuming felt authentic."
ChildoftheKindlyWest,"Dec 6, 2000",10/10,"I don't think it's really possible for me to explain how much I love Bravheart.  Its just such an incredible film.  It was terribly unfair that the first time I saw it was in Latin Class.  After the period, I had been crying so hard, that people stopped me in the halls and asked if I was alright.  Braveheart melds action with romance, and adds loads of wit--with stunning results!  Besides gory, realistic midieval battle scenes, Braveheart gives you a story whose characters touch you.  Thier pain and grief as well as their joy and confusion is realistic and you can relate to it.  Its simply an irresistably beautiful film.  Definitely a must see, must buy, and must watch often!!"
Shoals-3,"Sep 19, 2002",7/10,"There are many comments here obsessing over historical inaccuracies, but here is one you missed: the overwhelming american ideology present throughout the film.  ""Freedom"" is mentioned again and again to the point where it really gets painful to watch.  I know the primary audience is american, but did Gibson really have to bring out the buzzword time and time again?Apparently it worked, judging by the number of americans who love this film and who mention the freedom aspect in their comments. Not that this is the ideal place for political arguments, but really how americans unerringly swell with pride at the mere mention of ""freedom"" is beyond me.  If freedom means having one of the highest incarceration rates in the the world, letting 18 year olds carry concealed automatic weapons, but not allowing them to touch alcohol until 21, and keeping a heavy military presence throughout the world to brutally restrict any behavior they dislike, then I want no part of it.However, there are many good points to this film as well.  It is beautifully filmed, well acted and flows well from beginning to end.If it weren't for all the chest-thumping ideology pushed down our throats, it would be one of my favourite films."
gamingvault,"Jan 7, 2020",9/10,"I saw this for the first time recently and wow.. I was very impressed! It's not perfect and the good (Scots) against the evil (English) is a bit too black and white. What I mean by that is that the English and King Longshanks are historically portrayed as completely cruel and evil. I know some of the history and in spite of being English myself I think the Scots had every right to defend their land and fight for independance. The film just makes out all the English characters to be comic bad guys and the Scots, of course, the good. I am not saying there were no bad English, I just think the real history would have been more conveluted. But I am not one of these anoraks, that pick out the helmets being the wrong diameter. It's entertainment and it serves that at a premium throughout. There are few boring parts in this great film.Patrick McGoohan, in what must have been one of his last roles (RIP), is brilliant as the dry humored nemesis to Mel Gibson's William Wallace. I think the sets and the filming was all done superbly. You can really feel that wet Scottish landscape & the art director deserves praise. The action scenes are also excellant and very gritty. They use a lot of close ups of faces and nasty pointy weapons. This really makes you feel among the battles. None of the Alan Ladd-esque pantomime violence. There is plenty of blood and guts and soldiers (as in reality) not simply keeling over and being whisked to heaven. But lying in agony, painfully waiting for the reaper. This gritty style has been copied since. But this, along with Kenneth Brannaghs Henry V were among the first wave.Charecter development is second to none. You really feel for the characters, I liked big hamish. A slightly simple, but good natured Scottish giant. When his father is cut down in battle and he weeps, it really resonated with myself.As I said before the action and film direction is top notch. Yes the history is not as black and white. Yes Longshanks is a bit of a pantomime villain. But you can still take in most of the timeline of important events. Including the fact that Wallace was tortured horribly once caught. His severed body being sent to the four corners of England.Well worth a look if you haven't seen it and like me, an old fashioned bloke that loves action and beautiful women (love interests)."
chera_khalid,"Sep 22, 2023",9/10,"I love 'Braveheart' and gave it a 9/10. Mel Gibson's acting is compelling, and his portrayal of William Wallace is unforgettable. The music by James Horner elevates the epic feel of the film, while the casting, including standout performances by Sophie Marceau and Angus Macfadyen, enhances its emotional depth. Cinematography captures the stunning Scottish landscapes and the brutality of battle with precision. Gibson's directing is ambitious, successfully weaving together action, drama, and historical context. The writing creates a powerful narrative, though it takes some liberties with history. Its strength lies in its memorable characters, grand scale battles, and emotional resonance. While some may find historical inaccuracies as a minor weakness, 'Braveheart' remains an enduring classic in the epic war film genre."
bsquillo,"Mar 5, 2001",10/10,"The casting of this flick was incredible.  Each character fit his or her role perfectly.  The music and the the scenic shots of the land of the Scot's itself are worth renting this movie.  The viewer of this movie should be prepared for an emotional roller coaster of a ride, where he or she will experience the lowest of lows and highest of highs as the plot unfolds through the movie."
milangucic,"Sep 7, 2016",10/10,"Starting from the first scene, this movie will guide you through the essence of slavery and colonialism made by centuries and millenniums. Fight for freedom and right to live free. Camera, screenplay, actors, sound, music (amazing music) are filled with emotions. I like the Gladiator very much, but this one is pure masterpiece. Mel Gibson have never made such a movie again. But, it very much enough to have this one and stay on top forever. Soundtrack is one of the best I Have ever heard. Amazing how almost every piece of the film is made by a fantastic team.Shame that movie is rated average by 8.4 but some people are probably just the opposite of this story."
TheRedGoblin,"Jan 18, 2006",10/10,"This is the most amazing film I have have seen and having taken several course on Film, I have seen many. Please anyone who has not seen this film yet do your self a favor and ignore the comments of the people who hate BraveHeart and see it.The claim made from the detractors of this film are not only ignorant but quite hypocritical. So in defense of this great film here is my response to those who hate this film.The film from a historical aspect is not 100% perfect, but it is still very accurate without becoming a preachy documentary. The film itself was never meant to be a documentary, most of you who consider yourselves educated know that it was originally a book, written on what we know to be fact about William Wallace and the rest written from the authors heart. And as for following the book it in many cases follows it to the letter( with the exception of Wallace Travelling to France and Itally. Still without being a documentary, it follows the facts we know about Wallace's life closely, though admittedly not fully. Yes, there was a bridge at Sterling, it was not put in the film due to low production cost, and yes Long Shanks died some time after the film depicted, beyond this though it is accurate to what we know. Since in reality, we know little of Wallaces life, the author put what he felt moved to write, in the story. Yes we will never know for sure if Wallace and Princess Isabell ever met and so on. This part of the film is only speculation. Other the the historical, I find it funny that some people would complain about the violence in this film and yet find movies like the mindless gore-fest by Tarrentino fine ( no this is not ever Braveheart hater, but a lot of them are that hypocritical).Now that I am done defending this film all I can say is that it reach down to the core of every human emotion. As another reviewer said before me, "" this film will make you cheer, love, laugh, cry; but more importantly it will make you think and measure what you have done with your life"". Every award it won it more than deserved and it deserved more. The score is one of the most moving and beautiful I have heard, the Mis-en-scene gritty realistic and unapologetic, and every actor and actress creates such a moving character, you can not help but be moved. This film is a once in a century masterpiece.See it!"
delfinchik,"Jun 11, 2006",9/10,"I loved the film. A rare case, when an entertainment film is so well-made, so moving...As for history - no matter how accurate or inaccurate it is historically, I don't see it as anti-English. Look at those treacherous Scottish noblemen! They are showed as far, far more disgusting people, than the English king etc.!I think it is not about ""good Scots"" vs. ""bad Englishmen"", but about people who are bleeding on the battlefield, fighting for their homes vs. people who just want more castles and personal power, than they already have. (English or Scottish, or anything else - no matter)."
isabella-41423,"May 1, 2019",N/A,"It was ok... I would just read the book instead of I were you! It was kind of boring and never really came to an exciting ""high""!"
JackUK1973,"Oct 21, 2018",7/10,"Well almost; the story which has no basis in reality, armies winning battles when hopelessly outnumbered, terrible terrible accents that are barely from the same planet let along the right region - this film is clearly one of the inspirations for '300'.This is my first viewing of the film, 23 years after its release. I'm pleased to say that I hadn't missed much.On the plus side, the cinematography and soundtrack were both beautiful.The rest was average at best. Presumably when Mel cast himself in the lead as a heroic, principled, freedom fighter he thought that only he would have the prowess and credibility to pull it off. Clearly Mel's ego is as vast as some of the panoramic shots in the film.The characters were all old school, the wicked king with his weak and childish son. The freedom fighter hero, who is inspired to fight by his beautiful dead wife, murdered by one of the men employed by the wicked king. The traitor who ultimately repents and finds redemption, and various other cliches live within this film. To be fair, these character types are classic for a reason.Despite my cynicism, I did generally enjoy the film, although now I've seen it I doubt i'll be rushing back for a second viewing.If you like the idea of Mel being the consummate hero freedom fighter then give it a whirl, if you find that tiresome then there are thousands of better films out there..."
vdvniels-62158,"Feb 21, 2021",10/10,There is nothing else to say. Masterpiece from beginning to end.
saraarts,"Apr 6, 2000",7/10,"First of all, I have to say that the first time I saw Braveheart, I loved it, unequivocally.  Too old to remember what I once knew of Scottish history, and therefore entirely unaware of any historical inaccuracies which I've since heard others put forth, I saw only a long, lush, romantic, dramatic, cinematic war poem, the sort of thing that would have become required reading in English literature courses had it been created by a troubador a few centuries earlier.  It didn't even bother me that Mel Gibson, despite his usual exceptionally strong acting, was far too old for the hero's role.  I was enchanted and deeply moved.Let me also state my opinion that, no matter what, Braveheart is still a really good movie.  The sheer choreography of the battle scenes is superb and not to be missed.  Patrick McGoohan's performance is the best I've seen him do yet.  Most of the little glimpses we get of Sophie Marceau are lovely and memorable.  The only real criticisms I can make of this film rest on the length and on certain cliches which could have been avoided; there were a number of scenes that could have been trimmed to strengthen Braveheart's impact immensely, and the script was not always as strong as the point.  But these are small criticisms.  Watching Braveheart is like immersing yourself greedily in a thick historical novel.However, when I first saw Braveheart, I had never seen anything like it on film.  So over the course of the next few years, hungry for more rich widescreen epics spread over two cassettes, I watched and rewatched a lot of other films, as much David Lean and Akira Kurosawa as I could find.  The first movie I saw after Braveheart was Lawrence of Arabia, which I'd seen and loved before; then, at my boyfriend's instigation, I moved into Kurosawa with a vengeance, starting with Ran.  If my goal had been to keep loving Braveheart, this was probably my first mistake.Then my boyfriend, at my urging, bought the video of Braveheart, letterboxed and everything as all originally widescreen films should be.  A big Kurosawa fan, and someone who cannot seem to get enough of beautifully presented violent tragedy, I assumed my boyfriend would love Braveheart as much as I had.  This was my second mistake.  For had he not purchased this videotape, my third and most critical error of judgment would never have occurred.My third mistake took place a couple of weeks ago.  We held a little film party at our house, ostensibly to watch Monty Python movies with a bunch of our friends, ages ranging from early 20s to late 30s.  We first watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a brilliant and hilarious movie we all love dearly.  Then the people who don't like violent tragedies, even when beautifully presented, had to go home.  So the question arose, what should we watch next?For some reason, neither Monty Python's The Meaning of Life nor Life of Bryan, which we had rented just for the occasion, appealed to the remaining guests.  For some perverse reason which I can only attribute to too many margaritas, we all agreed to watch Braveheart.Like The Holy Grail, Braveheart attempts to portray life in medieval Britain as it might really have been, filth and all.  So the first time we snickered when we saw a dirty face, we suspected we were in trouble.  As soon as the first English soldier in a bullet-shaped helmet appeared to receive a thorough taunting, those of use who had seen Braveheart before knew at once that our love affair with the film was over.  It didn't take long for our small audience to begin screaming things at the screen such as, ""Come back and fight, you coward!"" or ""Not dead; in fact, I'm feeling a little better,"" or ""You don't frighten us, English pig dogs!"" or, worst of all, ""Naughty, naughty Zoot!""I don't want to spoil Braveheart for others.  The purpose of this review is simply to put forth a warning.  And so I will not walk you through all the parallels we encountered, much to the detriment of Braveheart, from costume to character to event.  It would be unkind.  Nor will I go into a detailed analysis of the flaws of Braveheart versus the virtues of, say, Kagemusha.I would offer two warnings, though.  The first warning is that, if you love Braveheart and have not watched a lot of Kurosawa, go carefully into that rich domain.  Know that once you have seen Ran, with all its beautifully composed scenes, unique and perfect music, and careful, truly poetic editing, never again will you be able to look at Braveheart with the same respect.The second warning is much more obscure, probably a mistake others are not likely to make, but still...  If you love Braveheart, or if you want to love Braveheart, never ever screen it directly after screening Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Oh, sure; should you disregard this warning, you will certainly have fun.  Rolling around on the floor and laughing until you hurt is generally enjoyable.  However, you will never again be able to view Braveheart with any type of dignity."
syntinen,"May 22, 2008",1/10,"I can't imagine how anybody can take this farrago seriously.I can see that if you didn't give a toot for Scotland or its history, but you liked vigorous hack-and-bash action with one-dimensional villains and heroes, cartoon acting (Gibson was clearly channelling Fred Flintstone), simple-minded penis-size jokes and a dash of good old-fashioned homophobia, all set in beautiful (and totally inappropriate) landscapes, you could really enjoy this film. But it beats me how anybody can stumble out after watching it babbling ""inspirational"", ""enthralling"", ""heroic"", ""romantic"" and all the rest of it. It's a joke movie to rent for a raucous evening at home over some cans of beer. (Provided there's nobody in the house who cares about the history of Scotland  they will certainly come out in a rash.)"
dsgnbmtd,"Jan 21, 2022",10/10,"This is my first movie review if that says something about this film. I was blown away by the acting, cinematography, and sound track of this movie. Braveheart will impact you in some way, it's different for us all. Give it a shot, you won't regret it."

morris-4,"Nov 3, 1998",N/A,Words put here could never describe entirely what this movie achieves in every aspect in question. This is a story about a magnificent man who gives hope to many people and who also intrigues us in the way. A man perfectly performed by Gibson in what may be his best character to date. This is a man with a heart and a willingness to reach freedom that could impress anyone. It is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen that will pass on through history as a classic of our time. No doubt about it.
Prismark10,"Mar 15, 2016",6/10,"William Wallace was as a Scottish knight who became one of the main leaders during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 13th Century. Braveheart directed and starring Mel Gibson is a fictional telling of the Wallace story.Gibson has produced a rip roaring adventure with bloody battles and visceral violence. He certainly has brought his experience of action from the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon films.Patrick McGoohan is the hissable villain as King Edward 1 also known as Edward Longshanks. He is ruthless and cunning. Just see the way he disposes of his son's newly appointed war counsellor. Yet he will also bribe Scots noblemen with land in order for them to switch sides.The film opens with Wallace as a child, his father killed in an unknown battle. The grown up Wallace just wants a peaceful existence as a farmer with the love of his life. All this is shattered with the despicable English, raping and pillaging like they were Vikings.Gibson with writer Randall Wallace show a sure footing in the the story set up and the early battle scenes in the beautiful settings of Scotland and Ireland.It is the latter part of the film that causes problems with pacing that makes the film overlong and the rather shady depiction of Robert the Bruce who is the better known Scots hero. Wallace who has been betrayed by some noblemen takes revenge against them like he was Zorro, he also has a fictional affair with Princess Isabelle which is almost laughable. The final scenes of torture where he is put on a cross makes it look like that he already was planning The Passion of the Christ."
mcoloma-76848,"Apr 15, 2020",10/10,"Mel Gibson and James Horner made the best team when creating this movie and it's music. They both go hand in hand. The movie is full of life, wittiness, history and will make your blood boil if you have the slightest ounce of Scottish in you. Everything about it, acting, fighting, romance, scenery, directing and scoring is simply perfection."
SafReviews,"Jan 21, 2022",6/10,"I liked the fight scenes in the movie and it was quite good to see a battle without the use of guns for a change. I liked the story, however I did get less interested with it during the last hour, except for the execution at the end which was definitely interesting. Also I've heard this movie is quite historical inaccurate which kind of makes me dislike it a little as I like movies like this to be mostly historically accurate. I was expecting to really like this movie, but I'm guess I'm not a fan of 13th century period movies as I thought I would be."
rosian,"May 27, 2007",1/10,"I am fed up with Hollywood movies that deliberately or ignorantly, whichever, tell a pack of lies about the history of Great Britain. This isn't the first and doubtless it won't be the last but it's certainly one of the worst. This one seems set up to allow Gibson to wallow in being tortured and slag off England - for what purpose I really wouldn't know.Thank goodness we didn't pay to see this rubbish. And as well as a travesty, it's boring. As part-Scot myself I resent history being twisted to suit actors or producers or directors who have an axe to grind which is what this movie seems to be. If it isn't, what is it about?"

marulez,"Jan 19, 2007",10/10,"Best movie ever made! I think that Mel Gibson is the best actor/director in Hollywood. No one can rival with him because he is simply the best... A pure movie with no mistakes, no compromises and a very honorable movie with no propaganda in it. This movie is also one of the few movies with no anti-Christian propaganda. As you can see the Scots are Christians and they are praying. Throughout time I saw hundreds, thousands of movies and I tell you that none can rival with this one. I gave it a 10 and I hope you will do the same thing. P.S. The Scots are truly brave people with brave hearts! Freedoom for Scotland!"
RM851222,"Mar 13, 2008",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Braveheart"" (1995) is the movie that beats them all when it comes to a movie that combines historical facts, pure Hollywood fiction, romanticism epic scale. The words can not describe the greatness of this movie. I've cried when i first time saw it. I've seen it about 30 times and it only gets better and better. This is my favorite motion picture of all time.Mel Gibson did a wonderful job with this movie. Direction, performances, music, screenplay, makeup, cinematography - everything in this movie is just incredible and exceptional. At running time 3 hours, these are the fastest and best paced 3 hours one can find in movies.Overall, ""Braveheart"" is a film that is highly rewatchable, inspiring, funny, sad, beautiful, brutal and epic. It's one of the best films ever made."
sillyoctopus,"Jan 21, 2007",10/10,"My comment, to all of those who say that this movie is historically inaccurate, is that the opening lines ""Narrator: I shall tell you of William Wallace. Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is written by those who have hanged heroes."" explain why it is not the story that the history books tell!Arguing over the historical accuracy of a movie is a pointless. Movies are notorious for being inaccurate when ""following"" the plot of a book or the events of history. My advice is that if you enjoy a movie watch it again don't research it because you'll only be disappointed!Braveheart is a fantastic movie which encompasses all the best genres! Mel Gibson may be a bit greedy by being the director and lead role but his portrayal of the character is astounding. (Some of the inaccuracies actually add to the movie, for instance Stephenn the 'crazy' Irishman who is a wonderful character and fits in perfectly!)This should be in the top ten movies of all time!"

cmt-2,"Oct 21, 1998",10/10,Gibson and Wallace have taken a largely unexplored part of history and made an inspirational epic.  Amazing that it's from one of the big studios.
undertaker8908,"Nov 9, 2005",10/10,This was definitely one of the best movies i have seen in all my life. I was 9 when i first saw this movie and it was so well put together that i understood it like i was there. There was so much action and adventure. Mel Gibson was a genius for making this movie and i complement him. At the beginning of the movie it starts off really good unlike a lot of other movies that start off really slow but then when it gets in the middle it picks up so much more and becomes just an action packed thrill ride. It has all the basic elements in it a love story an epic hero trying to stop the cruel and harsh oppression. With combining action adventure and even a bit of comedy this for me is probably one of the greatest movies that i have ever seen in my entire life.
jsawyer,"Oct 10, 1999",2/10,"I will start with the one area of Braveheart that I will give praise to: the battle scenes.  The battle scenes were, for the most part, very accurate and appropriately brutal.  While I did think it was ""cool"" to see William Wallace wielding a military pick at one point in the film, it seemed pretty nonsensical.  It seems as if someone on the set said, ""You know what would be really COOL?  We could have Wallace smash in some guy's head with a big HAMMER!  Yeah, YEAH!""As for the rest of this film -- let me simply say that I probably would have found it to be wonderful if it was about a man named Elphed Beeblebrox and his life-quest to gain freedom for his nation, Goonia, from the evil imperial Shanta and King Twazel II.However, as this movie is simply an exercise in making history as two-dimensional and misrepresentative as possible, I have to give a big obscene gesture out to everyone involved in the more important aspects of making this film.  I'm sure I don't need to go into details about this -- if you actually cared, you'd probably go pick up a book to read about the history of this period.  Let me just set three things straight: both England and Scotland were horrible ""sports"" during this entire protracted war, Edward I died about ten years after Wallace was executed (Ed continued to pound Scotland throughout this entire time),."
info-11708,"Jan 25, 2007",9/10,"I loved this film. I know a lot of people feel that you can question a film based on the integrity of a film maker like Mel. But I say, if this film is a slice of who Mel is then he must be an amazing guy! You must see this film as a man to experience what it must have been like in the old days to fight for what you believe in. Love a woman so much that it hurts too lose her like nothing experienced before. To know the feeling of being betrayed by those you trusted! These are sentiments shown so well in this film and show that Mel is a filmmaker that has seen the other side and tapped his primal man side as well. Watch this film if you want to touch the sense of what most of ""Metro"" guys today are missing! It will teach you again a thing or two about good films and good manhood!"

moosebeard,"Oct 12, 2005",10/10,"I first saw this movie when i was 11 or 12 and instantly knew no other movie could come close to touching this film. Its a enchanting and heroic story with Magnificent actors (mainly the infamous road warrior). Mel was in charge of this one and HE GOT IT DONE !!!!!!!!!!!! The best action and plot and characters and love story all mashed into one film are great. even if u are not Scottish you will be touched by this movie and its inspirational story of love, revenge and belief in a cause. But I would have to say uncle argyle is my favorite character he was perfect and he taught William right and made him the man he was.The battle of Stirling is my favorite seen along with wills speech in the beginning.One thing I didn't really notice until after i had seen this film a few times is that Hamish's father takes a lot of injury during battle until he finally dies in Falkirk. next time u watch keep an eye on Hamish's dad its quite interesting. If you haven't seen this film yet drop what you are doing and go buy it."

Instead, they felt it necessary to give the award to Nic Cage for kissing Elizabeth Shue's breasts.  That is a shame!"
sweaty_chicken2000,"Sep 12, 2005",10/10,"This epic story of patriotism, love, war, sacrifice and spirit shows the bad and the good in mankind and gives a very real and inspiring example as to the glories of freedom and the steps to which a people go to protecting their precious liberty. Worth Every Minute Of Its 3 Hour lengthOne of top 5 movies of all time. Period.I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12.Don't just rent it... go out and buy it.Another good movie, with a similar story of sacrifice and inspiration is Gladiator (the newer version). Well worth seeing and buying as well if you ask me."
kismit,"Feb 13, 2000",N/A,This is definitely best seen on the big screen and I recommend it as a must see for fans of action and romance who enjoy history. The one caveat might be the amount that history was rewritten to fit the story. When I first saw the film I was quite disappointed with the manipulation of historical fact as the lives of many of the key characters have been recorded in some detail and do not fit the Braveheart storyline at all. This is however not meant to be a historical documentary and having now seen the film four times I find the factual inaccuracies don't matter much anymore. The film is an epic period piece of a type not made much anymore and it compares well against any of it's predecessors. I hope Gibson takes another turn at this type of film but he may have set the standard too high.
DeathFish,"May 20, 2006",9/10,"Yes this is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. It is amazingly composed, told and shown. The acting is beautiful beyond words, and the special effects are on the highest level. The movie is basically perfect down to every single detail and is so well made that you believe every bit of it. The story is so exciting and the acting so incredible, that you sit tight throughout the entire movie. Besides that the fact that it is an authentic story makes you think about it even more. This is a classical fairytale about the evil force against the underpowered good in an epic fight for freedom, but it is not a fairytale, it is a historical fact. This is definitely a movie for everyone to see, even though my writing may not fully describe the full excellence of this movie, you should see it if you have not yet, and if you have you should see it again."
sddavis63,"Apr 6, 2012",6/10,"As a tribute to William Wallace - one of Scotland's great national heroes in its ancient (and in some ways still ongoing) battle for freedom from England - this movie works very well. Wallace (portrayed by Mel Gibson) is a heroic figure in this. As a viewer you have no choice but to admire him for his courage and his fierce devotion to Scotland, and for his ability to rally the Scots around him. He certainly comes across as more consistently devoted to Scotland's freedom than, for example, Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFadyen) - which, in truth, he was. The title misleads, however. ""Braveheart"" was the name applied to Robert and not to William, and Robert, generally speaking, has received far greater acclaim in Scottish history.There's a lot to like about this movie. The sets and costumes are wonderful, and there are some spectacular shots of beautiful Scottish scenery throughout. The battle scenes between the Scots and the English are marvellously choreographed, and Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is compelling. The last half hour or so, which revolves around Wallace's capture, torture and finally his execution at the hands of the English is fascinating for its look at some of the torture techniques of the day, and for the same reason, it's disturbing. One gains a sense of the conundrum faced by the Scots, with divided loyalties and shifting alliances among themselves.There are also some things not to like in this, however. One could go on in great detail about the historical inaccuracies - and many have done just that. I have no desire to rehash them - but I will mention the one that really stood out for me: the depiction of the relationship between Wallace and Isabella. Let's first point out that Isabella was about 10 years old when Wallace was executed - making their relationship as depicted here quite unlikely, made moreso by the fact that the two never met, and that Edward I would have been unlikely to have entrusted a diplomatic mission (which is where the two are depicted as meeting for the first time) into the hands of a young female child. There's also the fact that Isabella didn't marry Edward II until 3 years after Wallace's death. For all those reasons, it was ridiculous to suggest near the end that Isabella implied to Edward I on his deathbed that she was carrying a child who was actually the son of Wallace. That portrayal mystified me and bothered me, and really detracts from the overall credibility of the story. It's dealing with a Scottish hero, so one expects dramatic licence and a bit of playing loose with history - but why this, which is so bizarre and so inaccurate? All it does is give a soap-ish feel to the story, while it adds nothing of any real significance.That's my main criticism of this movie - and for me at least, it's a big criticism. It detracts a lot because of its extreme inaccuracy, and because of the amount of unnecessary time the faked relationship takes up in the film. And it adds exactly nothing to the story. So this is a good tribute to William Wallace, definitely portraying him in deservedly heroic terms, but that detour into mere fable is a huge problem. (6/10)"
jago_turner,"Mar 25, 2001",1/10,For a Scotsman watching this film there can only be the sense of some of the most vital legends of a country being raped and pillaged by Hollywood. Disgusting in its sentimental Mad Maxisation of a historical character of great mythic importance to another nation this just goes to show how the financial weight of Hollywood has more influence over popular opinion than the entire sweep of history. Idiotic beyond belief. Two dimensionally racist in its depiction of both Scots and English. Disregarding any truth of what is known about WIlliam Wallace. Shame on everyone who helped put it together.

This movie was great. The battle scenes were amazing, the plot was amazing, it had some humor in it and overall it was really good. This is probably my favorite movie. Whoever says that this movie sucks is an idiot. I can't believe that some people like son of the mask or babie genieuses (which both happen to be on the bottom 100 list) over this.

achyuxiaoyu,"Dec 8, 2006",10/10,"I heard of this movie long long ago, but today is my first time to watch it, and it is not just in name only, but also in reality, a great movie, now and forever. Through all the movie, my heart always hung in the air. When ""Mel Gibson"" smiled, I smiled too, while when he was sad, so did I. This movie took me back to the history, and made it a real history, in my opinion at least. The music is very beautiful, and it appeared always in a proper time so was the graceful sound of Scotland bagpipe, sometimes sorrowful and sometimes solemn and stirring. It is ""a Mel Gibson film"", but other actors and actress also did a good job, they all made this movie a great one."
heylolli71,"Jan 22, 2008",10/10,"Braveheart has inspired war movies like Gladiator and 300 and many others, neither of which come close to the caliber of film put together in Braveheart. This film is an absolute masterpiece that provokes a span of emotions in a viewer. You are thrilled, in suspense, sad and you even feel a little triumphant. You might want to watch it again, but even if you don't you remember it. Not too often do films come along that are this intricate well versed and even though I cannot relate to the situations, who cares it is a great movie. It is well done and very impressionable. Mel Gibson has set the standards in film making"
mmmclaug,"Feb 27, 2006",10/10,"Most people when thinking of such a great movie as Braveheart think of the main character played by Mel Gibson, William Wallace. As a leader he is a noble, brave, and charismatic general. But one of the most over looked characters in the film is not even a Scotsman at all. It is Stephen the Irishman. He is one of Wallace's most trusted officials and is willing to give his life for the Scottish Cause. Stephen is known for being the egocentric Irishman who talks directly to God, simply to ""find an equal"" to an Irishman. So for all you Braveheart fans out there, The mid nineties are not good for such a great movie to Be ranked. Rate it where it should be. Stephen is the man."
Boba_Fett1138,"Jul 27, 2004",10/10,"""Braveheart"" is a modern already classic epic with beautiful scenery, epic fights and a moving score.Quite frankly, I don't care how historical accurate this movie is. Yes, of course the English are portrayed as stereotyped bad guys and I'm sure many more things in the movie are not as accurate as they had been in real life but I have absolutely no problems with it. All I see is a beautiful moving movie and at least I know now who William Wallace was!Everything about the movie is splendid. Visually everything is perfect and the musical score by James Horner is wonderful (For the Love of a Princess is beautiful) and lifts the movie even higher.The grand and spectacular massive fights are brutal and graphic as well as impressive. And having a few hundreds of under-payed extras fighting each other still looks better than having a few hundred CGI characters fighting, let this movie be a lesson to you Hollywood guys and take an example from it.Patrick McGoohan was one of the highlights for me. He was perfect and unforgettable in his role as King Edward I and he delivered his line's perfectly and with lot's of cruelty.The story is impressive, moving and interesting right till the end that might be just a little bit over the top but impressive nevertheless. On one of my recent viewings I noticed lot's of tiny details Gibson put in the movie to make Wallace look like a Jesus figure, especially more notable after Gibson's other movie ""The Passion of the Christ"".Beautiful impressive movie!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
aramis-112-804880,"Dec 31, 2023",N/A,"The Academy loves awarding splashy historical flicks with good stories about people living for ideals with Best Pucture Oscars. ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and, of course, ""Braveheart.""Most of them touch real history at points, though history is always more nuanced than streamlined stories invented by Hollywood, which is the home if money-grubbing big business which occasionally turns out a masterpiece that seems to undermine the values it dotes on.""Braveheart"" is a good movie as, like the others I named, it doesn't feel like it's real length. It moves at a cracking pace.The movie is full of solid performances from Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan and others.Some of these historical movies are more historical than others. ""Amadeus"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" are truly great movies that look beautiful and have great performances but are barely on nodding acquaintences with history. ""Amadeus,"" like ""Lawrence"" and ""Chariots,"" is one of my favorites and I watch it a lot more often.""Braveheart"" is right in there slugging with the best of them.So why do I hate it? Not because the history is nonsense. No historical movie is less historical than ""Shakespeare in Love."" Sure, there's no bridge at the battle of Sterling Bridge and the Scots are fighting in kilts (kilts!) rather than armor, ya-da ya-da, but I'm not offended by the line in SIL where the guy playing the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" tells a woman he's chatting up, ""It's about this nurse . . ."" I'm not offended by Peter O'Toole having half a foot or more on the real T. E. Lawrence; or the mis-identification of Harold Abrahams' G&S singing girlfriend; or the fact that Saliere didn't kill Mozart and was 100 miles away when Mozart died.Perhaps it's a long-time personal antipathy I have toward Gibson. I admire his courage in presenting ""The Passion of the Christ"" (a much better historical movie, albeit not in English). But I simply don't see his charm, from the time my brother and I watched the first ""Mad Max"" flick on TV.I remember an evening a good friend of mine suggested we have a double feature where we each had to watch the others' choices. It was a Mel Gibson evening. She selected ""What Women Want"" and I got ""Chicken Run."" We hated each other's movies. But I didn't mind Gibson in my choice when I couldn't see the guy.Anyway, take all the good things I said about this movie. As a fictional story (like ""Amadeus"") it's acceptable. But though I love tales of people fighting for freedom (which is why I love American history, an ongoing fight for freedom since 1776) I haven't watched this once since I saw it in the theatre nearly 30 years ago. I've been tempted, since I love McGoohan's acting and Sophie was never more beautiful; but I've resisted the temptation.At least, for its length, like the other movies I mentioned, it's never dull. It leaves me cold but that's a subjective thing. If you're indifferent toward Gibson, you might want to watch ""Chicken Run"" instead."
agmoldham,"Dec 1, 2003",6/10,"This film won the Best Picture award in 1995. William Wallace is deeply in love with his childhood sweetheart who is then 	  slain by the English. Wallace vows vengeance and we're treated to a number of battles before he is eventually betrayed.

Heimdal_88,"Jun 5, 2006",7/10,"Nominated for ten Academy Awards and winner of 'Oscars' for Makeup, Sound Effects Editing, Cinematography (John Toll), Best Director and Picture, few can argue that this movie was not well made. This film managed to propel Sir William Wallace, the infamous 13th-century Scottish hero through nearly seven centuries via the magic of a Hollywood script that took great liberties with historical fact.While many praised this movie's epic film making accomplishment, just as many historians decried it's lack of historical accuracy. The film's script, by American screenwriter Randall Wallace (no relation), of William's life, love, and death owes much to Blind Harry, a 15th century minstrel who put his rhymes into writing *150* years after Wallace's execution. Wallace historians and biographers continually dispute part or all of Blind Harry's narrative, but his account of the patriot's life DOES provide the most entertaining version of the tale.Blind Harry also used a heavy hand when sprinkling his tale with bitter sweet passion. His mention of a young maiden named Marion Braidfute of Lamington, who Wallace allegedly courted and wed, provided the inspiration for Murron (Catherine McCormack), Wallace's secret wife in this movie. However, no factual evidence of the marriage survives to corroborate Blind Harry's, and now Hollywood's, tale. On the other hand, Wallace DID murder Sir William Heselrig, English sheriff of Lanmark. Wallace put him to the sword and cut him into pieces in May 1297.One of the film's most intriguing twists is pure Hollywood invention. A calendar puts the LIE to the tale of Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella (Sophie Marceau), wife of Prince Edward II, and the fathering of her child. Isabella and Edward II married in 1307, two years AFTER Wallace's execution. Her son Edward III, was born in the years that followed. Incidentally,Wallace was executed by hanging, drawing and quartering, not by being disemboweled at the gallows as the film suggests. The script was also very unkind to Edward I (Patrick McGoohan) specifically, and to the Normans in general, who no historian will dispute, regardless of tactics, unified a then very culturally diverse England and molded it into the great nation it still is to this day.MANY other inaccuracies appear in this film as well, too many to name here, the most glaring of which had Wallace attired in the more familiar Highlander costumes when he was, in fact, a Lowlander. So what we have here is a film that is almost as much a fantasy as it is an epic. But admittedly, it is the good-guy, bad-guy scenario that is the proved Hollywood formula for success.The true power of this medium is that it has the ability to EDUCATE as well as to entertain, and it's truly shameful that so many viewers think this movie is an accurate representation of historical fact. It is NOT! See it for the character portrayals, costumes and well orchestrated battle scenes. But remember, the story itself is as much a self-serving, Hollywood-formula fantasy, as it is somehow well done."
Dacrab,"May 27, 2005",5/10,"Historically inept, amazingly biased and overall terribly ignorant. I have come to expect nothing less from Hollywood's less than amazing historical epics.Poor acting doesn't usually help but in this case, at least it gives the film some humour. The exaggerations of English EVIL and Scottish pride sickens so much that I am beyond retching. The film goes nowhere towards motioning that the Scottish invaded England constantly in their spare time, this is the reason for England invading and taking over.I'm surprised the king of England didn't have a hump. The next step on from this is to show hoards of Englishmen burning babies for a living then going home smacking their wives having a cup of tea and going to bed in a bowler hat.Thank the sweet lord that Hollywood has better films than this."

Elldaron,"Mar 28, 2025",10/10,"Braveheart is not just a film-it's a living, breathing testament to the unbreakable human spirit. Every frame bleeds with passion, pain, and purpose, echoing the eternal struggle for freedom in the face of tyranny. Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace is more than a performance; it's a raw embodiment of love, loss, and the unyielding cry of a man who refuses to be broken. The sweeping Scottish landscapes, drenched in both beauty and blood, set the stage for a tale that transcends time-a tale where a simple man becomes a legend not through power, but through conviction.The film doesn't just entertain; it wounds you, heals you, and leaves you changed. Wallace's final cry of ""Freedom!"" is not just the climax of a battle-it's the sound of a soul breaking its chains. Braveheart reminds us that true courage is not the absence of fear, but the will to stand tall in spite of it. It's a story carved into the heart of cinema, eternal in its message and unforgettable in its execution."

I personally don't care whether it's historically accurate or not. That's not why I like it. It's just a great movie."
tiskechristopher,"Jul 4, 2013",9/10,"This movie was done extremely well. It's story is one of the best I had ever seen in a film. It will touch your heart, and show you just how powerful love and people's beliefs can be. The story will bring you to life, and portray to the viewer that everyone has a purpose in life.The story is about one of the least selfish men in existence. It goes to show you that there are people out there that care for the greater good. Also, that any task can be accomplished, no matter how big it may be. There's always away, if you set your heart on it.In my opinion, the viewers will get very emotionally touched by this film. It will make you realize how strong a person's will actually can be, if not the strongest thing in the world. I think everyone would enjoy this very well made film. It's really hard to find anything negative about it."
DeepGrey,"Jun 13, 2004",N/A,"Not good. Mel Gibson just itches for an excuse to act in bloody, violent movies (such as Patriot) and this one is no exception. A heavy historical drama falls short with its shallow characters, macho Wallace and predictable, boring battle scenes. For some reason I kept thinking ""Highlander"" and ""Conan the barbarian"", which were much simpler, yet tremendously more enjoyable movies. If ""Patriot"" is your thing, you might probably enjoy this one; otherwise see Mad Max, Lethal Weapon and Payback instead."

If you want to watch something that makes you run the gamut of emotions, with breathtaking cinematography and period correct dialog, then buy, don't rent, this movie.

bryan-clark-93-937081,"Aug 29, 2014",5/10,"This film by Gibson is very imaginative, but should never be interpreted as being historically accurate. Personally, I disliked the graphic violence, the awful details of guts being ripped out, etc., but this degree of violence seems to be the norm for Gibson - he seems to think it adds realism or impact. When he has the Scottish rebel seducing the English queen - well, I'm an Aussie Republican, too, but do we have to resort to this level of dishonesty to make an impression? I think it was a great pity the account did not stay closer to the facts; that would have been sufficient because the ancient truths of the era were impressive enough."

With the help of his friends and the love of a beautiful French queen (Sophie Marceau) Wallace must risk everything to free his people and restore life to his native land.With a mixture of amazing locations, breathtaking acting, brutal war images and an enduring theme, Braveheart will be remembered as one of the greatest movies ever made.

It's the epic tail of my ancestor, Sir William Wallace (Mel Gibson), who was Scotland's greatest patriot. As the movie shows, he fought off the English invaders to death. I admit that the movie did get a few things wrong (namely that the Battle of Stirling was fought on a bridge, not in a field), but it definitely deserved Best Picture.I should remind you that this is not the sort of movie that should be viewed by just anyone. The battle scenes are more violent than anyone could imagine. But this is one movie where violence is an integral part of the story. A masterpiece in the true sense of the word."

This is movie-making at its best, it does not get better than this.Mel Gibson is one of my all-time favorite actors. While some movies entertain, this is a movie that makes you explore the history, search for names and events, you start to appreciate Scotland, even if you have nothing Scottish in terms of nationality. I'm Slovenian and after watching this movie I felt Scottish for a second there. Truth be said, probably 99,99% viewrs did.That is the power of true storytelling and the impact of the sense you are fighting for the right cause.The only thing that concerns me in these modern days is that every idiot thinks he is fighting for the greater good, but that is a topic for some other debates.Masterpiece and truly a gift to the movie industry."

peejmeister86,"May 8, 2003",N/A,"Mel Gibson sure has one enormous chip on his shoulder(and to think he followed this up with 'The Patriot').Possibly one of the most xenophobic pieces of historical inaccuracy ever laid upon film, Braveheart's undoubtably impressive recreation of medieval life and well staged battle sequences can't hide its childish and tired depiction of the English. I don't doubt that they committed some awful atrocities but Patrick McGoohan's pantomime King Edward is a jeering, sneering, cliche too far - I was almost expecting Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham to make a cameo appearance. I won't even get started on the history - but as a film and piece of fiction the movie is overlong and the performances only adequate, watch for the battle sequences but ignore the rest. It's a travesty that films such as this can win the Oscar for best picture when The Lord of the Rings was snubbed by the academy - after all, they're both fantasy films."
t_egefjord,"Dec 14, 2005",7/10,"I love this film; don't get me wrong - it's great! I'm a medieval freak, and so I enjoy the battles and the milieu and all that. And I like the Scottish people and their humour. However, I am very disappointed that so many historical factual errors have been made. Of course, you cannot get it all right - and some things have to be adjusted to please audiences and keep a red thread and in order to make a great film. BUT: There are several things that could have been done historically correct. For instance, the Battle of Stirling. Why not include the bridge as it was essential to the outcome of the battle? What's the point of the intimate relationship between the future Princess of Wales and Wallace? Seeing as she was just a little girl at the time it doesn't make much sense to invent this relationship. And the sacking of York - what's the purpose of inventing this? Not being in control of Scotland would be serious enough for Edward to send the army north. Besides, a rebel army such as this would not be able to lay siege to a walled town like York at this time.My main point is: If film makers think that the story or themes are most important then they should leave historical figures alone and invent their own. Of course, they may include historic events and persons, but they should not form the core of a fictional venture."
erinnpayne,"Apr 12, 2013",10/10,"I absolutely love this movie! It won Oscars and deserved them. The cinematography, acting, directing and general feel and theme of the movie is fantastic. It really allows people all over the world to learn about the great Scottish hero, William Wallace and Robert Bruce although i disagree with The portrayal of Robert the Bruce in the movie. Yes, it is not historically accurate but historically accurate does not make a movie, entertainment factor does. Despite the inaccuracies I believe the movie deserves only the highest of appraisal and is a huge accomplishment in film making. The soundtrack is breathtaking and really sets the mood. The acting is among the most believable performances ever and there is of course the occasional lighthearted comedy to lighten the mood. I must congratulate Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson and how can I forget Stephen The Mad Irishman played by David o'hara. I've watched this movie more times than I can count. As an English person I still love the movie despite the bias towards Scottish, but hey, there has to be a her and a villain in every movie, right? Loved it"
margaux-feral,"Mar 3, 2017",7/10,"Braveheart is actually not a historical movie, just an adventure/action movie. But I thought it was not a bad film either. I think the movie was well-made, it was pleasant to watch but in my opinion, Mel Gibson over-played his part so it wastes the character of Wallace. And as I said it isn't a historical movie when you know all the mistakes like: the Scottish didn't wear kilts at this time, some fights in the film are invented, they went too far on a point: the Prima Noctis; Lords didn't really used it), and many others. So if you wanted to know about the history of Scotland, you shouldn't watch this movie, if you want to know the basis maybe but be careful. The love story between the princess of England and Wallace is really really too much and another big mistake in a historical way. Some people say it was annoying as a movie but I didn't think it was as annoying as they think, some scenes are interesting. And I thought the King of England and Robert the Bruce are two great characters, these two actors make a good job ! To resume, it wasn't a bad movie but it can easily be much better, it is not historical, don't trust what you see immediately. But some great actors play in, so it is a good point."
kevin-h-720-45317,"Jun 24, 2013",1/10,"Dear dear me........this was nearly as bad as the film ""Titanic"" were the English are portrayed as locking Irish passengers below decks to drown as it was against the rules to allow them on the upper decks even as the ship was sinking!! to say that Brave heart comes across as racist and insulting is to put it mildly. All that has been said regarding historical inaccuracies has already been said in previous reviews. Mel certainly seems to have an Axe to grind or in this case a broadsword with the English and much like the patriot it portrays a nation that spawned the biggest empire the world has seen as inept duplicitous cowards(way to go Mel) have give this load of tripe a (1) as I cannot give it a zero.....I think there are a few Englishmen who would like to bump into this jumped up little dwarf and give him a history lesson......."
smacback-715-605926,"May 22, 2019",10/10,"This is a movie that is spectacular in almost every dimension. Cinematography is amazing. Historical plot line is amazing even with the Hollywood additions, but nevertheless a solid historical perspective. The acting is excellent from William Wallace to Long Shanks, the King of England. I cannot think of a single deficiency in this movie. Great action, Honor, Romance, every human emotion is captured, some good humor and epic battle scenes. Worth the watch if you haven't seen it or if you have for the 10th time."
mac_unknown,"Feb 2, 2022",10/10,Hands down better than anything out there like it. Well done in every aspect. The movie is a work of art. I believe Mel said he worked on this for 5 years. No movie had moved me as much as this one day. Took me away for a couple hours. I think this is also a trend setter as one of the first movies of its time and type to run for over 2 hours.
shullster,"Jul 17, 2000",10/10,"This is a grand epic of love and liberty backdropped against the William Wallace saga.  Although the movie is ""Hollywoodized,"" the primary message of the movie (freedom from oppression) and all the human elements Gibson tried to present (our countless human frailties and the powerful bond of love) were brilliantly painted on the big screen canvas!"
nationofachilles,"Jun 19, 2006",10/10,"This movie deserves so much more than it got. The story line is amazing, the backstabbing. and how Wallace only loses when he trusts his own people and is deceived. The directing is amazing, Gibson did a great job making sure every great moment was felt. The music is amazing, the soundtrack for this movie is one I have purchased. It is good just to listen to and even better fitting in with the music. The cast is well picked. Gibson did a great job starring, and his sidekicks fit the parts perfectly. The king of England just looked ruthless, and the princesses face could make anybody fall in love with her. Brilliantly picked cast. But the best part of the movie is the message."
aero_nut,"Jun 15, 2001",10/10,"To say the absolute least I was speechless at the end of this movie.  Its not perfect, but so close its scary.  I have this listed as my #2 movie. (I can't seem to find a number 1)  Based on actual events, (with the exception that princess Isabella was really a toddler when this was going on). It takes a hold of you by the shirt and dosen't let go until the last line is spoken.  The 3 hours it takes to watch this film is well deserved.  Supurbly cast and acted, and not only by Gibson.  But I believe the supporting deserves a standing ovation.Sophie Marceu looks like a princess even when she doesn't have to play one. She is so poised and proper, statuesqe almost. And plays a woman who is not loved by the man she married, which is all she wants, to be loved.Angus Macfaden was brilliant as Robert the Bruce, a man torn between what he knows is right and doing what he has to do to stay loyal to his titles and family name.David O'hara as Stephen. The crazy Irishman who saves Wallaces life on several occasions, he really brought the charator to life.Brendan Gleeson also did well as Hamish, Wallaces childhood buddy and one of his right hand men.Randall Wallace the script writer did an exceptional job by not concentrating on one thing too much.  It wasn't constantly serious, the romance was there but not overly exploited and the comedy that pops out at the oddest times.  And though the blood shed was tremendous it was tastefully done, for the story line reminds us constantly of the tyranny and persecution these people were facing, therefore making the slaughter seem more justified.I recommend this movie to everyone.  Unless youre a movie critic and get paid to, You cant find much wrong with this movie."
andrzejsemeniuk,"May 30, 2003",N/A,"what a disappointment. as a movie, it is crap; childish script, shallow characters, hollywood production.  i had to fast forward through most of it, wish i could get back that 1 hour stolen from my life.  it has some good scenes of combat, and cinematography is not bad, but overall you will see it is a mindless ""film"", a fairytale of instinctive and childish passions, fails to inspire.  it is boggling my mind why this movie is rated high or that it even won an oscar.  1/10"
hollis56,"Sep 12, 1999",7/10,"I truly enjoyed this movie, from the direction and realism of the medieval battle scenes, to the cinematography and score. However, for the sake of equal time, please note the following information.""Edward I might be taken as a pattern of the medieval king. He is remembered on the whole for his achievements rather than by his personality. Tall, strong and handsome in figure, he was magnificently royal in presence, clear and emphatic in speech, forceful and enterprising in action. He was uncertain in temper, but reasonable in council. Above all, he attempted to live by the ideal of Christian knighthood -- devoutly gallant and heroically chivalrous.""I'm not saying the book I culled this information from is any more accurate -- we are talking about events that took place 700 years ago. But don't take this movie to heart as the whole truth. Examples of history vs. Hollywood:William Wallace was 19 when his father was killed. He had killed English soldiers before his father's death. The French princess first arrived in England years after Wallace died. Edward I lived years after Wallace's death.My favorite error/omission was that in the movie the Battle of Stirling Bridge was in an open field without a bridge in sight. The bridge was the key element to Wallace's victory."
Jack28M,"May 3, 2002",6/10,"A comment by dr_necron on March 7th states that Wallace met Isabella when she was 12 years of age which was the year before his death.  I find this hard to believe because he was in hiding in Scotland at the time and she was mainly in France.  Does anyone have any information to support this? I would appreciate such info. She married Edward II after Wallace had been killed, but in the movie she is married to Edward while he lives.  She is shown in the movie to mediate between the Scots and Edward I, but she actually was a mediator between Edward II and the Barons.  She was a remarkable woman!  Her real life would make quite a movie.  She put her son on the throne in place of her husband and then he eventually put her in prison for most of her life.  She lived to be 66 which was quite old for those times. The battle scenes in this movie are very well done.  The acting is excellent.  However, I would have preferred Wallace to have a different lover, one his own age."
glenxxvi,"Jun 16, 2007",10/10,"i must say that i am very surprised to find that this film is currently ranked no. 96 on IMDb and that it gets 8.3 out of 10. i think that this film deserves at least 9 out of 10. and ranked 96, is that all it gets? it should at least be in the top ten, i don't know if it's the best film ever made but it's certainly up there with the best. this film has everything, the music score is great, the actors are great (some of them i've never even heard of before and never seen since, but they're good anyway) and the story is extremely well done, even if it is historically inaccurate. the film is so good that the three hours go by ever so quickly and the fight scenes are good and bloody, normally fight scenes in other films are boring and/or hard to follow but this isn't. what's really good is the battle of wits between king edward (longshanks) and william wallace. it's almost like a game of chess on film, wallace controls the Scottish and the king controls the English and what's really amazing is the sense that without their leaders each country would be lost, as longshanks says' they're sheep, merely sheep, easily dispersed if we strike the shepard.' i could be here all day just telling you why this film is so good but if you've already seen it then you already know, if not then get it because you will keep it, trust me. i haven't seen mel Gibson's latest work, apocolpyto but if it's half as good as this then it will be excellent."

I laughed,got angry,i even cried at some scenes,that to me is the sign of a great movie.When it can make you feel all those emotions in one sitting. Mel Gibson did a great job as a director and as the leading man in the movie 'BRAVEHEART' he carried that movie!And i cant forget the excellent supporting cast :Loved the father-son relationship between 'brendan gleeson' and 'james cosmo',Patrick McGoohan as longshanks(He played the character so evil i loved it),Catherine McCormack as murron,Angus Mcfadyan as robert the bruce,even the cameo from brian cox was excellent.Not one bad performance in this movie! 10 out of 10 !Awesome movie !!!"
Cocacolaguy912-2,"Feb 6, 2007",10/10,"It took me a long time to see ""Braveheart"". I finally did last week and my very high expectations were met and pleased. There is nothing to say about this movie except that it is among one of the best war epics ever made in addition to just be a masterpiece of a film in any genre. This film is brutally realistic, not sugar coated by scenes of touching moments or too much of a love story...that being said, the film is very powerful. Here we have a man, Wlliam Wallace, who's determination to unite and gain independence was incredibly moving. Everything about Braveheart is near flawless. One thing that stands out is the music which just makes you want to cry...not because it is depressing but because it adds to the incredible emotional aspect of this film.If you have not seen this amazing piece of film, move it to the top of your list."

samuelcking,"Feb 18, 2006",10/10,"There has been very few films that have been able to capture a person's heart the way that Braveheart does. From the very beginning to the very end, it leaves the viewer intrigued with the life of William Wallace. The score in this film is absolutely perfect and puts the audience emotionally on par with the events in the film.I cannot speak highly enough for the performances of everyone involved. From the English guards all the way to the King of England, the casting is perfect. This film is an absolutely must see for anyone who enjoys historical epics. I've personally seen it at least 20 times and never get tired of it."
Jonas Tigerschiöld,"Mar 15, 2021",10/10,"One can count as many historical inaccuracies as one likes in this movie of the legendary Scotsman, but it is nonetheless a glorious accomplishment. It's a sweeping epic, and has all the trimmings you'd like. It has romance, action, betrayals, swerves, big battles and a cackling villain you love to hate. For all its length it never bores and is endlessly rewatchable. I've watched it ever since 1995 in the theater, made a traditional thing every year, and on top of all that it has been received the great treatment of 4K on Blu-Ray. Simply love this movie and has taken place in my Top 10 of all time."
wasp8,"May 31, 2020",N/A,"Cinema is supposed to be art but this movie is just like a tv episode, and a really, really long one. there are at least two major cutting/editing mistakes and the characters are so shallow like they came out of a children's book with their super predictible lines and all the courage related messages they are trying to impose to the viewers over and over throughout the entire movie. for me it was a waste of time"
planktonrules,"Jul 22, 2022",7/10,"Technically speaking, BRAVEHEART is an exceptionally well made movie. It's got a rousing plot, great scope and leaves the viewer impressed. However, as I am a retired history teacher, I was compelled (as usual) to investigate the story...and found much of it wasn't true at all and was changed to make the story more interesting...something I really dislike about many historical pictures. So, the affair with the queen, the death of the Prince's 'favorite', the Battle of Bannockburn occurring just after and a result of Wallace's death (it was 9 years later)...just not true at all. Still, if you ignore some bad history here and there, it's worth seeing. One of Mel Gibson's better films even with the historical problems."
teresabeckham,"Nov 7, 2006",10/10,i watched this film last night for the first time since i was a young girl and i have to say this is the best film ever made no matter what anyone says Mel Gibson is the greatest actor in the world and he has the most endearing beautiful eyes i have ever seen his wife is a lucky woman love him so much. All the cast were excellent Bruce was great and the princes was brilliant so was long shanks. Mel Gibson is the greatest ever and he is also brilliant in forever young. For a man his age i think he is just brilliant. Anyone that thinks Goodfellas or whatever you call that film is better than Brave heart there is something wrong with your head. My favourite scene was the one were William and Pricess Issabelle kissed I think both actors were very convincing and you could see the William really did love his first wife. This film will never be forgotten i also think Mel added good humour into the film especially the scenes at the battlefield were they flashed at the enemies. Mel is a brilliant actor as well as a brilliant director.and all yas English people that are saying that mel Gibson made the English to evul well he didn't mak them as evil as they really are he portrayed this film brilliantly and his Scottish accent was just brilliant and everyone from Scotland that dissapproved of Mel in this film and mocked his accent should be ashamed of yourselfs Mel did your country proud so stop your yapping. Mel is the best in the world and the irish love him especially me x x x
aleksanderk-95350,"Mar 8, 2021",7/10,"A great well acted film by Mel Gibson. The battle scenes are very well done. The whole cast does a good job.

General_Cromwell,"Oct 27, 2002",1/10,"What an absolutely godawful cod-sporran-swinging monstrosity this film is.Mel Gibson shows himself to be the pompous,self righteous,English hating berk i always suspected he was.Anyone who proclaims this to be,""The best film ever made!""

Especially the war scenes are almost real. I don't think of anyone's heart not pumping adrenalin when watching the movie. It takes you all to the times of middle age in England. The war fields and the acting of warriors are so realistic that you feel yourself there. Thanks to the director and leading actor of the film, Mel Gibson. Also thanks to the academy for awarding oscar to this wonderful movie."

The cinematography, the soundtrack and of course, the story... all were to the mark !! Sophie Marceau and Angus Macfadyen also played their role pretty well as Princess Isabelle and Robert the Bruce respectively. Most of the people believe that it was not the perfect depiction of the life of the Scotland legend but still it was not that easy for any other director other than Gibson to portray the life of Wallace in just 177 min.yes of course, when it comes to the biopic then it is not a classic like Gandhi (1982), Goodfellas (1990) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962) but still i strongly recommend Braveheart to everybody.... wholeheartedly.... simply...10/10"
shambrinkhalid,"Mar 29, 2021",9/10,One of the best movies in Hollywood. The movie is about a scotsman named William wallace and his fights for the freedom of the Scottish people. The scenery of the filming location in Scotland and Ireland are beautiful and breathtaking.
jared-25331,"Jan 4, 2025",10/10,"Braveheart (1995) is a first time watch for me, but this is a movie I've heard of for years. Now I understand that people have complained and criticized this movie for it's historical inaccuracy, but for me I'm willing to forgive all those mistakes because this movie was truly epic.Positives for Braveheart (1995):
Now I have to give it to Mel Gibson for his phenomenal directing here and while I know people don't want to acknowledge him now for obvious reasons, I've always had respect for what he has contributed to the world of cinema. Regardless of that, Gibson still does a fantastic job at getting the audience to feel the epic atmosphere of the story. I also have to say that Mel Gibson does an excellent job with his performance as William Wallace who is easily one of the greatest movie characters in the history of cinema. For a movie on the verge of 3-hours long, Gibson does a great job with the pacing and the three act movie structure. I really enjoyed the cast of characters and the banter between them throughout the movie. I was also very surprised by the amount of humor here and it worked for me. The action sequences are epic and I appreciate how brutal they are. And finally, I liked that the movie ends without telling us what happened and it allows the audience to form their own ending.Overall, Braveheart (1995) is a true epic in every way possible and I'm surprised that this movie did win some awards at Oscars because they were well deserved."
m_a_singer,"Jul 14, 2001",N/A,"Simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and one of the few I couldn't even finish. After five minutes, my partner and I began to mutter to ourselves about the sloppy editing, ridiculous dialogue, and wretched performances (it's probably best not to cast child actors who can't control their facial muscles). At ten minutes, mutters had become outraged snorts and laughter - couldn't the editor have even *tried* to sync the piper's fingers with the terribly unrealistic pipe music? At 15, right after he said, ""Look! It's the ghost of Basil Rathbone!"", we turned it off, figuring that if they didn't have the sense to edit out the crap by that point (admittedly, by then eliminating what sucked would have involved a totally different script, editor, and actors, and about 12 minutes less film), they never would."
cyvais,"Nov 16, 2005",9/10,"During the funeral scene of William Wallace's father and brother. As everyone is standing around listening to the prayer service, there is a change of camera angle sequence that reveals a mistake in regard to cast placement within the scene. As the priest finishes the sermon and the camera focuses on young Murron, everyone begins to move away... it's at this point that you'll notice that in most of the edits Murron is standing in front of her mother and stage right of her sister. But one reveals her standing in front of her father and stage left of her sister just before she reaches for the flower she hands Wallace. She then is switched back to stage right. By the way, notice that the young Earl Of Bruce kinda looks like John Cryer?"
wilm-1,"Feb 28, 2002",6/10,"This movie is at its best in the big battle scenes. However, it goes on forever. Like ""Giant"", it's great to look at, but it's long and has many dull subplots that make it tough to follow. I admire Mel Gibson for the hard work he put into this movie and his role as Braveheart, but the evil king Edward is the more interesting of the two."
Tanya-Valeria,"May 12, 2006",1/10,"Mel Gibson really does seem to have a downer on the English doesn't he? But my dislike of this film is certainly not based on some misplaced jingoistic pride.I'm quite a history fan and I don't mind at all when the sins of the father are hung out to dry. But I do insist on credible - don't insult my intelligence with a pantomime villain and romanticised plot developments. William Wallace was the father of Edward III? Give me a break, Edward II having other um, 'interests' doesn't mean he couldn't father a child, or that his wife is likely to sleep with Scottish outlaws.As for Edward, the ruthless, brilliant strategist and general; getting his archers to fire on his own forces in a mêlée - yes that must be how he was so successful a military commander. Confidence and loyalty-inspiring stuff.The only difference between this and the Alan Ladd Knight of Olde fifties Hollywood crap is that you saw people's arms being chopped off. Yes, the violence is more realistic. That's it.I prefer my corn on the cob, not the screen."
pernickety-hall8,"May 31, 2005",8/10,"Frist of all, let me be clear about the fact that l did enjoy Braveheart a lot, And l would have to put it in as one of my all time favourites. However it does not mean that l ignore the historical inaccuracies of the film. And reading many of the reviews on this site, it is clear that many people seem to gain their grasp of history from films and television and not from the facts as we know them. So l will try to help a few of you out there. This is what l had manged to find out about William Wallace after being inspired by the film. Both my parents are Scot's and often spoke to me about Wallace long before any film. It appears to many Scot's (like my parents) that Wallace continues to be an inspiration for an independent 'Scotland' and his struggle (like all for Freedom) captures the hearts of many. But most Scot's that l know, my parents included, have no real desire to be independent of England, in fact the UK has always been stronger united than separate. Wallace's inspirational achievements may well be greater than his actual achievements and this could be his greatest legacy. So some facts. 1. Wallace was born into what was believed to be a minor 'noble' family - a sort of 'county gentleman' not a Lord. However recent evidence suggests he was a game keeper or professional tracker or hunter - but certainly of lower class then previously believed. He was a lowlander! 2.Scotland and England at been at peace for over 100 years until the death of the Scotish King, Edward the 1st of England then tried to put a 'puppet' king on the throne of Scotland. Scotland said no and England invaded - Edward removed the puppet King and claimed the throne of Scotland for himself. 3. There is little known about Wallace's life before this time, but what evidence we have suggest's he was already an 'outlaw'; but seems that he did try and fight the English when ever he could after Edward took the throne of Scotland. 4. Wallace's actions seemed to be a rallying cry for many Scot's and his numbers grew - encouraged by the the Church he openly targeted English forces and administration centres. 5. At the Same time a Scotish Knight called Andrew Mornay began actions in the north of Scotland ( forces you see in the film that come down to join Wallace at the Battle of Stirling) 6. Wallace did have a wife or lover killed by the English and he did Kill the English Commander of Lanark in response ( We know this because at his trail it was one of the only recorded actions of Wallace's that was mentioned and we have documents about) 7. The Battle of Stirling was fought over a Bridge, not on an open field. 8.Wallace did invade England but not as far as York (as shownin the film) 9. He never had a relationship with the Princess of Wales as she would have only been about 4 years old at the time. 10. Wallace lost the battle of Falkirk due to the power of the English longbow and his own cavalry fleeing. (shown in the film) - however Falkirk was the first time during the middle ages that heavy cavalry had been stopped by foot soldiers. 11. Wallce went to France for several years - returned and after a few small actions was captured and killed as shown in the film; but did not shout FREEDOM at his death - sorry to say. 12. Robert the Bruce was never at Falkirk - he was 50 miles away. 13. Edward the 1st died a number of years later after Wallace, not at the same time. 14. Wallace has believed to be about 6'7"" tall and could have been as young as 20 to 24 at the Battle of Stirling.Wallce is a true hero of Scotland and his 'stepping' on to the pages of history was short but dramatic - he did inspire the nobles to fight for Scotlands freedom."
bilging,"Mar 1, 2025",9/10,"An unforgettable historical drama that masterfully blends intense battle sequences, emotional depth, and grand storytelling. Mel Gibson delivers a passionate performance as William Wallace, embodying both the ferocity of a warrior and the heart of a leader. The cinematography captures the rugged beauty of Scotland, while the score enhances every moment with a hauntingly epic feel. The battle scenes are brutal and exhilarating, immersing viewers in the rawness of medieval warfare. Though not entirely historically accurate, the film's emotional impact and powerful themes of freedom and sacrifice make it a cinematic masterpiece."
SaifS-78,"Nov 21, 2025",10/10,"Mel Gibson's masterpiece. The drama, the atmosphere, the story, the Romance, the music!! This movie has it all. If they ask me ""which one movie that you will choose to watch for the rest of your life?"" It's definitely BRAVEHEART. Such a Magical movie. To me, its one of the top 10 movies of all time."
boba-11,"May 24, 1999",10/10,"Breathtaking, dramatic, with a touch of humour, Braveheart takes the viewer on a whirlwind of emotions as we see the reasons for revolt against oppression.  Mel Gibson's direction makes for an vivid depiction of art, battle and dialogue.  Bravo."
Francisco-948,"May 24, 2025",10/10,"The epic story of William Wallace is crafted in such a way that, from beginning to end, you feel like you're in those damp Scottish wildernesses, with bagpipes following you in the wind, swords and rocks everywhere, as you feel that fight for freedom boiling inside you. You feel both kinds of courage: that of impulsive, gallant valor, and that of the anger and frustration of those who seek justice with no apparent answer. The battle scenes are savage and, therefore, highly realistic. Howard Shore's music has few rivals in the history of film soundtracks. An ode to bravery, just as its title suggests. A showcase of what Scotland has to offer, and a meaningful film for an entire nation. If anyone steals the show and it's not Wallace, it's definitely Robert the Bruce, and ever since I saw it, I've been wanting to see a sequel showing how he continued the legacy. The princess is also incredible; she commands every moment she's in. The villains are despicable, and the heroes, even with all their flaws, instill in you that loyalty and attitude that makes them heroes not only in the eyes of the viewer, but also in the eyes of history."
masamosotin,"May 30, 2025",10/10,"There are films that entertain.There are films that educate.And then there are films that ignite something inside you-something ancient, visceral, and profoundly sacred.Braveheart is that kind of film.Watching Mel Gibson's Braveheart is not just watching a movie; it's feeling history move through your blood. It's not about timelines or politics. It's about the fire in a man's soul when he rises to defend what he holds most dear. And for me, that is what Braveheart captures with aching, uncompromising, unwavering beauty.From the windswept hills of Scotland to the brutal battlefields where courage meets carnage, William Wallace's journey is a mirror held up to every man who has ever stood-not for glory, not for praise-but for his people. His family. His land.And when Wallace rallies everyone-even the king-and screams ""FREEEDOOOM!"", it's not just one of the most memorable cinematic moments ever. It's a universal cry. Ancient. Eternal.And if it's not obvious yet:
I felt that cry in the marrow of my bones.Because Braveheart reminded me of my own story.My service. My struggle. The battles I fought-not just in uniform, but in every hour I've worked to build a life worthy of the sacrifices made before me. It reminded me of my father. Of my grandfather. But above all-of my great-grandfather.The greatest man in our bloodline.A man who didn't just fight metaphorically-he bled and died at the Karelian Isthmus, defending our homeland from those who tried to erase it. Erase us. Erase our way of life. The sentiment that drives Braveheart-that fire-is hauntingly similar to the one that lived in him.My great-grandfather never lived to see the peace I've lived in.The peace he paid for-with his life.But Braveheart made me feel like I stood beside him again. Shoulder to shoulder. Blade in hand. Heart ablaze. It gave his memory a face in William Wallace. A voice. A purpose. It made me weep-with pride and pain-because in Wallace, I didn't just see a Scottish hero.I saw my bloodline.And more importantly, I saw every man who's ever been willing to give his life for a cause greater than himself.There's a deep, almost spiritual honesty in this film's message:
That freedom-true freedom-is worth everything. Even your life.And no, I don't give a damn about the historical inaccuracies. Braveheart isn't here to lecture you. It dares you to feel.And I did.And so have many others.And many more will.This is not just a film. It's a monument.A cinematic tribute to every nameless warrior buried beneath the soil of his homeland, whose only prayer was that the generations after him might live free.Every Christmas, I go with my dad to see my great-grandfather.And I thank him.Call me looney all you want. But every single thing I have-every breath of peace, every inch of freedom-I owe to him.Lest we forget the real heroes.So if you ask me what I think of Braveheart, I won't talk in star ratings or critical analysis.I'll simply yell from the bottom of my lungs:
FREEEEEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOOOOOOMM!!And I know...
Vilho yells it with me."
Draecke,"Jul 12, 1999",N/A,"Another overmelodramatic, overacted, and overrated ""historical"" blockbuster out of Hollywood.  I thought the virulent anti-English tone that permeates the whole movie was too much to take.  ""Braveheart"" wasn't terrible, but for a more realistic, artistic, and authenticly Scottish film in the same genre, I would highly recommend ""Rob Roy""."
spinin,"Dec 8, 1999",9/10,"""Braveheart"" is a very impressive war epic, especially since it was directed by Mel Gibson. Before the movie won any oscars, I had no idea that Gibson was capable of such filmmaking. Here, he effectively recreates a legendary story of Scotland's battle for freedom from England.This three hour picture focuses on the life of William Wallace (Mel Gibson) and his courageous attempts to lead Scotland to victory in the 13th century. A peaceful man by nature, Wallace is driven toward violence after his beloved wife is executed by English soldiers. Having lost his father earlier to the English as well, he is no longer capable of standing aside and allowing the enemy to rule his life. As he coldly and vengefully kills the men responsible for his wife's death, he begins a revolution. Brave men are quick to help him in this battle and desire more. Wallace, unsure of his goals, is eventually persuaded by his men to continue even further. He accepts the role of leader as a classic quest for freedom unfolds.The cinematography in ""Braveheart"" is excellent, especially during the battle scenes. Some of the most energetic and quite graphic sequences occur during the fighting. Gibson plays Wallace very well. The hero vows never to give up, and often when it appears that all odds are against him, he still manages to overcome them in some way. Cold and determined, Wallace still remains a good person. He will not accept defeat nor will he accept compromise. Along the way he meets the unhappy wife of King Edward's son. Princess Isabelle is played by Sophie Marceau, who I really like and respect now after also seeing her terrific performance in ""The World is Not Enough."" They find beauty in each other and Isabelle is inclined to aid Wallace in his battle.The acting is superb and the film is very well made. Wallace's heroic will and his endless efforts are evident in Gibson's performance. The story is smart and well written, and the entire outcome is not too obvious. The film could have been even better if a couple of scenes were omitted. For example, during battle, the Scottish raise their kilts one time too many in order to flash the English army. An unnecessary shot of one Scot getting his rear hit with an arrow follows. Also, this film is yet another war epic in a long list fine war movies. It seems that those types of films are too safe and too easy to make. No one will ever hate them. While ""Braveheart"" is probably not better than ""Platoon"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" it is right up there with them. Aside from a couple of sequences I would have liked to see edited out, this movie is terrific. The cinematography creates a story world where there is very little not to like. This movie deserved the oscar it received. Overall a 9 out of 10."
The_Movie_Cat,"Jul 20, 2000",6/10,"That says it all in a way. Maybe if I had watched Braveheart alone I would have liked it a whole lot less. Yet I took this one out on video after seeing ""The Patriot"", my curiosity piqued to see if this was as fundamentally bad.It isn't, of course, and watching in conjunction with that film made me appreciate this one a whole lot more. The Patriot is melodramatic, trite, sentimental and showily directed. Braveheart may have its dream sequences, stereotypical bagpipes and the odd duff line, but generally it's pretty good for Hollywoodised history. I don't even mind the fact that history has been severely distorted, either. After all, this is a film, and every film needs its heroes and villains. The picture may be entirely one-sided in it's portrayal of the Scot/English divide, but at least the ""enemy"" in this one get more than the boo-hiss one-dimensionality of ""The Patriot"".However, while this isn't high-minded enough to be a great historical epic and isn't totally worthy of the five Oscars it received (and, while nominated for more, they were all technical, none for acting) it is sturdy, average entertainment. In fact, what makes it of note, and justifies its watchability are really just two things:1. Patrick McGoohan, No.6 himself, having a thoroughly good time as the outrageously mad King;2. The Scottish accents. Maybe the American audience that thought they were getting an honest historical was convinced by the laughably fake ""accents"". Gibson was far from the worst, incidentally. But even so, anyone who lives in the whole of the British Isles would be unlikely to sit through this film without crying tears of laughter as this Australian, would-be US actor tells us what it's like to be a Scotsman.For those two factors alone, Braveheart is priceless."
Caz1964,"Mar 22, 2006",1/10,"How this film won so many Oscars is beyond me.To start with its totally inaccurate,it looks like a typical excuse for Mel Gibson to try and look macho and at the same time practice his racial hatred on us English.I don't know about anyone else,but i saw this film about ten years ago and the thing i remember most about it apart from his silly hairdo,was the sheer offensiveness of it,I've never watched it since.He implies that the kings son was homosexual,which there's no evidence of,and then implies that homosexuals are evil people,how bad is that in the 20th century.Films have been banned for implying a lot less.But on the whole why cant he just leave our history alone and do something useful like make a film about the Aborigines or the American Red Indians,which is more his neck of the woods,not tear British history apart with how he wants to see it.I'm worried that he may try and make a version of the Battle of Britain,could you imagine it,he would probably portray the English as sitting around drinking tea saying,go on taffy and jock old boy go and kill some Hun for us ha ha tally ho.It would be that bad."
AggelosTsatsa,"Feb 11, 2025",10/10,"When I really started being interested in movies I made a list of about forty or forty five all time, Oscar winning classics on apple notes. Braveheart was one of the first ones that I saw. Out of the whole list I wanted to watch the ones that everyone is making a big fuss about like Interstellar or Fight Club. My dad insisted and showed me Braveheart. Out of all the movies that I saw after this, none beat it. It is perfect in every aspect. It tells a love story, a war story, a friendship story and a political story. It also perfectly captures the essence of every emotion from love to anger to sadness to disappointment. It is long but it had me on the edge of my seat every second. The ending was EXTREMELY satisfying and this movies has really changed my view on history. Mel Gibson did an excellent job at telling an untold story."
Hakihiko,"Oct 11, 2025",8/10,"""Braveheart"" stands as one of the most powerful and emotionally charged historical epics ever made - a film that, despite its imperfections and liberties with history, delivers a deeply moving and cinematic experience. Mel Gibson's direction is bold and sweeping, filled with grandeur and grit, while his performance as William Wallace embodies the raw defiance and passion that drive the story forward.The battle sequences remain some of the most intense and viscerally shot ever put on screen - brutal, chaotic, yet beautifully staged, giving the sense of both the horror and heroism of war. The cinematography captures the natural beauty of the Scottish landscape, turning it into both a character and a symbol of freedom. James Horner's score is haunting and magnificent, elevating nearly every emotional moment.If there's a flaw, it's in the runtime and occasional dramatic excess - some parts could have been tighter, and the romantic subplots feel slightly overplayed. Still, those are small drawbacks in a film that combines emotional depth, powerful storytelling, and visual spectacle so effectively. ""Braveheart"" may not be historically precise, but as a cinematic experience, it's stirring, memorable, and timeless."
SuvenduM-90,"Oct 5, 2025",10/10,"Very good storyline,real storyline and very good acting and direction..its a real story and its very inspiring. Its storyl of bravery and truthfulness. Also a example of how own people are reason of our lose in majority time. A must watch movies. It will make u cry and will fill your mind with courage."
Fluke_Skywalker,"Jun 6, 2025",8/10,"Revisiting 'Braveheart' is a bit like going to a five star restaurant, and as you're leaving you wonder how you're going to adjust to going back to eating fast food (i.e. Comic book movies, endless remakes and reboots, worn out IP's, etc.).Mel Gibson is a solid actor, but he's a great filmmaker. His storytelling instincts are impeccable, and his mojo is a perfect fit for this kind of story. He gets ""epic"" and ""operatic"" and uses them to build emotional investment that pays off in glorious and spectacular ways.Featuring a host of great performances (including Gibson himself), superb direction (also by Gibson) and backed by an all-time score from the late, great James Horner, 'Braveheart' is the kind of film we should all revisit and subsequently demand that Hollywood begin making again."
TaylorMadeTakes,"Oct 5, 2025",10/10,"Braveheart doesn't waste a heartbeat. From its first frame, it grips you with raw emotion and never lets go. The performances are genuine, the battles unforgettable, and the storytelling fierce with purpose. Wallace's journey feels monumental yet deeply human, a rebellion of spirit as much as of sword. Some films entertain; this one commands your soul's attention."
davidfyfe99,"May 7, 2010",7/10,"I have tried to sit through this film on many occasions and haven't managed for several reasons, the primary one being that the Academy thought Gibson was a better director than Michael Mann and Ron Howard ( I don't recall if Mann was nominated, he certainly should have been), another being that I just can't stand the sight of Mel Gibson, another being that the Scottish accents are absolutely DREADFUL. I have, however, set myself a goal to see every Best Picture winner in reverse chronological order (yes I am an anorak) and Braveheart happens to be the first I haven't seen. So I finally managed to get through it and my conclusions are as follows:It's really quite a well made film, actually most of Gibsons directing efforts are good films production wise - I guess it wouldn't have had such commercial appeal if he used Scottish actors and no-one understood what the hell they were saying -the Academy showered it with awards because it has all the ingredients of what they normally give all the big awards to ie, an inspirational true story (although Gibson was quite creative with historical events), a great soundtrack, a tragic tear-jerking ending....So yes, the Academy got it wrong, but it's not the first or last time, the biggest injustice ever is that Slumdog Millionaire was showered with so many awards, it was a good, entertaining film, but that's it, no way it deserved the awards it got. Oh, and considering the other nominees for '95, I think probably Sense and Sensibility and Apollo 13 were better films than Braveheart, but 'Heat' was the best big studio film of the year and it wasn't nominated, and Michael Mann was the best director."
