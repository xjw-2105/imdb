AlsExGal,"Jan 15, 2017",9/10,"This was Alfred Hitchcock's first American-made film. Quite frankly, I'm amazed at how well Hitchcock ""got"" what American audiences wanted in their suspense films, hitting them out of the park from the moment he began working in the US.Apart from being a tad bit long, this is a well made film. I love the inside of Mandalay and Sir Laurence Olivier played a wonderful mysterious and sullen Maximillian De Winter opposite his new wife, a beautiful and naive young Joan Fontaine who is never even given a name here, probably deliberately and in keeping with how mousy and ""second hand"" she feels about herself in relation to the first and late Mrs. De Winter, who is actually Rebecca from the title.Of course there is also George Sanders, playing the type of character he is best known for--sarcastic, snobby, self-assured, pompous, witty and verbose. He hits the nail on the head as Rebecca's ""cousin"" - so he calls himself. Of course the most eerie and unsettling character was Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's housekeeper or ""maid in waiting."" Danvers takes great pains in sabotaging the second Mrs. De Winter's marital relationship with Max de Winter,--even going as far as calmly urging her to to plunge to her death into the water from Rebecca's bedroom window at Mandalay. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but I won't give them away. It's best if you watch them unfold yourself in true Hitchcockian style.I will say that Rebecca, the first wife of Max de Winter, is NEVER seen, but we learn about her by what is said about her by the various characters, even going as far as seeing the untouched shrine of a bedroom maintained by Mrs. Danvers. But soon you learn that Rebecca was never the perfect wife Danvers and others make her out to be. The ending is a surprise in more way than one, and yet Mrs. Danvers gets the last word in her own way. A great movie by Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick."
BA_Harrison,"Feb 13, 2020",8/10,"Director Alfred Hitchcock is renowned for his visual acuity, creating some of the most memorable shots in movie history; he also had a keen eye for beauty, casting some of Hollywood's most stunning actresses in iconic roles: Grace Kelly in Rear Window, Maureen O'Hara in Jamaica Inn, Tippi Hedren in The Birds, Ingrid Bergman in Spellbound, and Janet Leigh in Psycho, to name but a few. Perhaps his most enchanting leading lady was Joan Fontaine, who won an Oscar for her role in Suspicion (1941), but who was never more appealing than in her first film for Hitch, Rebecca, based on a novel by Daphne Du Maurier.The gorgeous Fontaine plays a meek young woman (we never discover her name, but she's not the 'Rebecca' of the title) who falls for rich aristocrat 'Maxim' de Winter (Laurence Olivier) while working in the South of France. Equally besotted, Maxim proposes to the self-effacing beauty, and takes her back to his ancestral home, Manderley, which he once shared with his first wife Rebecca, before she drowned in a boating accident. The new Mrs. de Winter does her best to adapt to her new lifestyle, but is constantly under the shadow of her predecessor, with stern housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) being particularly disapproving of Maxim's new bride, deliberately driving a wedge between the married couple and even going so far as to try and talk Mrs. de Winter Mk. II into killing herself.Thus far, the film is pure melodrama and sappy romance, and avid Hitchcock fans might be wondering where the murder and mystery is; worry, not, for this comes in the second half of the film and provides plenty of intrigue and suspense as Maxim reveals what really happened to his first wife and is subsequently suspected of her murder. Both his wife and the viewer are aware of his innocence, but with Rebecca's lover Jack Favell (George Sanders) accusing Mr. de Winter of murder, and plenty of damning evidence, things are looking pretty bad for the poor fellow. It all wraps up nicely in the end, of course, but there are plenty of tense moments along the way, all handled in the director's typically assured manner, with bags of atmosphere and sumptuous cinematography.But as great as the direction and story are, it is the performances that really make Rebecca a winner: Olivier is perfect as the troubled toff, Anderson is wonderfully wicked as scheming housekeeper Danvers, nobody does 'bumbling oaf' quite as well as Nigel Bruce (playing Major Giles Lacy, who puts his foot in his mouth whenever he speaks), Sanders is suitably slimy as adulterous blackmailer Favell, and Fontaine... well, she is completely captivating, every smile, every tilt of her head, and every nervous glance guaranteed to win over the viewer (she was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the Oscars, but lost to Ginger Rogers). Hell, even the dog that played Maxim's mutt Jasper was excellent (so cute!)."
Infofreak,"Jul 8, 2004",N/A,"Hitchcock felt 'Rebecca', his first Hollywood film, was a compromise, but as a viewer I just can't fault it. It's a masterpiece in my opinion, full of suspense, mystery and brooding atmosphere. It's also one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. I've watched it several times over the years, and even now that I know all the plot twists and turns (quite shocking on your first viewing), it never fails to hook me in. One of the reasons it really works is the flawless casting. I'm not much of an Olivier fan but he's superb as de Winter, with just the right mixture of charm and coldness. And Joan Fontaine is just perfect as de Winter's new bride. I can't spot an unconvincing moment in her performance and can't imagine any other actress in the role. Hitchcock subsequently used her in 'Suspicion' with Cary Grant. She was also excellent in that but 'Rebecca' is a much stronger movie. The supporting cast also includes some brilliant performances, especially Judith Anderson ('Laura') as the extremely creepy Mrs. Danvers, George Sanders who plays Rebecca's slimy cousin, and Nigel Bruce in a typical role as de Winter's bumbling brother-in-law Major Lacy. Sanders subsequently worked again with Hitchcock in 'Foreign Correspondent', and Bruce played Cary Grant's lovable pal ""Beaky"" in 'Suspicion'. I sometimes think that Hitchcock's 1940s movies are overlooked by many because they are regarded as being too ""old fashioned"", but for me movies like 'Suspicion', 'Saboteur', 'Lifeboat' and 'Spellbound' are some of the most entertaining movies Hitchcock ever made, and 'Rebecca' is the best of the lot. If you want to be totally enthralled for two hours just watch 'Rebecca'!"
kosmasp,"Jul 10, 2021",10/10,"Hitchcock - never won an Oscar - not in the Best Director department that is. He was nominated multiple times, but never got one. At least this movie right here won one for best movie. I know it is sometimes strange how a movie can win best movie, but the Director won't get one too.Anyway that does not change the perception most have of him: as one of the best directors that ever made movies. And he made lots of them thankfully. I finally came around watching this one - just before I went ahead and watched the ""remake"" that Netflix released last year. I put ""remake"" in quotes because the movie itself does try to establish itself as being based on the source novel.Now I have not read that, so I can't attest to all the changes that were made (although one was made for the ratings board considering the fate of Rebecca - and that was also used in the Remake). Humor was added though apparently and I would guess that the actors made their roles their own. In combination with what Hitchcock was able to get out of them.Many takes on the most simple things apparently and even a lot of looping (dubbing) of lines that he wasn't too keen of. But I've written so much and have not even touched the surface of what makes this movie great.You have a movie that is about the role of a woman - a second wife no less. A movie that seems to tell so many stories - but especially a story that concentrates on the female main character. Some have claimed that Hitchcock was a misogynist. On the other hand the extras here and some feminist claim the exact opposite. Even in his (infamous) interview with Truffaut, some might say it became clear he was more feminist than he liked to admit.And the movie right here seems to be able to capture many feelings of women. Even add some bi-sexual or lesbian love? You could read that into it - maybe it is in the book too. Again, I can't really tell.Every frame here is planned into the smallest detail. Nothing is left to chance and coincidence. There is a reason he is considered a master. The performances of the couple is amazing - Olivier may not be easy to read, but that is again on purpose.You also have the whole theme of romance and the age gap ... love, betrayal, addiction ... so many themes woven in here. And the overall presence of ... Rebecca. A presence that is felt throughout ... while never seen. And yet it is better this ... it is perfect as it is."
FiendishDramaturgy,"Dec 3, 2003",10/10,"his movie is a 10 from the very beginning. The casting is brilliant, the story is hauntingly beautiful, the performances are the best of what Hollywood once was, and the sets are of quality design and architecture. The direction is awesome, but it's Hitchcock, and I expect nothing less from his productions.Rebecca is a glamorous, beautiful socialite who has won the hearts of all who knew her. Well, almost all. But a year after her untimely death, her grieving husband near his wit's end, has grown seemingly suicidal and aloof.He engages his grief while on a trip to Monte Carlo, and meets the beautiful personal secretary and maid of a long-time friend, Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper. She is young, naive, and completely unprepared for the life which is awaiting her; all qualities which George Fortescu Maximillian 'Maxim' de Winter finds endearing.I won't detail the events in this movie, as the story itself is quite haunting, with surprises around every turn.This is a definite ""must have"" in any suspense / horror / Hitchcock / classics movie collection, and a mandatory must see for all fans of all movies.It rates a 10/10 for its absolute perfection, from...the Fiend :."
alluyb1tch,"May 19, 2021",7/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's first Hollywood production, starring Joan Fontaine, Laurence Oliver and supported by Judith Anderson.It is a film with a dark aura, exquisite in its shots that seem empty but immediately one delights in those empty corridors being able to imagine the echo of those large spaces in that house. It has a lot of personality, and that is because of its legendary director who takes all the credit for me. The plot is well run and accessible, it became a bit dense in the middle. The way Rebecca's character is put together is great, it doesn't require an actress to play it because in our minds she has her own face and scenes, even the energy that adheres to the character.The performances were neat, it is the first film I have seen by Joan Fontaine and I admit that she did not surprise me, I suppose that her character was not so enthusiastic. Laurence manages to stand out a little more giving having the role of developing the twist of the film, where he takes it out of that seemingly nostalgic and gray character, and becomes something darker. Judith Anderson stands out strong with this sinister and insane housekeeper, a superb performance that works.Film nominated for 11 Oscars, winning two, including the most important of the night ""Best Picture"". It is the first film of the mystery and dark genre to win in this category, surprising as I have read here that it is the only Hitchcock film that has achieved this."
dave fitz,"May 1, 2000",10/10,"In his long career, Alfred Hitchcock directed many great films. Rebecca ranks as one of the greatest. It was the only Hitchcock movie to win a Best Picture Oscar and it was his first Hollywood film after leaving England. This was also the first film in which he adapted someone else's work, the famous novel by de Maurier.This film features all the twists and strange characters you would expect from Hitchcock along with the trademark unexpected ending. Sir Laurence Olivier is great, as usual, as Maximillian de Winter. The stunning Joan Fontaine is wonderful as ""the Second Mrs. de Winter"". Rebecca is an entertaining thriller by one of the masters of film."
fullthundermoon-36564,"Nov 20, 2021",10/10,"Snuggle up and be entertained by this dark, psychological masterpiece of cinema. This film has it all: acting, plot, mesmerising scenes, and unbearable eeriness. If you are not familiar with the novel, this film will incentivise you to read.."
fletch5,"Sep 8, 2000",6/10,"""Rebecca"" is often mentioned as one of Hitchcock's finest works. In my opinion, it's his most overappreciated film. I just don't understand what's so good about this overdramatic, fairly unhitchcockian yarn. It goes on and on and on revealing ""the secrets of Manderley"", and then ends quickly, almost furtively. Maybe the maestro himself didn't like the film neither, because his cameo is a really hard one to catch! Still, ""Rebecca"" is worth seeing at least for Judith Anderson's amazing performance as the evil Mrs. Danvers.If you're a Hitchcock fan, take notice that Leo G. Carroll (Dr. Murchison in ""Spellbound"", senator Morton in ""Strangers on a Train"", the professor in ""North by Northwest"") makes his first appearance in a Hitchcock movie as Rebecca's doctor (near the end of the film)."
riverspipe,"Apr 2, 2005",5/10,"There are two moments of cinematic greatness in this film. 1)The home movie scene, and 2)the scene involving Danvers manipulating Joan Fontaine after the costume ball. But though these memorable instances attempt to cajole us into admiration during the viewing, the overall product beckons us to reexamine our initial wooing. There are a few other moments of atmospheric success, and Fontaine's initial arrival and exploration of Manderlay and its characters is interesting, but otherwise, the film is often mediocre, and sometimes even poor. Laurence Olivier is very stale and does not exude much of a presence, nor a riveting sense of charm. Fontaine is better, but her character is completely over-the-top. She seems well adjusted and interesting at first, then does nothing but shake and stand with lost eyes for the rest of the film. I know the situation is supposed to bring about such behavior, but it is just too much. The chemistry between the two characters is horrible. Perhaps that is supposed to demonstrate the awkwardness in their relationship. But, then we find de Winter really does love her, and he hates his dead wife. So while his madness translates well, his supposed love for her never does. Not even at the end. And hers for him feels impossible to get our heads around, since he never does anything but be rich and handsome to impress her. I know, I know, those are the dynamics of the relationship, and some of them are more subtle (e.g. de Winter probably goes for her because she seems sexually tame and timidly obsequious), but it still does not feel right in the end. The characters' actions are too shortsighted for the overall plot.The film often has no momentum, and drags on forever. The entire opening courtship can be eliminated since it is not efficacious in convincing us of much romance anyway. Then there is the second part, where Fontaine slowly learns the secrets of Manderlay, and though this probably is the best part of the film, it still never feels like it is building to a climax, even though every scene attempts to convey a bit of foreboding intrigue. Instead, it becomes monotonous; precisely because every scene is exactly the same. The end feels like it should approach soon after Danvers diabolical rant. Then there is Olivier's admission, and it feels like it should come again. But again it doesn't, and when the ending finally does come, it is of such an enormous magnitude that it feels too brief.Then there is the story, which I believe has a couple of plot holes, and realistic dilemmas, though I cannot say with absolute certainty. The film has a chance, but not without a reassessment of the script. Another chance at astonishing greatness blown."
sundae,"Oct 11, 2000",N/A,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Definitely my favorite classic. There are some that come close, such as Citizen Kane, Spellbound, and Psycho, but none quite compare to this amazing movie.The first thing that you notice is the outstanding cinematography. You have to remember that this movie was made in 1940, when they didn't have the technology we have now. But that first shot of the water beating up against the rocks grabs you and for one split second you wonder if maybe this isn't part of the movie but rather something filmed just recently. But then you see the familiar face of Laurence Olivier, reminding you that this was made 60 years ago, a fact that forever amazes me. The only oscar it won besides Best Picture was well deserved.Another thing that makes it such a wonderful film is the acting. I have debated on whether Laurence Olivier's character, the tortured Maxim de Winter, is the pitiable character or if his second wife played by Joan Fontaine is really the one to feel sorry for. Every time I watch it I see it from a different point of view. Joan Fontaine is excellent. Laurence Olivier is wonderful, but that's no surprise. The only thing that bugs me is that it seems in every movie he's in (well, at least, everything I've seen him in), he always plays the same type of character.  But he's extremely good at it, so I suppose it doesn't matter.But although Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier are wonderful, Judith Anderson steals the show! The first time I watched the movie, I was immediately grabbed by her stunning performance as the sinister Mrs. Danvers. You hardly notice the other characters when she's in the scene. She acted the part so well that it's strange to imagine that she was any different in real life.With a wonderful storyline, and a very surprising ending, Rebecca well deserves the title as the only of Hitchcock's films to win the oscar for Best Picture. Although it may not be the most famous of all his films, it is without a doubt the greatest"
Twillhead,"Jun 11, 1999",10/10,"In a line-up of great motion pictures, ""Rebecca"" stands as one of the giants. It is arguably Hitchcock's greatest film effort, replete with jolting, slap-in-the-face plot twists and gothic sets. Dark and moody, the film boasts Sir Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine in slam-dunk, dead on performances, George Sanders as the deliciously despicable Jack Favell, and Judith Anderson nearly stealing the show as the eerie, obsessed housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. A perfect ""10""."
hitchcockthelegend,"Mar 4, 2008",10/10,"Rebecca is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screen play from the Daphne du Maurier novel of the same name. It stars Laurence Olvier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Cinematography is by George Barnes and music scored by Franz Waxman.After meeting and marrying 'Maxim' de Winter (Olivier), the Second Mrs. de Winter (Fontaine), finds life at his English estate, Manderley, far from comfortable because the servants and the house serve to remind her of the first Mrs. de Winter, whose death remains a source of mystery. What did happen to the first lady of the house? Can this newly married couple survive the oppressive cloud that looms large over the mansion?A Gothic emotional near masterpiece, Alfred Hitchcock's first American film may seem a bit too serviceable at times, something he was also aware of himself, but the production values are high and the story is played out supremely well. Within the story we can find Hitchcock's now famous trait of mistrusting Women, but in the main it stays the tragic tale of one young woman living in the ominous shadow of the previous Mrs. De Winter. Mood is often set as foreboding, with the director understanding the psychological pangs of the source material once the action switches to the de Winter home of Manderley. It arguably is a touch too long, and the restraint of Hitchcock, down to producer David O. Selznick overseeing things, stops it being a bit more unnerving than it should be.For Manderley the mansion here is one of the finest put on the screen, this is because Hitchcock and brilliant cinematographer George Barnes manage to make it bold & beautiful one minute, and then the next scene it comes off as a monolithic nightmare. It's wonderful case of the surroundings playing the extra character for maximum effect. Laurence Olivier is impressive, even if we would learn later on that this is the sort of performance he could do in his sleep. The supporting cast do great work as well, especially as regards the cold and terrifying turn from Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. However, to me this will always be Joan Fontaine's show, she nails it perfectly, the new Mrs. De Winter wants to do right but can't seem to so for doing wrong, she infuriates at times, yet the next minute you just want to hold her, for she's so vulnerable, but beautifully so, it's a brilliant performance in a brilliant film.The ending is a switheroo from the novel, and it almost derails the success the film has achieved up to that point. And looking at it now it's hard not to curse the Production Code for enforcing a big change to what was revealed in du Maurier's wonderful novel. But the film has survived the ""appeasing"" ending to stand the test of time for all the ages. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Barnes also won for Best Black & White Cinematography, it was nominated for a further nine awards, including Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. No nomination for Waxman, sadly, but his score is worthy of a mention for the evocative strains that sit nicely with the tone of the story. Rebecca, a hauntingly beautiful picture that's acted and produced with consummate skill. 9.5/10"

moonspinner55,"Nov 6, 2006",7/10,"Daphne Du Maurier's novel becomes a handsome romantic-thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock involving a naïve young woman (Joan Fontaine) who weds a wealthy, mysterious man (Laurence Olivier) and moves into his imposing castle filled with memories of his deceased first wife. Despite a stiff opening reel, ""Rebecca"" is a well-mounted psychological melodrama in the ""Jane Eyre"" vein. Judith Anderson's Mrs. Danvers has been interpreted (and misinterpreted) to death--she's indeed a little grandiose--though it's still a stunning characterization: a steely-eyed villainess who ranks right up there with the most enjoyable cinema-baddies. The movie gushes and flutters over Olivier almost as much as Fontaine does; he's quite good, but this turns out to be Joan's picture. Increasingly insecure, nervous, chatty and overeager, Fontaine runs the gamut of emotions and is never less than compelling. 11 Oscar nominations with two wins: George Barnes for hsi cinematography and for Best Picture. *** from ****"
sol-,"Jan 3, 2005",10/10,"A stylishly directed and photographed film that examines a number of themes, such a deception, death and depression, and explores well the emotions of its characters. It is rare to find a film like this, as it tackles various genres, ranging from being a romance to a mystery to a drama to even a comedy at times, and all without seeming pretentious. The cast is truly magnificent. Judith Anderson is a stunner is a quiet but sinister role, and George Sanders is even more impressive in lively but also sinister performance. Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are perfect for their roles too. The film won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Cinematography quite deservingly  this is one of the best films Hollywood has ever produced."
oOoBarracuda,"Jan 10, 2017",6/10,"Being an avid fan of Alfred Hitchcock's films, I should rank Rebecca high on my list. It was the only of Hitch's films to win an Academy Award, winning Best Picture in 1940. However, much like North by Northwest, another fan favorite, I don't care for Rebecca. Almost everything that makes a film Hitchcock-esque seems to be missing in Rebecca. The film is full of imposing camera angles and the wonderful lighting I adore in Hitchcock pictures, but his standard care with which his narrative is formed seemed completely different. Starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, Rebecca tells the story of a recently married couple and the self-consciousness experienced by the new bride who cannot seem to escape the shadow of her new husband's deceased first wife.'Maxim' de Winter (Laurence Olivier) a wealthy man living in a sprawling estate meets a quiet, timid young woman who he instantly falls in love with and decides to marry. The new Mrs. De Winter (Joan Fontaine) soon learns that there is a spirit hanging over her new home, that spirit belongs to the first wife of her new husband, Rebecca. Mrs. de Winter soon becomes fully aware just how much Rebecca's memory has engulfed her husband's thoughts. There are even rooms in her home that haven't been changed since Rebecca was there. Mrs. de Winter clashes with the staff in the home, as it seems everyone is longing for the first Mrs. de Winter.Rebecca seems less like a Hitchcock film than the sole comedy he made Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The audience wasn't thrown into the suspense like in Strangers on a Train, the tone wasn't set like it was in Psycho, it was a diligent narrative that seemed more like a John Ford film than a Hitchcock picture. The cinematography was brilliant, and more than deserving of top prize that year for George Barnes. The film itself was fine, just not at all what I expected from Hitchcock's only Oscar winner."
Xstal,"Sep 11, 2020",9/10,"... and it's clear to see throughout that Maxim de Winter is not overwrought with joy as we witness a story tacking in one direction, gradually adjusting course to another and finally distorting and folding in on itself with magnificent Hitchcockian escalation towards the end.If you view this through contemporary eyes alone it's easy to see it as dated, old fashioned, antique perhaps, many things in the past fall foul of fashion sooner or later. Place a pair of pince-nez on the bridge of your nose and witness two great stars, Joan Fontaine is outstanding, add immense depth to an already deep, dark and disturbing tale with some sinister supporting characters thrown in for good measure, none more so than Judith Anderson as the mysterious and cryptic Mrs. Danvers."
zephyr_00,"Mar 27, 2006",7/10,"So far the Alfred Hitchcock's films never let me down. Certainly this as well. Quite different from his other films, Rebecca contains no violent blood scare scene at all. But what makes Alfred Hitchcock talent is we can feel the tension atmosphere all through the film (the housekeeper's eyes to the girl, the weird west room, the sign tune of Hitchcock....). Joan Fontaine does a great help to the film as the The Second Mrs. de Winter. We have to mention without Judith Anderson (Mrs. Danvers),we can hardly imagine how it will to be. The film is really perfect until The Second Mrs. de Winter know all about Rebecca in the cottage. The after portion doesn't fully close to the beat of the film(Maybe director must make it a 2-hour-film to satisfy the company)After all,as a film won Best Cinematography & Picture in 1941 Oscar. It enjoy me much tonight*******/**********"
ccthemovieman-1,"May 24, 2006",4/10,"This review won't be accepted gracefully on this website but at least I am honest in telling you this was a big disappointment to me, considering all the great reviews I read (not here) prior to seeing it. Some of that praise is simply because it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie with ""Hitch"" being a big favorite among national critics.Even though I own a good amount of classic films, this was way too slow, way too corny and old-fashioned. I should re-purchase this film and use it the next time time I have trouble getting to sleep at night.Joan Fontaine has a nice, pretty wholesome face but that's about it. Her character in this was just plain stupid and got worse as the film wore on, especially at the end. Judith Anderson, whom I read was so ""creepy"" in this, was not anywhere near as evil as built up to be. As usual, the real-life wacko, George Sanders, is the most interesting actor in the film.Having said all that, I do want to highly praise the sets and camera effort of this movie. The best part of this melodrama was the cinematography with some wonderful scenes inside ""Mandaly"" (the mansion). The cameras did a great job with the use of shadows, some of the best I've ever seen. Without the visual treats, I doubt I could have stayed with this 130-minute film."
Dtkoyzis,"Feb 20, 2001",N/A,"""Rebecca"" was the first Hitchcock film I ever saw, and I was mesmerized by it from the start, convinced that I had to see more of the director's work. It richly deserved the Oscar it received, but it's a real puzzle that the Academy saw fit to withhold a best director award for Hitch.  Would one possibly give an award to a work by Picasso and not to Picasso himself?""Rebecca"" was the first of the director's American-made films, and it shows. It's quite different from his earlier British-made films, such as ""Young and Innocent"" and even ""The Lady Vanishes,"" which somehow seem more amateurish by comparison.  (I know little of the British cinema of that era, but it's difficult not to conclude that Hollywood was better at producing more sophisticated efforts.)  I would even judge ""Rebecca"" the best of his films of the early 1940s, with the possible exception of ""Shadow of a Doubt.""  It is true, of course, that much of this film has become cliché (remember the spoofs on the old ""Carol Burnette Show""!), but it still weathers the decades very well.  The acting is uniformly excellent.  Olivier is the hardened Maxim de Winter, untitled lord of Manderly, trying to forget the past and given to unexpected bouts of anger and coldheartedness. Fontaine is perfect as the unnamed mousy heroine, innocent yet deeply in love, still carrying with her the aura of an awkward schoolgirl.  Even character actor Nigel Bruce, best known for his role in the Sherlock Holmes films, makes an appearance and plays, in effect, Nigel Bruce!But it is Judith Anderson's role as Mrs. Danvers that viewers are likely to remember best.  Her presence is as dark and foreboding as that of the deceased Rebecca herself, and Fontaine is evidently cowed by her icy stare and unnervingly formal manner.  The dynamics between the two actresses are wonderful.  Who could fail to empathize with Fontaine's unenviable position as, in effect, the new employer of such an intimidating personage?  On the other hand, Olivier seems quite unfearful of Anderson, despite her representing so much of the past he is trying to block out.  This part of the plot (even in the book) never made much sense to me and is unconvincing.As far as I know, this film marked Hitch's first collaboration with composer Franz Waxman, whose haunting score makes it all the more memorable. Waxman's scores are perhaps less obviously cinematic than those of the incomparable Bernard Herrmann, who would score Hitch's films from 1955 to 1966.  Contrast the score for ""Rebecca"" to Herrmann's music for ""Citizen Kane"" the following year, and you'll immediately hear the difference. Waxman's is more symphonic in the central European style reflective of his own birth and upbringing.  Yet it is worth recalling that scoring films was still a new art at this time, and both Waxman and Herrmann were pioneers.Finally, one has to mention the cinematography, which is magnificent. Technically ""Rebecca"" might have been filmed in colour, which was newly available in 1940.  (""Gone with the Wind"" was filmed entirely in colour the previous year, while ""The Wizzard of Oz"" and ""The Women"" had colour scenes.) But colour would have diminished its impact.  The suspense and the ominous sense of impending doom could only have been communicated through the medium of black-and-white and the deft use of light and shade which it affords.In one respect, of course, ""Rebecca"" is not a typical Hitchcock film.  There is no fleeing innocent trying to clear his name of a crime he did not commit.  Surprisingly, there isn't even a murder, although its absence was apparently imposed by the Hayes Code and is certainly foreign to Daphne du Maurier's original novel.  Some have said that there is more Selznick than Hitchcock in this film, and perhaps there's something to that.  Still, if the collaborative effort between the two was not exactly amiable, it was nevertheless successful.In short, this is the first in a string of Hitchcock masterpieces."
secondtake,"Mar 31, 2010",10/10,"Rebecca (1940)Ah, to see another great movie from those few years when Hollywood peaked, when that combination of art, freshness, and sheer collaborative talent combined over and over. I'm talking from Gone with the Wind to Casablanca, 1939 to 1942. Throw in any number of truly staggering movies in the stretch--Citizen Kane for starters--and we have to almost expect Alfred Hitchcock to fit right in. With Rebecca he does. It's another perfect movie.Daphne Du Maurier's book of the same title is a great read, something short of a literary classic but something better than a mere best-seller. I read it recently, and was completely transported into a land of subtle drama. That sounds like an oxymoron, but when you see this movie you'll notice how people act with restraint, with glances, with quiet actions, and yet achieve a grandiose, dramatic effect that tears your heart out. It's an archetypal story about a girl who seems to have a dream come true marrying a charming and very wealthy man.But of course, there are skeletons in this man's closet, and Lawrence Olivier plays the inner struggle of Maxim close to the chest. More openly troubled by events, and so sympathetic your heart jumps out of your chest, is the girl, his wife, played by Joan Fontaine. Now here is a performance that is just incredible. She even changes her presence as her innocence slowly bleeds away from start to finish. If the two of them never quite have sparks fly, they're not supposed to.But Hitchcock has done more than chosen a great, cinematic novel and two amazing actors (as well as a flawless supporting cast). With the most romantic, lush sets, delirious lights, and rich, layered photography, all fluidly combined to create scenes so beautiful you can almost taste it, the director has shown, again, that he understands the intuitive power of the cinema. It isn't the outward brilliance of any one scene or shot, or any one conversation that the camera follows invisibly, or any flinging of the curtains to reveal only more fog or sheer obscurity. It's the pacing and sequence of these moments that sucks you into the world and won't let you go.Well, it's no surprise, maybe, that Rebecca won best picture and best cinematography at the Oscars. And it was up against The Letter, The Grapes of Wrath, and The Philadelphia Story, all of which are more proof that the movies of this period are a zenith of a certain kind of Hollywood. The studio system. (Yes, there are hundreds of other great movies from other years, but I'm not really trying to make my case here.) Hitchcock never won an Oscar for best director (neither did Welles), but he could have here without fault. As much as this is just a movie to get lost in and enjoy, it's also a movie you could watch over and over and study."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Apr 12, 2023",10/10,"A shy, naive young woman travelling as a pair companion encounters powerful, handsome widower Maxim de Winter, the pair quickly fall in love, and she moves to his family home.This film is without doubt, something of a masterpiece, there have been several adaptations of it, and it remains the ultimate adaptation.Hitchcock deserved an Oscar for this film, it really has stood the test of time. It has multiple quality elements, mystery, intrigue, romance, horror, it really does capture the imagination.Almost every sequence is meaningful, nothing feels unimportant or meaningless, every action has purpose, some are subtle, some are heavy.It looks sublime, production values are terrific, you can see lot went into it. Despite a fairly lengthy running time it never feels long or drawn out, it holds your attention so well.The acting is first class, Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are absolutely perfect, exactly what I see from the book, the standout for me however, is
Judith Anderson, who gives an incredible, chilling performance as Mrs Danvers.10/10."
drqshadow-reviews,"Sep 16, 2024",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's first American production may have been a frustrating experience for the director, but that hardship produced his most professionally-lauded work. Hitch did not get along with hands-on producer David O. Selznick, but history looks fondly upon the big boss and there's little question his imperious oversight kept Rebecca on the path to a Best Picture Oscar; Selznick's second in a row after Gone With the Wind. Steel sharpens steel, as they say, and the fact that neither of these guys liked taking orders probably ensured that only the best ideas won out in the end.Subsequently, Rebecca isn't as overtly mysterious as Hitchcock's later, more popular work, but that's not to say it lacks for suspense. Instead, the twists and turns arrive with nuance, more dramatic for their implications than their big, shiny spotlight moments of revelation. We get one or two of those, too, but they're well-earned and hit harder for the restraint. The story, of a quiet, cheerful young woman who's swept up in a whirlwind romance and marries into great wealth, kept me constantly guessing. Though dapper and easygoing, not to mention the master of a palatial estate, her new beau is also a widower, and the shadow of his ex-wife's influence looms over the mansion like a sticky storm cloud. The new bride quickly realizes that the head maid has judged her insufficient by comparison, but her real concern (and ours, by proxy) is how she stands in the eyes of her husband. His evaluation seems to ebb and flow by the minute, as we all begin to work out the tangled web of unspoken truths and boldly-proclaimed lies that still define their faded marriage.From plotting to acting to direction and artistry, this one's a true work of art. So much so that I mourn the boxy 1.33:1 aspect ratio that was standard at the time, for robbing us of that much more Hitchcockian cinematography. I noticed a few era-specific production quirks - particularly the obvious projected backgrounds behind driving scenes, and even some of the walking scenes - but despite those minor niggles, it's a magnificent story, expertly executed for the screen, and a well-deserving award winner."
Leofwine_draca,"Jun 15, 2015",7/10,"REBECCA, an enthralling adaptation of the Daphne Du Maurier novel, is probably the closest that Hitchcock got in his career to making a traditional 'haunted house' film. Certainly his adaptation of the classic book is laden with Gothic dread, as a newly-wed bride moves into the ancestral home of her husband and discovers that the spirit of his dead wife is very much alive and out to bring her down.REBECCA is a highly effective non-supernatural horror/mystery flick, with expert direction (of course) and a mature approach to the storyline. It may be a little slow for modern tastes, but this gives the director the chance to let the audience experience the nuances and delightful atmosphere of the storyline.Joan Fontaine is fantastic as the new Mrs. de Winter in one of those 'being driven out of her mind' type roles. Laurence Olivier is more than effective in his ambiguous part. The supporting parts are particularly well judged, with a well-placed cameo for Leo G. Carroll, another humorous bumbling part for Nigel Bruce, and George Sanders appearing as a delightful cad. The latter part of the film, where the mystery begins to be cleared up, is particularly well-handled, leading to a gripping climax. As for Judith Anderson as the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers...well, she'll go down in the pantheon of Hitchcock villains as one of his creepiest and most ruthless!"
akshatmahajan,"Nov 4, 2024",8/10,"Rebecca combines the genre of romance, drama and thriller and the result is a deep thought provoking drama which even with a simple story engages you with it's various themes.The story is good and simple but it's the execution that makes it a tense watch; the screenplay is tight, strong and keeps you bound throughout the runtime; the direction was good and the performances were also good, all the characters had some mystery to them which made them interesting.Overall, it was a good tense thriller drama which uses it's various themes to built-up a story which has the elements of drama, romance, thriller blended together."
AAdaSC,"Dec 23, 2014",7/10,"Joan Fontaine (Mrs de Winter) is a companion to the very snobby and highly amusing Florence Bates (Mrs Van Hopper). While holidaying in Monte Carlo, they bump into Laurence Olivier (Maxim) who is mega wealthy and owns the stately home of Mandalay in Cornwall. A romance between Joan and Larry develops behind the back of fussy Florence, and by the end of their stay in Monte Carlo, Joan and Larry are engaged. They marry and return to Mandalay but the overbearing presence of Olivier's first wife ""Rebecca"" still lurks at every corner. But, things are not as they seem.The film left me thinking about how I would feel about Olivier's character if I watched the film for a second time. I would definitely view him in a different light now that I know the story. You have to get to that point to understand what I mean as things take a very different turn about three quarters of the way through and his motivations become very different to what has been previously assumed. It's a clever twist. Up to that three-quarter way mark, I found that Olivier, Fontaine and housekeeper Judith Anderson (Mrs Danvers) were all too predictable and that the film was a little long. However, things pick up with the discovery of Rebecca's boat.The cast are uniformly good with George Sanders (Favell) standing out as a cad. He is elegantly sublime and slimy as he looks out for number one. At the other extreme was Fontaine – I'm not keen on feeble female roles and so she grated on me on several occasions. Chicks in films need to be funny or be ready to fight back. None of this drippy stuff.A couple of things that I didn't notice during the film – Hitchcock's usual appearance (it is there, though), and the fact that Joan Fontaine's character doesn't have a first name! The film is a little long but it's worth it in the end."
briancham1994,"Sep 11, 2021",9/10,"In true Alfred Hitchcock style, this film is full of suspense and darkness. The initial events seem innocent enough - a wealthy gentleman sweeps an insecure young woman off her feet while on a trip to Monaco - yet things go on a gradual downtown as the events of the past catch up to them. The atmosphere is one of extreme discomfort, as the protagonist is constantly under scrutiny and compared with her predecessor, a universal obsession that she eventually succumbs to. The stark monochrome cinematography suggests that many things are hidden in the mansion, and the emotional acting adds deep characterisation to everyone on screen, all culminating in some shocking twists."
sascha_z,"Mar 24, 2023",6/10,"""Rebecca"" (1940) is a classic film by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. However, while the film is certainly entertaining, it falls far short of the masterful pieces of Hitchcock's later career and is, in fact, overrated.One of the primary issues with ""Rebecca"" is the implausibility of its story setup. It is hard to believe that a stunningly attractive girl like Rebecca would marry someone for their wealth without any emotional interest whatsoever, especially when she could marry anyone who had both wealth and whom she might love. Furthermore, it seems improbable that Maxim de Winter would not have the faintest clue that Rebecca was a cruel, evil monster before marrying her. Additionally, it is difficult to believe that de Winter would leave the management of his entire estate to someone as stereotypically cruel and obviously insane as Mrs. Danvers.While some other aspects of the story are explained in the film, such as why de Winter did not simply get divorced to save himself from suffering, these explanations still feel barely believable. The acting does not help matters, as never for a moment does one feel that de Winter is genuinely in love with his second wife - who in turn comes across as extremely naive and silly, even if her daunted timidity is well portrayed. Meanwhile, Mrs. Danvers is portrayed more as a fairytale witch than a real person. The list goes on.Moreover, the police investigation and the ad-hoc incrimination by Mr. Favell have nothing to do with any sort of reality. You might argue this is consistent with the overall mystic-nightmarish ambience of the movie. But as a psychothriller, it is psychologically way out of line. Perhaps it might have worked better as a gothic tale or horror film.Finally, the film is permanently drenched in a cheesy sauce of music, which becomes annoying after a while.While ""Rebecca"" is undoubtedly worth watching as a classic of the genre, it is not a must-see film in Hitchcock's oeuvre."
jay4stein79-1,"Oct 27, 2004",N/A,"I spent the majority of this film thinking about how lucky M. Olivier really was. To be able to wrap his arms around Joan Fontaine and kiss her. Oh my. She's one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen (almost, but not quite as beautiful as Veronica Lake). She's also absolutely perfect in the role of the second Mrs. DeWinter, taking a character that could have become a cloying bore in less capable hands and transforming her into a sympathetic and interesting figure.The movie, on the whole, is similarly amazing, capturing the spirit and the tone of those great Gothic romances. Watching Rebecca, I was reminded (pleasantly) of Wuthering Heights; I do not mean to suggest that in some way this film re-tells the tale of Cathy and Heathcliff, but rather that Rebecca has the feel of Bronte's novel (I am most certainly not talking about the William Wyler adaptation a few years before the release of Rebecca. That's a terrible film that somehow manages to mis-interpret the novel).I must assume that the guiding hand of Hitchcock played no small role in recreating the feel of a Gothic romance. There are very few that would be able to take a love story, infuse it with such gloom, with such a sense of foreboding, and still manage to create something that ends happily without it feeling like a cop-out. I'd also like to draw everyone's attention to the incredibly moving section of the film that occurs between the arrival of the second Mrs. DeWinter at Mandalay and the masqued ball. The emotional strain on the Joan Fontaine character is so palpable, so absolutely taxing, that it actually pains me to watch. I hurt along with her. Few other movies affect me so emotionally - one of them is Vertigo.All in all, this is a fantastic piece of film-making from Hollywood's golden age. Laurence Olivier is in top-form, as he plays the quiet, sad Maxim and George Sanders is positively hateful.10/10 - a visceral masterpiece"

5981forever,"Sep 18, 2024",8/10,"Rebecca (1940) is an atmospheric, mesmerizing film that expertly blends psychological drama with gothic romance. Adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same name, Rebecca marks Hitchcock's first Hollywood film, and it stands as one of his most iconic and critically acclaimed works. The film's haunting mood, complex characters, and intricate narrative make it a timeless classic that still resonates with audiences today.The performances in Rebecca are exceptional. Joan Fontaine, as the unnamed second Mrs. De Winter, delivers a nuanced and captivating performance, portraying her character's journey from naive and insecure to resilient and determined with great emotional depth. Fontaine's portrayal of vulnerability and growing self-awareness anchors the film, allowing the audience to feel her inner turmoil as she confronts the seemingly insurmountable presence of Rebecca. Her subtle shifts in demeanor and expression convey a wide range of emotions, making her performance one of the highlights of the film."
Quinoa1984,"Jun 5, 2006",10/10,"David O. Selznick might have had more of an influence over this production than some might think- as with many of his films- and he is the one who ended up receiving the Oscar, not director Alfred Hitchcok, for the 1940 mystery-drama-romance Rebecca. But it is to the credit of both that, for the most part, it looks as if both tried to stay out of each other's way and just put up as good as film as they could. And it is a credit to Hitchcock that with a certain change from what one might see in his perhaps more entertaining films of the 50's and 60's also shows his knack at making great romantic Hollywood movie-making.He is given a plethora of the best of English acting talents (Olivier of course is hyped and hyped again just like Brando, but his work is undeniably good here, and yet it's Joan Fontaine who quietly makes her mark quite powerfully even when she is reserved in scenes), lush sets and production decor, a solid 'studio' score by Frank Waxman, and some memorable sequences and set-pieces. There is also some solid storytelling as well with his usual knack at unraveling a mystery piece by piece, with love, loss and deception at the core.Part of the film's success, however, is as attributable to the factor of it being one of the best ""chick-flicks"" in history that the film works today. And this time I mean it pretty much as a compliment, perhaps more to Selznick than anyone (Gone with the Wind, of course). The appeal that might usually go mostly for women is not lost at all on the male audience due to the sheer power and hints at what the two main actresses go for. Fontaine is the ""2nd"" Mrs. De Winter, who elopes with the Mr. played by Olivier and goes to live in Manderlay and meets some of the family and other folks. One of these is the one who has maybe the most interesting (naturally, as the antagonist) character, Mrs. Danvers played by Judith Anderson.Her's is a cold, exacting kind of character who has the straightforward, stern attitude of the ma'am of the house, but also with some dark secrets. It's not to say Hitchcock doesn't hav his eye out for other supporting parts and characters (I liked particularly the old guy who's at the shack where the majority of the secrets are house). But he also is able to get the character the audience will dislike the most as the more fascinating of the bunch, and Anderson is up to task.I wouldn't rush to see this as the first Hithcock film to see if you haven't seen one yet, but as an example of what he could direct aside from his outrageous and masterpiece works in the following years this is a fit example. It's also got, basically, an excellent story, and is pumped up with the best of Hollywood decorum and spectacle, with a big fire of an ending that practically on its own makes it worthwhile enough to see."

goatcheese-25746,"Dec 16, 2019",7/10,"Rebecca is truly an underappreciated Hitchcock movie. It's very Gothicly atmospheric and has a dreamlike feeling.The acting is particularly strong in this film. Joan Fontaine really sells the meek, naive wife character and her switch to a more powerful character is very noticeable, her character arc is enjoyable because of it. Laurence Olivier is charming but also brooding and mysterious at the same time, haunted by the memory of the looming Rebecca. Judith Anderson really does a great intimidating and unsettling performance, you really hate her by the end. An all round great cast.The plot was pretty engaging and intriguing, the memory of the titular Rebecca is successfully shown to be powerful with the lead always being compared to the seemingly godlike Rebeccca. All the characters are entertaining and interesting to watch. The plot twist is surprising, I didn't see it coming and it really made the third act more exciting.The set design was convincing in this movie, especially the imposing hallways and rooms of Manderley, Rebecca's room in particular. The flowing curtains seem just perfect to me.However, this movie could have been just a bit shorter. Some scenes dragged a little and could have been cut or trimmed down. This wasn't often though.Overall, this was a really good film that was very well acted and suspenseful throughout, with a suitably mysterious atmosphere. It could have been a little shorter but that doesn't detract too much from the experience. I recommend it."

The performance of the fragile Joan Fontaine is amazing with her innocent expression and clumsy attitudes in an aristocratic world that does not belong to her, a simple working-class young woman. Inclusive her character does not even have a name. Laurence Olivier makes a couple without chemistry with Joan Fontaine, in the role of a millionaire with a shadow from the past. The introduction, with Joan Fontaine telling her dream, misguides the viewers and I expected a different fate for the lead couple. George Sanders is the perfect scumbag and Judith Anderson performs a creepy character that might be homosexual grieving an unrequited love with Rebecca. The cinematography in black-and-white is very beautiful but the DVD released by the Brazilian distributor Continental is not remastered. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Rebecca, a Mulher Inesquecível"" (""Rebecca, the Unforgettable Woman"")Note: On 15 October 2024, I saw this film again."
MJB784,"Apr 13, 2024",7/10,"It is an interesting story about a woman who marries a bachelor and lives in his mansion only to find another woman's clothes and belongings there from his first wife Rebecca. She wants to know more about Rebecca and her husband is very secretive about it. The problem is, there's not a whole lot of story or classic scenes. This is more dialog driven than other Hitchcock movies, but the look is impressive and so are the camera angles. There's this really good opening tracking shot outside at nighttime, which was very mysterious. I also like the performances from Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine."
burkhart-3,"Dec 6, 2000",3/10,"I still have no idea why people like this movie so much.  The acting is poor, particularly that of Olivier.  He comes across as overacting terribly. Miss Fontaine fares better.  She, at least, gives us a decent performance. Anderson is completely not to be believed.  The music is so overdone it makes you wonder what they were thinking by putting it in there so much. This movie is just waiting to be parodied (as it has been).  And then there's the ending when this turns into a movie in search of an editor. Every time you think it might be over it goes on for ten more minutes. Then, is it over?  No, it just rambles on and on until you want to strangle whoever is playing that awful music.  It should be noted that this movie has more of Selznick in it than Hitchcock.  After making this film Hitch began to try and get every other studio in Hollywood to hire him out so he wouldn't have to work with Selznick again.  He even makes fun of Selznick with smug jokes in later movies.  I can see why.  If somebody took my movie and put in that music and let it ramble on forever I'd be mad at them, too. There is a good idea for a film in here somewhere, but this isn't it.  I hope all the people who voted this the best picture of 1940 were given a nice padded cell.  I was planning to write more, but just thinking about this movie is making me cringe, so I'll just stop.  If you like good movies, see many other Hitchcock classics, but leave this one on the shelf."
rmax304823,"Aug 24, 2002",N/A,"Hitchcock's first American movie, a word, American that is, that should be put in quotes because as Hitchcock pointed out, all of the cast and almost all of the crew were British.  The film has already garnered so many comments that I'll avoid repeating most of them.  The plot I'm sure has been thoroughly outlined and professionally analyzed but a few points are worth emphasis.The plot of very precisely structured.  It consists basically of a man who is the dream of many women in the 1940s audience: ruggedly handsome, intelligent, keen witted, a bit commanding but not too much, fabulously wealthy, a touch roguish, and mysterious.  It's the mystery that provides the plot engine.  Every incident of his past emotional life needs to be pried out of Maxim deWinter (what a name, suggesting frigidity and distance) as if it were an abcessed tooth.  Each secret, as he reveals it, is a surprise to his wife.  Except for the final secret uncovered in the plot, which surprises everybody.  Maxim could clear the whole mystery up with an hour's worth of private conversation with his wife.  But of course he doesn't, or else there would be no story.  That's why Hamlet takes so long to slaughter Claudius.  And why the Indians don't shoot the horses as they're chasing the stagecoach.The acting.  Olivier is extremely good at impersonating deWinter with all his charm and challenge.  George Sanders is the best cad that the movies ever produced, and he proves it again here.  Mrs. Danvers has a face and an expression that looks like an ice sculpture.  The implicit lesbianism in her character of course had to remain implicit, but it is still rather a shock when she tenderly unfolds Mrs. DeWinter's nightie and says smoothly, ""Look, you can see my hand through it.""  As for Joan Fontaine, a friend in Ireland said of her performance, ""She does the shivering wife very well."" Precisely put.  With her delicate bone structure, fragile looking limbs, and her overall ikabani flower arrangement appearance, her wide asymmetrical eyes, with one brow arching up over her pale forehead, she looks about to faint with fright through half the movie.  The only thing coarse about her is her wardrobe: bulky knit sweaters over her girlish bosom, long flapping drab skirts over her small but saucy rump, and those clodhoppers she wears while clunking about the house.  She does the shivering naif in at least two other films of the period -- Hitchcock's ""Suspicion"" and ""Jane Eyre.""  In fact, rummaging through the disarranged attic that is my long-term memory, I can't really remember her ""doing"" any other role.It's the closest Hitchcock ever came to making what was then called ""a woman's picture.""  It received a ""best picture"" Oscar, which went to Selznick.  Something Hitchcock seemed to resent for the remainder of his life.  It was a commercial and critical success and it deserved to be."
Doylenf,"Dec 29, 2006",8/10,"It's silly for those who complain that Hitchcock did not put his usual stamp on this film--and then they cite VERTIGO, MARNIE, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, etc., etc.--when all the time Hitchcock himself has said that this was not a typical Hitchcock film per se. He knew he had a Daphne duMaurier story to tell and he was not able to turn the whole thing into his kind of film because David O. Selznick insisted that they be as faithful as possible to the original material.And it works. REBECCA is a marvelous film, notable for the casting of the up until then rather unknown JOAN FONTAINE in the lead (which gave Selznick and Hitchcock many headaches as they tried to exact the kind of performance they wanted from her), at a time when Fontaine was regarded in Hollywood as a second-rate ""wooden"" actress who had only done a bunch of supporting roles in ""A"" films and leads in ""B"" films. She certainly proved herself up to the task.I think her performance is well nigh perfect, suggesting the timid, insecure young woman who is intimidated first, by her worldly husband, Maxim deWinter, and then by his domineering and sinister housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (JUDITH ANDERSON). But if there is one major fault, it is that I never really felt the chemistry between Max deWinter (LAURENCE OLIVIER) and Fontaine. It's as if he has all he can do to merely smile at her--he seems to be tolerating her rather than really loving her.Maybe that's because, as good an actor as he was, he was unable to show any real affection for a woman he personally wished were not playing his wife. (It's well documented that there was no mutual admiration going on between Olivier and Fontaine), although she did respect the fact that he could do everything exactly the same in take after take. Not only did he treat her with only lukewarm consideration, but she had to contend with Hitchcock who claims he had to devise all sorts of things to keep her performance on track.Whatever, the end result is what counts and REBECCA is impeccably produced, written and scored (by Franx Waxman) with utmost respect for the DuMaurier story. Supporting roles are all capably played by a British cast including GEORGE SANDERS, NIGEL BRUCE, GLADYS COOPER, REGINALD DENNY, C. AUBREY SMITH and MELVILLE COOPER.The scene where Joan Fontaine finally stands up to Mrs. Danvers, reminding her that she is now the mistress of Manderlay, and the confession scene where she listens and reacts as Olivier explains what happened on the yacht are memorable examples of first-rate screen acting. It is for these scenes where she finally gathers some strength to help her troubled husband that Fontaine really deserves the most admiration. Her earlier scenes as the mousy heroine are just a bit overdone, in my opinion.And so, with the exception of a lack of real chemistry between the stars, I think REBECCA is another example of David O. Selznick's quest for perfectionism in translating a novel to the screen as faithfully as the production code allowed."
Hitchcoc,"Sep 21, 2001",10/10,"I pretty much ignored this film when I first saw it. Having gained a great appreciation for Hitchcock and having studied his films and read widely about his work, I have come to appreciate this more than some think I should. I bought a copy of the movie, but I forced myself to read the book again (it had been about 30 years, when, out of curiosity, I read it). It is a book full of wonderful atmosphere, a bit sappy in places, but has that Gothic appeal that I love. When I got the film out, I was ready, and found myself caught up in the wonderful story. Like Jane Eyre, there is that secret that becomes a part of the decay of Manderly. It can't become alive again until things have been resolved. With a masterful hand, Hitchcock delicately brings his camera around and around and peeks in the shadows, bringing threat from every corner of the mansion. I think the acting is anything but average. Olivier is at his best, again, as in Wuthering Heights, standing above his ghosts. If there is a weakness, it's not in the film, but in the book. What are Olivier's motives in marrying the girl if he was to resign her to the coldness of her new environment. How clueless was he about the hatred directed toward his young wife. Was he totally unaware that Rebecca could hold forth even in her death? Still, even though Sir Alfred didn't really like doing this film and probably butted heads with his producer, it is a work of incredible craftsmanship, and when it is over, it makes one feel a great loss. Like ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" the cracks in the foundation are what this story is all about. If it had been made today, it would probably have brought down the characters as well."

Selznick and what a pairing it is. Hitchcock may have felt he ""compromised""...but I couldn't tell. It was atmospheric, suspenseful and downright haunting.I have seen the film several times and it never seems to loose it's charm...or it's mesmerizing allure. A big part of the continued success of this film is the wonderful cast. I am not a Laurence Olivier fan, but he seems perfect in the role of Maxim de Winter where he plays a sometimes cold and aloof aristocrat. Likewise Joan Fontaine is flawless in her portrayal of the sweet, innocent and naive new bride. There is a steller supporting cast lead by Judith Anderson who plays the eerie housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who idolized the first Mrs. De Winter so much that she has kept her rooms as a shrine or museum to her. Another supporting cast member who really stands out is George Sanders who plays Jack Favell, ""cousin"" and playboy of the first Mrs. De Winter.The story is about a British aristocrat Maxim de Winter, whose first wife dies and while mourning her in the south of France he meets a mousey (in my opinion lovely) paid companion. The two strike up a friendship and soon are married. Maxim brings his new wife home to his palatial estate named Mandalay. The new Mrs. De Winter immediately feels lost and out of place in her new home...which isn't helped by the staff and family friends' constant words praising the first Mrs. De Winter...especially the house keeper Mrs. Danvers. Mrs. Danvers' obsession with Rebecca (the first Mrs. De Winter) goes beyond normal.There are some twists in this film (of course, it's Hitchcock) and I will just say that things aren't always as they seem.This is a must see for both Hitchcock fans and fans of vintage films...I would also recommend this to fans of suspense. I have heard it said that this is a romantic story...but as a true romantic, I have to disagree. Like Romeo and Juliet, this is more of a tragedy than a romance. Haunting cinematic classic based on a classic novel."
alekspredator87,"Jul 30, 2023",7/10,"The films of Alfred Hitchcock and decades after the master's departure are remembered for their unique atmosphere. Sometimes his style is elusive in a particular scene, more often it excites when the viewer sees that memorable suspense and tension. ""Rebecca"" is a project a little unusual for the work of Alfred Hitchcock. Although all the recognizable aspects of the director are present here, the detective and the love line come to the fore. And this is undoubtedly a successful approach to the presentation of this particular work.I remember the picture and the variety of beautiful plans. The team of creators did a great job on the scenery, presenting the rather detailed rooms of the mansion to the audience.But the main characters in the film, of course, are the characters played by Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier. Moreover, in my opinion, Olivier acts as a ""second fiddle"". The main decoration of the painting is Fontaine, her game pleases and fascinates. The heroine looks both strong and lost, puzzled, and sometimes afraid of what is happening. The whole range of acting skills of the actress allows you to feel how complex her heroine is. I am sure that other contenders for this role, among whom, by the way, were the stars of the recent ""Gone with the Wind"" Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland, would hardly be able to convey the image of the heroine, which was so successfully embodied by Fontaine.Olivier is also good. The Englishman very subtly conveyed the aristocratic image of his hero, who has all the recognizable features of such persons. His hero is confident, determined, and of course it is his story that becomes something to be explored by both the heroine of the film and the audience.The acting work of all the other participants in this project is also good. I wouldn't single out anyone in particular, everyone coped perfectly. Hitchcock, as a masterful director, perfectly staged the picture, playing on the feelings of the audience and skillfully presenting this or that scene exactly as he knows how. The picture became the best at the Oscar ceremony in the corresponding year, taking the coveted statuette. The second award, which the creators could boast of, was the best work of the operator.""Rebecca"" is a worthy film of its time. Often the picture is forgotten because of the more famous works of the master of suspense, including the legendary ""Psycho"", ""Birds"", ""Window to the courtyard"" or ""In case of murder, dial ""M"". However, this is a high-quality project that will still be interesting today with its unforgettable atmosphere of detective and drama.The authors elegantly conveyed a mysterious story that is literally imbued with the intangible, but very distinct and even dangerous presence of the one called Rebecca.7 out of 10."

SnoopyStyle,"Dec 30, 2015",7/10,A sweet shy woman (Joan Fontaine) is staying at a Monte Carlo hotel assisting her employer pompous Edythe Van Hopper. She falls for the wealthy Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) and they are quickly married. His first wife supposedly drowned. They live in his country estate Manderley with strict housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) and other servants. She discovers that Rebecca still dominates Manderley.It's Alfred Hitchcock's first American effort and working under Selznick. It is beautifully shot. Joan Fontaine does well as the damsel in distress. The style is moody Gothic. It is a bit slow at times. I would like it to be more intense and less overwrought. It's an old fashion style that isn't my favorite but it is very well made.
matthewssilverhammer,"Mar 6, 2021",9/10,"One of Hitchcock's purest straight-ahead dramas cements the proof of his immense skill as a pure filmic storyteller. If there's any doubt of that, watch the scene of Olivier's Max recounting what happened to Rebecca. On page, it's nothing more than a well-written monologue; in Hitchcock's hands, it's a chilling piece of melodrama - a ghost story nearly-come-to-life. The film is fantastic in its own right but is only enhanced by the behind-the-scenes stories (Olivier & Fontaine feud, Selznick's involvement)."
slokes,"Jul 30, 2010",7/10,"Nearly 20 years before ""Vertigo"", Alfred Hitchcock made another film featuring romantic atmosphere, social misfits, a possible ghost, and male-female frustration. Except in ""Rebecca's"" case, it was from the woman's point of view.""Rebecca"" features identity confusion as well, in this case pitting a woman without a face against another without a name. Joan Fontaine is the nameless one here, paid to keep a miserable battleaxe company until she is whisked away in Monte Carlo by rich, debonair Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). It's a perfect fantasy except that the place he lives, Manderley, is a perfect nightmare.""We're happy, aren't we?"" the bride asks at one point. ""Terribly happy!"" The problem's the dead former Mrs. de Winter whose first name is the movie's title. Based on a best-selling novel by Daphne Du Maurier, Rebecca's malign spell is captured in the ornate but shadowy set decoration, a creepy Franz Waxman score, and the raven-like Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), a maid who pops out of corners of the frame offering unwanted advice on how ""the late Mrs. de Winter"" would have wanted things.Beaky, unblinking Mrs. Danvers is one reason guys might find this film frustrating. If she's so nasty, just send her packing, right? But Mrs. D works for me because of the heroine's trembly manner. Fontaine wears her character's insecurity very well. She wants to be on Mrs. Danvers' good side, which only mines ""Danny's"" contempt. Still devoted to Rebecca, a spellbinding force for whom ""love was a game"", Mrs. Danvers's perverse loyalty prompts a jealous cruelty. In ""The Shining"", we learn that people leave traces of themselves in strange buildings after they're gone, like ""if someone burns toast"". In ""Rebecca"", Mrs. Danvers IS the burned toast.Olivier is a bit of a stiff here, though it suits the part. It's a woman's-eye story all the way, with a real tough-love male to draw out his lover's unquenchable spirit. He wins her over to him with such lines as ""I should have asked you to have had lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily"" and ""I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool"". He probably sent her out for Chinese food on their honeymoon, too.The movie moves very slowly, stringing out every hurt emotion. Because Rebecca was lost at sea, Fontaine has to blurt out at one point irrespective of nothing: ""I never have any fear of drowning, have you?"" cuing a musical sting. Around Maxim, there are lots of stings. ""I'm boorish through living alone"", he says, but of course that only makes the heroine's devotion more grand. Like Mrs. Danvers, she loves fully, but not at all well.Still, ""Rebecca"" is a solid romantic film with recognizable bits of Hitchcockian suspense worked in the corners. It's his first and most successful collaboration with David O. Selznick (a nudge who this one time was right to nudge), his first American film, and his only Oscar winner.I can think of several other Hitchcock films deserving of Oscar over ""Rebecca"". But it's better than no Oscars for Hollywood's greatest director. Looking past that, ""Rebecca"" is a solid, character-driven story worth watching and appreciating for its own substantial merits."
johnnymonsarrat,"Mar 26, 2010",3/10,"I'm forced to say I just didn't ""get"" or enjoy Rebecca at all. I'm sorry.Our male hero alternates between making his love interest cry and heckling her for trying to please him. He proposes by mentioning it in a flippant and sort of insulting manner from the next room. Our female hero tries so hard to please everyone that she's constantly excusing herself and breaking down.Sure, people like this exist in the real world. But this is not a Leaving Las Vegas story of crippled people... it's portrayed as a true love story. I find it sickening. These days, we look up to strong women, and we certainly don't want people (of any gender) constantly saying thing that are mean.To add on top of this, I didn't feel any chemistry between the characters... declaring their love felt quite sudden, I didn't feel any real chemistry about the hero's angst about his dead wife... the whole film just seemed contrived. The scenes where the heroine isn't quite ready for rich living become repetitive, like beating a dead horse. It would feel preachy if only there were some message to preach. Finally, I'm sorry to say it, but cinematography and things like color have been in films for a long time now.This film left me even more confused than Chasing Amy and I couldn't get all the way through it. I can see from other people's reviews that a murder mystery eventually surfaces. But hey, I did get an hour into the film without a hint of tension so I guess that all happens later. I'm forced to give it a 3 out of 10."
acec-29548,"May 12, 2021",9/10,Alfred Hitchcock at his best. The book is extraordinary and he stays true to the book. You don't really understand the plot line and intense emotions of the characters until the very end. Well done!
CinemaSerf,"May 29, 2024",8/10,"We saw this quite recently on the big screen at Somerset House in London. One of those outdoor screenings - and the fact that it poured with rain on hundreds of us didn't matter one jot (though the hampers got quite sodden). Olivier and the eerily stupendous Judith Anderson provide the ultimate in sophisticated horror partnerships and make this by far my favourite Hitchcock film. Joan Fontaine is an expert at conveying the naive, adoring vulnerability of the second ""Mrs. De Winter"", combatting a foe she cannot hope to defeat and George Sanders is almost as sinister as he makes up the quartet in this bleak, frightening and totally enthralling two hours of cinema."
Darth_Osmosis,"May 28, 2018",10/10,"I wish Hitchcock had done more movies like this. It's not his best, but the atmosphere and mood are incredible and virtually every other element is superb too. It's hard to see how this could have been done better really."

christopher-underwood,"Feb 18, 2008",6/10,"Having seen almost all of Mr Hitchcock's films except this one it seemed time to catch up with the one many people reckon as one of his best. Well, what can I say? It is fine. Interesting from time to time and with the prowling Danvers and developing mystery, one's interest is just about held. I have several problems with the film, not least with the two leads but I think that for me the real problem is that this is not so much Hitchcock's film as that of the all powerful and at that time all involving Mr Selznick. Given more of a free reign, I would have expected Olivier to be replaced if he could not get himself a little more involved in the proceedings and not to have had Joan Fontaine play her role so meekly (and dowdily!). Most of the action at Mandelay is good and creepy but we seem to gain little from the early scenes, supposedly showing us the couple's love blossom. I also felt that the almost comic cops at the end took away what edge the director had managed to engender. Perhaps if the whole film had been confined to the house the Hitchcock shadows and menace could have helped sustain a more sinister feel throughout. Ah well, very watchable if minor Hitchcock."
showgirl626,"May 1, 2006",9/10,"I don't normally get into love stories, but this love story is so very different than most. All those Hitchcockian twists are great, Mrs. Danvers is deliciously wicked, and the on-screen interaction between Olivier and Fontaine (considering they hated each other when the cameras were turned off) was quite convincing. I have rarely enjoyed movies from this era because I thought the acting was wooden. Maybe it's just that I'm a big Hitchcock fan, but I don't think that's totally it. The lighting is wonderful, providing such crisp detail, the cinematography excellent, the set design marvelous (with the exception of a couple of cheesy fake backgrounds), and the miniature Manderley is exquisite. I would have to say that this movie is one of the best that Hitchcock ever directed, and definitely one of my favorite movies ever. I'll watch it again and again, and I'll recommend it to anyone.Enjoy."
Thanos_Alfie,"Feb 8, 2015",7/10,"""Rebecca"" is a mystery movie in which we watch a shy woman who was working as a companion girl of another woman. In a trip she and one rich man fall in love and they decide to marry. When they are returning to the main house of the man she understands that he is still troubled by the death of his first wife, Rebecca, who was killed in a boating accident the year before. And in that the mystery starts.I really liked this movie because of the plot which was really nice written but also for the direction of it which made by the master Alfred Hitchcock and his contribution in the success of this movie was really obvious. We can understand in many scenes the tips and the guidance that Alfred Hitchcock gave to the actors on how to play, to show etc. About the interpretation I have to say that I loved the interpretation of Joan Fontaine who played as Mrs. de Winter and also the interpretation of Laurence Olivier who played as 'Maxim' de Winter. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Judith Anderson's who played as Mrs. Danvers and I believe that she was great on her part. Another important fact that I have to mention is that this movie did not tire me even a little and kept me in tense in the whole duration of it, something that I believe is extremely important for a mystery movie.Lastly I believe that ""Rebecca"" is a nice mystery movie which combines really well this mystery with the romance between the couple and the result that comes out from it is the best. I also think that this movie is one of the best of Alfred Hitchcock and I strongly recommend it to everyone because it's a must see movie."
blu_cu,"Nov 20, 2001",9/10,"Rebecca was the second consecutive Best Picture produced by David O. Selznick. Selznick did the right thing in bringing Hitchcock to direct the film and in doing so, turned it into a classic. Hitchcock is a genius and throughly deserved an Oscar. Laurence Olivier plays the rich English owner of Manderly, Maxim De Winter. Olivier gives a fine and tortured performance of a man who is haunted by his dead wife, Rebecca. His performance was great but the only flaw is that his character is annoyingly unresponsive to his wife. Judith Anderson gives a chilling performance as Mrs. Danvers, the crazed housekeeper with a lunatic obsession to her dead mistress, Rebecca. Her lines are classic and it is she who gives the tense atmosphere to the movie-Hitchcock's dark and cold Manderly just enhanced Miss Anderson's performance. It is Joan Fontaine who really gave the stellar performance as the second Mrs. De Winter. She is a shy girl who suddenly marries the haunted Maxim of a great estate. Hitchcock originially wanted Fontaine's sister, Olivia De Havilland to play the part. Olivier wanted his wife, Vivien Leigh. Although both ladies are great actresses, I'm glad that Fontaine was cast because she made Rebecca what it is today. This was the movie that sprung Fontaine to stardom and her shyness of the camera was carefully inputed into the character of the lonely Mrs. De Winter. Her first words: ""Last night I dreamt we went to Manderly again"" sets context not only to the story but to the character of Mrs. De Winter. She is shy, unused to a formal life, desperate for Maxim's love and most of all, intimidated by the presence of the late Rebecca in Manderly. Mrs. De Winter was supposed to be a plain and mousy person and so, Fontaine had the misfortune of being a beautiful woman playing an unattractive one. However, Fontaine presents other ways of being unattractive--such as that Mrs. De Winter has absolutely no social skills. All in all, Fontaine gave a performance that deserved a Best Actress Oscar. Although she lost out to Ginger Rogers, the Academy gave a compensation Oscar the following year for her less impressive ""Suspicion""."
caspian1978,"Jun 17, 2001",6/10,"You can't help but wonder about the mansion they lived at in the film Rebecca. Take a good look at it in the opening of the film and ask yourself the question, Does this house look very similar to the one Charles Foster Kane lived at in Citizen Kane? Not only does it look very similar, but the film starts out exactly like Citizen Kane with the slow movement of the camera introducing the mansion. I wonder what Orson Welles was thinking when he made his masterpiece 1 year after Rebecca premiered in theaters?????"
tfrizzell,"Jul 10, 2002",N/A,"The only Alfred Hitchcock (Oscar-nominated for directing) film to win the Best Picture Oscar, ""Rebecca"" is one of those typical films from the amazing director that chills, entertains and puts you on the edge of your seat each time you watch it. Joan Fontaine (Oscar-nominated) has just married the very wealthy Laurence Olivier (also Oscar-nominated), but she is haunted by his mysterious housekeeper (a show-stopping Oscar-nominated performance by Judith Anderson) and the memory of the film's titled character (Olivier's late wife). Hitchcock, noted for his subtle sexual under-tones in films spares none of that here as Anderson's character and the late titled character's relationship seemed to go much further than employee-employer. Anderson slowly tries to drive Fontaine to insanity and the end she may accomplish her devious goal. Hitchcock's first real major U.S. debut stunned the Academy and audiences alike and would lead to the coveted Best Picture Oscar. It is not the best film the legendary director ever worked on, but it is still an amazingly good production that works on many cinematic levels. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
appleimacdude,"Aug 13, 2004",10/10,"This movie has so many twists and turns - you may think you have it figured out very early on, but soon discover that things don't seem quite as they may appear - this is not a simple movie!  Very cleverly written, with superb acting on the part of the staff, both in the major and minor rolls!This would be an excellent addition to anyones film library, a good movie to take out for others to see who may not be familiar with old movies - or for those who are!This was a movie where I had to immediately check the IMOB database to find out details on who everyone was after I watched it (on TMC on TV, which doesn't air credits after the old movies - good commentary, but I had to know ""who played Mrs. Danvers"" - Dame Judith Anderson!"
loveballet12,"Jul 18, 2012",8/10,"Date: 18 July, 2012 -First Time Watch- I love old Hollywood movies, mostly because they had good story lines and fantastic acting. Alfred Hitchcock does an amazing job with this in almost every movie he did. 'Rebecca' is an example of a another amazing old Hollywood film. The story opens with Joan Fontaine finds Laurence Olivier (he was so young and I felt oddly attracted to him) on the ledge of a cliff, ready to jump in. She stops him and they met up again later that day. They spend lots of time with each other and soon marry, despite the fact that Ms. Fontaine is unprepared for her new role as Olivier's wife. Trouble only continues when Ms. Fontaine arrives at the large estate and finds that everyone, especially the head maid Miss. Danvers, compares her to the greatly loved Rebecca, Olivier's first wife who died tragically a year before when she took her boat out by herself and drowned. But, as always Mr. Hitchcock throws in several twists and turns with a surprising conclusion. Definitely a very well done film with plenty of action and suspense to keep you interested.8/10"
Incalculacable,"Jan 9, 2006",8/10,"Rebecca, I must say, is a masterpiece. This is what movies today SHOULD be like. It's suspenseful, intriguing, interesting - it really takes you on a journey full of sympathy (mainly for the second Mrs. de Winter - so vulnerable, weak, but she undergoes a major transformation), hate, jealousy, mystery, murder, suspicion and many more. I liked Joan Fontaine's acting better than Larry Olivier, I felt she put a lot of soul into her character (her acting may have been enhanced by Hitchcocks comment that everyone on the set hated her) and you sort of felt awkward when she and Maxim were having a fight, you felt sorry for her. Mrs Danvers is just plain spooky, especially giving that hypnotic speech to The Second Mrs de Winter.It's an amazing movie, held my attention, very impressed. A true masterpiece!"
estebangonzalez10,"Mar 17, 2014",9/10,"""You thought you could be Mrs. de Winter, live in her house, walk in her steps, take the things that were hers! But she's too strong for you. You can't fight her - no one ever got the better of her.""Without ever being physically present or having a line in the film, Rebecca's strange influence over everyone dominates the film in a way only Hitchcock could have pulled off. I still have a lot of Hitchcock films to catch up with, but so far I haven't seen one I disliked. Rebecca is a near masterpiece and Hitchcock once again proves his craft as a director by slowly building a psychological romantic thriller and then once we are hooked with the characters he pulls the rug under our feet and delivers some surprising twists we never expected. This may not be one of Hitchcock's most popular films, but it will always be regarded for being the only film of his that won him an Oscar. Rebecca isn't his best film (which in my opinion is Rear Window), but it deserves to be ranked amongst his best work thanks to a gripping screenplay, some wonderful performances, memorable characters, and above all its beautiful black and white cinematography. It is simply stunning and despite being made in 1940 it still manages to remain incredibly suspenseful and unique. Despite knowing that Hitchcock is going to come up with an interesting twist he completely catches me off guard every time and leaves me even more engaged with his work. My only complaint (a minor one) with his films is that despite being subtle throughout the story at the end he spells everything out for the audience trying to explain the twists (Psycho is the best example of this, but in Rebecca it's done again and it makes the film drag a bit near the end, but it's only a minor complaint considering we are talking about the Master of Suspense).Rebecca is based on Daphne Du Maurier's celebrated novel (who also wrote The Birds which Hitchcock later went on to direct) and adapted by Robert E. Sherwood. The story centers on a shy unnamed woman (Joan Fontaine) who works as a paid companion to the wealthy Edythe Van Hooper (Florence Bates). While they are in Monte Carlo she meets a wealthy estate owner named Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Edythe mentions that Maxim's wife, Rebecca, passed away an year ago in a boating incident and he hasn't recovered from it. During their short stay in Monte Carlo however, Maxim falls in love with her and the two marry within weeks of having met. Maxim takes the new Mrs. de Winter to his beautiful country home known as Manderley and introduces her to the staff. Despite being in awe of the majestic home, she feels intimidated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), who remains obsessed with Rebecca. As the days pass, Mrs. de Winter begins to feel overwhelmed by everyone's affection towards Rebecca and somehow she feels that Maxim is still very much in love with her. Rebecca's shadow seems to interfere with everything she does and she begins to feel her relationship is doomed.Rebecca is not simply a psychological thriller centering on relationships, it is a film focusing on identity. Despite never being seen, Rebecca's presence dominates this film and she seems to have a strange effect over everyone. In contrast, the second Mrs. de Winter only gets her name once she marries Maxim and she never really has an identity of her own. She is continually threatened by Rebecca's presence no matter what she does and despite wanting to overcome it she can't because everyone seems to have adored her. Hitchcock builds the tension and suspense very subtly with memorable characters. Despite being extremely beautiful Joan Fontaine pulls off an incredibly natural and believable performance as this shy and insecure pet-girl. Laurence Oliver also plays his role as the loving but distant character very well. However the two most memorable performances for me came from the supporting cast. Judith Anderson and George Sanders play the villains to perfection. Sanders delivers some comedic relief, while Anderson's mysterious and cold face uneases us from the moment she appears on screen. The Gothic mood underlying the film mixes perfectly with the haunting ghost story as Rebecca's presence can be felt everywhere once we step into Manderley. Hitchcock has done it again."
fionafarsi,"Aug 28, 2020",6/10,"I am a big fan of Hitchcock's work but I was quite disappointed with this one. The film lacks gothic and mysterious elements that are present in Daphne DuMaurier's novel. I feel as if this film was rushed and there was not enough depth to the characters. The build up to the big twist was underwhelming. While reading the book, there was a lot of build up towards the end, preparation. I will admit though, it is hard to fit a storyline that occurs over the course of 6 months into a 2 hour movie. The only reason I am giving this a higher rating is because I think that the the main characters are perfect in their roles."
lisa-kevin3531,"May 5, 2009",10/10,"I've never been a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock, but his Rebecca is simply hard to fault. Even if you aren't a vintage movie buff, you owe it to yourself to see this film. Joan Fontaine is stunningly beautiful as the new Mrs. DeWinter and Laurence Olivier is charming but cold as her new husband. Judith Anderson as the sinister housekeeper is a performance that must be seen to be fully appreciated. The production is flawless and the trademark Hitchcock use of light and shadows to create an eerie atmosphere is truly a work of fine art. I first saw this movie on late night TV when I was a teenager, and I've seen it probably twenty times since then. This is one movie I will never tire of. There simply isn't enough praise for this film! This is a must-see motion picture. The mystery is enthralling, right up to the last frame."
Philaura,"Aug 16, 1999",6/10,"Not nearly as thrilling as I was expecting, today's movies have come so much further with script writing, actors are more natural, sets more spectacular, etc.The lighting was gorgeous and quite breathtaking at times, but it seemed to me more of an education in film making as it was done back then.  The old scenic backdrops were fun to see, but obviously artificial.  While Joan Fontain was adorable, Lawrence O'livia was far too stiff for me to get comfortable with his character.  The gal that played the gustapo type housekeeper was way over the top.  She looked like something out of the silent film era. All very interesting, but not totally satisfying for me. Not what I expected."
Handlinghandel,"Aug 31, 2002",7/10,"I hadn't seen this movie in maybe 15 years. The opening voiceover spoken by Joan Fontaine is splendid and classic. The movie is beautifully, skillfully directed. I am not a fan of Hitchcock works such as ""Vertigo"" -- no matter how often I see it, it still seems tacky -- or ""Psycho"" after the shower scene. So this is far better.My favorites are ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" ""Notorious,"" and ""Strangers on a Train."" And ""North By Northwest.""But it is a bodice-ripper. It's awfully corny in many ways. Olivier's seeming uninterest in Fontaine makes sense in the early parts but once The Secret has been revealed and they speak to each other in Hushed Tones, he seems no more interested."
jetk-1,"Jun 16, 2008",3/10,"This film is pretty much a disgrace to the book. It has terrible dialogue, music, and is very, very boring, not even in such a way that leaves you to hope for a climax, or some kind of abstract moral or psychological meaning, but in a way that makes you claw out your eyes with frustration that a movie can be so terrible.It is baffling to think that this won an Oscar, and just because you have a pretty face doesn't mean you make a movie good. And I'll add that the character of the 2nd Mrs. DeWinter is supposed to be dreadfully boring because she is supposed to be of no consequence at all. What a terrible letdown after reading the book.The only thing gloomy about the movie is that it actually exists."
Snow Leopard,"Jul 26, 2001",N/A,"This fine classic combines a great director, a great story, and a great cast.  Any one of those would have made for a good movie, but all three make it an excellent one.  Hitchcock's style and eye for detail combine very well with a story (from a novel that is extremely good in its own right) filled with psychological fear and settings that are interesting and suggestive.Most of the time the story itself moves fairly slowly, allowing the focus to be on the characters, but there are also a couple of very good plot twists, which can be very surprising if you've not seen the movie or read the novel. So if you happen not to know the story, it's a good idea to see the film before reading a lot of comments about it.  Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson, and George Sanders are all perfectly cast and do a wonderful job bringing their characters to life, and making you feel a part of the story.""Rebecca"" should be satisfying not only to any Hitchcock fan, but to anyone who likes classic movies.  Whether you like romance, suspense, or drama, they're all here, and put together by a director and cast that are masters of their art."
davidholmesfr,"Feb 19, 2002",9/10,"Worthy of its place in cinema history, Rebecca remains a lesson to all would-be filmmakers. The opening scenes, light, airy and frothy, played out in romantic comedy style as de Winter meets his second wife in the south of France, soon give way to a more forbidding atmosphere. From the amusing delights of Mrs Van Hopper and sunshine to the menace of Mrs Danvers and the swirling mists of Manderley is a short, but life-changing step for the second Mrs de Winter.Hitchcock's use of light and shadow add to the feeling of foreboding. The fall of shadows across Joan Fontaine as she explores the house adds to the impression of her imprisonment in the rambling old house. And slowly, as ever, the master builds the tension as we realise that there is more to de Winter's first marriage and his wife's death than meets the eye. As one minor quibble, perhaps the scene in which Fontaine appears for the ball in a copy of a gown Rebecca had worn was slightly over-played, given that we could all see what was coming.The acting between Olivier and Fontaine was out of the top drawer, no doubt aided and abetted by Hitchcock's `encouragement' of the personal dislike the two had for each other. Judith Anderson's icy menace makes her perfect in the role of Mrs Danvers and is a strong counterpoint for the fiery ending. Lighting, editing and all the other elements come together to make this a fine piece of early noir."
JamesHitchcock,"Nov 15, 2005",8/10,"It is strange that after arriving in Hollywood from Britain, Alfred Hitchcock should have chosen to base his first film upon a novel by Daphne du Maurier, the same author, who had provided him with the material for the last film of his British period. ""Jamaica Inn"" was one of his few failures, a minor-league costume drama that is today of little interest except to Hitchcock completists. With ""Rebecca"", however, he achieved one of his greatest successes, even though the story is hardly typical of his work.A number of Hitchcock's films, such as ""The 39 Steps"" or ""North by North-West"" end up with the hero and heroine falling in love, but are nevertheless essentially suspense films with an element of romance. ""Rebecca"", however, is essentially a romance with elements of suspense. Indeed, it starts out as a romantic comedy. A young woman (we never learn her name) staying on the French Riviera with her employer Mrs Van Hopper, meets and falls in love with Maxim de Winter, a handsome older widower. There is a brief comic sequence as the two lovers try to outwit the overbearing, bullying Mrs Van Hopper and escape back to England.With the shift in location to England, the mood of the film becomes darker and more serious. We learn that Maxim is the wealthy owner of Manderley, a stately home near the Cornish coast, and that he was widowed about a year earlier when his first wife Rebecca drowned in a boating accident. The new Mrs de Winter finds it difficult to adapt to her new role as the mistress of such a large house, especially as she feels that everyone, including the servants and Maxim's friends, is comparing her unfavourably with the beautiful and accomplished Rebecca. Maxim reveals to her that his first marriage was an unhappy one as Rebecca was compulsively promiscuous and betrayed him with a number of lovers. This revelation does not, however, put her mind at rest, because evidence soon comes to light that suggests that Maxim may have killed Rebecca out of jealousy.The ""suspense"" elements of the film only occur near the end, when Maxim has to struggle to clear himself from suspicion of murder. There are no typical Hitchcock set-pieces like the crop-duster in ""North by North-West"" or the shower scene in ""Psycho"". This is, however, one of the most atmospheric of Hitchcock's films. Although it was shot in California, the morning mists, the pine trees by the rocky coast and the Gothic mansion are all suggestive of England. (I suspect that if Hollywood were to make the film today they would try to Americanise it, but in the forties their attitude to British literature was generally more respectful).In a way this is a ghost story, although not in the literal sense of a tale of supernatural happenings. Manderley may not be literally haunted, but it is permeated by Rebecca's spirit. The old house is solid and luxurious, but it also has an oppressive air, especially for Mrs de Winter. (Max Ophuls was to conjure up a similar atmosphere in ""Caught"", made a few years later). Rebecca does not actually appear in the film; she does not appear in the book either, but that is a first-person narrative told from the viewpoint of her successor. In the film, where the first-person perspective is largely abandoned, it would have been much easier to show her in flashback, but Hitchcock chose to resist this temptation. In my view he was right to do so. Rebecca is far more frightening as an unseen but malevolent and brooding presence than she would be if seen in the flesh.Mrs de Winter is an outsider at Manderley, partly because she is from a less privileged social background than Maxim, partly because she is the only character who never knew Rebecca personally. Maxim was probably attracted to her precisely because she was so unlike Rebecca. As she is supposed to be somewhat plain and dowdy, Joan Fontaine, one of the most attractive actresses of the period, was perhaps not physically right for the role. (Joanna David, in the 1979 TV production, seemed closer to du Maurier's conception of the character). Nevertheless, Fontaine's interpretation of the role is a very good one, making her shy and bewildered but possessed of an inner strength which enables her love for Maxim to survive.Laurence Olivier is also good as Maxim, bringing out the two sides of his character. On the one hand he is the calm, self-possessed English gentleman, on the other a man haunted by his past. The other performance which stands out is that of Judith Anderson as the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers. Always dressed in black, with a severe hairstyle, moving silently through the house, Mrs Danvers initially greets the new Mrs de Winter with an icy formality, but gradually becomes her chief tormentor. Although this could not be explicitly stated in the forties, there is a strong hint that Mrs Danvers is a lesbian and that she might have been in love with Rebecca. Certainly, the scene in which she stands lasciviously pawing her late employer's underwear is highly suggestive.It certainly seemed eccentric of the Academy to give this film the ""Best Picture"" award while withholding ""Best Director"" from Hitchcock. 1940 was, however, a very strong year in the history of the cinema and, excellent film though ""Rebecca"" is, I am not sure that it is necessarily a greater one than John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"", Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" or ""The Philadelphia Story"", all of which were nominated. I suspect that the decision to give ""Best Picture"" to ""Rebecca"" and ""Best Director"" to Ford may have been a deliberate attempt to spread the honours more evenly. Nevertheless, ""Rebecca"" remains one of the great Hitchcock classics. 8/10"
bkoganbing,"Aug 17, 2006",8/10,"I've always found it curious that of all the films Alfred Hitchcock directed Rebecca was the one that wound up with the Best Picture Oscar and that Hitchcock didn't receive Best Director for it. Usually those two go together. John Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director for The Grapes of Wrath that year instead. Also Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson were nominated and all came up short.Off the top of my head I would say Vertigo, North By Northwest, Shadow of a Doubt, and Spellbound are all qualitatively better than Rebecca. Yet Rebecca does have a nice Gothic horror feel to it though there is nothing supernatural going on here.Laurence Olivier plays Maxim DeWinter, heir to the estate of Manderley who is in Monte Carlo looking to get away from the place because of the death of his first wife Rebecca. She was by all accounts a regal beauty who was the toast of society and he's in mourning for her loss.But he meets Joan Fontaine a nice, but plain sort of girl who is the paid companion of American dowager Florence Bates. Maybe because she's the opposite of Rebecca he's attracted to her. Fontaine grabs him on the spot when marriage is proposed.Fontaine has a lot of insecurities much like her character in a following Hitchcock film, Suspicion. They're not eased any by Judith Anderson the housekeeper of the big Manderley estate.Mrs. Danvers was Judith's career role. Before writing this review I remarked to someone else that I wonder what Mr. Danvers must have been like. It occurred to me later that there was no Mr. Danvers, he exists only as an excuse or a pretense so there would be no whispers about her unmarried status. She pretends to be a widow.There's more than just latent lesbianism in Judith Anderson's portrayal. She was totally in love with the late Rebecca DeWinter and I'm sure it got good and physical. She can't stand seeing anyone else in taking her place. Since it comes out that Rebecca was fooling around with her cousin George Sanders, why not a lesbian affair as well. If Rebecca were written today, Mrs. Danvers would be more openly lesbian.Rebecca was the first of Alfred Hitchcock's American films as well, though it was done here it was done by the English colony in Hollywood. Hitchcock never had budgets that Selznick gave him over in the UK. The sets depicting the grandeur of Manderley are an eye full. Than again so were the sets of Tara in Selznick's Best Picture of the previous year, Gone With the Wind.Rebecca is a good mixture of mystery, Gothic horror, and romance served up quite nicely by Alfred Hitchcock."
Boba_Fett1138,"Oct 24, 2008",7/10,"Not that this movie is horrible but it just also doesn't exactly lives up to its reputation. This is not the only Hitchcock movie with this problem and even though I absolute love most of Hitchcock's movies and he was an absolutely brilliant and a one of a kind director, he doesn't get a critical free pass from me. Needless to say this movie disappointed me even though it had plenty of redeeming qualities, which in the long run still makes this a perfectly good movie.Problem to me is the movie its story and then especially the pace its being told in. Mostly the middle part of the movie is just a complete bore. Nothing interesting or mysterious enough is happening in it. From an Hitchcock movie you would at least expect some suspense but there is actually very little of that present here. You can say that this movie is not really being enough 'Hitchcock' like. Perhaps this was because this was Hitchcock's very first Hollywood movie and he was kept more on a short leach by the studio's and the movie its producers?A redeeming quality is the movie its last halve hour or so, when your whole view of the movie its main character suddenly changes when you learn about the truth. You really don't like sympathize for the man at first but once you know what really happened this suddenly all changes for you and he becomes actually a tragic character you start to care for.The movie is also being innovative by using some real dynamic and experimental camera-work at times, as you basically always can expect from an Hitchock movie. It also makes good use of miniature and while watching this movie I couldn't help wondering if this movie didn't somewhat inspired ""Citizen Kane"". Some of the effects and camera handling seems to be the same and of course the Manderlay estate can also be seen as Xanadu, you don't need a lot of imagination for that.The movie tries to create a good dark and mysterious atmosphere but when there is not an awful lot happening in the movie, atmosphere is not really enough to make a movie with. It suits the movie that its being shot in black & white and all but the atmosphere is just not as good, moody and horror Gothic like as everyone tries to make you believe it is. The story just simply doesn't allow this.The movie has a typical solid '40's cast, with popular actors such as Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and popular supporting actors such as George Sanders, Nigel Bruce and Gladys Cooper involved. It was especially nice to see Laurence Olivier in an Hitchcock movie, two Hollywood legends working together. The acting is overall good in this movie though it tends to become a bit overly melodramatic at times.Give credit where credit is due. This is a good movie but no way a classic, or among Hitchcock's best work. Oh well, seems that just not a lot of people agree with me on this, also considering that this movie won an Oscar for best picture in 1941. It won as well for its cinematography by George Barnes and was nominated in 9 more categories.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
ankitmirinseth,"Jun 16, 2009",9/10,"This was Hitchcock first American masterpiece which marked the beginning of a new era for Hitchcock. It was the first among the string of hits he directed during 40's and 50's. And moreover this is is so different from his other movies which generally revolve around some guy trying to clear his name and someone discussing a perfect murder. I cannot understand why academy didn't award Hitchcock an Oscar for this(though the movie got one) This is the story of a young simple woman played by Joan Fontaine who falls in love and marries a widower Maxim De Winter who is the lord of Manderly . She finds herself in a awkward position of the employer in their mansion with a fleet of servants to her disposal . But she finds that everyone is still in awe with with maxim's ex-wife Rebecca and no matter what she does she cannot fill her shoes. Maxim played by Laurence Olivier is a loving husband who loses his mind easily and bursts into violent anger sometimes. He is quite convincing as a man trying to forget his dead wife and trying to move on. But the most memorable role is that of Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper.She represents Rebecca in the movie and cannot accept new Mrs. DE winter as Rebbecca's replacement. She creates a mesmerizing atmosphere with her icy looks and fearlessness.The strength of movie lies in the impeccable performances by everyone especially the scenes the new Mrs. DE winter share with Mrs. Denver's. And to compliment this is the chilly music score by Franz Waxman.Finally, one has to mention the cinematography, which is magnificent Ultimately this is a must watch for everyone."
blanche-2,"Jun 11, 2005",10/10,"Rebecca is one film I could watch over and over. It is definitely one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. I recently saw the DVD version for the first time, which had the screen tests and some of Selznick's memos.My favorite was the memo that said, ""Please don't say anything to Larry and Vivien"" referring to the fact that Vivien Leigh wanted the Fontaine role so that she could be with Olivier. Though her second screen test was better than her first, in my mind, I've always pictured Leigh as the actual Rebecca, were she ever shown.The casting is perfect, with Joan Fontaine as the insecure Mrs. De Winter, coldly manipulated and laughed at by Mrs. Danvers, as expertly portrayed by Judith Anderson. Jack Favell is Rebecca's sly cousin, beautifully played by George Sanders.Olivier is gorgeous as Max, mysterious and distant. He utters two of the all-time most devastating lines heard in a relationship: ""Happiness is something I know very little about. If you say we're happy, let's leave it at that.""I have one quibble with ""Rebecca,"" which is very minor. There were just a few too many shots of Rebecca's initials. But I loved seeing that R in the last shot."
moritzherz,"Mar 24, 2023",6/10,"Alfred Hitchcock is definitely one of the top 5 movie directors of all time. He not only revolutionized whole genres, he invented new ways of working with the camera, while still entertaining with intriguing, intelligently written stories.Rebecca is one of those typicall Hitchcock movies, you can feel that right from the beginning. A compelling story with great plottwists and a shocking ending. The master of suspense created an oscar winning classic you should watch, especially because of the great cast around Joan Fontaine's masterclass depiction of the new Mrs deWinter.It is not Hitch's best movie, but still definitely a must watch for people interested in cinema history!"
preppy-3,"Nov 23, 2008",5/10,"A shy insecure poor young woman (Joan Fontaine) meets rich widowed Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier). He falls in love with her and they quickly get married. He then brings her to his huge English estate called Manderley. She quickly finds out that Max can't seem to get over his first wife and the evil housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) loved the first Mrs. de Winter--and doesn't want anyone to take her place.Alfred Hitchcock's first American picture. This has always been regarded as a masterpiece but I don't really like it. It's is beautifully done with top production values (Manderley alone is stunning) and won a well-deserved Oscar for cinematography (also for Best Picture which I can't figure out). Fontaine was nominated for her wonderful performance and George Sanders and Gladys Cooper stand out in supporting roles. Also there's a STRONG lesbian subtext between Mrs. Danvers and the first wife. But that's about it for good things. Olivier is terrible in his role. He comes off as an obnoxious jerk--I kept wondering what Fontaine's character saw in him. He didn't want Fontaine in the movie (he wanted his wife Vivien Leigh) and it comes through loud and clear. The movie moves far too slow--things seem dragged out for no earthly reason. Also even though Fontaine was great her insecurity at the beginning got annoying quick. More than once I just wanted her to slap Mrs. Danvers silly.I've seen this multiple times and still can't figure out why it's so highly regarded. It's not Hitch's worst (that's ""The Trouble With Harry"") but certainly not his best (that's ""Rope""). I give it a 5 but most people seem to love it."
semioticz,"Oct 19, 2007",N/A,"London, England's 'notorious' director of psychological thrill, suspense, mystery & drama films, Sir Alfred Hitchcock (8.13.1899-4.29.1980), was nominated for 5 Oscars: ""Rebecca"" (1940), Hitchcock's 1st US motion picture, earned his 1st directorial Oscar nomination & won the 1941 Oscar for Best Picture. Thus, began the history of acclaim for Hitchcock's remarkable career as a motion picture & television show director.Both of ""Rebecca's"" lead actors, Sir Laurence Olivier ('Maxim' de Winter) & Joan Fontaine ('Madam' de Winter), were nominated for Oscars, as well. Original music by Franz Waxman provides a combination of eerie, erotic, moody & emotive orchestration effects. George Barnes won ""Rebecca's"" 2nd Oscar for Best Cinematography in Black & White.Novelist Daphne Du Maurier's plot certainly wouldn't work nearly as well without the spooky head housekeeper of the de Winters' castle, Manderley: Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson). Danvers entered Manderley with Rebecca (de Winter), Maxim's first wife who left him a widower & left Danvers obsessed with her. The nearly unspoken memory of Rebecca is the haunting aspect that Hitchcock expertly raises from the dead throughout this film to its magnificent end.Fontaine & Olivier deliver superb starring performances of Du Maurier's novel's protagonists through Philip MacDonald's & Michael Hogan's adaptation and Robert E. Sherwood's & Joan Harrison's screenplay. The two fall in love on vacation in Monte Carlo, marry & return to Maxim de Winter's castle on a craggy coastal cliff in England.Fontaine's Mrs. de Winter is young, unassuming & constantly feels out of place due to Danvers' psychological torment by comparing Maxim's new wife with his dead one. Danvers contrasts Rebecca's perfection to the newlywed's shortcomings. Fontaine's Madame de Winter is led to believe that everyone was ""enchanted"" by Rebecca, even as she knows of her own plain, unpretentious simplicity. The historical atmosphere of Rebecca seemingly shrouding Manderley has the effect of nearly driving Fontaine's de Winter nuts.Before the true mystery of Rebecca is revealed, a shipwreck near Manderley forces Maxim to tell his new wife the truth about Rebecca. That's when everything the film builds the audience up for starts to unfold. Unlike so many psychological suspenses, Hitchcock's delivers a grand flood of surprises & unpredictable twists up to the very end.A note of interest: 9 of Hitchcock's motion pictures still rank in the top 250 today on IMDb.com. ""Rebecca"" is currently #75. An astounding 5 Hitchcock films are ranked in the top 100! No other actor, director, producer or any other contributor of works to motion pictures comes close to ranking as consistently high for the span of a century as Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Though Sir Ian McKellen comes close with 3 films in the top 100 & rated by over 400,000 viewers' votes!"
ackstasis,"Dec 25, 2007",9/10,"By the end of the 1930s, working for Michael Balcon at the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation , director Alfred Hitchcock was heading towards the peak of his artistic potential. Films such as 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934),' 'The 39 Steps (1935)' and 'The Lady Vanishes (1938)' became both critical and commercial successes, and so it was only a matter of time before he was tempted over to Hollywood to pursue even greater fame and fortune. Though his working relationship with independent producer David O. Selznick proved constantly frustrating  Selznick often demanded a large amount of creative control over his films  their very first collaboration proved one of Hitchcock's most successful, with 'Rebecca (1940)' becoming his only film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Based on Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel of the same name, 'Rebecca' is a tense, atmospheric Gothic melodrama about the lingering influence of the story's unseen title character, long after her own death.Relative newcomer Joan Fontaine plays a young, modest woman who falls in love with a wealthy widower, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier), who still apparently mourns the death of his wife, Rebecca. Following a humble wedding in Monte Carlo, the two lovers return to Maxim's sprawling Manderley estate in Cornwall, England, where the servants  especially the chillingly creepy Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson)  find it difficult to accept this young bride as the new Mrs. de Winter. Whenever Fontaine's character finds herself within the walls of her new home, the atmosphere in each of the rooms is discomforting, even suffocating, as she struggles vainly to assimilate into a world for which she is unsuited. Her character symbolically remains without a given name, reinforcing the story's stance that she is without an individual identity; as long as she remains with Maxim, she will continue to be evaluated against Rebecca, and will be forever in the lingering shadow of Maxim's long-dead, ""perfect"" previous wife.The Master of Suspense certainly knew how to make an entrance into Hollywood, and 'Rebecca' is definitely one of his top ten films {out of the twenty-seven that I've seen thus far}. Though, at 130 minutes, it is one of the longest motion pictures that Hitchcock ever produced, the film never drags nor feels overly cumbersome, with the extended running time merely prolonging the suffering that the audience must endure through Fontaine's innocent, continually-threatened character. This isn't the sort of thriller that lulls you into a false sense of security and then shocks you, since that was simply not Hitchcock's style. Like another Gothic thriller of which I am fond, George Cukor's 'Gaslight (1944),' the main character is forever at ill-ease with her surroundings, and we, as the audience, are never afforded the luxury of feeling safe and secure. Rebecca de Winter is one of the most meticulously-detailed unseen characters in the history of cinema, and, without the story ever straying into supernatural territory, it seems as though her lingering presence is somehow orchestrating the disturbing events of the film."
Pimpernel_Of_Scarlet,"Jan 16, 2009",9/10,"This Hitchcock film was the first he made in Hollywood and he thought it was a compromise because he did not have complete control. Don't let that fool you. This is a classic film by perhaps the best director in history and it offers a view of Gothic horror and/or mystery you won't soon forget.""Rebecca"" is nearly 70 years old and yet it still projects a surreal world that draws the viewer into its web. Laurence Olivier is convincing as the brooding Maxim de Winter--a man unable to forget his first wife, Rebecca, who died a mysterious death. That presents a big problem for Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter. She is a young and fragile newlywed who finds herself in a dark and confusing situation. She cannot fathom Maxim's many mood changes and his cold demeanor and she feels everyone is comparing her to the first Mrs. de Winter.This begs the question why did she marry him in the first place? Was she blinded by his scholarly manners or his offer of a comfortable life? Whatever he presented in courtship changed as soon as he returned to Manderley. He never seemed to grasp the fact that she felt out of place and was confused as to her role as lady of the manor.Some argue that Fontaine was too weak in the role, but I could not find a false note in any of her scenes. She started out as a mousy girl in love who was dependent on a strange, distant husband for everything. But, she fought her way to the truth about the first Mrs. de Winter and became a strong woman at the end of the film.Character actors, a Hitchcock staple, are a big plus in ""Rebecca"" as Dame Judith Anderson, Nigel Bruce, Gladys Cooper and George Sanders bolster the film. Anderson is amazing as Mrs. Danvers, the manor's housekeeper, whose presence seems to cast a cold and foreboding pall over everything. Her formal manner also has de Winter's new bride completely mesmerized and the give and take between the two actresses becomes a battle of sorts. Maxim seems unaware of the tension between the two and he seemingly has no fear of Mrs. Danvers even though she is so much a part of his tragic past.Although unspoken throughout, Hitchcock resurrects the memory of Rebecca as a tool to haunt all aspects of this film. From beginning to end, there is the strange feeling that she is still alive somehow and has returned to Manderley to claim her rightful place.In 1940, Hitchcock could well have used color for this film, but black and white proved to be an excellent choice. The dark shadows and fog just make the mansion that much more eerie and that includes the billowy curtains, which take on a life of their own when the wind blows.This film was Hitchcock's first ""modern"" picture, seemingly eons away from his small British movies of the 1930s. It is a Hollywood studio film (in the best sense) and David Selznick's production skills are evident as the ""look"" of the movie is very good even by today's standards. Even if the director felt this was not his best effort, many critics think this is Hitchcock's first classic film in a long line of them."
l-seidel,"Apr 19, 2014",9/10,"Rebecca is a beautifully made film that, every time I watch it, sticks with me for some time after. Hitchcock masterfully uses the medium of film to mirror the story he is telling. The way the images flow across the screen is haunting, beautiful and adds so much to the emotional resonance of each moment.I think what I love most about Rebecca is how many scenes revel in the quiet and in sparse dialogue. Words are being said, but you can hear the characters holding back torrents of emotions and thoughts. This is especially true in scenes between Mrs. Danvers and the new Mrs. De Winter. I can't say enough about the actress who portrays Mrs. Danvers. I found myself so drawn to her character while at the same time completely creeped out by her. This is how you do horror!Definitely my favorite Hitchcock film."
rancencolt,"Jan 17, 2005",10/10,"What other word can describe such a piece of art? The Selznick/Hitchcock team may have been very strained relation-wise, but it proved to turn out one heck of a motion picture. The photography is awesome. The shadows cast all over Manderley are beautiful. The performances are dead-on. Joan Fontaine deserved the Oscar, but Judith Anderson is the best here. She never misses a note as the sinister Mrs. Danvers.The basic summary is this: Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) takes his second wife (Fontaine) back to his large estate Manderley, where his bride is terrorized by memories of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca.There is no other movie that can compare. A perfect 10."
tripper0,"Sep 3, 2001",6/10,"Its really a crime that this is the one Hitchcock film that wins best picture.  It doesn't compare to 'Rear Window',  'Notorious' or 'North by Northwest'.  All of the performances were excellent.  Olivier was good, as this is the first movie I've seen with him.  Fontaine was enchanting as the new Mrs. de Winters.  Its been mentioned, but Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers does add a sense of dread and intrigue into the mix, and was memorable and excellent as well.The first hour of the movie I was quite interested.  I found myself becoming intrigued as to what happened to the original Mrs. de Winters, and really what the big secret was with Maxim de Winters.  I felt a sense of tension, and I was rather intrigued.  That, of course was the first half of the movie.Then comes the second half, when we are exposed to the big secret.  And let me tell you, I was not impressed.  The movie, in my humble opinion, quickly changes tone.  It loses its identity as a psychological thriller and becomes something less.  The romance between Fontaine and Olivier quickly becomes unbelievable, as we are supposed to believe that she would still love a man such as him.(you'll see what I mean when you watch it)  It loses the sense of tension and intrigue that fueled it beautifully for the first half, and comes to a screeching halt.  I lost interest at that point, and by the grand finale, which I was also ill impressed with, I just didn't care anymore.I should note that I personally don't like plot twists.  The most important aspect of any film, for myself, is the story.  When something happens that I don't like, it weakens everything else.  Its a shame here because the performances were top notch.  The romance was a bit stale, nothing compared to the beauty that was 'Notorious'.  This is probably the worst I've seen of Hitchcock, but luckily he gets much better than this.  He is still the master, but even the master can have a bad movie here and there.  I mean, Spielberg did make 'Hook'.  All that said, 6 out of 10."
zetes,"Jun 1, 2000",10/10,"I was quite interested in the film while I was watching it, but when it ended, I didn't feel impacted. Very soon afterwards, however, my mind began to feel very heavy. The first words of the film came floating back to me: ""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again."" I ruminated over the events of the film, and I began to tear up a bit. It creates one of the most unsettling atmospheres ever to exist in a film. I still feel enshrouded in the mist and smoke that curled around Manderly. I can tell that this is going to be one of those films that, when I recall it to memory, I will fall back into its mood. I can't say this for too many films.One of the reasons that I connected with it so tightly was the main character, the narrator, the new Mrs. de Winter. Joan Fontaine was perfect in this film. Out of the ones with whom I am familiar, I don't think that there is another Hitchcock heroine who was as well developed. Kim Novak's character Judy from Vertigo was close, and so was Janet Leigh's character Marion Crane from Psycho. Those two heroines provoked great pity in my soul. But the heroine of Rebecca beats them all.I was completely involved with her. She begins as little more than a slave to a domineering woman, Edythe van Hopper (their relationship was a little confusing to me; a hired friend? This made me suspicious. I think that there was a lot of suggestive lesbianism in this film, perhaps between van Hopper and the heroine, but definitely between Rebecca and Ms. Danvers. Watch as she delicately shows the second Mrs. de Winters Rebecca's underwear. Also notice that Rebecca used Ms. Danvers' name at the doctor's office, having gone there to find out whether or not she was pregnant). The heroine only escapes from one owner to go to her next owner, Maxim de Winters. He treats her even more cruelly than Edythe van Hopper did, calling her a ""little fool"" and an ""idiot."" When he called her those names and reprimanded her, I trembled. As the movie went on, I think my mind actually became fused with the heroine's. I started to cry when she did after Ms. Danvers tortured her psychologically. When Ms. Danvers tried to convince her to jump out of the window, I felt as if I was about to fall to my death.I became rather disappointed when the focus moves from the heroine to Maxim. His predicament became more interesting near the end, but my sympathies, my whole attention were squarely focused on Fontaine's character. Thus arose my initial impression of the film. This small disruption can be forgiven, because the film as a whole just remains in my mind as a sad, beautiful masterpiece.Rebecca is one of Hitchcock's best films. Definitely a 10/10."
Atreyu_II,"Dec 3, 2011",6/10,"This film is worth watching for being one of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's early movies. In that particular category, it is one of the best efforts, but if we talk about his movies in general, this isn't in the same league.The best about this film is the fine visuals and especially the Manderley mansion and respective scenario. It actually starts pretty good but as it runs it becomes a merely average story (although there are good moments here and there) and therefore a little boring. Plus, it is also a tad long.Having that said, practically the whole film is accompanied by lovely background music. Laurence Olivier has a great acting as the short-tempered Maxim de Winter. A very pretty Joan Fontaine acts very well as Maxim's second wife whose name is not once mentioned or revealed. Judith Anderson's acting as the malicious and jealous Mrs. Danvers is very believable. There is one particular scene which is haunting because Mrs. Danvers is taking Maxim's wife to the window as she speaks and both her words and attitude are suspect - they almost suggest that she's advising her to kill herself. George Sanders as Jack is great too.The title character is dead and her presence is only as a haunting memory. But as nearly the whole movie talks about her, she is a permanent presence, as a memory and psychologically.The ending is the worst part. It wasn't an especially good ending. A shame, this movie starts so promising that it seemed that it was gonna be pretty good."
ElMaruecan82,"Mar 2, 2017",8/10,"""Last night, I dream I went to Manderley again.""This is the narration, murmured by Joan Fontaine's soft voice and inviting us for a posthumous tour over the English countryside, to the local manor that turned into a ghostly no man's house, surrounded by dark and brooding trees enveloping the place with an aura of sacred danger like some monster's claws over a precious catch. What is with that Manderley that inspired that dream anyway?The answer is of course in the title, it's all about ""Rebecca"". In fact, there's not a single element that belongs to the film or to the original novel written by Daphne du Maurier and that can be defined with the economy of that name-calling. Manderley was the place Rebecca lived. Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) is Rebecca's widower. Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) is her former governess. And Joan Fontaine suffers from the most ungrateful status as she's not even given a first name, she's only known as the ""second Mrs. De Winter"" she's not even Rebecca's rival because it's a lost fight, mentioning her in the same breath than Rebecca is like pronouncing the name of God in vain.So, the whole movie is overshadowed by Rebecca's aura, it's like the black-and-white photography, drawn through powerful contrasts, was just some decoy containing the shadowy presence of Rebecca, likely to commit an intrusion at any time, by means of a memory, an evocation, a revelation or a confession. There's a moment where Fontaine asks Maxim's best friend (Reginald Denny) about Rebecca, all he can say is that she was the most beautiful creature he ever saw. It takes some superhuman talent to convince us that Fontaine's not as beautiful as Rebecca, however she looked. As the shy, hapless and desperate-to-please Mrs. De Winters, Fontaine is vital to the credibility of the story because through her behavior, she's the plain that gives prominence to the mountain.And 'plain' is the word, it is the mark of a very subtle talent to take distance from the usual strong-minded, glamorous and independent heroines played by the likes of Bette Davis and Katherine Hepburn and create such a fragile, delicate and mild-mannered woman, begging for friendship rather than love, in awe of her husband and in total fear from Mrs. Danvers, the ominous governess who never misses an opportunity to remind what kind of a woman Rebecca was. It's a real psychological torture-game operating on Mrs. De Winter's head and frail shoulders and she hardly finds comfort in Maxim who seems to be constantly preoccupied and absent. Olivier seems rather uncomfortable in the role, but while the story unfolds, we slowly understand the reason of his emotional nonchalance and the no-less odd attraction to his new wife. Of course, even the answers belong to Rebecca.Daphne du Maurier was a woman who enjoyed isolation, not just for work but also as a way to contemplate her freedom and question her identity. This distance from the world predisposed her for fascination, for the ability, as a 'first person' to be haunted by someone, and it often happened to be a woman, or her memory, sometimes even a vague idea was enough. Through her fertile imagination and ambiguous sexuality, she managed to translate this power into a splendid Gothic-tale whose risqué subjects forced Hitchcock to make a few changes. But he faithfully, albeit at times not too subtly, respected the original material and his camera-work conveyed the ghostly presence of Rebecca. Even Danvers who seemed to have had a privileged relationship (of platonic nature in the film) seems to glide over the place, as if she was possessed by the soul of her deceased mistress.Hitchcock was a craftsman and his camera loved the faces of Anderson and Fontaine, the cinematography also accentuates the feeling of an impending danger, and the acting was enriched by the presence of a youngish George Sanders and Leo G. Carroll who would also reveal one thing or two about good old Rebecca. It was Hitchcock's first Hollywood movie and needless to say the trial was conclusive. The film won the Oscar for Best Picture, over classics like ""The Grapes of Wrath"" and ""The Great Dictator"", without winning any of the major awards in the directing, acting and writing department, but I guess that's what can be said about ""Rebecca"", it is a great picture with the looks, the mystery, the acting and everything one could ask for.I only wish it didn't overplay the melodramatic violins and a succession of twists and revelation at the end satisfy the mind, but don't fool us either as Olivier didn't play the kind of roles that deserved a happy ending by Hitch' standards. The film redeems itself with some last-minute thrills but Hitchcock would make subtler films. Still, ""Rebecca"" holds up well today because there's that uniqueness in the heroine and this extraordinary presence, the fascination over the fact that the most fascinating character is actually absent. The American Film Institute recognized Mrs. Danvers as the thirty-first villain of all time, but I wonder if Rebecca on her own way was the real antagonist and would have deserved that title a little more. Indeed, we never see her, but we can feel her actions, just like the Man in ""Bambi"" who also nominated in the same list, an invisible but an undeniably evil presence.Now, does Rebecca win or lose as an antagonist? Well, from the opening line, the one about that dream, one can guess that you can never totally get rid of Rebecca, and maybe for that reason, despite the film's flaws and that it's never mentioned at along with ""Vertigo"", ""Psycho"", ""North by Northwest"" or ""Rear Window"" as Hitch' best, we can never totally ignore ""Rebecca""."
evanston_dad,"Oct 13, 2008",7/10,"I was expecting big things from ""Rebecca,"" Alfred Hitchcock's Best Picture Academy Award winner from 1940, and I was disappointed. Give me ""Foreign Correspondent,"" Hitchcock's other 1940 release and fellow Best Picture nominee, any day.""Rebecca"" starts out promisingly enough, as a Gothic ghost story about a naive young woman (Joan Fontaine) recently married to a wealthy aristocrat (Laurence Olivier) who finds herself competing with his dead wife, a woman whom Fontaine mentally builds into an image of female perfection until the memory of her almost becomes a physical presence in the house. But the mystery departs the film around the three-quarters mark, and the enigmatic spell of the movie goes with it. Fontaine and Olivier are two limp noodles at the film's center, and it falls to Judith Anderson, playing the mysterious and creepy housekeeper who fostered an irrational love of her former mistress, to keep things alive.The production design and black and white cinematography look stylish, but the film doesn't give Hitchcock the opportunity to impose any of his playful directorial signatures on it. As a result, it's a bit of a bore.Grade: B"
sundancewanderingwolf,"May 5, 2014",3/10,"I'm not much of a book reader but I LOVED the book and was very excited in school to watch this movie... then right from the beginning I was severely disappointed. The characters didn't reflect the writers picture of what they should have looked like and the acting was way over dramatized. It seems in many cases Hollywood ruins movies for the readers of the original books points of view. Was the acting good in this movie? Yes Was the directing good? Sort of... Was the casting correct and true to the story? NO I never understood why this movie was so popular... probably because most of it's viewers hadn't ever read the book before and since Hollywood loves to change things to make them ""better"" people didn't notice. If you want to see an amazingly accurate version of this wonderful book, watch the version from 1997 by Masterpiece Theatre staring Charles Dance as Maxim and Emilia Fox as Mrs. de Winter. The casting was PERFECT as was the acting. All the characters fit especially Mrs. de Winter who is supposed to be a little quiet mousy thing of a girl, very naive, who isn't all about glamor like the Mrs. de Winter depicted in the original film, who looked more like Rebecca than the character she was cast to play."
bd74,"Sep 20, 1999",N/A,"Out of all of the movies of Hollywood's Golden Age, ""Rebecca"" is certainly one of the best. It's an excellent mystery movie! Everything about this movie shines, beginning with the story itself. I really liked the story, in which the title character is a dead woman whose ""presence"" still lingers in many ways. The plot takes quite an unexpected turn near the end of the movie, when a shocking revelation is made. This revelation has a significant effect on the main characters. Speaking of characters, the performances of all the actors are outstanding. I loved Joan Fontaine's performance in this movie. It is one of the greatest female performances. What I liked about her performance most is that she plays a very shy woman. That's not something you see very often in movies. Fontaine plays her character with a lot of realism. She gets married to a wealthy widower, without having any knowledge of the lifestyle that awaits her. You can't help but be moved by her character's innocence and her desire to do the ""right"" thing, despite her timidness. You can understand the reasons for her character's confusion in being ""the second wife"", and her feelings of isolation when she is inevitably compared to the late Rebecca. Another really good performance is that of Judith Anderson as the sinister housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. I especially liked the bedroom window scene where Anderson is telling the depressed Fontaine what she ought to do with her life. I love the expression on Fontaine's face in that scene. Also, Laurence Olivier gives a great performance as the husband, who has ambivalent feelings toward Fontaine. Furthermore, the sets were amazing. As a mystery movie and as a movie in general, ""Rebecca"" is excellent in every way. **** out of ****."
kirubanithi005,"Oct 9, 2015",9/10,"This review doesn't have the story line or any spoilers. 'Rebecca' is a recommended classic for all ardent fans of Hitchcock movies. Not only the suspense gives us chills, the film has soothing love sequences between Laurence Oliver and Joan Fontaine. Joan as Mrs. de Winter steals the show with her innocent love over her husband. Judith Anderson's portrayal as Mrs. Denvers is one which should be noted. She simply stuns the audience with her dark brooding body language and the tone she speaks. The sequence involving her and Joan in the old Mrs.de Winters room speaks the work of Hitchcock. Great direction, beautiful sets of Manderley with lovely performances adds feather to the classic mystery. Overall it is a must watch where Entertainment joins hand with Classic touch ..!!"
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"May 25, 2011",9/10,"Both a Golden Age Gothic romance and a true Hitchcock thriller, ""Rebecca"" somehow merges its director's style with its producer's sensibility. Much has been made about the butting of heads between Alfred Hitchcock and famed Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, but ""Rebecca"" ends up feeling like a Hitchcock picture with the sweeping feel of a Hollywood film.Despite being Hitchcock's first experience working with Hollywood and Selznick's reputation for controlling his projects and making literal book adaptations (this being of Daphne Du Maurier's novel), the best parts of the film have Hitchcock's thumbprint on them. He infuses the story with total suspense and discomfort, refusing to let it bore for long in spite of its length.The story follows a Gothic romance storytelling model akin to the Bronte sisters, which explains why star Joan Fontaine won the lead in ""Jane Eyre"" opposite Orson Welles just a few years later. Hitchcock channels nearly everything through Fontaine's performance as the aptly unnamed main character, a personal assistant who on a whim during her stay in Monte Carlo meets and marries a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). Fontaine exudes a lovable naivete, one that starts out earning sympathy but twists into an attribute that antagonizes the audience as the film goes on as the presence of the late great first Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca grows more powerful.The role of Rebecca easily ranks as the most powerful character in cinema to never appear on screen. Hitchcock sees to it that her presence not only fills the mansion that already overwhelms the new Mrs. De Winter, but also consumes the film itself. She's felt both on camera and in the audiences mind, enough so that when Hitchcock pretends that she's really there by ""following her"" with the camera in a key scene late in the film where Maxim recalls the night she died, you honestly believe it and picture her as some terrifying figure.But there's no depreciating the characters on screen. Fontaine as she writhes about in mentally anguish does manifest everything a bit too physically, but the reaction she creates in the audience is a palpable paranoia and fear. Olivier portrays a man quick to anger but clearly for deep-seated reasons that come from a dark place.Then there's Mrs. Danvers, the woman who runs the house. The moment Judith Anderson walks on screen she enters your mind. A good comparison would be Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch in ""The Wizard of Oz."" It helps that Mrs. Danvers also serves as an antagonist, but in an entirely different way. We connect with our unnamed heroine's fear of Mrs. Danvers, but not simply because she plays the creepy housekeeper, but as we come to know her and understand her connection to the late Rebecca, she becomes this psychologically complex individual. Although Hitchcock's directorial voice runs through Fontaine, Anderson adds punctuation to his efforts, especially as she steals the final moments of the film.Although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences would have you believe ""Rebecca"" to be Hitchcock's finest effort, it merely showcases his ability as an artist to overcome what was a producer-driven Hollywood at the time. Despite David O. Selznick's name appearing before the title card, Selznick will always be better remembered for ""Gone with the Wind.' ""Rebecca"" — that was Hitchcock's work.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
sumana-m21,"Jan 8, 2012",8/10,"You never see Rebecca throughout the movie, yet she captivates you as the audience for the most part. Her beauty, wits and most importantly how she had managed to admire so many people all at once while maintaining her solemnity with everyone except her husband. Without going into too much depth, this movie will captivate you, confuse you and still manage to not deprive you of the very curiosity you will crave for. But a vintage masterpiece you shouldn't pass by. There are some scenes however which I felt could have been dealt with in greater detail, but considering this is an old classic, one must realize there are some things better not to expect. Enjoy it as is. 8/10"
lewiskendell,"Aug 15, 2010",8/10,"""I've loved you, my darling. I shall always love you, but I've known all along that Rebecca would win in the end.""Rebecca begins very simply, with only the slightest hints of the twists and turns to come. After a whirlwind romance in the South of France, a young woman (Joan Fontaine in a nameless role) is swept off to Manderly, the lavish ancestral home of her new husband, Maxim (Laurence Olivier). It doesn't take her long after arriving there to find out that the shadow of Rebecca, Maxim's deceased first wife, continues to hang over Manderly. The stress of constantly being compared to the memory of the seemingly perfect Rebecca begins to outright suffocate the young wife, and her husband's frequent outbursts of temper and preoccupation combined with the unfavorable opinions of some of the household staff becomes more and more overwhelming. All is not as it seems in Manderly, however, and hidden secrets are eventually brought to light, with life-changing consequences.I thought Rebecca was a great movie. It initially seemed to be a light romance, before seamlessly bringing in elements of mystery and even courtroom drama. It's actually a relatively dark story, full of sordid dealings and shady characters.  Quite a surprise or two is sprung on the audience before Rebecca is done, and while this doesn't seem much like a Hitchcock movie in the beginning, by the end, there is little doubt that his fingerprints are all over this. I highly recommend it."

ashtonnepackaging,"Jun 7, 2021",9/10,This is by far one of my favorite stories! It's shocking twists and turns will keep you on high alert.
sddavis63,"Sep 12, 2011",7/10,"The secret to truly appreciating this movie is to get through the first hour or so of it. To be frank, that first hour is less than riveting. We find ourselves following the romance and the early part of the marriage of the wealthy and lonely widower Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) to his new young bride (Joan Fontaine.) There really isn't much meat to this part of the story. It's a bit of a rich meets poor love story, as the young bride finds herself in a romance with this man who was quite above her socially, and it's even got a bit of humour to it, as we watch the young woman's employer Mrs. Van Hopper (Florence Bates) try to ingratiate herself with Maxim. It's a pleasant enough (although not exactly engrossing) love story for a while, and after their return to Maxim's Manderlay estate it still seems to be little more than the challenge of the new Mrs. de Winter (whom I don't remember being named) to overcome the reluctance of the servants - and especially Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) - to accept her, since they appear to have been fiercely devoted to the late Mrs. de Winter (whose name was Rebecca.) Yes, Mrs. Danvers is an unusual, and therefore suspicious, character who has more than a bit of mystery about her, but still this really doesn't seem to be going anywhere very fast.Once we're through that first hour, though, plot twists start to emerge. Maxim starts to pull away from his bride - is he also having trouble accepting her as the new Mrs. de Winter at the estate? Are the differences in the marriage just too much to overcome? Then Rebecca's body is unexpectedly found and questions begin to emerge about how she died. At this point, director Alfred Hitchcock manages to turn what had been a rather empty story into a pretty good suspense/thriller. In that last hour, Hitchcock builds the story brilliantly, so that it gets progressively more suspenseful, and by the time the shocking final scene comes along, as a viewer you're absolutely hooked.It's hard for a movie to overcome such a long stretch at the beginning where little of great note actually happens, but ""Rebecca"" manages to do just that. It's also interesting as an example of a fairly early piece of work by Olivier. (7/10)"
theconservativeliberal,"Jun 27, 2008",2/10,"These lines of dialogue are a good summary of why Rebecca sucks.I'm not beautiful, or intelligent. - But you have other, better qualities. Like kindness and sincerity. - So let me ask you, what was Rebecca like? What did people see in her? - Why, she was the most beautiful creature I've ever seen.Either this is the worst writing ever, the worst character development ever, or a really pathetic attempt to be mysterious and complex, making it again the worst writing ever. Hitchcock is so blindly driven by his technicality that he actually forgets to read the screenplays he's turning into films. And if that's not the case, if he wasn't hearing impaired on set, he has the intelligence of an infant and the creative energy of a euthanised walrus.On top of this hysterical delinquency, I can't believe women's rights groups haven't tried to bury Hitchcock under the insurmountable pile of celluloid he cost the world. Every female character in his films is either retardedly stupid, socially inept, cruel and backstabbing or insane. I can almost see sometimes the bruises on these actresses faces from the beatings he must give them in their trailers each night."
Lechuguilla,"Feb 14, 2010",8/10,"Poor girl. No matter how hard she tries, the second Mrs. de Winter (Joan Fontaine) just can't quite measure up to the memory of Rebecca, the first Mrs. de Winter, a ghost that hovers over Manderley, British estate of the wealthy Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Manderley is an enormous castle-like house, first seen in black silhouette in the opening sequence. It lies in ruins. Yet, there are memories contained therein, and the film's plot structure consists of one long flashback, as told by Joan Fontaine's character. ""Rebecca"" is a Gothic love story, and Manderley is where most of the story is set.This is a ""dark house"" melodrama. And it's a good one. Manderley's interiors are imposing and intimidating, like the house manager, the severe Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), whose job it is to please Mrs. de Winter. Yet fearsome Mrs Danvers lords over the place, causing considerable inferiority and grief for Fontaine's character.The underlying theme I suppose is the introduction of disorder into an otherwise orderly, predictable aristocratic circle. There's an ever-so-slight hint of subversion in the story, injected by the main character, lovely but naive, clumsy, lacking in social skills, someone who doesn't fit in among the usual Manderley crowd.The plot's middle Act, set at Manderley, is by far the best. The first Act takes place at Monte Carlo. And in the third Act, the plot turns perfunctory and shifts away from Manderley. We thus lose the ""dark house"" atmosphere. The film's dialogue strays into exposition in the second half.B&W cinematography is competent. We get multiple light sources in interiors, and lots of shadows. Rooms are big, and the staging creates a credible sense of wealth and aristocratic power.The film's overall acting is very, very good. I don't see how Joan Fontaine, or anyone else, could have done better in her role. Olivier and Anderson also give wonderful performances.Both entertaining and thematic, ""Rebecca"" is a high quality film that focuses on a young woman put in an awkward situation. The story is haunting and eerie. Despite its age, it still speaks to a modern audience, as most of us feel uncomfortable if we're placed among people, or in situations, that seem intimidating or threatening."
wes-connors,"May 3, 2008",10/10,"What else can you say about Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca""? It's still a startling production. Most obviously, it's one of the most perfect ""Gothic"" dramas produced; making a very steady transformation from Daphne du Maurier novel to film, it gives the genre refreshing celluloid life. Mr. Hitchcock directs star Joan Fontaine (as Mrs. De Winter) to the top of her profession; her guilty, frightened performance is a model for the reluctant Gothic heroine. Mysterious Laurence Olivier (as Maxim De Winter) and the supporting cast are perfect; with sinister Judith Anderson (as Mrs. Danvers) raising her character to striking icon status. Ms. Anderson's excessive fondness for ""Rebecca"", and the understated perverseness of sexuality between Mr. Olivier and both Mrs. De Winters, gives the film a edginess not permitted at the time. And, it was all enhanced by Hitchcock's expressive direction of George Barnes' camera.Haunting.********** Rebecca (3/27/40) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Joan Fontaine, Laurence Olivier, Judith Anderson, George Sanders"
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Sep 20, 2004",10/10,"This is Hitchcock at his best; just when you think that you've figured everything out, you are treated to a twist that completely turns your perception of the film around. This isn't the twists of modern movies, where you're immediately awe-struck by the sheer unlikeliness of them, but rather twists that send a chill down your spine and turn the movie in a direction you wouldn't have imagined possible. There is almost more suspense and tension in the entire last *half hour* than there is in the collective amount of supposedly suspenseful films of newer time. This is thriller, as it's supposed to be. Don't give us the husband-suddenly-turned-psychotic out to kill his wife, keep the face-less killer devoid of any real motive away, and please spare us the old cliché of the psychopath who rarely ever has a reason for his/her behavior. This is what a thriller is supposed to be like. Constantly hinting at something, hidden in the past, keep us guessing what it is, and just when we think we've figured everything out, pull the carpet out from under our feet. The one complaint I could come up with for this film is that the first half doesn't accomplish much, apart from build-up and character development, but, the more I think about it, the more I realize that that's what makes the impact of the second half; we *think* we know these people, these secretive and hidden people, we think we've figured out what they're hiding, why they are so secretive, and then we hear how different the truth is from what we had expected, and it is devastating, in a good way. To use a metaphor: Just the moment you're sure you've put together the puzzle, someone points out that you've missed a fourth of it, or, rather, points out that the picture is, while it seems logical at its current state, far from the real picture. The plot is excellent, and the way it slowly unravels is perfect. It keeps you guessing and watching, patiently and attentive, and once you're treated to the mind-blowing final half hour, full of twists, tension and suspense, you will not feel that you have wasted the time up to that point; quite the opposite, actually. The film has a very good pace, and is thoroughly interesting. The acting is great; Laurence Olivier as the mystical yet charming Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the nameless heroine who is humble and submissive, George Sanders as the sleazy, creepy Jack Favell and Judith Anderson as the cold character of Mrs. Danver, who is seemingly devoid of emotion. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography is defining of Hitchcock, with plenty of play on shadows and long, lingering pans that only increase the chill down your spine. The dialog is well-written and surprisingly sharp. The whole thing is just amazing as a film. Defining of Hitchcock and worth watching for any competent film viewer. One final note; the last few scenes involve so many twists, so much suspense and tension, that it puts just about every single other non-Hitchcock thriller to shame. I recommend it to any major fan of film in general, as most should find something enjoyable about it, any fan of Hitchcock, and big fans of the following genres: thriller, mystery, drama and romance. This certainly deserves its place on the Top 250(as I'm writing this, it's #105), and should be viewed by any major fan of films in general. 10/10"
HarlequeenStudio,"Jun 19, 2017",10/10,"I was so scared when I watched this film as a kid. Mrs. Danvers is scarier than any vampire, she appears and disappears almost like a ghost, so ominous it's clear something must be terribly wrong with this household. One almost expects her to announce, ""This is Hell and I am the Devil."" For the young woman that moves into this house (Joan Fontaine), she sure is. A new wife of the owner, Max de Winter, she feels small and insignificant, constantly unfavorably compared to Rebecca, the deceased first wife, by Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper. We see her roaming about the gigantic house, lost and confused. She doesn't even have a name and Rebecca does, still the lady of the manor, as ever. We never see a picture of Rebecca though, and our mind, just like the young Mrs. de Winter's, can't stop trying to imagine the greatest beauty to ever grace the earth. She was prettier than Joan Fontaine! Her husband Max, played by Laurence Olivier, doesn't help her much with his constant put-downs. Olivier was perhaps a better film actor than he had thought of himself. The film shifts from romcom, to psychological, to very real horror. Cynics would say, the natural stages of any marriage. But in the masterful hands of Alfred Hitchcock, it's art. The Selznick production - impeccable, as always. Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers will forever give me nightmares. Oh, the glory days when women were villains!"

The movie, Rebecca, is about a young woman living in Monte Carlo with her mean employer. She met a very wealthy man by the name of Maxim de Winter. The two fall in love and move back to Maxim de Winter's large estate but it doesn't take long for his new wife to notice that the death of his first wife, Rebecca, still has an effect on everyone in the house. They all still miss her and it is obvious that they wanted the new wife to kind of take the place of Rebecca in a way that she just couldn't do. Rebecca had a huge effect on the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. She even set the house on fire at the end of the movie and ended up dying in the house. The movie had a very surprising ending which I liked. Hitchcock is a great director and you can see that through the movies lighting, camera-work, sounds, and editing."

AaronCapenBanner,"Oct 12, 2013",7/10,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this Gothic romance that stars Sir Laurence Olivier as Maxim De Winter, a recently widowed(and quite wealthy) man vacationing in Monte Carlo who meets the paid companion(played by Joan Fontaine) of a older woman. They unexpectedly fall in love and get married. They then return to his home in Cornwall, a country estate called Manderly ruled over by the imposing housekeeper Mrs. Danvers(played by Judith Anderson) who holds sacred the memory of the first Mrs. De Winter Rebecca, who died mysteriously in a boating accident. As events unfold, the new Mrs. De Winter will discover things about Maxim's past that will come to haunt her... Impressively directed and acted film is still melodramatic stuff given a high gloss, but remains entertaining and atmospheric, though hardly deserved to beat ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" for best picture of 1940!"
bobsgrock,"May 5, 2009",9/10,"There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was successful during his tenure as a British film maker who thrived on low-budget suspense pictures and was churning them out nearly every year. However, it was inevitable that he would find his way to Hollywood, and along with famous producer David O. Selznick, he adapted Daphne du Maurier's classic book into a thrilling and tense story about obsession, death and the effects and memories we all take with us long after someone moves onto the next world.What makes this such an interesting picture is the fact that Hitchcock was able to adapt some new and ground-breaking ideas into the filming process which obviously improves the quality of the experience as well as usher in a whole new way to create movies. He storyboarded every scene, used deep-focus photography and edited the picture ""in camera,"" in other words only shooting what he wanted to see on the screen. This gave him a complete vision of what he wanted as well as kept the nosy Selznick's hands away from his product. What it leaves us today is spellbound, suspended and amazed at what he was able to do with a camera; in some ways 40 years ahead of its time. Though he would not receive as much credit as Orson Welles one year later with Citizen Kane, he nevertheless left behind a stirring story filled with complex and emotional people who bring us along on this strange and mysterious journey.The movie never would have been as great without an all-star cast, which Hitchcock had with Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine as the two lovers separated by the dead Rebecca's presence as well as supporting characters Judith Anderson as the obsessed housekeeper Mrs. Danvers and the slick and sneaky George Sanders. The narrative feels to bend a little in the final third as we are brought along to figure this dilemma out in a routine police investigation. Nevertheless, filled with dazzling images of Manderley, a completely convincing performance by the beautiful Fontaine and Hitchcock's ability to have Rebecca cast a shadow over the characters despite being dead, this is a classic not to be missed and one that needs multiple views before the mystery is cleared up. Even then, perhaps all will not be revealed."
Steffi_P,"Nov 23, 2006",8/10,"Hitchcock's first US production is distinct from anything he did before or after, most significantly in that it was an adaptation of classic novel. With the exception of The 39 Steps, before and after Rebecca Hitchcock would normally work with original material or loose adaptations of lesser-known novels. After leaving the relative freedom of the British studios, it was also his first time to work with perfectionist producer David O. Selznick, who often exerted as much control over the way a picture turned as the director.The fact of Rebecca being such a highly regarded and well-known novel was clearly something of a straitjacket for such an independent and formulaic director as Hitchcock. There could be no major changes to the plot, little room for Hitchcock to squeeze in his trademark suspense and black humour. Hitch instead sticks to his other forte, using the arrangement of shots to convey mental states, true feelings and relationships between characters  and at that he is at his best here. In an early scene where Maxim de Winter sits down for coffee with Miss Van Hopper and Joan Fontaine's character, he focuses on Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine's reactions, even though the clucking Miss Van Hopper is doing most of the talking. In a later scene at Manderlay we see Joan Fontaine sitting alone at a huge dining table, with the camera slowly pulling out to show her sense of isolation.Hitchcock also goes a long way in creating atmosphere with large wide open spaces, curtains blowing in the breeze and the way he moves actors in and out of the frame. Mrs Danvers' first entrance, walking arrogantly straight into the middle of the shot is particularly memorable. A brilliant example of how Hitch uses a few simple techniques to achieve a change in mood is when Maxim and Joan Fontaine are viewing a reel of home movies from their honeymoon. Halfway through they are interrupted by the butler with the news that an ornament belonging to Rebecca has gone missing, and Joan Fontaine owns up to breaking it, leading to an argument. Before the interruption the camera focuses on the projection screen, and we see footage of the newlyweds happy together. Afterwards however the camera ignores the screen and focuses on Olivier and Fontaine, their faces half-lit, emphasising the tense, awkward atmosphere.Another problem with faithfulness to the source novel means that the dialogue is often overly literary. Joan Fontaine's opening narration sounds particularly lofty. Luckily the two lead acting performances are good enough to carry it. Laurence Olivier is great as usual. I didn't like Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs de Winter on first viewing, but then I realised what was actually annoying me was the way the camera draws in on her and the music swells up for all her emotional moments, which is more the fault of Hitchcock and producer David O. Selznick. Overlooking this, her Best Actress Oscar was well deserved.Rebecca is an engrossing film, and one that stands up well to repeated viewings. It has to be said this is mostly down to Daphne du Maurier's gripping, twisting story. But credit has to go to Hitch for using the freedoms of cinematic technique to convey it. Aside from the minor flaws already mentioned, I can't really think of a better way it could have been done. Whatever the case, it has to rank among Hitchcock's finest films."
rohitbajaj,"Feb 14, 2004",10/10,"This is one of the finest movie I've ever seen, the cast was excellent and the acting especially Joan fontaine was top-notch: she missed the Oscar though. I've seen around 14 movies of Hitch and this comes close second to Vertigo. The atmosphere, the sceneries were all brilliant, the mystery in the atmosphere was handled well. Great!"
Vincentiu,"Dec 31, 2011",N/A,"It is the great character. Its soul - magnificent Judith Anderson as madame Danvers. Its skin - Rebecca. Pray - beautiful couple. Result - a strange fairy tale, with crumbs of Gothic and mystery, seeds of dark drama and past as clay. An ashtray in which gentle paper ash is drawing from fire, tomb air and strong perfume of lily. Each time when I watch it, this film was different. The story - a lake with nuances of day. Joan Fontaine more fragile. Laurence Olivier - forgiven murderer. So, all new viewing was the first. In that conditions, Rebecca remain more a chain of experiences. Memories and pieces of persons presence. Sad, beautiful and behind words. A film. Like a gray autumn afternoon."
Vartiainen,"Aug 27, 2017",6/10,"A young, sweet and naive girl from humble origins (Joan Fontaine) catches the eye of a wealthy aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). One whirlwind romance later they're married and moving back into his ancestral home called Manderley. But almost immediately she has to start dealing with begrudging staff and the proverbial ghost of the previous Mrs. de Winter.The film managed to surprise me pleasantly. Because let me tell you, the first third of this film is boring. It's so absolutely boring. A young woman moves into an old manor, terrible things start to happen, et cetera, et cetera. But, seeing that this was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, it really shouldn't have surprised me that it didn't remain that boring. The movie changed directions abruptly, and then again. When it got to the final few minutes, I'd call it outright brilliant.Hitchcock also manages to inflict the film with a lot of flair. It was his debut in the United States and was met with almost universal approval, including Hitchcock's first and only Academy Award for Best Picture. And I'd say it's earned. It's an old movie, but filled with a lot of neat tricks and touches. Things you'd nod your head approvingly at even in modern films. The mood is built with almost surgical precision, the soundtrack supports this beautifully and the characters keep revealing new sides of themselves.Is it the best film Hitchcock ever made? No, it's not, but it's still a great watch for all fans of mystery and suspense. And quite a different love story as well, if you're looking for that as well."
zkonedog,"Mar 10, 2017",9/10,"Despite the fact that Alfred Hitchcock is widely renown as one of the great directors of his time, it is a bit strange how so many of his films (especially the later ones) have such lame plots. Hitch can make practically anything watchable, but Cold War stinkers like Topaz or Torn Curtain, for example, just weren't going to be classics with even the greatest at the helm. In the case of ""Rebecca"", however, the overall plot is equal to Hitch's masterful style, producing an epic film worthy of its Oscar statue.For a basic plot summary, ""Rebecca"" begins with the the meeting and courtship of Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) and the lady who will become his wife (Joan Fontaine). When the couple arrive at Maxim's elegant mansion, however, the new bride discovers just how deep the love of Maxim's first wife runs through the home, especially in maid Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson).The main plot element of this film reminds me very much of ""Vertigo"" in the sense that a supernatural presence is hinted at. Viewers never quite know what is going on (further hinted at by Hitch's adept film & music touch) until quite literally the final minutes of the movie. I won't give away any details here, but suffice it to say that the mysteries throw enough curve-balls to keep you on the edge of your seat in wonder.The acting is also top-notch. Olivier & Fontaine shine in their leading roles, but Anderson's Danvers pretty much steals the show in this one as one of the great creepy movie characters of all time. Comparable to Nurse Ratched in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"".Overall, ""Rebecca"" has got to be up near the top of all ""Best of Hitchcock"" lists, as it excels in pretty much every element of film-making. Whereas other Hitchcock films rely on Hitch's tricky camera work or silly humor to a large extent, ""Rebecca"" is just a fantastic story translated well onto the big screen. You can't really go wrong watching this effort."
theognis2,"Feb 15, 2024",7/10,"Powerhouse producer David O. Selznick imported director Alfred Hitchcock to make this suspense picture, ably adapted from a popular novel by Daphne du Maurier. The waffling between the mystery and the supernatural is well handled by the brilliant Robert Emmet Sherwood and Hitchcock's longtime assistant Joan Harrison. The casting and performances are excellent. DP George Barnes and Franz Waxman's violins are very helpful. Young, beautiful Joan Fontaine plays innocence very cleverly, doing credit to the woman-in-jeopardy genre, and Olivier validates his romantic hero status. But this is more a Selznick story than one of Hitchcock's classics. It is a pleasure to hear the crisp line readings of stage-trained actors, but the clear professionalism cannot lift the limitations of the story into the upper echelons of Hitchcock's work. It was perhaps an inspiration for another, much better haunting years later: ""Vertigo"" (1958)."
bigticket-36199,"Aug 28, 2025",9/10,"""Rebecca"" is a psychological-romantic drama wrapped in a veil of mystery, which in its final act takes on the contours of a crime thriller. The screenplay is based on Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel of the same name.The story opens on the French Riviera, where the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter stands on the edge of a cliff, seemingly contemplating suicide. Just as he leans forward, a young woman stops him with a desperate cry, saving him from the fall. Soon after, Maxim shows an interest in her, and we find her in a hotel where she serves as companion to a pompous older lady. Maxim takes every opportunity to invite the young woman on outings, and she becomes both enchanted and confused by his attentions. Shortly before her departure, he unexpectedly proposes marriage. Shocked but eager to escape her oppressive employer, and confessing her love for Maxim, she accepts. Only upon arriving at the grand estate of Manderley does she confront the lingering spirit of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca...Director Alfred Hitchcock preserves the gothic structure of the novel, shaping it within a distinctly British atmosphere while weaving a story of identity and obsession. Psychological tension permeates nearly every sequence: the unnamed second Mrs. De Winter battles her own insecurity and anxiety, intensified by the invisible and seemingly indomitable presence of her predecessor. Visually, the film offers striking gothic set design full of stark contrasts. Manderley is burdened by the weight of the past, its monumental architecture casting shadows that smother any warmth of the present. The heroine is an outsider in this world, where walls, beds, portraits, staircases, and floors endlessly whisper the same name. Even the sea itself is portrayed as unsettling and hostile.The dialogue amplifies the atmosphere of unease and melancholy, particularly through the young Mrs. De Winter. Later, Hitchcock shifts the rhythm, accelerating the narrative into a mystery-thriller laced with touches of dark humor. This blending of genres produces powerful effects, heightened further by Franz Waxman's evocative score.Thematically, the film explores obsession, the shadow of the past, and the fragile possibility of love within a marriage haunted by memory. It weaves motifs of crime without punishment, obsessive desire, subtle allusions to lesbian fixation, and themes of lies, deceit, and adultery. Hitchcock masterfully interlaces these strands into a tapestry of tension and unease.Laurence Olivier portrays Maxim de Winter as the embodiment of aristocratic elegance and detachment, while also revealing sudden shifts of mood and a deep, tortured inner life. He is a broken man, torn between love and guilt, particularly when confronted with the sea. Joan Fontaine, as the young Mrs. De Winter, gives a moving performance of fear, insecurity, nervousness, and shy devotion. Hitchcock reportedly heightened her sense of vulnerability during filming, and the result is strikingly authentic. The chemistry between Olivier and Fontaine feels genuine, though tinged with uncertainty.Judith Anderson delivers a haunting portrayal of the fanatical and hypnotic Mrs. Danvers. With minimal dialogue and a chilling gaze, she embodies obsession and manipulation, becoming one of the most memorable female antagonists in cinema history. George Sanders as Jack Favell injects charm and wit, while cloaking his character's cynicism and corruption. His performance adds a dynamic edge to the darker intrigues. Florence Bates as Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper provides comic unpleasantness, but also lays the groundwork for our empathy toward the heroine, sharpening the contrast once she enters Manderley's oppressive world.""Rebecca"" is a film where psychological mystery unfolds into a chilling yet captivating tale of aristocracy, intrigues, malice, and death. It is a work that stirs the emotions of its audience and firmly stands among my five favorite Hitchcock films."
wrightiswright,"Jul 29, 2015",7/10,"What's this? No corpse under the bed? No big, lavish set pieces? No screams in the dead of night? Is this REALLY a Hitch movie? I am confused... *Checks the back of the case*...Well, apparently it IS. Now there's a surprise... Considering it has so few of his trademark flourishes. However, as a major caveat, this really doesn't make much difference at all to the final product. It's a fine film in it's own right, and the fact that it's probably The Master's most frills-free work actually aids it in creating a level of human interest that might not otherwise be present.In a build-up not unlike novels such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, we are introduced to our heroine, a sweet young girl who tries to be nice to everyone. She meets a brooding, handsome older gentleman, and proceeds to fall in love with him. After marriage, they relocate to his estate, which is absolutely vast. Inside, she will unlocks secrets of the past... As well as tangle with a maid who resents her being there in the first place...We really feel for this young lady (No, I'm not forgetting her name... The film doesn't give her one) as she desperately tries to fit into this new, aristocratic world around her, but failing dismally (mostly due to the machinations of another. Hitch captures her feelings of isolation well, while her husband remains a distant figure, before giving us the BIG twist which sets up the major conflict towards the end.For all the masterpieces he made, I don't believe Rebecca is the first choice most people would go for as Hitch's only Best Picture win (Not even Best Director, he never even accomplished that honour) but it is clearly a highly atmospheric suspense / drama which shows he could do more than just have us on the edge of our seats. 7/10"
tedg,"Sep 2, 2005",N/A,"I stick by my other Hitchcock comments, comments that have produced lots of negative responses.Hitchcock was a terrific craftsman who after many, many tries made two really superb movies. Movies that can be life-altering and changed the face of cinema. This is not one of them.Those two cast a light of genius on his other work that is undeserved. This film is often cited as a great example of how coherently he was able to weave all his skills. I agree, but only two are remarkable: Fontaine's performance in the first half where she shrinks in her new situation.And the use of the house. But the story is so dull and plodding it cripples the pleasure of a craftsmanlike film.The house is similar to many in other films. But already with this movie, Hitchcock has a camera that is curious. Hard to recognize how unusual that is today because such a stance is so common now, but the idea of having a camera come from non-human perspectives but with human behavior was unique to him.And he uses the building well. We get a hint of this in the opening sequence. There is a collection of absolutely dreadful shots of fog, and an equally dreadful narration by Fontaine, but then we are taken through the gates up the drive. In an ordinary film of the era, the gates would open or the camera would go through the space between the two halves.But this camera goes through a ""solid"" part of upper right gate. That effect was costly and we get the message early that this is about space. The pounding on the fog metaphor is blunter report of the same message.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
bdcharger69,"Feb 18, 2011",10/10,"This movie is very close to the actual book, written by Daphne du Maurier. I read the book after I first saw the movie. The similarities are amazing. When I first saw this movie I fell in love with it. I never really liked black and white movies but this one caught my attention right off the bat. The love story is amazing. Alfred Hitchcock is an amazing man. I don't want to spoil the movie. It is a must see!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson are well paired. The ending of the movie is definitely a surprise! It was a pleasure to visually experience the early way movies where put together and the difference between the 1930 to the present."
fredschroeder-63011,"Dec 7, 2016",9/10,"I loved this movie. An early Hitchcock film, it resembles the certain suspense accompanying his direction. The eeriness of the old ms Dewinter, Rebecca, room allowed for the plot to build, a certain tenseness overtime those double doors popped up. the lighting was dark, a lot of the time it kept a majority of the shot in deep shadow. the deep shadow allowed for the idea of the unknown to build, similar to the threat of the old Rebecca. she was never explained, just mentioned and there are only reminders of her around the home. the eeriness builds with the coldness of the maid, the entire movie just build slowly upon itself. it is an excellent movie to preface the films Hitchcock was about to make, a wonderful predecessor."
dromasca,"Dec 4, 2008",8/10,"'Rebecca' is the first film that Hitchcock made in US and the only one that was crowned with a Best Picture Oscar, although it should be noted that the Oscar was not received by Hitchcock but by producer David O. Selznick, who had produced one year earlier 'Gone with the Wind'. It is somehow overrated in my opinion, as despite being a good movie it is not one of its best, and it's the less Hitchcock of all his films.The film starts as a romance, with young and innocent Joan Fontaine meeting widower Laurence Oliver on the Cote d'Azur to become in 20 screen minutes his second wife. It's 20 minutes of good romance, which let us feel that if he wanted Hitchcock could become a good romance movies director. Second part is the most Hitchcock one with the young wife becoming mistress of the castle which is still haunted and dominated by the shadow of the late Mrs. de Winter (we actually never learn her name - she has no name, Rebecca, the first wife has no face in the film, no portrait left). The psychological relation between the second Mrs. de Winter and the intendant of the house, faithful to the memory of her first mistress is the key conflict of the film, and here we get some of the fine balances of innocence and terror that we well know from other films of the master. The third part falls into quite routine police inquiry, and although the ending may hold some surprises it is this part that is really dusty and did not make it through the six decades since the film was made.There are some good or even bright parts in this film, the acting of Joan Fontaine and especially of Judith Anderson as one of the classical villains of all times is very good (less is Olivier's - this is not one of his great roles), and some camera work is really asuperb. Overall the film is unequal, and too many and too long boring parts make it one interesting but not one of the brightest pieces of work of Hitchcock."
gridoon,"Jul 28, 2002",8/10,"Methodical direction by Hitchcock; startling plot twists (at least for those of us who haven't read the novel); subtle chills; superb performances by Joan Fontaine (lovely), Judith Anderson (hostile even when she's being polite), George Sanders (suave and ruthless); it just gets a bit too talky in some places toward the end.      (***)"
JuguAbraham,"Apr 10, 2006",7/10,"Hitchcock's cinema has always been propped up by a good novel, play or script. His cinematic flourishes embellished these materials with a remarkable intuition of how viewers would react to his treatment of the written material.The real genius of the film ""Rebecca"" will remain with the author du Maurier. Hitchcock's treatment of the story was to change the end of the story to make the leading man appeal to the audiences. Daphne du Maurier's murderer is transformed by Hitchcock into a tragic hero. That's what American audiences wanted in the Forties and want even to this day. Hence the film gets the Best Picture Oscar and other Oscars. But even with the changed ending, the story is great. In the book, the lead characters go on to live their lives after Manderlay burned down in another far way place.This film has all the ingredients that go down well with most audiencestwo superb performances (Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter and Dame Judith Anderson as the housekeeper with lesbian attachments) and the realistic special effects that recreated Manderlay within the studio. If people were wide-eyed at the performance of Olivier in this film, I suggest they see a British film called ""A Term of Trial"" directed by Peter Glenville, which has a story with quaint similarities to Olivier's role in ""Rebecca"" to see the thespian at his best.What is Hitchcock's contribution beyond the fine performances of the ladies? He was able to capture the sinister quality of Manderlay (just as the house of the murderer in ""Psycho"") in the opening sequence through spoken words and visuals and the burning of Manderlay at the end by light on the faces of people viewing the spectacle. He was probably aware that the basic material of du Maurier was the flip side of ""Blackmail,"" one of his early films with a gender reversal. He was probably thinking of reworking elements of ""Rebecca"" in ""Suspicion"" a film he made 3 years later.""Rebecca"" might have won awards but in terms of cinema it pales in comparison with four Hitchcock films ""Notorious,"" ""Saboteur,"" ""Sabotage,"" and ""Blackmail."" Interestingly, this is a rare Hitchcock film that presents women who gain in strength other rare examples being ""Marnie"" and ""Spellbound."""
akhilgenx2005,"Feb 12, 2009",N/A,"Rebecca is a true classic movie..made in 1940.kind of mother of all thrillers..based on a classic novelI was astonished to see how they were able to make such technically good movies almost 70 years back. This is what I like most about movies..no matter you watch an old one or a new...the performance and the screenplay remain the backboneits not a science in true sense but a bouquet of many senses coming together..and Rebecca is a perfect exampleJoan Fontaine did a wonderful job ..her innocence was nicely built into her body language throughout the movie and it was just done to the level of perfection (without brushing the overdone level even momentarily). Olivier's dialog delivery was great and as fast as I have ever heard (in sports commentary) and it was all making sense too. The movie had romance, mystery, thriller..good cinematography.well thought dialogs.background musicand always on track and you could tell the director was very much in controlMrs. Danvers role is another major accomplishment in the movie because that character pretty much solely brings in the thriller elementI would probably rate it as Hitchcock's best, once again mainly because of the technical soundness, so long back"
Bored_Dragon,"Mar 5, 2017",9/10,"This classic Hitchcock's Gothic mystery irresistibly reminds of ""Gone With the Wind"" (same producer), and also of ""Jane Air"" (the screenplay is based on the novel of the same name by Daphne Maurie and it's written on the model of Charlotte Bronte). This is the first Hitchcock's American/Hollywood movie so it has typical British flavor, like all previous Hitchcock's mysteries. It is nominated for eleven Oscars and has won two, for the best movie and the best black and white cinematography. I wouldn't say it's one of the best movies of all time, but it surely is a masterpiece.9/10"
Horror-yo,"Aug 5, 2016",8/10,"A beautiful film very well directed, with very good acting, an excellent setting and decor, a very good screenplay, based on a very efficient story from the novel of the same name, 'Rebecca' is the real deal. This film is as much about story as atmosphere, and everything works in the way of the atmosphere transpiring evidently from this piece as one will surely keep at least some visual images and the overall feel from this film some time after viewing it. It's just about what one would expect of a Hitchock-directed picture rooted in a deep Gothic, dark romanticism. A few special mentions to Joan Fontaine who was arguably in her prime, absolutely gorgeous and attentive to play her role judiciously, as well as Olivier sometimes criticized who played his role of the constantly tormented, preoccupied but forgetting himself in the present moment male lead just right, and the actress portraying Mrs. Danvers who was simply exact with her performance.Excellent story. Excellent film. 8/8.5ish."

This is perhaps one of Hitchcock's if not Hitchcock's most glorious of film productions. It is loaded with all of the intriguing mysteries of life and love yet suspenseful and thrilling(no surprise coming from Hitchcock that is). There is a twist at every corner as we slowly discover who ""Rebecca"" truly is and the honest means of her death. watching this film is like following a deranged child through a maze.

lampic,"Jul 31, 2015",10/10,"From the very first, legendary opening lines to the very end this is one of the cornerstones of a cinema history, but where some other old movies are simply, well old, this is something gripping and involving, truly magical, Gothic and strangely faithful both to du Maurier and Hitchcock. Even if director himself was not completely happy with being under someone else control (David O. Selznick was simply not a man to ignore) it has his signature all over the screen, from complicated characters hiding secrets from each others to evil lurking in the shadows, morbid fascination with death, innocent heroine (it never occurred to me earlier that she is never called by her name) lost in the imposing majesty of Manderley to twists and turns of a fascinating story itself. And - the best of all - this is a movie with Mrs. Danvers (magnificent Judith Anderson). Now I can finally admit that I always found her the true owner of Manderley and if anybody asked me, I would drown both Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, in my version Mrs. Danvers would live on and on forever, bringing fresh flowers in Rebecca's bedroom and occasionally even try those silk stockings and underwear made by nuns from convent. (What kind of nuns knew how to sew sexy underwear?) Hitchckock would have been amused to find that audience of the future find the villainess the most appealing character in the movie. I got a lot of fun ideas involving Mrs.Denvers and me but will keep them for myself."
didi-5,"Apr 17, 2004",6/10,"This brooding, dark classic has all the hallmarks of Hitch at his best, with the shadows, the striking shots, and the fine performances from Laurence Olivier as Maxim, a very young Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs De Winter (admirable how the film still gets around the problem of her not having a first name), and best of all, Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers.  The fabric is broken somewhat by George Sanders appearing to do his usual bored aristocrat act, but that's a small quibble.  The reliable Gladys Cooper and C Aubrey Smith appear in tiny roles.The film is never boring, and even though it stretches and changes its source material in places, it does a good job of making a movie out of Daphne du Maurier's novel.  Any reader of 'Rebecca' will have their own ideas about the characters - I'm glad the temptation to actually show 'Rebecca' herself was resisted."
FilmCriticLalitRao,"Nov 26, 2009",10/10,"If there is anybody who has not seen any film by Alfred Hitchcock,it must be said that that person must start Alfred Hitchcock initiation course by attentively watching ""Rebecca"".It is one of those great black and white films which would surely please anybody who appreciates meaningful cinema as it is made in such a professional manner that one can enjoy many good cinematographic elements in a single film. However, Rebecca is not a regular,run of the mill Hitchcock film with a lot of suspense.This is because this master of suspense deliberately avoided suspense in order to remain faithful to the original book written by English writer Daphné du Maurier.In this manner a personal touch was added to a film which has been celebrated all over the world.A giant screen of an equally huge cinema hall would ideally be the best place to appreciate this film with one's family as one can appreciate superb black and white cinematography which brings out the best of a Gothic tale.It is true that Alfred Hitchcock made ""Rebecca"" in USA for an American producer but it is still very much a British film as most of the actors including Laurence Olivier portray genuine behavioral traits of an English society."
Groddeck,"Feb 26, 2017",2/10,"This is another example of Hitchcock's hatred for women. Great Movie...last century. Who likes to see a woman act and be treated like a stupid child nowadays?

PudgyPandaMan,"Jan 9, 2009",9/10,"This was Hitchcock's only movie to win Best Picture. That still shocks me as he had so many good films. While I'm not sure I would rate this his best picture, there is so much to love here if you are a fan of Classic Film.There is an unforgettable opening sequence with fog and trees and crashing waves. The cinematography here is some of the finest I have ever seen. It also won a much deserved Oscar for Cinematography. There is a stunning dream sequence that is also very well done. All the filming creates the perfect mood for a Gothic tale of romance and tragedy. One thing Hitch was the best at was creating mood and tension and this movie highlights his skill perfectly. He accomplishes this through fantastic cinematography and direction that capitalizes on the use of shadows and tense angles, as well as a great mood-setting musical score. The lighting effects are also used with great skill.Fontaine is perfect as the nervous, insecure new bride. Her acting doesn't have a single insincere note in the whole of it. I understand Hitchcock helped achieve this superb performance out of a relatively young and inexperienced performer by telling her Olivier despised her because his wife, Vivien Leigh, lost the role to her. Hitch also told her the rest of the cast hated her as well. Can you imagine how insecure this would make a young, inexperienced actress? Olivier is at the prime of his physical beauty here, and does a superb job of handling the various depths of his character as they are revealed. Mrs. Danvers is enough to send shivers down your spine - what a creepy woman.Parts of the movie do seem to drag a little slow. And it seems to run long as well. But stick with it, and your interest will come back around. There are unexpected twists near the end."
ericstevenson,"May 19, 2016",10/10,"I admit to being confused by the first twenty minutes or so of this film. This might be the last Alfred Hitchcock movie I ever saw as I've seen almost all his other well known films. It really is great to see this evolve into a movie truly worthy of his namesake! Almost all his films are horror or mystery or at least thriller. This is a film that definitely got better as it went along. It just got better and better atmosphere as it went on. You would think the main female character in this movie would be named Rebecca, right? Nope, that's actually her husband's deceased wife who never even appears.It's amazing to see how much is done in this movie. The husband shows off their home movies even though they just got married. It will make more sense as more is revealed about the story. I feel bad for not finding the Hitchcock cameo in this! It turns out you can barely see his face at all and I had to watch a supercut to make sure it was him. Yeah, I'm such a nerd and I have heard of people who watch his movies just to see his cameos. It's over two hours in, a record!The strange thing is that it begins with opening narration. It ends without any, so it's hard to tell if she's actually telling the story. It was certainly unpredictable, as expected from any of his movies. This may be one of his earliest films that's really consider one of the best of all time as it would be over ten years that ""Psycho"", ""The Birds"", ""Vertigo"", ""North By Northwest"", AND ""Rear Window"" would come out. It's always nice to see when an artist first becomes an expert! This is a must see for anyone. I personally don't find this as good as most of the movies that I just mentioned, but that's still a compliment for someone as good as him! Perfect ****."
edwagreen,"Feb 5, 2006",10/10,"Daphne Du Maurier's great book was turned into a phenomenal Oscar-winning film of 1940.By chance, a meek, timid girl, Joan Fontaine, meets the elegant Laurence Olivier, a moody individual, haunted by a deep secret. She is at a resort as a companion to the wealthy Florence Bates. Bates is quite effective as a domineering matron who loses Fontaine to the infatuated Olivier.The two marry and go back to the estate of Manderley. She meets the entire staff and is certainly unaccustomed to having things done for her. As head of the staff, Judith Anderson etched an unforgettable eerie character-Mrs. Danvers, who was totally devoted, to Olivier's first wife, Rebecca. The unusual technique of never showing who Rebecca is, is quite effective.We soon learn that Rebecca's death is suspicious. Naturally, we have George Sanders, a cousin to Rebecca, to stir up things as well as plot with Mrs. Danvers.When finally, it appears that Olivier had killed his wife, the truth emerges that even shocks the devoted Danvers. Not able to get her way, Danvers literally turns up the heat and burns down the place in an exciting ending.Though ""Rebecca"" was voted best picture of the year, nominees Olivier, Fontaine and Anderson (in a supporting role) came up short.A clever mystery with great performances.

elvircorhodzic,"May 22, 2016",10/10,"I can not help feeling that the hostility between the producer and director on the one hand and the main actors on the other hand resulted in such a unique and excellent film. REBECCA is a mystery drama with elements of Gothic style that captivates completely. The director deliberately provoked gloomy atmosphere on the set. Despite that the actors are perfectly done their job.The beginning of the film is reminiscent of a typical romance or ""Cinderella"" story in which a little bit of stink. After the wedding story becomes very anxious mystery with a strong dramaturgy and excellent acting. Set design is incredibly fit with the atmosphere. Emotion and cold alternating. Despite repeated plots this movie I would not describe as a thriller. Rebecca is a film about violence against relations and ties with the past. Voltage, typical in Hitchcock's creative work, there is more than just entering the Manderley, not wane even after the last scene.Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter is a common companion and plain, simple girl who becomes the mistress of a huge estate and wife of a man of high lineage. It becomes Mrs. De Winter, but how to do it, when the first Mrs. de Winter still there? Fontaine probably had no idea how her mood affect the perfection of character. In Hollywood she entered through the front door.Laurence Olivier as Maxim de Winter, owner of Manderley is habitually cold and sharp. In the second part of the film his emotions rise to the surface. Olivier is certainly one of the few actors who make a small play in conflict with his own emotions.Perhaps the animosity was as good a reason of attraction between Olivier and Fontaine on the screen.Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers, housekeeper of Manderley is the perfect villain for this opportunity. The terrifying stillness, cold look, lack of emotion, facial expression that suggests hatred etc. Hitch is through this character touched two controversial topics psychological violence by women and lesbianism.The film is little you can complain about, one that nicely rounded whole, diverse genres, accompanied by fine music theme by Franz Waxman. With Laurence Olivier in the title role, a triple Oscar winner and founder of the British National Theatre, Hitchcock as a director and an intriguing storyline. Rebecca is absolutely brilliant film with shades of threatening the past, violent and tragic present and an uncertain future."
LeonLouisRicci,"Feb 22, 2013",7/10,"A haunting tale of Gothic romance that is a time-stamped style that will forever be acclimated to those thick Female penned stories of love and longing when such things were expected as entertainment. This kind of heavy-handed story could not and would not be done today.That dating aside, we have Rebecca a Film that has quite a reputation. Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier.It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former ""partner"". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic.Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name."
kenjha,"Jul 4, 2010",8/10,"A young woman of common stock marries a noble widower and moves into the mansion that may be haunted by the spirit of the first wife, Rebecca. This visually opulent screen adaptation of the celebrated Du Maurier novel won the Oscar for Best Picture. Ironically, it is one of the few instances that the Best Picture winner did not also garner Best Director, denying an Oscar to the great Hitchcock, who never did win one. Fontaine does a terrific job of projecting the insecurities and vulnerabilities of the unnamed heroine. Olivier is brooding if one-dimensional. And nobody does brooding better than Olivier. Anderson is quite spooky as the maid."
kenandraf,"Oct 8, 2000",1/10,This was an average movie.Not more not less.The camera angles and shadow techniques of Hitchcock saved the film and turned a bad movie into a fair one.Best picture Oscar?I don't think so.The acting was also good and the actors had to do as much as their skills would allow to bring life to a limited screenplay.......
Chrysanthepop,"Mar 27, 2009",N/A,"Given the huge acclaim and having enjoyed many of Hitchcock's other works, I really was looking forward to 'Rebecca'. The film starts with widower Maxim pursuing Fontaine's character which leads to marriage. The early sequences are full of clichés and bad acting especially by Olivier. From the marriage point, then on Hitchcock successfully sets an atmospheric tone once the viewer is introduced to Manderlay. The cinematography and lighting is brilliant. Though Rebecca is dead, even the viewer feels her looming presence that suffocates the second Mrs. De Winter. Consequently, her marriage to Maxim is on the rocks.However, after the sequence where Rebecca's body is discovered in a sunken boat, the movie goes rapidly downhill. There writing gets very shoddy as it changes into a contrived murder mystery with too many inconsistencies. Even the cute Joan Fontaine's Mrs. De Winter loses bearing (just like the plot). At this point I got so tired that I was desperately hoping for the closing credits to roll. Fontaine was excellent as the naive pushover bride up until this aforementioned turn of events when the character loses focus. Laurence Olivier overacts. But, it is Judith Anderson who steals the show as the intimidating Mrs. Danvers.I don't understand why 'Rebecca' is recognized as one of his most accomplished work. To me it is far from Hitchcock's best. It's his worst of what I've seen."
JohnWelles,"May 2, 2009",10/10,"A lot of people respect and like Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" (1940), but quite a few people have one small quibble with this film, which is the lack of humour. To me, this is added virtue. Who ever heard of a dark, brooding Gothic melodrama having humour in it? This is a totally serious movie which was Hitchcock's first American movie. Thanks to the larger budget he got across the pond from David O. Selznick, he could build magnificent sets crammed with detail. The film is helped enormously no end by the cast, with a dream team that included Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, George Sanders, Judith Anderson, Nigel Bruce and C. Aubrey Smith. This is one brilliant film that will have you siting on the edge of your seat."
cottonsbaby,"Aug 9, 2001",10/10,"Rebecca, a movie that I watched again for the 10th time recently, was a phenomenal Alfred Hitchcock thriller.  This dark drama has one glued to their seats.  One can't help but to get caught up in the beauty (inside and out) of the character of the Second Mrs. de Winter or the mystery of Maxim. This Oscar award winning movie is wonderful even up against recent blockbusters."
zemboy,"Feb 27, 2015",10/10,"This is my all-time favorite movie and I'm 72 years old (making Rebecca three years older than I!) I won't waste space repeating all of the praise that's already been expressed by so many reviewers about the wonderful acting, directing, musical score, etc. I would like to comment, however, on the performance of one actress who never seems to get much credit. It's Florence Bates, who plays the rather short but important part of Mrs. Van Hopper at the beginning of the film. I don't think her performance as the rich, rude, self-centered American traveler abroad could possibly have been more perfect. She interrupts and rudely scolds her paid companion (Joan Fontaine), she pushes herself on Max DeWinter in efforts to scrape an acquaintance with him because of his wealth, she's totally repulsive and she speaks English in the uppity- rich Boston/Philadephia manner. She is rude and insulting at all times.Now here are some amazing facts about Florence Bates. Born in 1888, she grew up in Texas, was from a Jewish family, and was a talented piano student but a hand injury forced her to give up piano. She was a brilliant student and earned a university mathematics degree; taught math in high school briefly, then studied law and became the first woman licensed to practice law in Texas. She was fluent in Spanish and, after radio was introduced around 1920 she had her own Spanish-language radio program in Texas with the goal of improving relations between Americans and Mexicans. She later ran her father's antique shop, and when her husband lost his fortune in the 1929 crash the couple moved to California and operated a bakery. In California she acted in a few plays and finally in 1939 she landed her very first film role--in Rebecca! She ran into Alfred Hitchcock by accident and he knew she would be perfect for the part and offered it to her--her very first film role.Clearly a person of immense energy and multiple talents, she was 51 years old when she made this ""film debut"" (Rebecca was actually filmed during 1939 but not released till 1940.)As to her acting in Rebecca, the way she uses her voice, facial expressions and general posture and demeanor to create and project the personality of this relatively minor character is, in my opinion, nothing short of genius. If you have a DVD copy of the film, have another look at her brief performance (she is only present in the first half hour of the film.) Watch especially the scene at Max DeWinter's hotel room door as he announces to her that he has become engaged to her ""companion."" And watch the movements of the camera as it anticipates her glance toward the companion after DeWinter's hand gesture. I agree with reviewers who suggest that Hitchcock should have won ""Best Director"" because just this scene alone should have won the award for him, in my opinion.As to Hitchcock's use of the camera, I think it's wonderful the way he has the camera OFF the face of the person speaking and, instead, ON the face of the person being spoken to. Example: the early scene in which Mrs. Van Hopper announces the engagement of her daughter and her sudden decision to sail for New York. We only see the back of her head as she speaks--allowing us to focus on the full facial reaction of Joan Fontaine to this awful news.These are just a couple of the touches of genius in acting and directing that I appreciate in this wonderful movie. Virtuoso performances by Judith Anderson and George Sanders in addition to Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier and, in fact, great work from everybody involved."
carmenv,"Sep 30, 1999",10/10,"This is a classic film, not only because it was Hitch's first American film, but because the story and the idea of tragic romance is virtually non-existent in films today. The story centers around an wealthy English man who is suicidal and gloomy after the death of his wife.  This role is carried out brilliantly by Laurence Olivier.  He meets and falls in love with a young and very naive girl he meets in Monte Carlo. He marries her and brings her back to his boyhood home, called Manderley. This is when the trouble begins. The wife, played wonderfully by Joan Fontaine, is ill at ease as a mistress of the house and is intimidated and frightened at the idea of the first wife, Rebecca, haunting the house and the idea that she does not measure up to Rebecca, who was charming and beautiful to all who knew her. Rebecca allegedly died in a sailing accident, and when the wreck of her boat is found near the estate, all the past rises up again to destroy Maxim and his bride. Films like these are no longer made, which is why they are called classic. If you enjoy suspense, romance, or even Alfred Hitchcock films (Heaven knows I can't be the only Hitchcock fan around!), rent this film. It is rarely shown on cable, so don't look for it on TV. A Hitchock film celebration was recently held on Starz!, Turner Classic Movies (TCM), and AMC and none of these channel showed this film. I cannot recommend this film highly enough!Enjoy a rare glimpse of Hitchcock when he was first getting started in Hollywood, and look for Hitch's quick cameo at the beginning of the film."
nickmat-2,"Feb 3, 2020",6/10,"This film must have been produced when Hitchcock was out of form because it is nowhere near the brilliance of his great films such as Psycho, Vertigo, Dial M for murder, Shadow of a doubt, North by North West. Most of the film is awfully boring, needlessly drawn out without any substantial plot or anything to create tension and suspense and I was wondering what is the plot where is this film going to? For example the early part in Monaco where De Winter met his future second wife played by Joan Fontaine lasted about half an hour when it could have been done in ten minutes maximum.Only the last 45 minutes of the film reminded me somewhat of the Alfred Hitchcock dexterity but overall this film was mediocre and quite insipid, you won't lose much by giving it a miss and watch instead one of his top films such as the ones I mention above."
EUyeshima,"Feb 8, 2006",9/10,"Even though this film won the 1940 Best Picture Oscar, it does seem a shame that master director Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's classic mystery is hardly mentioned in the same breath as his later works like ""Notorious"", ""Rear Window"" or ""Vertigo"". I'm not sure why but it may be because at the time, it was a film more associated with David O. Selznick in the afterglow of ""Gone With the Wind"" than with Hitchcock who was making his first picture in Hollywood. Sixty-five years have elapsed and diminished the perception of Selznick's then-powerful influence. Suffice it to say that ""Rebecca"" survives as one of Hitchcock's most atmospheric masterworks, beautifully filmed by George Barnes and with two superb lead performances by Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. Major credit needs to go yet again to the Criterion Collection for restoring the original beauty of the black-and-white film from a pristine print and resuscitating a clear soundtrack. The result is well worth revisiting even if you have already seen it in earlier forms.The full-blooded plot is intricately based on the way Du Maurier sets up the two main characters. At the center of the story is a naïve, unadorned young woman working as a hired travel companion for the selfish Mrs. Van Hopper. Because of her testy employer, she ends up on the French Riviera where by chance, she meets Maxim DeWinter, a brooding, wealthy widower. DeWinter is energized by the young woman and decides to marry her on the spot. The newlyweds return to DeWinter's residence, the foreboding estate called Manderley. The young woman's insecurity is heightened by the cold housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who takes an immediate dislike to the new Mrs. DeWinter. Mrs. Danvers's adoration is reserved strictly for Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. At first, the new wife is completely intimidated by the manipulative Mrs. Danvers, but over time, she takes stock and becomes a more formidable presence until a revelation threatens to destroy her marriage. As the film plays itself out, the young woman discovers the real cause of Rebecca's death and gains strength in providing support for her tortured husband.In her first important role, the 23-year old Fontaine captures the right mix of deepening anxiety and innocence in portraying a woman so insecure as to not have a name in the story (she is referred to as ""The Second Mrs. DeWinter"" in the credits). Fresh from his equally ominous turn as Heathcliff in William Wyler's ""Wuthering Heights"", Olivier plays older, and it suits his polished manner much more as a well-bred man trapped by his personal demons. In a role that has been parodied endlessly ever since, Judith Anderson expertly plays the implacable Mrs. Danvers with a foreboding chill with her overly modulated tones. I do have to admit there are some moments -especially as she holds the candles near her tersely twisted face - when you almost want to laugh from the overemphasized dramatic effect.Smaller roles are filled expertly by familiar faces - George Sanders, a full decade before his acerbic Addison DeWitt in ""All About Eve"", plays a far more bald-faced scoundrel but with the same smarmy panache as Jack Favell; the befuddling Nigel Bruce and a relatively sympathetic Gladys Cooper expertly portray Maxim's brother-in-law and wife; and in the early going, Florence Bates makes a wonderfully wicked Mrs. Van Hopper. Once the center of the mystery has been exposed, the film does move quickly toward its conclusion running somewhat counter to the pacing Hitchcock uses in the story set-up. Regardless, many of his touches are on full display, especially the distorted camera angles and creative use of lighting. It all makes for grand entertainment.The Criterion DVD is a wonderful two-disc set with expert commentary provided by film historian Leonard Leff, the author of ""Hitchcock and Selznick"". It's obvious that he has studied this film intensely and come up with some golden nuggets of insight regarding the film machinations and the treatment of various plot developments. The second disc for true aficionados with an in-depth Du Maurier biography; numerous Selznick memos (for which he was most famous) on the ongoing production; more recent interviews that Leff conducted with Fontaine and Anderson; and most interestingly, archived footage of screen tests with actresses far more established than Fontaine at the time - Vivien Leigh, Loretta Young, Margaret Sullivan, a seventeen-year old Anne Baxter. Except for Baxter, who brings a touching Oedipal twist to her audition, it becomes clear how hopelessly wrong these beautiful actresses are for Fontaine's role and instead would have been ideal as Rebecca. The first disc is a must-see; the second is for devotees only."
cmtenasitas,"Apr 6, 2025",6/10,"This movie is quite disappointing. I wouldn't say it's bad, but it definitely falls short in many moments. Something I always applaud the director for is that he always tries to give quite interesting plot twists, but for that plot twist to meet expectations, the rest must be even better planned, and in this aspect the movie falters. First, because the romance, unsurprisingly, is poorly written, so you don't manage to empathize with any of the characters. Therefore, when the climax happens, the final revelation, it's surprising, yes, but nothing extraordinary, which is a shame because more than an hour is thrown overboard in which the characters were not well built. So, I will continue to wait for an excellent Hitchcock movie."
Mehki_Girl,"Jul 23, 2020",5/10,"I know a lot of people here aren't going to like my review but I'm sorry. This started off fairly well. I actually like the very first scene with her and her companion on first meeting Maxim.But for me it went downhill after that. I understand the character of the lead is supposed to be someone who's unsophisticated and naive but Joan Fontaine plays the part like a scared puppy who piddled in the corner of the room and is about to be found out. We are hammered over and over and over again with that performance.I'm watching her simper to the point that she comes across as an idiot and it is starting to wear thin. Okay, we get it, she's not from a rich background, she feels somewhat intimidated, she's a little worried about pleasing her husband, but come on. I mean an hour of this?Like others have said, there's simply no chemistry between the two leads.The movie score is overdone as somebody else mentioned and I agree. It's just constant loud strings of schmaltz.Everyone is rude to her. Everyone insults her to her face, including her husband and somewhere along the line most of us would get a backbone and fight back out try to make this movie interesting instead of 80 minutes of someone looking like they're about to break into tears.Finally, after way too many minutes setting this up, the film finally picks up. It's like two different directors shot this mess.Yeah, not Hitchcock's best."
bob the moo,"Jan 18, 2006",N/A,"A naïve and shy young woman is staying at an exclusive but dull hotel with her guardian Mrs Edythe Van Hopper. While Van Hopper is in her room, bedridden for days with a mild cold, the girl meets ""Max"" De Winter  a wealthy and influential man who she gets on with very well. Learning that he is still distraught over the accidental drowning of his first wife only makes her feel closer to him and the two bond during their drives together. When it comes time for Van Hopper to return to America, De Winter proposes and the girl gratefully becomes Mrs de Winter. Moving in with him at his Cornwall estate, Mrs de Winter cannot believe the change in her life from being barked at by Van Hopper, to now being waited on by a large staff.The idea of a marriage where the wife is constantly compared to the husband's previous wife sounded like a melodrama to me but I felt confident that Hitchcock and the assembled cast must have done something more interesting with it than just making a sentimental weepy. And indeed I was right because this has the air of a romance that turns dark, that breeds fear and develops into a mystery film of sorts. The story is twisty and very engaging and I was held by it; it does have the approach of a melodrama but it is far from that thanks to the dark air of foreboding that Hitchcock gives it. The girl's appealing nervousness is well turned in on itself by the ""ghost"" of Rebecca. It is done in a gripping way and when truths come out, it may head in a different direction but it is just as satisfying.The cast are pretty much all great. Fontaine dominates the first half of the film in the same way that Rebecca dominates her characters life. Throughout the film, we never know her characters first or maiden name and this helps set up a lack of strong identity that Fontaine plays off really well. Her nervous, shy girl is totally convincing and in real life I know several people like her  people who allow themselves to be taken over by stronger characters and Fontaine did well to allow that to happen without ever having the person doing it on the screen. Olivier is powerful and makes for an interesting character throughout the whole film. Anderson has a much smaller role but has a great character and does well to support the dark air. The rest of the cast are all impressive in terms of faces  Sanders, Bruce, Carroll, Smith, all well known people from the period and add to the sense of class the film has.Overall this is an impressive and engaging film that tells a good story with a great approach, producing a dark and interesting film that is driven by an unseen character whether the tone is melodrama, romance or mystery story."
FilmOtaku,"Oct 19, 2003",8/10,"Rebecca, based on the Daphne DuMaurier novel of the same name is a gothic melodrama about an average woman who becomes the second wife if an English widower, but lives among the affects and memories and in the shadow of his first wife, Rebecca.   This film was Hitchcock's first Hollywood venture and his first collaboration with David O. Selznick, a producer with whom he would grow to have a volatile relationship for many years.  It is also the first and only Hitchcock film to win a Best Picture Oscar.This film is excellent in many ways, but the beauty lies in the performances of the excellent cast.  Joan Fontaine was expertly chosen in the role of the nervous and unsure `second Mrs. de Winter' and the always superb Laurence Olivier is brilliant as the volatile and conflicted Maxim de Winter.  While George Sanders is always delightfully smug and droll in his supporting role, the real star of this film is the psychotic Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson.  Her obsession with Rebecca manifests itself into instant hatred and scorn for Maxim's new wife, and Anderson's both understated and at times over-the-top performance is fantastic.As with many films of this era, the subtle jokes and dialogue are extremely dated and laugh-worthy, and the melodrama is palpable at times, but this film is a certified classic and in this reviewer's opinion, Hitchcock's best film until Shadow of a Doubt was released in 1943.--Shelly"
deathly_smirk,"May 14, 2007",10/10,"OK as an 18 year old I don't really watch 'old' movies. However, a friend recommended the book to me as an 'unusual ghost story' and the movie happened to be on by chance. I watched the 1st 10 minutes and I was hooked. It is a fantastic movie, completely under- rated and one I feel which will be absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to replicate today in terms of actors, atmosphere, locations and storyline. The actors were amazing (I can't stop praising them) Laurence really nailing the role as the torn lover between his guilt and love for his 2nd wife. Joan Fontaine shines as the 2nd wife, creating what appears an exciting, genuine chemistry with Laurence whilst retaining what appears like a natural sort of innocence, that makes her a joy to watch. If only their were more actresses like her today!!! The supporting cast is well presented too. With Mrs Danvers giving me the chills every time she came on screen. Poor Joan I felt so sorry for her! The suspense of this plot is what drives you to complete the movie like the 2nd Mrs de Winter (Joan) you wish to know what is wrong with Maxim (Laurence) truly."
dallasanna,"Mar 22, 2001",10/10,"This movie is long (3 hours) but is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.  Every time I run across it flipping channels, I have to stop and watch it to the end.  If you have not seen it, you should!!!  Joan Fontaine plays a plain (although JF is FAR from plain), young girl who meets the wealthy widower Max DeWinter.  Lawrence Olivier is sexy and complex as Max, causing me to fall in love with him.  Max's deceased wife, Rebecca, died tragically in a boating accident but continues to haunt all in the house. This is the best Hitchcock movie I have ever seen."
Ned_And_Shall_Luvz_Filmzsh,"Apr 30, 2020",7/10,"I rate this film 7/10 for a few reasons. Although the film is directed brilliantly, with unique camera techniques and interesting story lines. I can't help but feel that some of the reviews hype the film up a little too much. Regardless, this is still worth a watch and it was pleasure to watch such an old film , proving that you don't need all the production in the world to capture such eye catching moments.Enjoy!"
Kuba_D,"Jun 7, 2007",10/10,"After having succeeded in Europe, the master of spy films, Alfred Hitchcock was invited to Hollywood by David O. Selznick in the year 1939. This time the director reached for a novel 'Rebecca' by Daphne du Maunier. It is a story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine), who becomes a second wife of a British lord (Laurence Olivier), and his residence she meets with the cult of Rebecca. Rebecca was the lord's previous wife and she has died in very peculiar circumstances.Film cost more than a million dollars. And it was matter of conflict between the creator and the producer. But it gathered more than 10 Oscan nominees and two Oscars for the best movie and cinematography. Selznick himself was quite surprised by the piece of art. He decided to produce the movie only due to the fact that the final scene of fire reminded him of the fire of Atlanta in 'Gone with the Wind'.This master psychological thriller opened a new chapter in Hitchcock's works, making him the Hollywood's master of manipulating with mood."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Nov 9, 2020",7/10,"Essentially, 'Rebecca (1940)' feels like three different films welded together; each of its acts are somewhat distinct in tone and, even, style. To begin with, the picture focuses on a whirlwind romance between the nameless protagonist and a rich recluse who's haunted by the enigmatic existence of his eponymous ex-wife. It feels sort of like a romantic comedy here, with only a few hints of darkness seeping into the fray, and its aesthetics are rather light and, for want of a better term, fluffy. It also culminates in one of the worst marriage proposals ever, a declaration of love disguised as an insult. The second act is by far the feature's most successful, focusing on the protagonist's attempts to acclimatise to the vast halls and large staff found in her new home, all while feeling pressured to live a certain responsibility-ridden, rich-blooded lifestyle as the 'lady of the house'. It's a lonely, mysterious and somewhat gothic fish-out-of-water segment that does a fantastic job of putting you in the new Mrs. de Winter's position. It's also the part in which the haunting, almost otherworldly presence of the deceased yet incomparable Rebecca is most keenly felt. The icy air that hangs over the house and its inhabitants belies the fact that this is, in essence, a ghost story, which gives the piece an interesting texture and lends it an air of suspenseful unpredictability. The movie's final third takes place after what you initially presume to be its big, reveal-ridden finale. It turns into a sort of courtroom drama/ police procedural and is much more focused on delivering information, albeit in an intriguing and well-conceived way. It lacks the almost ethereal vibe that the second act is soaked in, feeling much more in-the-moment and, in a way, straightforward. Of course, this segment isn't bad. It just feels as though it could have been refined somewhat and arguably isn't all that necessary in the grand scheme of things. Still, the conclusion is satisfying. Overall, the film is a beguiling and often enigmatic experience that keeps you engaged throughout. 7/10"
Jalea,"Aug 16, 2007",10/10,"This is one of my favorite movies! My family comments on the fact that I watch black and white movies. It is because of the creativity and the dialogue. The 40s the dialogue was always crisp, clean and the actors enunciated their lines, you understood every syllable. No mumbling or swallowing of words in the 1940s (with the exception of comedy and gangster movies).This is one of best of the best. You never see the violence, death or heated arguments. All of the gory details are presented in a narrative form and yet you are enthralled. It is because the actors were excellent story tellers.And there are a few innuendos and witticisms, some of which if you are not watching or listening carefully, you will not catch. There is plenty of wry, dry English wit to go around in this movie.It is a Englishman's film-noir, which Hitchcock excelled at."
JayWolfgramm,"May 7, 2025",7/10,"Rebecca is the only Alfred Hitchcock film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. This was Hitchcock 20 years before ""Pyscho"", this was far from his peak as a director in quality or popularity. Heck, Hitchcock doesn't even make a cameo in the film. Although this isn't Hitchcock's Best Picture, you can still see the potential peeking through...in the final 40 minutes. One of the main lessons Hitchcock seemed to take from this film is that he needs to get to the hook earlier in the story. The romance between Mr and Mrs. De Winter gets dull as soon as they leave the hotel. Once the reveal of Rebecca is given, then the movie starts to get engaging again. In future Hitchcock films, he learns to get to that point a lot faster."
Kirpianuscus,"Jun 24, 2016",N/A,"for me - the film of Judith Anderson. her performance defines the atmosphere and the rhythm and the cold air of a remarkable adaptation. in same measure, she seems be the perfect axis for bright the performances of Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontain. because it is more than a good film or high level adaptation. it is a pure Hitchcock, impressive for each detail and nuance, fascinating for the tension and for the strange evolution of story, against the obvious remark than it is a film of his actors.because it has a not small dose of magic in each scene. because it reminds old dark fairy tales and the emotion is the same front to the brothers Grimm stories. that does it a masterpiece."
sunbrite06,"Sep 28, 2004",10/10,"This is one of Hitchcock's earliest films in the United States that incorporates all the suspense and mystery of a true Hitchcockian thriller but with a more romantic feel. With an awesome plot and great acting we can really see why this won Best Picture in 1940. I absolutely love this film, it's definitely in my top three.The camera work is great and the acting, brilliant. Sir Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine have great chemistry on screen, and the rest of the cast is wonderful, especially, Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers the sinister housekeeper. Anyone who loves, mystery, romance, suspense, or drama, can find it in Rebecca."
sabby,"Apr 16, 1999",8/10,"""Rebecca"" was Alfred Hitchcock's first Hollywood picture (after a string of British made hits). This also gave Hitchcock his first (and only!!)Academy Award. This fabulous mystery has endless twists and turns and provides an amazing movie-going experience. Joan Fontaine(who was Oscar-nominated)plays a woman who marries a rich, dashing Englishman(Laurence Olivier), but she soon is haunted by the memories of his late wife, Rebecca. Adding to Fontaine's troubles is the evil and scary Mrs.Danvers(Judith Anderson)who is the housekeeper that is completely obsessed with Rebecca. Major lesbian overtones here. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest films of Hollywood's golden era and a Hitchcock triumph!"
jfgibson73,"Aug 22, 2021",10/10,"This movie has one of the best written thrillers providing the script. Add to that one of the greatest directors of all time, and you have a perfect film. Of course, the performances are great, my favorite being George Sanders as Favell. This is one instance in which it doesn't matter if you read the book or see the movie first--they are both highly enjoyable."
rutledgekenneth,"Jun 15, 2005",10/10,"This is an absolutely excellent movie. The acting is superb and the tension of the story grips you to the very end. It would be well worth anyone watching the film and enjoying the various twists and turns found in the movie. I would suggest that after watching the movie you should also read the book........but read the book only after watching the movie. Hitchcock is at his best in this one and makes use of some very good character actors. One of the things to watch in this movie is the entire lifestyle of the English characters and the way wealthy people live. It is extremely interesting to note various differences in how people react to things in a culture with class distinctions. The housekeeper in this movie is a fascinating and complex character designed after the typical English housekeeper. However, she is like no other housekeeper you'll run into. The main female lead could not have pulled this off any better than she did. The acting is superb and is so believable you find yourself forgetting its a movie. That......to me..........makes for good movie watching. Enjoy!"
Filmdokter,"May 29, 2021",7/10,The film kicks off quiet slowly and Hitchcock allows to get to know the two lead characters (Fontaine and Olivier). The plot really gets going once the newlyweds arrive at Manderlay. From there the film that's started rather as a romantic story turns into a thriller (what happened to Rebecca?) and a drama (Fontaine and her struggle as the new lady of the house). It is a bit of a shame that the great way in which Hitchcock tells this story visually is sort of abandoned in the final 40 minutes or so. There we have (really) long dialogue scenes that take the thriller bit out the film. A pity but nonetheless a film worthwhile checking out.
saalehab,"Dec 17, 2015",8/10,"Hitchcock movies are known around the world for a reason, they're really good, acting wise, director wise, and cinematography wise. The whole story was acted out wonderfully by Olivier and Fontaine, Oliver played the mysterious handsome man well, and Fontaine was believable as a naive girl who fell for the looks. There were so many instances of great cinematography unique to Hitchcock films, playing with light and shadow to really tell the story along with the dialogue to make everything come together. Alfred Hitchcock as the director definitely left his mark on this movie, since I saw it was adapted from a book, and not created by him, he made it his own with great directive vision."
Somesweetkid,"Feb 15, 2024",6/10,"Of all the overblown dramatic dialogue in this overwrought adaptation, the line in the caption is the most laughably ridiculous and it comes from Olivier towards the end of the movie.Let me first state that I'm neither a fan of Sir Larry's over-emoting nor of Ms. Fontaine (at all), especially in this movie. And, if not for the crucial appearance of George Sanders near the end of the film, I would have given an even lower rating.But, I have enjoyed Mr. Olivier in other films, especially ""Pride and Prejudice"" and in one of his last roles in ""A Little Romance."" I feel his style of acting was more suited to Shakespeare and on the stage rather than in a Hitchcock film. However, he was remarkably handsome in this picture.I will also give credit to Ms. Fontaine for her convincing portrayal of the mousie and slouching second Mrs. De Winter, but her sudden take-charge attitude mid-film was both jarring and unconvincing. I don't feel her performance warranted a nomination for Best Actress.However, Judith Anderson was hypnotic as the ""two-Jokers-short-of-a-full-deck"" Mrs. Danvers and as performances go, was definitely memorable!Additionally, for the character of Maxim De Winter I would have preferred that Olivier and Sanders switch roles. Olivier was too over the top for me and I've never seen Sanders give anything less than a stellar performance. I especially loved him in ""Lured"" with Lucille Ball, of all people, as his leading lady and ""Village of the Damned"" where he was especially sympathetic. He was charming in both and not the cad that he so often portrayed, as he did in this film.I was surprised that ""Rebecca"" won the 1940 Best Picture Oscar, which I felt was undeserved, but not surprised that it won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, which I felt it DID deserve. It is a beautiful film.Finally, any motion picture that includes C. Aubrey Smith, Florence Bates, Nigel Bruce (a hoot), and Gladys Cooper as supporting characters is always worth viewing."
janesbit1,"Feb 6, 2000",8/10,"This is the only Hitchcock movie that won an Academy Award for Best Movie, preceeding Citizen Kane by one year.  There is much in Rebecca reminiscent of Kane--from the outstanding opening black and white cinematography of the tracking shot of Manderley to the final shot of the embroidered pillow surrounded by flames.The Academy snubbed Hitchcock himself, as they never did award the all-time best director the top prize for himself.  Hitchcock's influence is demonstrated throughout the unfolding of the film.  As in many of his films, your initial assumptions will likely prove wrong.Laurence Olivier plays a wealthy man haunted by the death of his first wife, while Joan Fontaine plays an ""ordinary"" young woman who becomes the second Mrs. de Winter.  Fontaine's character obviously loves her husband but feels out of place in the vast mansion, especially when the sinister and strange Mrs. Danvers appears.Rebecca holds up well with age.  The characters are memorable and the subtle Hitchcockian twists are riveting. Renting this classic will be much more worthwhile than watching 99% of the more current fare available."

mjneu59,"Dec 29, 2010",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's Hollywood debut, while not likely to appeal to the same fans who champion 'Vertigo' or 'Psycho', is nevertheless a 14-karat treasure from the Golden Age of movie-making. Purists will argue that the film is more Selznick than Hitchcock: a blockbuster studio production packed with talent, prestige, and all the glamour money can buy, but certain touches (mostly those concerning malevolent maidservant Judith Anderson and smarmy playboy George Sanders) could not have been duplicated by any other director. The film today, restored to all its magnificent, pristine clarity, is suitably lush and moody, and after all these years the atmosphere of unease surrounding the stately house of Manderley is still palpable. But the Daphne Du Maurier scenario is still very much an anachronism: the innocent, unsophisticated girl who marries into wealth and tries, desperately, to conform to society's manners is hardly a valid role model these days. And once the mystery of the late Rebecca de Winter is finally solved, the Gothic plot settles into a conventional blackmail scheme more typical of the Master of Suspense."
beziercurveguru,"Mar 12, 2024",10/10,"When I was younger, I used to avoid classical films because I believed their concepts were outdated and not worth watching. However, watching ""Rebecca"" completely changed my perspective.This film not only boasts a captivating story, but its cinematography is surprisingly impressive, especially considering it was made in 1940. The acting is also remarkable, with Judith Anderson delivering a magnificent performance as Mrs. Danvers, effectively sending shivers down my spine in every scene.Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, once again demonstrates his brilliance as a filmmaker through this gripping masterpiece."

Took many an efforts to finish this one off.. such was the loss of momentum and failure of creation of Hitchcockian allure for me.Loads of laboured scenes, too much of make believe stuff, and general lack of effort with script/dialogues. Just didn't come along as other movies by the same director. Citizen Kane was an abs master piece, this one kept fizzling out every other scene or so."
dkncd,"Nov 5, 2007",10/10,"""Rebecca"" is Alfred Hitchcock's film about a woman that marries a wealthy widower and settles in his considerable estate, only to find that the lingering memory of the man's first wife, Rebecca, hampers the couple's happiness. Stories about English country estates with a legion of servants can easily be bogged down and boring, but ""Rebecca"" proves exceptionally tense and interesting.Joan Fontaine is the ""second Mrs. de Winter"", who is attempting to overcome the resentment associated with filling a place of high social standing in the stead of the seemingly perfect ""Rebecca"". Fontaine makes the character enchanting and extremely sympathetic. Every slight to her character and moment of self-doubt is disconcerting to see. Laurence Olivier is as skilled as ever as the distressed ""Maxim"" de Winter and effectively creates an ambivalent character. Judith Anderson is very unnerving in every scene she is in as Mrs. Danvers.The story has an underlying mystery and various twists that make it interesting. The film's tension is built up masterfully with the help of its sharp dialogue. It is impressive the way the tension returns near the end just as it seems to vanish. ""Rebecca"" shows us life at an English country estate with tension and not tedium."

mafreysphone,"May 15, 2019",8/10,Judith Anderson is the true star as Mrs. Danvers. She brings a soft menace and haughty condescension to the role that makes her a joy to watch. The cinematography is excellent- as is to be expected of Hitchcock's exacting labors. A tad long but well worth viewing.

RodrigAndrisan,"Sep 18, 2016",N/A,"A great film directed by one of the greatest masters of the 7th art. The whole movie is really impeccable. But Joan Fontaine in particular. Laurence Olivier is also good but is not his best role. In my opinion, his best part is Szell in Marathon Man. George Sanders is also excellent, as in most movies. Judith Anderson also made a noteworthy role. The music is excellent. The cinematography, the direction, everything is top quality. A movie to be seen and reviewed at any time, with the same pleasure and the same thrill. I am convinced that the great Alfred twist in his grave seeing what movies are now, a few decades after his death."
IulianI-2,"Apr 6, 2025",10/10,"Just watched Hitchcock's Rebecca and I have to say-this film is haunting in the best way. It's not a horror movie, but it creeps up on you with tension, elegance, and mystery. The story revolves around a young woman who marries a wealthy widower and moves into his massive estate, Manderley-only to find that the memory of his late wife, Rebecca, still controls everything.From the very first line-""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again""-you know you're in for something atmospheric. The mansion becomes a character on its own. Cold. Beautiful. Full of secrets. And Mrs. Danvers? Probably one of the most unsettling characters ever. She doesn't raise her voice, doesn't need to. Her presence is enough to keep you on edge.I loved how the film explores insecurity, obsession, and the shadow that the past can cast over the present. It's slow-burning, but every scene builds tension. Joan Fontaine perfectly plays the timid, unsure new Mrs. De Winter, and Laurence Olivier brings that brooding energy that makes you constantly question what he's hiding.It's psychological, elegant, and beautifully shot-like a gothic fairytale gone wrong. If you like movies that make you feel uneasy without jump scares, and love a good slow-reveal mystery, Rebecca is a must."
imdbfan-6646544255,"Apr 4, 2025",10/10,"Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940) is an absolute masterclass in psychological suspense-an easy 10/10. From the moment Joan Fontaine's timid heroine steps into Manderley, the film drips with unease, mystery, and gothic beauty. Laurence Olivier is captivating as the brooding Maxim de Winter, but Judith Anderson's chilling performance as Mrs. Danvers steals the show.The cinematography, shadowy and atmospheric, pulls you deeper into the film's haunting world, while Franz Waxman's score amplifies every moment of tension. Hitchcock crafts a tale that is both romantic and terrifying, proving once again why he's the master of suspense. Rebecca is perfection."
aMirKheirolahi,"Jan 23, 2025",7/10,"Set, awesome, highly technical
in the true sense of the word, is Rebecca's MacGuffin
and the story revolves around Manderley
a haunted house,
a sacred tomb,
and a magnificent tomb.In a dreamlike atmosphere
and an inaccessible geography,
John Fontaine wanders through an environment
overshadowed by death;
a place like a temple
to a goddess who is dead.The physical confines of the stage, where Gothic mysticism is mixed with the remains of a darkly romantic life, show John Fontaine that he is merely an annoying decoration here, that although he has an apparent freedom of action, he is asleep, innocent and troubled, in the face of the secrets he holds. And Manderley, with its intricate collages of shadows, its aristocratic halls, its empty rooms, and the only remaining letter R, creates a terrifying MacGuffin that is woven into the museum-like space of the mansion, creating an ideal breeding ground for intense obsessions. Rebecca, the dead Rebecca, the seductive Rebecca, the possessive Rebecca, still watches over everything. By creating a stylistic language that plays with the ambiguity between the visible and the invisible, Hitchcock makes Rebecca's presence felt in every corner of the mansion. Although absolutely nothing is seen, we seem to sense Rebecca's sexual and aggressive energy; In its billowing curtains, its clothes, its mirrors, and Hitchcock's dreamlike camera movements, which go to places where there is nothing but dead matter, but where something alive and terrifying once happened, the pinnacle of Hitchcock's characterization is the incarnation of Rebecca's spirit in the body of Judith Anderson, Mrs. Danvers, a woman of death who is infinitely terrifying even in a simple screenshot. Rebecca, this Gothic cinema classroom, not only holds a special place in the history of cinema, but is a model for examining human relationships, obsession, and the power of past memories to shape present and future lives. With its psychological and visual precision, this film is not only a dark love story, but also a spectacle of the conflict between past and present, power and weakness, and the visible and the invisible. In ""Rebecca,"" Hitchcock managed to turn a classic Gothic tale into a multi-layered work of horror."
CincySaint,"Aug 17, 2021",6/10,"I just didn't feel that the psychological ""suspense"" worked very well. Bordered on silly."
OldieMovieFan,"Nov 27, 2022",4/10,"Nice production values can't keep this one above the bottom third of Hitchcock's films because of the dragging, endless lack of emotion on display for hour after dreary hour.Of course the film is well directed, but it's the shifting cameras rather than the intensity of the characters that are eye-catching - to the point of being distracting. The viewer is constantly pushed out of the reverie of the tale by the constant intrusion of the director. He grasps for technical brilliancies and destroys the flow of the story. After a few minutes one is longing for Wilder or George Stevens, directors who wisely let their actors dominate scenes instead of intruding with these gaudy tricks. Throughout his career, Hitchcock frequently wrecked scenes by over-directing, and much of ""Rebecca"" is over-directed.Olivier gives a fine performance, not as nuanced as his other 1940 performance, that of Mr. Darcy in the lighthearted take of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" but it would be difficult to think of an actor more equipped for the part of the massively depressed, obsessive, de Winter. Olivier assumes and assimilates and owns the role, displaying a masterly change of personality while away from the great house at Mandalay.Fontaine on the other hand, is only adequate in a very strongly written role. Unlike Olivier, Fontaine does not give the sense that nobody could replace her in this part. Easily a half dozen of her contemporaries would have done the part as admirably: Bergman or Joan Bennett or Fontaine's sister Olivia deHavilland are all examples; Claudette Colbert would have created a masterpiece with this role, although studio heads were jugheadedly insistent on typecasting actresses.A good quality melodrama, but not more than that."
FaberFilmFiles,"May 23, 2025",10/10,"Hitchcock's Rebecca is a masterpiece of gothic atmosphere and psychological nuance. Joan Fontaine's fragile performance and Judith Anderson's chilling turn as Mrs. Danvers anchor a haunting tale of jealousy, identity, and memory. The cinematography by George Barnes bathes Manderley in haunting light and shadow, while Franz Waxman's score enhances the dreamlike melancholy. Hitchcock crafts suspense not through action, but suggestion. Though altered to appease censors, the story retains its emotional power. Rebecca is ghost story, mystery, and romance all in one-and one of the finest films ever made."
kalbimassey,"Mar 21, 2025",9/10,"''Have a look at The Times, there's a thrilling article on what's the matter with English cricket.'' Ah!....reassuring to know that some things NEVER change. Not least the enduringly iconic nature of this movie. Signs of wear and tear are evident. A stilted performance here, a bit of stagy dialogue there, but 'Rebecca' remains an essential, sublime piece of cinema.Innately irascible, Laurence Olivier, his hot temper tempered by an irresistible charm, brings young, attractive, unpretentious bride, Joan Fontaine home to the culture shock of an overwhelmingly luxurious life of wealth and an army of servants. A life to which Olivier's sadly deceased Rebecca, appears to have been eminently suited. Curious friends are only too keen to give the new Mrs de Winter patronizing advice on dress and hairstyle. More ominously, housekeeper, Judith Anderson, sporting a facial expression that would instantly turn a glass of milk into yoghurt and who appears to have been secretary of the Rebecca fan club, takes an instant dislike to Fontaine, with her baggy cardigans, slightly unkempt hair and gauche disposition. From the get-go she faces an almost insurmountable task, filling the chasm left by her predecessor. The mood becomes increasingly strained as any reminder of Rebecca inevitably triggers an Olivier outburst. Plain Jane, Joan Fontaine seems irrevocably trapped in an emotional whirlpool - never able to fulfill expectations, always existing in Rebecca's shadow. As the plot unfolds, however, is Olivier's fury less driven by profound grief at the loss of a wife perfect in brains, breeding and beauty, or to a greater degree by resentment at years wasted with a woman closer in character to the femme fatale, who we simply never see, but whose unfading spirit still pervades every corner of Manderley and its immediate surroundings?Of the supporting cast, George Sanders is outstanding as the personification of the brash, well-spoken but utterly detestable cad. The public school bounder, always in pursuit of devious money making schemes, who even when rumbled, responds to his accusers with a scornful smirk and a snide remark.The first installment in Hitchcock's Hollywood history. 'Rebecca' stands as a master class in goth-noir, which set the template for a number of other features, frequently more contrived and less inspired."
imdbfan-1532834722,"Mar 29, 2025",10/10,"Winner (directed by some clown named Alfred Hitchcock). Now starring Lily James & Armie Hammer (in the roles established by Joan Fontaine & Laurence Olivier) we find James working as a valet for a rich dowager (played by Ann Dowd looking unrecognizable), an American on vacation in Europe who's staying at a swank hotel. Unrehearsed in the ways of the world, James (working for a paltry 90 pounds a year) is pushed around & shoved to do her job waiting hand & foot on Dowd's behalf generally not enjoying the sumptuous surroundings about her but things change when the mysterious & rich, Maxim DeWinter, Hammer, shows up at the resort setting tongues a-wagging. Dowd, hoping to get into his good graces & probably dish some gossip, hopes to be seated w/Hammer when he goes to dine sending James as her emissary but in meet cute fashion Hammer does end up finding her to be the bee's knees & they start to date (Dowd falls sick & thankfully for James bedridden) which when their time at the hotel comes to an end the picture postcard sheen of their romance bears fruit when they marry. They then head to back to Hammer's estate, Manderlay, where the staff meets the new Mrs. DeWinter & the house matron, Mrs. Danvers, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, still exalts the name & memory of the former mistress (the Rebecca of the title who passed away when she drowned) keeping James on edge throughout her stay which forces her, whether she likes it or not, to assume the mantle she's married into & have some say over the household. Now the big elephant in the room can be addressed, was the original Rebecca so antiquated & past its prime it needed a remake? No way full stop. Does this film hurt the memory of the original? No, again. While hitting a lot of the same story beats as its predecessor, it also adds unnecessary subplots (maybe from Daphne Du Maurier's novel?) which end up adding nothing w/the awesome & iconic finale of Manderlay & Mrs. Danvers going up in flames changed to something a bit muted & less bombastic. The actors are fine but in no way do they outdo their betters but for those out there who deign to even glimpse a film prior to a certain d."

While this is a really good film it's not nearly as iconic as a dozen other of Hitchcock's movies.

The story twists and turns, but the truth remains elusive. The suspense atmosphere and the rhythm of the story fully reflect the director's ability, from the beginning to the end exudes the unique charm that black and white old films cannot resist.Although the director said that his film was a failure, but in the end it got a great success, it should be because he asked too much of himself.

andrewmerritt-31652,"Dec 8, 2019",9/10,"Rebecca stars Joan Fontaine, Laurence Olivier, and Judith Anderson. The story revolves around a young woman who meets Maxim De Winter and soon becomes his second wife. Later, he takes her to her place named Manderley where she learns a dark secret to his first wife. Rebecca is a twisted fairytale. At the beginning of the film we are introduced to Joan Fontaine who is a shy and insecure woman looking for love. She later meets Maxim De Winter who acts as her prince charming even though he is cruel towards her and she tries everything to escape her evil godmother and eventually the two fall in love and get married. She has this fantasy that he will to her to his palace called Manderley and live happily ever after, but it is far from happy. She is Snow White who wakes up from her coma with the imagination that she will live happily ever after with her prince charming, but once she sees Manderley up close her fairytale is an illusion. Mrs. Danvers is the Queen in the Snow White story who is the scariest woman in movie history. Mrs. Danvers loved the first Mrs. De Winter almost as she were the first wife before the second Mrs. De Winter took her place. All the other characters that we meet along the way are part of the second Mrs. De Winter's fairytale illusion. She's still wants that fairytale to be real and it's the only one living in that fantasy while everyone else is oblivious of the fact that they are also part of the story, but they don't realize it. By this point there is no hope for her as she refuses to be woken up from her dream as she believes that dreams can come true while the first wife was cruel to Maxim. Maxim at once believed that dreams do come true, but once he found out about her real intentions he woke up and realized that his dream was shattered. Alfred Hitchcock takes the beloved fairytale that we all know and turns it upside down and gives it a more gothic tone. Overall, this love story shows us that love is cruel and harsh even though we don't want to accept it. Rebecca took me completely by surprise as it showed me what love is truly about filled with tons of suspense that makes this a great film to watch."
jgcorrea,"Oct 29, 2025",10/10,"Rebecca is a movie whose most defining character is a dead woman's domineering presence. Hitchcock tells a story of woman maturation, growth and struggle of ""overidentification"" with other women, while casting a nameless young girl, with no clear self-identity, as his heroine. And, yes. Hitchcock made significant changes to the ending of Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca. In du Maurier's novel, the ending is quite different from the film:
Novel: After the fire at Manderley, Maxim de Winter confesses to the murder of Rebecca, and he is arrested. The final scenes show him in court, where it's suggested he might be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. The book ends with the narrator reflecting on the destruction of Manderley and her uncertain future with Maxim.Film: In Hitchcock's adaptation, the revelation is that Rebecca had terminal cancer, and she provoked Maxim into killing her, which changes the nature of his culpability. Instead of being arrested, the inquest rules her death as an accident. However, the burning of Manderley still happens, but it's implied that Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper, set the fire. The film ends with Maxim and the narrator escaping together, with their future left ambiguous but with the implication they might start anew.These changes were made due to pressures from the Censorship (Hays Code,) which governed what could be shown in films at the time, particularly regarding crime and morality. Hitchcock had to ensure that the film had a more morally acceptable conclusion. Additionally, these alterations helped to shift the focus from dark inevitability to a more open, albeit uncertain, hope for the protagonists."
Dethcharm,"Feb 21, 2024",N/A,"Director Alfred Hitchcock's REBECCA is the perfect gothic love story, containing drama, suspense, and even horror elements. Opening like any other such film, the future Mrs. De Winter (Joan Fontaine) is swept away in a whirwind of romance by Laurence Olivier's dashing Maxim de Winter, confounding her snooty benefactor, Mrs. Van Hopper (Florence Bates) to no end.Soon, wedding bells chime, and the new bride is taken to the gargantuan de Winter estate known as Manderley. Here, she is introduced to the house staff, led by the never-smiling Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), who terrifies Mrs. De Winter from the first second they meet. This is where the movie takes a sinister turn, and Manderley becomes more like a prison than a mansion.Mr. Hitchcock really plays up the tension between Mrs. De Winter and Mrs. Danvers, who is still obsessed with the former Mrs. De Winter, for whom the movie is named. While Maxim goes about his daily business, his new wife is left to wander Manderley's massive rooms and hallways, with Mrs. Danvers seeming to grow more malevolent by the second! As we're slowly let in on a terrible secret, the late, unseen Rebecca becomes almost a tangible character, not quite a ghost, but a definite presence. This leads to the dark, fiery finale.Both Mr. Olivier and Ms. Fontaine are fantastic in their roles, making their haunted relationship seem doomed.Special mention goes to Ms. Anderson, whose glares could curdle milk! She set the standard for all bitter, hateful female characters that would follow her. She's downright scary!Also, watch for George Sanders as the rather oily Jack Favell. His part is small, but becomes important toward the end.A true classic from Mr. Hitchcock..."

Rebecca has all the hallmarks of Hitchcock's love of directional and linear storytelling, with his mastery of the ominous and unnerving.

Michael_Elliott,"Feb 27, 2008",N/A,"Rebecca (1940)*** (out of 4)The first film in Louisville's Hitchcock Festival is one I hadn't seen in a good fifteen years and a film that I've only watched once, which is rare among the director's work since most of his films I've seen countless times. A ""common"" woman (Joan Fontaine) marries a rich widower (Laurence Olivier) and comes to realize that the memories of his old wife will wreck havoc on their marriage. I know this film won the Oscar for Best Picture and I know this has a large group of fans (just check out the rating at IMDb) but for some reason it didn't really work too well with me. I remember loving the movie from my previous viewing but it just didn't sit right with me this time so I wouldn't rank it among one of Hitchcock's greatest. The director's style and visuals are all right on the mark but I found the film dragged on a good fifteen minutes too long and I also wasn't that thrilled with all the twists towards the end. The greatest aspect to the film is without a doubt Olivier and it was certainly a nice treat finally being able to see him on the big screen. A lesser actor would have died during some of the darker moments in this film where the character has to go into the ""rage"" but Olivier pulls it off very well. Fontaine is very good in her role as well but I can't help but feel a tad bit stronger performance was needed. The music score is wonderful as are all the locations and costumes but I'd still rank this towards the middle of Hitchcock's filmography."

Of course, it helps a lot that the story is based upon the work of acclaimed novelist, Daphne Du Maurier. Even the best directors need desperately a good story in order for their movie to be great, they are not magicians to pull a rabbit out of their hat. Even Hitchcock himself has created some not so memorable movies because script didn't help him.It's not just Du Maurier. Acting is always one of the best qualities in Hitchcock movies but acting here is even better than the average of them. Laurence Olivier's acting is transcendental, dare i say, mythical. Fontaine is also excellent, and truth be told, her role is even more demanding, not so ""glamorous"", more introvert and subtle : These roles are always harder than a loud character who screams and yells, displaying his rough emotions.In conclusion, this is a great drama/mystery movie, a bit less suspensful than his other best movies, but amongst his most well-written movies with really unexpected twists and turns. Last 40 minutes are amazing. I didn't love this movie until then, and that's the reason i didn't rate it higher. In any case, these last 40 minutes make this movie (almost) a masterpiece."

And it didn't feel all that Gothic to me either. But it certainly is a wonderful drama/mystery that pulled me in and held me right through to the end. I found myself staring at Joan Fontaine's face in almost every scene. Such simple, understated beauty! Olivier was great too, even if I found his character to be kinda of a jerk. A great film that has stood the test of time."

Based on Daphne du Maurier's novel, the story follows a shy young woman who marries the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter and moves into his grand estate, Manderley-only to find herself haunted by the memory of his late wife, Rebecca.Hitchcock creates a tense and eerie atmosphere, where the presence of Rebecca looms large, though she never appears on screen. Joan Fontaine delivers a powerful performance as the timid new Mrs. De Winter, and Judith Anderson is unforgettable as the cold and menacing housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.The film is visually stunning, filled with moody shadows and elegant set design, and the suspense builds gradually, in true Hitchcock style.

Based on my own enjoyment of it, I'd rate this film an 8 out of 10.Please bear in mind that this is one of the slower Hitchcock films. Until its plot accelerates toward its end, it spends much of its running length as a methodically paced, brooding Gothic romance and mystery. It's also a psychological thriller, and you can tell that Hitchcock is working to translate onto the screen its character-focused source novel. (I haven't read Daphne du Maurier's eponymous 1938 book.)""Rebecca's"" final act brings the viewer into familiar Hitchcock territory with some interesting surprises. What I liked best about seeing the director's style, however, was his trademark sharp characters and dialogue - with both heroes and villains sparring in a dry-witted and rapid-fire fashion. It's something you don't often see today. I don't think all old movies are like this - some of the ""classics"" I've been recommended are absolutely vapid. But Hitchcock treated his viewer as intelligent adults, and I think it's part of the reason why people love him."
Pedro_H,"Feb 8, 2004",N/A,"A shy girl marries a rich man with a haunting past.What a product this is. There is so much talent on show from the classiest writer on the block to the best director of all time and probably the best actor of all time. It also features the classiest producer of all time, but there wasn't room for it in the sentence. Talk about a power packed movie - how could it fail? Nor did it.I am not a big fan of Gothic novels. For me they are one step above the silly, but I find they make far better films, the silliness tends to look better on the silver screen.This is a simple story. A man with a secret and girl that has to come to terms with a character that is already dead. This is where the men are separated from the boys (if you can forgive the sex change) in the literary world. Threat for the majority of writers would come from the living, only geniuses can makes the dead seem just as potent.The setting of the castle on the hill is chilling. I don't know about American's or non Europeans, but they are by their nature unnatural and sinister places. If you actually visited one for real, you would find them to be like any other home only built more sturdily. However they look terrible from the outside, in the manner of prisons.Yes there are short comings here. There is so little romance before the couple marry that it almost seems like a scene or two has been cut out. Equally many of the devices are stock and not that original: Castle, cliff top, crashing waves, the giant painting, sudden appearances out of shadows, strange people turning up out of the blue. All found under the chapter ""Disorientation"" in the writer's manual.Hitchcock was the best thriller director ever. He virtually invented the film thriller and I bet people watching today think that some of his films are full of clichés without realising that he was the one that invented the clichés! He knew film backwards. He knew his audience backwards. He was like a master magician: Knew all the tricks and knew how to perform them all. Only age withered him.Olivier is a strange fish on film. Started terrible, worked his way up to genius level and then slipped back to the ham. Here is trying to be older than his actual years and is not totally convincing. He is playing dour and that doesn't totally suit him. He is better with some kind of humorous undercurrent. Ronald Coleman (who turned down the part) would have been better. Indeed Larry seems to be doing an impression of him throughout.I don't rate the original novel as much as others. It has too many stock situations and too many audience pleasing motives (person growing to overcome difficult situations) to get that high marks. Call it upmarket airport pulp.The thing I like about the product is that it is not really moral in any true sense of the word. It doesn't tie up it itself up with a pink ribbon and has plenty of ambiguity. However ambiguity is not something to sniffed at. It is my favourite word and the real world is full of it."
SendiTolver,"Jul 24, 2018",9/10,"'Rebecca' might be the best film Hitch made in the '40s, and it still holds up great today. As matter of fact, it is one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all times (and not only my personal opinion, I dare to think). It starts of as sweet romance, the first 30 minutes really look and sound like lighthearted romantic comedy where charming man with troubled past falls into innocent young woman. But soon, the darker note are pressing in, and the viewer is tangled into the twisted mystery world of Manderlay. It is one of those movies where repetitive viewing, when you already know all the twists and turns (which some might be quite shocking, but never preposterous) never fails to engage the viewer.Also the cast and performances. Hitchcock's movies always starred some of the greatest actors of the time and most of them gave their best performances in Hitchcock's movies. 'Rebecca' is not an exception. Laurence Olivier is perfect as charming wealthy man with troubled mind, and Joan Fontaine just shines as innocent, but never dumb or dull, simple girl who is not used with the high class British lifestyle. George Sanders always manages to come off as charming, even in his villainous roles.Masterpiece in every aspect."
p-69076-12366,"Apr 28, 2023",9/10,"This movie was one of the best I have seen in a while. To start, it did not stimulate the viewer, as most modern films do with sex or fantastical CGI. Further, this film has an excellent plot which kept me in suspense nearly every moment of the movie. Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. De Winter was especially great at depicting the part of the new, innocent wife who initially must live in the shadow of the first Mrs. De Winter know as ""Rebecca."" Hitchcock does a great job of using the scenery, especially the symbol of the ocean in the film. My only complaints were that some scenes seemed drawn out or somewhat unnecessary, especially at the beginning, and there are a few instances of obviously fake old-school type acting (in one scene Maxim--Mr. De Winter--""punches"" someone and then there is no mark on the other fellow's face)."
Kdosda_Hegen,"Sep 7, 2020",5/10,"This film had such unlikable characters, much of the plot would have been entirely different if they communicated properly with each other... The plot of this film is interesting, but it doesn't have as strong of an ending as other Hitchcock's films. This film has many of the traits of his films, cameo, discussion ending, murder mystery, etc... Just in my opinion most other of his films were much better."
surfryder,"Aug 27, 2022",8/10,"Even while watching this classic in 2022, a good 82 years after the movie was released, Sir Hitchcock could get me engrossed into the groove all the way till end!With powerful portrayals, plot twists, subtle Hitchcockian nuances, and the almighty background score, it was a great watch even though you're psychologically biased by the towering presence of anything Hitchcock!What a great performance by Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson, who made the invisible protagonist Rebecca being felt inside the Mandalay. George Sanders in a short role was excellent. However, I found Sir Laurence's performance a bit subdued."
guisreis,"May 26, 2023",9/10,"One of the greatest movies by Hitchcock and the first he made in the United States, not surprisingly the one that have him his only Academy award for best picture (besides the Oscar for best cinematography, which is indeed very beautiful and impressive). The beginning seems an excellent romantic comedy, what is not usual in Hitchcock's filmography (although it may also be seen in great Lady Vanishes). Gorgeous Joan Fontaine is extremely charming in the role of the clumsy and insecure woman whose name is never mentioned, and she has a good chemistry with Lawrence Olivier as the leading couple. The story has well developed and interesting characters, such as her Mrs. De Winter, his Maxim, and others among whom I may highlight flamboyant Mrs. Van Hopper and creepy Mrs. Danvers. However, an unique element is the strong presence of another character who is indeed absent: the Rebecca from the title, previous Mrs. De Winter. Probably, this is the most striking presence of a character who is only mentioned in the whole history of cinema. After the aforementioned romantic comedy beginning set in Monte Carlo, the movie continues engaging but with a dramatic genre twist, moving to a strong drama and psychological thriller, set in the gargantuan mansion Manderley, in Cornwall. Expect plot twists in this nice script well worked in the brilliant direction of the master of suspense."
Jephy1,"Nov 16, 2022",10/10,"It is difficult to add, at this late date, to the many excellent reviews of this motion picture. The whole thing is a tour-de-force. Its characters and timing and plot-pace all capture one's interest and hold it until yet another Hitchcockian turn or surprise arises. I will add that as a period piece, today it is an informative and exciting eye into a long-gone era of style and class. Against this backdrop perhaps is much of the atmosphere that surrounds and makes the noir elements of the film and story most realistic and believable and attention-holding. The screenplay comes full-circle, and ends with all loose ends succinctly tied-up. Best Picture, 1940: well worth it!"
marcin_kukuczka,"Aug 18, 2013",9/10,"Charles Ramirez Berg, when discussing various landmarks of Hitchcock's films, pointed out that therein ""evil manifests itself not only in acts of violence but also in the form of psychological, institutionalized and systematic cruelty."" And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls ""facile and penetrating"" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin).The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story ""stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature"" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, ""allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres"" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to ""somewhat uncharacteristic works"" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie.(Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that ""it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama."" Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that ""cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again."" Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy.(Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, ""the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe."" Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that ""the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria."" But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement.It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, ""considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses"" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion.(Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as ""a second Mrs. De Winter"" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she ""emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca."" Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances.REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment."
willowgreen,"Feb 26, 2003",N/A,"A big, prestigious production from 194O. This movie had a lot going for it: a great gothic mystery best-seller by Daphne DuMaurier for its foundation, David O. Selznick as its producer, British director Alfred Hitchcock making his American directorial debut and actors perfectly suited to their roles: it really couldn't miss. And it didn't. Joan Fontaine was a most inspired choice for the shy, awkward, almost gauche young woman whose employer is a repulsive old society matron (played to the hilt by Florence Bates): she makes her mousey character charming and believable. As Max DeWinter, Olivier is sometimes surprisingly a bit wooden at times, but overall, he gives an effective portrayal as the tortured master of Manderley, the beautiful Cornish manor which is psychologically haunted by the memory of his first wife, Rebecca. A good example of the type of picture Hollywood seemingly can't make anymore, it is a masterpiece of the romantic mystery genre.  In the supporting cast, Judith Anderson stands out most notably as the very intimidating Mrs. Danvers, while George Sanders, Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce are fine in their varied roles. It is known that Olivier was displeased that his exquisite wife, Vivien Leigh didn't quite fit the role Fontaine coveted & he was unhappy during filming. The film won the AA for Best Picture of 194O: I feel that Joan Fontaine should have won for her effectively restrained portrayal of Mrs. DeWinter. Ginger Rogers won the AA for her badly dated portrayal of KITTY FOYLE instead. Pity."
acanacox,"Mar 25, 2023",3/10,"I kept seeing everywhere that this was top list for romance movies that belongs to Hitchcock but I don't see it. If anything this is closer to ""Suspicion"". A man who is thought of killing his wife, a very scared timid woman by his side. A rocky romance. But at the end it all turns out for everyone~ well exactly Danny.I really didn't get the gist of the this movie. A women who just keeps learning about the women ""Rebecca"" and that's basically it. She's tries to be a better woman for max but things seem to crumble anytime she tries her best. Danny though I feel is closer to the only thing that made this movie watchable. She's creepy, gothic, dark, stalker-y. Her cold grin, stare down, yea that's about it. Seems more obsessed with Rebecca and if this movie was made in todays world where rules and regulations and that pretty hays code wasn't obtained~ I would say Danny was infatuated with Rebecca to a point of loving her and wanting Rebecca for herself but things turned out differently for Rebecca.I did love George sanders, I love the way he talks and owns everything in the movie, very suave and dark.I feel the hermit/crazy dude next to the boat house I feel was unimportant really. The dog, sorry, you're cute but the point? To have the excuse to go down to the boathouse?I love Hitchcock movies a lot but this one didn't move me like his other wonderful movies such as ""Notorious"" ""spellbound"" ""north by northwest"" or even ""to catch a thief"".Unless I'm just not reading it at cinema devoted lovers view, but it shouldn't need to have such strain on your brain to appreciate and to find the hidden art in a movie which I feel I was trying to do here, I feel you have to dig really deep to find a reason to love this movie and I couldn't find it. #NotoriousAllTheWay."

dglink,"Apr 6, 2014",10/10,"""Last night I dreamed I went to Manderlay again..."" and so begins one of the most captivating films from Hollywood's golden era. A superb adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's best selling novel, ""Rebecca"" was Alfred Hitchcock's first American directorial assignment, although producer David O. Selznick's strong influence is evident. While lacking the color and historical spectacle of ""Gone with the Wind,"" Selznick's follow-up to his 1939 blockbuster shares lush production values, a thickly romantic atmosphere, and flawless performances with its illustrious predecessor. Both classics were adapted from popular novels, and both won Academy Awards for Best Picture.Du Maurier's well known mystery centers on a never-seen, but exquisitely beautiful and admired woman, Rebecca, who dies tragically before the story begins; however, she casts a dark shadow over her husband, his young second wife, and Manderlay, a stately seaside estate in Cornwall. The mystery-romance unfolds before George Barnes's Oscar-winning camera work, which emphasizes velvety blacks, window-cast shadows, and rainy reflections on a grandfather clock. Franz Waxman's lush score weaves its own web throughout the film with an appropriate mix of romantic themes and suspense.In front of the camera, Hitchcock drew memorable performances throughout. Sporting a mustache and a touch of grey, Laurence Olivier embodies the handsome Cornish aristocrat, Maxim de Winter; smooth, cultured, refined, and harboring a dark secret. With a voice born for sarcasm, George Sanders steals his scenes in a snide, cunning performance as Rebecca's ""favorite"" cousin. Mrs. Danvers ranks among cinema's most beloved villains, and Judith Anderson is cold, impassive, and riveting. Also called ""Danny"" in a sly allusion to her lesbian infatuation with the title character, Anderson excels in a restrained, yet hypnotic scene, where she fondles Rebecca's furs and caresses her lingerie; the actress says everything that the Production Code forbade about Danver's relationship with Rebecca. Florence Bates is another scene stealer as Mrs. Van Hopper, Joan Fontaine's employer; selfish, self absorbed, catty, and unforgettable. In support, Selznick sprinkled in such veterans as Gladys Cooper, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, and Leo G. Carroll to fill out an exceptional cast.Although easily overlooked among the bounty of rich performances and skilled thespians, Joan Fontaine's portrayal of the second Mrs. de Winter is exquisite throughout. Still in her early 20's, Fontaine's subtle growth from shy insecure travel companion, dominated by her overbearing employer, to self-assured supportive wife is masterful and never calls attention to itself; on a subsequent viewing, fans should focus on Fontaine throughout and marvel. While Fontaine grows as a woman, she also becomes closer to Olivier as the story unfolds; initially, Olivier kisses her chastely on the forehead, retains a distance between them, but, as the secrets spill, Olivier reaches out to her and, eventually, they kiss on the lips.Hitchcock's final image in ""Rebecca"" foreshadows that in ""Citizen Kane."" A silk pillow embroidered with an ""R"" is consumed by flames; a year later, Orson Welles ended his masterwork with a sled emblazoned ""Rosebud"" also engulfed in flames. Like the Welles classic, ""Rebecca"" is a timeless film that bears repetition. Despite familiarity with plot and ending, the film is like an old friend, and a return to Manderlay is always cozy, comfortable, and welcome."
loloandpete,"Jan 3, 2021",10/10,"One of the greatest page to stage adaptations and darn near faultless in every respect, it won a brace of hugely well deserved oscars in best picture and cinematography. The former obviously has a lot to do with the style and wit of the great Alfred Hitchcock, but also with it's producer, David O Selznick, who insisted on a faithful treatment of Daphne Du Maurier's novel. Hitchcock was often rather unfaithful to Source material and taking Du Maurier as an example this was sometimes a good thing (The Birds) and sometimes, a bad (Jamaica Inn). As to the cinematography, DOP George Barnes does a masterly job with moonlit images of the gothic Manderley and the rain reflected on the walls so they appear to be weeping, amongst many incredibly striking images. These are underscored and augmented hugely by Franz Waxman who provides an incredible music score and then there is the casting. Joan Fontaine from her opening voice over of the novel's first line, gives us a character who breaks our hearts and we empathise with her in every moment as a loveable, endearing and naive young women at the start to the strong, indomitable heroine at the end-what a journey and a masterclass of acting. Laurence Olivier is an aristocratic, brooding Maxim De Winter that partners Fontaine perfectly and the rest of the cast bats all the way down. Judith Anderson is one of the coldest and most intimidating characters on screen as Mrs Danvers and no one does a cad better than George Sanders as the oily but charismatic Jack Favell. Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce as the Laceys have brilliant chemistry together and bring immense warmth and humour to the film and Florence Bates is unforgettable as the dragon lady, Mrs Van Hopper, monstrous and hilarious. For my money this first American film of Hitchcock's is his greatest and indeed one of the very finest films ever made. In a word, perfection. Amongst it's thirteen academy award nominations that didn't win were Hitchcock, Waxman, Fontaine (who went on to win for Hitchcock's Suspicion, the following year), Olivier and Anderson. All would have been worthy winners."

They fall in love and get married soon thereafter. The De Winters take up residence in Maxim's family estate, Manderley. Mrs De Winter finds it hard to fit in. The presence of Maxim's deceased wife, Rebecca, seems to permeate through the house and Mrs De Winter can't shake the feeling that she is constantly being compared to her and that she is an interloper. Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's personal maid, also takes care to make things as uncomfortable as possible for the new Mrs De Winter. Mrs De Winter has the constant fear that memories of Rebecca will drive her and Maxim apart. Over time, she grows to know more and more about Rebecca...Brilliant psychological drama, based on a Daphne Du Maurier novel and directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Carries all of the Hitchcock trademarks - the slow-burning intensity, the mystery, the psychological games, the twists and the powerful conclusion.While the plot does develop slowly, especially in the early-to- middle section, this movie is by no means boring. More than engaging, it is a totally immersive experience. You see everything through Mrs De Winter's eyes, feeling her apprehension and fears and love for her husband.At a point, the plot takes off and then we have intrigue upon intrigue, with some great revelations and twists along the way. Powerful, profound ending.Excellent performances from Sir Laurence Olivier (though that's a given) and Joan Fontaine in the lead roles. Both received Oscar nominations, as did Judith Anderson for playing Mrs. Danvers. Hitchcock received his first (of five) Best Director Oscar nominations for this movie.The movie itself won the 1941 Best Picture Oscar, beating out, amongst others, another masterpiece - The Grapes of Wrath."

Anyway Selznick was honored in 1939 by a ton of Oscars including Best Picture of the Year. Not satisfied with thus honoring Mr. Selznick, Hollywood bestowed another Best Picture Oscar on him in 1940 for ""Rebecca."" The difference being that GWTW is/was truly a great film, while ""Rebecca"" was boring enough to put a hyper-active into a coma of ZZZ's.

grahamvr,"Oct 23, 2020",10/10,Hitchcock's film of REBECCA is an absolute masterpiece compared with the new Netflix Version. The new one is entertaining but lacks the mystery and suspense that only Hitchcock can deliver. The music score in his adds so much to the mystery of the story and the black and white cinematography is excellent. Hitchcock's burning of Mandalay closes a magnificent story by a great gothic writer.
anna_kouremenos,"Apr 15, 2007",10/10,"I saw this film after reading the book and it struck me because it is a truly wonderful adaptation. It is indeed the first of Hitchcock' masterpieces if one doesn't count his earlier British film ""The Lady Vanished"". One of the most memorable film characters ever is Ms. Denvers, the housekeeper who is still loyal to Rebecca. After watching this film, it is hard to forget about her extreme coldness and cruelty toward the young Mrs. DeWinter. Although this is not one of Hitchcock's most suspenseful films (most trained viewers can easily perceive how the story will turn out)it is one of his simplest and most emotional. Read the book first and then watch the film."
squill,"Feb 1, 2000",N/A,"Hitch's greatest achievement was not his cinematic techniques or his oft and justifiably praised films. Instead, that rotund jokester, pulled the wool over the eyes of the world in general and, more importantly, those of the pretentious cinema dandies who's voices resulted in prestigious awards, by serving up and having it accepted and lauded as the year's best ""oh so serious"" drama, a flaming, hilarious over-the-top melodramatic potboiler which wound up outdoing any '50's Lana Turner film, any '60's Jackie Susann novel, or any '90's Heather Locklear television vehicle.Blasphemy? I think not!While staying true to the novel's plot and storyline, Big Boy Al, and I must think this was intentional, lets his stars take their characters to the land beyond absurd while all other aspects of the filmmaking maintain dramatic normalcy. The result is pure genius. Joan's shy little ingénue is so cloying and whiny that you want to continually slap her, forget marry her. Florence Bates, as Joan's overbearing name-dropping employer, all but steals the movie's early scenes, as she bullies everyone in sight, delivering her lines in the slyly nastiest of manners. Enter Sir Larry (Maxim de Winter), the most foppish, arrogantly spoiled non-feeling idiot the aristocracy has ever produced, blatantly overdramatic and casually indifferent to everyone else who inhabits the world. His performance is ""fall-down funny"" brilliant, as he takes care to make absolutely sure that there is not a hint of chemistry between him and Joan, his future Mrs. de Winter.But it's not until Maxim and his new childlike bride return to the family estate, Manderly, that Hitch plays his trump card, Judith Anderson as the gloriously nasty and nuts (""is she a lesbian?"") housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who is still inhabiting, at least in her warped little mind, in a world lorded over by the FIRST Mrs. De Winter, the enigmatic and unseen Rebecca, whom she was simply ""devoted"" to, and who perished in a tragic boating accident near Manderly's shores. Miss Anderson turns in the comic performance of her or anyone else's lifetime - watch her eyes (Cloris Leachman owes ""Danny"" everything).So there is the setup. I strongly urge you, keeping in mind everything you've been privy to here, to sit back with a couple of friends and watch one of the finest comedies ever committed to film."
rollernerd,"Mar 28, 2021",5/10,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's Hitchcock movie review is the romance mystery Rebecca (1940), which apparently won the Academy Award for Best Film. I have no idea why. There are so many brilliant Hitchcock flicks that should have won best picture but this film is definitely not one of them. I wont go into full detail of the plot so a quick summary is that a shy insecure poor young woman played by Hitchcock alum Joan Fontaine meets rich widowed Max de Winter played by the Shakespearean elite Laurence Olivier. Both fall in love and they quickly get married. He then brings her to his huge English estate called Manderley and soon the new wife quickly finds out that Max can't seem to get over his first wife whose name was Rebecca - yup she dead. And theres this weird possible evil housekeeper Mrs. Danvers who loved the first wife, Rebecca - the one true Mrs. De Winter and doesn't want anyone to take her place. Interesting? It took me 4 or 5 times to get through this film. The funny thing is you do not know Fontaine's character who is the narrator in the beginning of the flick. The film is slow and mediocre and there are stale performances in particular from Olivier, I just couldn't see the engagement. Fontaine is the opposite, she is completely over-the-top especially when she yells out ""Maxim, Maximmmmm!!"" The chemistry between the two characters is horrible and awkward. The lady who plays Danvers does well in tormenting the new Mrs de Winter by showing her all the important things that belonged to the late Rebecca. But what really turned me off was the movie was wayyyy too slow and too long and some scenes felt repetitive especially when the flick takes small steps. Overall a letdown 5/10."
Spuzzlightyear,"Apr 7, 2006",8/10,"Rebecca is a very VERY densely layered drama about a newly married woman who discovers that the deceased former wife, Rebecca, still casts a VERY large shadow over the estate. While she figures out why everyone is so obsessed with Rebecca, we also find out that her husband, Mr. De Winter, also has some rather LARGE skeletons in his closet. This all leads up to a quite an awesome conclusion, where some layers are peeled off to find.. Well, more layers! This is quite an amazing little twisted tale. One of which I wasn't sure where on earth it was going, but after the De Winters get married and they move into Manderlay, the spectacular property which Mr De Winter lives on (and which Lars Von Trier named a dreadfully silly movie after) the movie then switches into high gear (and sometimes into camp, when Judith Anderson playing the wild house servant Mrs Danvers is around). Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier are gold here, and produce dynamite chemistry."
smatysia,"Sep 2, 2020",8/10,"An older film that has aged fairly well, thanks in no small part to director Alfred Hitchcock. I understand that it hews fairly closely to the book by Daphne du Maurier, but I have not read it. Outstanding acting from the leads, especially Joan Fontaine, whose character is forced to grow up quite suddenly, and Ms. Fontaine was able to emphasize this transformation through speech, expressions, and mannerisms. It may not be Hitchcock's best, but it is quite good nonetheless."

springfieldrental,"May 1, 2024",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock, Britain's most popular director, wanted to be a big fish in a huge pond known as Hollywood when he accepted studio owner and producer David O. Selznick's offer to work for him. His first American movie was March 1940 ""Rebecca,"" the only Academy Award Best Picture winner the 'master of Suspense' ever directed in his long and storied film career.Hitchcock enjoyed a quasi-independent free reign directing his British movies and expected the same under Selznick. He quickly learned differently. Assigned Daphne du Maurier's 1938 Gothic novel 'Rebecca,' Hitchcock, in his usual fashion, developed a script that deviated from the best seller Selznick had purchased the movie rights for $50,000. The director upped the suspense and chills of du Maurier's book which Selznick immediately rejected. ""I am shocked and disappointed beyond words..."" led Selznick's ten-page memo to Hitchcock after reading his script.As he had in England during filming, Hitchcock minimized his shot selection; he carefully edited ""in camera,"" controlling what clips would be splice together like a jigsaw puzzle in the editing room. Selznick, who was a frequent overseer in the editing process, was frustrated by Hitchcock's lack of multiple shots he could select from. In a rare move, the producer called in his wife to look at Hitchcock's footage, going so far as telling her he was thinking of canceling the production. After viewing a few reels, she thought the director's footage was excellent and he had nothing to worry about.Hitchcock continued to use psychological tricks on his actors he felt would maximize their performance. In ""Rebecca,"" wealthy George de Winter (Laurence Olivier) brings home his second wife, newlywed Mrs. De Winter (Joan Fontaine), who gets a cool reception from his household staff. Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), the housekeeper, is especially frosty towards her. George's first wife, the late Mrs. Rebecca de Winter, who had died under mysterious circumstances, was a favorite of the staff and notably to Mrs. Danvers. Selznick, impressed by actress Fontaine, 21, in 1939's ""The Women,"" sat next to her during a dinner party one evening and asked her to audition for the highly sought after part of the insecure new bride of George's. She passed with flying colors, displaying a unique fragility on the screen. Competition was fierce, with Margaret Sullivan reportedly the favorite. But Selznick had a different opinion, thinking ""Imagine Margaret Sullivan pushed around by Mrs. Danvers!"" Loretta Young and Joan's sister Olivia de Havilland were also high on the list. Olivier's soon-to-be wife Vivien Leigh auditioned, but didn't get it, causing a bitter Laurence to belittle Fontaine throughout the shoot, as he did with Merle Oberon in 1939's ""Wuhtering Heights."" Hitchcock compounded Fontaine's lack of confidence in her biggest role yet by pulling her aside early in the shoot and telling her the largely British cast thought little of the American actress playing an English lady. He added everyone felt her acting was inferior. His ploy worked; in almost every scene Fontaine's anxieties jump out, a performance Hitchcock was looking for and the Academy equally appreciated, awarding her a nomination for Best Actress.To play the relatively cold Mr. De Winter, Selznick felt Ronald Colman would have been perfect. Once he read the script, Colman realized this was newlywed Mrs. De Winter's picture and he would be second fiddle. On the basis of Olivier's performance in 1939's ""Wuthering Heights,"" whose female fans were left swooning, Selznick casted him. Many critics found actress Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers stealing the show. Film reviewer Ed Howard observed, ""Anderson gives a wonderfully fiendish performance as the gaunt, sinister housekeeper, always lurking around and padding quietly through the mansion to surprise the lady of the house at inopportune moments."" Hitchcock rarely shows her walking into a scene. Like a ghost, she consistently pops into frame, scaring the wits out of Mrs. De Winter. The Australian Anderson, 43, specialized in stage acting, and was in her only second credited feature film as the evil-eyed Mrs. Danvers, earning her only Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She holds the rare distinction of winning two Emmys, a Tony and a nomination for both the Grammys and the Academy Awards.Even though the director dismissed ""Rebecca"" as ""not a Hitchcock picture,"" largely because of its lack of dark humor and Selznick's strict rules of sticking to a script which closely followed the book, film critic Chuck Bowen saw the movie as a learning curve in Hitchcock's auteurism. ""In his early British thrillers, Hitchcock used German expressionist tricks to conjure notions of evil and dread,"" Bowen notes. ""After Rebecca, Hitchcock would infuse such dread in bourgeoisie comedies of manners, occasionally springing formalist tricks to highlight key emotional shifts.""""Rebecca,"" the third highest box office movie in 1940, earned eleven Academy Awards nominations. Besides the Best Picture Oscar, George Barnes won for Black and White Cinematography. Hitchcock garnered his first of five Best Director nominations (he never won an earned Oscar), while nominees were Oliver (Best Actor), Fontaine (Best Actress), Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Special Effects, and Franz Waxman for his Best Original Score. The American Film Institute ranks the drama as the 80th Most Thrilling Movie while Mrs. Danvers earned its #31 Most Villainous Movie Character. The Guardian British newspaper said it was ""one of Hitchcock's creepiest, most oppressive films."" The motion picture is included as one of the '1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.'"
jared-25331,"Oct 7, 2024",10/10,"So I just got done watching Rebecca (1940), Alfred Hitchcock's first movie in America, for the first time ever and it was fantastic.Positives for Rebecca (1940):
The main thing that makes this movie work perfectly is the atmosphere. Throughout the runtime, I was having this uneasy feeling watching the movie because I knew something was going to happen by the end of the movie. It goes without saying that Alfred Hitchcock's direction and execution I this movie is masterfully done. This man knew how to pull in his auidence's attention with these movies and it works almost every single time. The performances from the entire cast are phenomenal, which isn't surprising given that again this movie was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. And finally, the ending of this movie is one of the most tragic and shocking things I've seen in any old school black-and-white movie.Overall, Rebecca (1940) was a brilliant introduction to Alfred Hitchcock for the American auidences and this movie was only beginning of something special for us Americans."

eibon09,"Oct 31, 2001",N/A,"Atypical of the films Alfred Hitchcock usually did in his career, this David O. Selznick produced feature is the only film to win an Oscar(Best Picture). Like for the majority of his lifetime, Alfred Hitchcock was snubed by the Academy Awards for the Best Director award.  Ironic that Hitchcock is considered the top level of technical filmmaking and yet he was unable to win a Best Director Oscar.  This shows that the Oscars really reward for the most part the mediocre when it comes to chosing Best Picture and Best director.  This was the producer's second feature that came right after his hugely popular but highly overrated feature film, Gone with the Wind(1939). Rebecca(1940) still is a very good film from Hitchcock that has some wonderful touches of gothic atmosphere.Lawrence Oliver is his usuall excellent form for the role of the mysterious Maximillian de Winter.  Judith Anderson gives a memorable supporting performance in a AH film as the meancing housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. Although not completely a Hitchcock motion picture there are still touches of the master of suspense that crop up here and there in the plot.  The image of the house burning with Mrs. Danvers in it is a classic image in 1940s American film.  Alfred Hitchcock redid the story in a way as the Cary Grant-Joan Fontaine film, Suspicion(1943).  Well adapted feature of a novel by a writer who the director would revisit in The Birds(1963)."
shanie25350,"Sep 29, 2021",5/10,"Okay, but overlong and overrated. Lovely cinematography. Great score. I liked Joan Fontaine as Mrs. De Winter and Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers, but did not care for Laurence Oliver's performance as Maxim de Winter at all. I never realized how horribly he mumbled until I saw Rebecca and, after seeing it, couldn't believe he was considered one of the most acclaimed actors of the 20th century. You really need subtitles/closed captioning to understand him in this film. I found Olivier nearly impossible to understand without subtitles--and not necessarily because of his accent, but because he constantly mumbles, merges words together, and is basically incoherent except when he's angry and shouting. Plus, he's totally detached and unemotional and speaks too fast in a cold tone even in the scenes where he's supposed to be falling in love with Joan Fontaine's character. Olivier's performance was very disappointing, and I think just about any other major leading man of that era could have played the role of Maxim de Winter better than he did. At least they would have been more coherent.I give this film 5 stars for the cinematography and gothic atmosphere, but it's not one of Hitchcock's best."
hmpulham,"Dec 10, 2005",9/10,"We know that Mrs. Danvers was in love with Rebecca, the question is was Rebecca involved sexually with Mrs. Danvers? Hitchcock made pointed references to the fact the Rebecca was often a cold and sexually unresponsive wife . There is the assumption that Rebecca was at least bi-sexual. To really appreciate the subtlety of this film it helps to factor in this possible relationship between the women. Hitchcock working under the censorship code of the time could only hint at it. However, with this in mind, one doesn't have to look hard to connectthe dots. Rebecca is wonderful story telling with a first rate cast and is beautifully photographed. One of the classics from Hollywood's golden age."
vvva,"Jul 14, 2000",8/10,"This definitely was a great picture, one of the 100 best ever but in the middle gets a bit boring and the end is quickly rapped up and the viewer sort of loses interest in the movie by the end. Everyone, especially Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson give excellent performances. The idea of never showing Rebecca was ingenious as well not giving the new wife a name. Watch the movie, because it really is a classic though."
kel_har,"Nov 30, 2001",9/10,"A wealthy man's second wife becomes ""haunted"" by his first wife in Hitchcock's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel.  I recorded this off of cable a couple of months ago and finally watched it this week.  Olivier and Fontaine were great (however, their characters were somewhat ""unusual""), but Judith Anderson stands out in her eerie performance of Mrs. Danvers.  If you're a fan of  Hitchcock or enjoy classics, then I recommend this."
telegonus,"Dec 2, 2002",9/10,"Rebecca is a gorgeously mounted, opulent filming of Daphne du Maurier's runaway best-seller, and is at its core a Gothic romance of a high (but not that high) order. Joan Fontaine plays the unnamed, callow young woman who fulfills what seems to be every woman's dream, which is marrying a brooding, handsome English aristocrat. As her husband, Laurence Olivier glowers nobly, and while I wouldn't say that he throws away his lines, he does give the impression that he's better than his material he's given to work with, as indeed he is.Director Alfred Hitchcock, whose first American picture this was, is quite conservative in his approach, as this movie really ""belongs"" to producer David O. Selznick, who all but buried poor Hitch with his famous memos as to how he felt the film should be made. Given Selznick's exquisite taste, and the way the movie came out, his instincts were probably correct.The movie contains a secret, and here it departs considerably from the novel. I won't give it away, yet it's worth mentioning that the movie takes a turn toward the end that's such so astounding and unexpected that it actually works, making the picture surprisingly satisfying almost in spite of itself. Selznick was right after all."
davidmvining,"Jun 29, 2020",10/10,"So, Alfred Hitchcock traded an out of control actor/producer in Charles Laughton for just an out of control producer in David O. Selznick. That honestly feels like a step in the right direction. Instead of having an egomaniac try to dictate Hitchcock's own movie to him on set, he only had the egomaniac on the phone and in the editing booth. Reading about Hitchcock up to this point in the timeline of his filmography, this is the first time I've seen his editing in the camera technique mentioned where he only shot exactly what he needed to edit together. So, he didn't have entire scenes playing out across multiple takes, instead he shot what he needed from a particular actor in an exchange at a particular angle and stopped filming. I have to imagine that this was a technique that he developed while working in the studio system in Britain where he had to be as economical as possible. It had the added advantage of preventing Selznick from completely remaking the film in the editing bay. So, despite the stories of how much Selznick wanted to mess with the film, Hitchcock made the film in a way that only minimal messing could happen.Anyway, the film is based on another Daphne du Maurier novel after Hitchcock adapted her Jamaica Inn as his last British picture. This is apparently a much more faithful adaptation of du Maurier's work than the previous film. A young woman is attending Ms. Van Hopper as a paid companion in Monte Carlo when the pair meet the mysterious and very wealthy Maxim de Winter. Ms. Van Hopper, a rather tiresome socialite well past her prime, desperately tries to latch onto Maxim, but the young attendant effortlessly falls into his arms romantically, and the romance blossoms into a quick marriage. The real joy of Ms. Van Hopper is how she quickly morphs from a tiresome bother into a woman of experience as she tells the new Mrs. de Winter that she's entering a world that she does not understand.At Mr. de Winter's residence in Cornwall, Manderley, a gothic mansion on the coast of England, the new Mrs. de Winter meets the house's staff, in particular Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper. This is where it becomes apparent that this is a ghost story. The former Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, is mentioned in almost every scene. Everyone seems haunted by the mysterious presence of her a year after her disappearance and death, but her former presence affects different people in different ways.Maxim can't bear to hear her name or be reminded of her, and he won't talk about her, leaving his feelings a mystery. Mrs. Danvers, on the other hand, treats Rebecca's name with the utmost reverence. When the new Mrs. de Winter finds her way into Rebecca's old room, Mrs. Danvers touches Rebecca's things like they are holy objects, her brush and pillow case (embroidered with an R) in particular. Mrs. Danvers goes so far as to encourage the new Mrs. de Winter to wear a dress that Rebecca wore to a dress up party a year before in an effort to drive a wedge between her and Maxim.Eventually, Maxim reveals the true past of his relationship to Rebecca and his role in her disappearance to his new bride, a terrible secret that weighs on him heavily and could turn into serious consequences if found out by the right people such as the local sheriff or George Sanders, Rebecca's cousin and lover.What sets this movie apart from everything Hitchcock made up to this point is the maturity. From the basic approach to actors and their performances to framing and to emotion, Rebecca doesn't feel like the work of a man who's most successful movies have been adventure yarns about shadowy organizations doing shadowy things for shadowy reasons. This is a character drama that uses Hitchcock's entire array of technical skills and also manages to fit in thematically while finding places for his telltale sense of suspense. The way the truth gets doled out steadily over time, with questions lingering about motive and desire for main characters with the new Mrs. de Winter as our point of view into this strange little world, is all about building suspense towards the central questions at hand (something that honestly, despite my defense of the film, should have been in Jamaica Inn).The only thing that I have some small reticence over is the final fifteen minutes or so of the film when everything gets revealed. For what it is, a series of reveals that the movie actually did build up towards, it works and has a certain appeal, but it feels more banal than the more Romantic and Gothic film that had preceded it. Again, it's not a bad series of reveals, it just doesn't feel like it quite fits. The final images of the film, though, do fit wonderfully well as the ghost of Rebecca burns away in visual metaphor.This is a sort of greatness that Hitchcock, up to this point, hadn't really been working towards. The films that were meant to be taken more seriously, like Juno and the Paycock and The Skin Game felt as much like quick solutions to the question of talkies from a producer perspective than anything else, and, while The Skin Game is a successful film, it always felt limited visually (due to a few outside reasons Hitchcock had no control over). Working from novels, with greater inherent scope than stage plays, feels like a more natural fit for film in general, and Hitchcock fills the frame really well to fit the story. So, despite some lingering, limited questions of authorship between Hitchcock and Selznick, this does represent a reinvigorated Hitchcock in his new Hollywood home."
whpratt1,"Feb 29, 2004",10/10,"Have not viewed this film in many years, however, when ever I need to see a great Classic Film with great Actors and a director like Alfred Hitchcock, I can really appreciate the great films from the past and the great gift Hollywood has given.  George Sanders(Jack Favell),""The Lodger"",'44 plays a horrible blackmailer, who is very hateful and tries very hard to destroy Laurence Olivier(Maxim 'de Winter),""The Jigsaw Man"",'83, and claims that he murdered his first wife. Judith Anderson(Mrs. Danvers),""The Red House"",'47, supports Jack Favell in his efforts to break up the marriage of Maxim'de Winter and rid him of the beautiful Mansion that he lives in. Judith Anderson was a great actress and played very evil and cruel roles through out her career and was given the highest award that England could present to an actress, naming her DAME in 1959.  If you look close enough, you will see Nigel Bruce(Maj.Giles Lacy),""Sherlock Holmes & the Spider Woman"",'44,who played a great supporting role.  He was Dr. Watson in the 1940's Sherlock Holmes series.   Alfred Hitchcock made this film into a masterpiece of fine acting,with great perfection, he even produced in later years a great horror picture, ""Psycho"", which cannot compare to ""Rebecca"", but  the film brought in a great deal more MONEY!"
Red_Identity,"Jun 8, 2014",N/A,"I'd actually heard quite a lot of great things about this. To my surprise, I found it just adequate. It's not bad and it's definitely intriguing to an extent, but the story doesn't offer much in terms of great material. The two leads are decent, but it's really Judith Anderson who shines here. Such a wicked role played with such chilling restraint, it's definitely the best performance in the film and it holds up quite nicely today. The twist near the end is somewhat justified (both of them, since it can be said there's two) but the actual ending doesn't do anything special. This is probably one of Hitchcock's weakest that I've seen."

drownsoda90,"May 22, 2015",10/10,"Joan Fontaine plays a self-conscious working class woman who falls in love with and marries a wealthy high society man (Laurence Olivier) and moves with him to his sprawling ancestral estate. She is met with bizarre reception from his friends, as well as his mysterious housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) and finds herself haunted by the ceaseless memory of his first wife who died in a bizarre accident outside the property.Probably Alfred Hitchcock's most Gothic work, ""Rebecca"" is a phenomenal and faithful adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's classic novel; the film itself has deservedly earned its place in the film canon, much as the source novel has in the literary realm. The plain truth is that ""Rebecca"" is an all-around masterwork. It's easy to forget that this is a Hitchcock film, which is maybe what makes it such an interesting piece of his filmography— while the film has Hitchcockian colorings, it is quite possibly the least ""Hitchcockian"" of all his films, leaning more as an ode to Gothicism than any of Hitch's signature quirks.Predating the aesthetics of Jack Clayton's ""The Innocents"", Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"", and Lewis Allen's ""The Uninvited"", ""Rebecca"" is the paramount of spooky mansion films, which is interesting because it really isn't a spooky mansion film at all (yet another paradox). It is not at all a ghost film, though the presence of the eponymous Rebecca haunts every frame just as much as the memory of her torments the leading lady. Fontaine's character is reminded of, compared to, and prodded with the memory of Rebecca at every turn, and the film's shadowy photography of the expansive manor's interiors provide a landscape in which the omnipresent former wife can possibly lurk. Ominous and portentous warnings from the bizarre housekeeper only accentuate the feeling that Rebecca may be lurking in any corner, be it in human or spirit form.As a partial result, the terror that is central to the film is very much psychological; if anything, I'd categorize the film as a psychological thriller, though the thrills are fairly light, especially by today's standards. Tour-de-force performances from Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier especially boost the overall impact, with Fontaine believably embodying a woman who finds herself in a new life that is haunted by her predecessor, and Olivier is quietly menacing yet charming and suave. Judith Anderson's legendary performance as the cryptic Mrs. Danvers is also key here, adding a necessary unnerving sensibility as she invokes Rebecca more forthrightly and disturbingly than any other character. Unlike so many films of the era, the performance here are truly timeless.I would say that this is one of Hitchcock's greatest films, but the truth is that it's just a great film, period. It is dissimilar in tone from what the director is most celebrated for, and for that reason is easily separated from his stylistics, though very much an important hallmark in his career. ""Rebecca"" is an understated masterpiece of Gothic horror that looms over the genre just as ubiquitously as our titular invisible monster. 10/10."
enmussak,"Dec 15, 2002",9/10,"During the first 30 minutes of this movie, you can either get frustrated or patiently wait for something to happen.  Because I have infinite respect for Hitchcock, I knew that his choices were carefully planned and that the film would pick up sooner or later.  Of course, it did.  The end of the film was very gripping, but in order to get to that point Hitchcock spent considerable time developing the situation and character interactions within Mandalay.  Looking back on it, the last half of the film wouldn't have been as effective if he hadn't.For the haters of this film, probably those who are used to the pacing of North by Northwest of Rear Window, they likely found the slow pace unbearable.  The film finished with power, but only for the patient."

Mrs. Danvers, the creepy caretaker, keeping Rebecca's flame burning and Maxim DeWinter, forever tortured by the secret of Rebecca's death.

levybob,"Feb 27, 2024",3/10,"(This film has been restored and, as of Feb. 2024, is available on TCM On Demand)'Rebecca' is not good Hitchcock. From the novel by Daphne DuMaurier it is a tale told slowly and dreamily, when it ought to be crisp and biting. Joan Fontaine is quite good as our heroine who, for some reason, falls head over heels for the depressed and narcissistic widowed British millionaire played in over-the-top fashion by Lawrence Olivier. What befalls her after they wed makes up most of the story.The story, like many theatrical pieces, is presented in Three Acts.In Act One the couple meet cutely in Provence, Southern France. There is a comedic flavor to this part of the film, entirely at odds with the rest. I'm not sure if the film might not have been better off without this 'prelude' to the real action of Acts Two and Three.In Two, the new bride returns to England with her husband only to find herself overwhelmed by the size of his estate and by its house-mistress (Judith Anderson). Here the film slows to a snail's pace. The one saving grace, the appearance of George Sanders as a slimy evil-doer who had some sort of relationship with Olivier's now dead wife. But overall the acting is over-wrought, especially that of Ms. Anderson, a house-keeper so evil, so clearly deranged, no one would keep her in their employ. Act Two is by far the longest chapter, and least entertaining.As Act Three opens we discover a secret. And it is that secret which will serve as the catalyst for what drives the rest of the film. It introduces what little suspense the film has to offer. Which, if like me you are a fan of Hitchcock, should tell you all you need to know. Little suspense? From Hitchcock? Ok. I'll pass.But I didn't. Whatever the reason this was the one Hitchcock I'd never seen even once (I've seen the rest many times, even the silent era's), and so I stayed with it all the way to its disturbingly awkward final scene.That done, I finished my drink, went up to bed, and resolved never to sit through a bad film again. Or, until the next time."

The spirit flows in the house and seems to live with the members of that house, and Danvers and the servant show the clothes of the slave.

The character who was his servant and subordinate until he met and married Mr. Duwinter, now feels that he has stepped into another world because of the conditions in It has become accustomed and thinks that it has to do its own work.After a while, a certain feeling is created inside her. And she sees herself worse than the position she was in before. Therefore, determined, she introduces herself as Mrs. DeWinter and her position is established, although at first He doesn't believe this, and when the phone rings from inside the building, he says that Mrs. Duwinter has been dead for a year. In fact, he has doubts and cannot believe himself, to believe that he is in another place. .

But a few hours later from my most recent rewatch - I've reversed my usual cynicism and found a few rather nice things about this one too.For one, Joan Fontaine is brilliant. She makes the character a bit tearier than in the book - but she's such a charismatic, beautiful performer. I thought she nailed it. And Laurence Olivier is not bad as Maxim! I'm usually not a fan of his, but I quite like his performance in this.And George Sanders appears as Jack Favell, absolutely nothing like the character he's based on whatsoever. He does his trademark George Sanders performance instead. But you know what they say about ""if it ain't broke"".

The setting is brilliant, and the scene where you see Maxim distantly solitarly on the precipice is breathtaking. Well done, Hitchcock!Joan Fontaine was perfect for the role of the anonymous girl which is in total admiration and awe of the sophisticated gentleman Maxim de Winter (don't get me started on Laurence Olivier; he is GORGEOUS!!) and is swiftly married, much to the annoyance of Mrs Van Hopper, Fontaine's atrocious employer.Once back at the beautiful, castle-like Manderly; Fontaine (much to her tense and shy naiviety) is waited on hand-and-foot in royal manner as the mistress of Manderly. Maxim's manner cools and sharpens towards her, and she discovers that this is due to the mysterious death of the previous Mrs De Winter (Rebecca) whom people will say nothing about.Gradually, in true Hitchcock style, the mystery unfolds; and as it does so almost kills you with suspense. There is only one other talent to rival Fontaine, and that is none other than Judith Anderson as the evil Mrs Danvers... she freaks you out completely. My favourite scene is in the bedroom after the ball... Fontaine is beautifully tearful and tormented (fantastic actress, why have I never heard of her before???) and Anderson as Mrs Danvers is cruelly manipulative and wow, she is scary.Much as I adore and admire the greatest actor of all time, I think perhaps Larry (I HATE this term) hams up some of his scenes of personal torment, but for the rest of time the chemistry between him and Fontaine is lovely.So, here's the summary: Olivier is handsome and brooding, Anderson is evil, evil, evil; but Fontaine beats them all with her beautiful, poignant performance. A true masterpiece. A MUST SEE!!!"
adamjohns-42575,"Sep 19, 2022",5/10,"Rebecca (1940) (Larry Olivier) -This might have been the best I've ever seen from Larry. He was far more natural, somewhat debonair and suave and actually quite handsome. Similar in his delivery to Colin Firth and Hugh Grant if I had to make modern comparisons.His character, De Winter, was a bit of a bastard right from the start though, with quite chauvinistic ideals to say the least. A bit of a tyrant and with a temper, it's hard to see what the appeal was apart from his face and money. I could understand his depression, his mourning and ""Other"" issues, but he was really quite unnecessarily horrible to his poor new wifey.He was never very complimentary about the woman that he supposedly loved and treated her like a second class citizen, which was probably a reflection of the time in which Du Maurier wrote the original book and may be a comment, on her part, about the way the world was unequal.Initially I did find that it was definitely a whirlwind romance, as these older films and stories so often were and because of that it did seem a stretch to believe, especially when they returned to Mandalay and his treatment of her was not the kindest.A relationship where the previous partner is still present in the new one is always difficult, but this was just obscure, like some sort of ghost worshipping cult, especially old lady Danvers who was obsessive.You could almost imagine that Danvers was a disgruntled former wife or THE first Mrs De Winter (Only pretending to be dead) in a disguise, because of the way that she behaved.In a strange way I felt that there were similarities in the story to 'Beauty And The Beast' (1991), except that Angela Lansbury's, Mrs Potts wasn't such a frightening old hag and Belle had a bit more going for her. That and I've never fancied the beast, even in human form, like I was shocked to find that I did with Larry in this one, having been so appalled by him in 'Spartacus' (1960) and 'The Prince And The Showgirl' (1957).I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film actually, although I think for the most part that was due to the story itself. I liked the twists and turns that occurred as part of what I would call act two. Some things I had never expected or even considered, so in that respect it was very clever.I'd be tempted to watch the updated version with Armie Hammer as long as he doesn't eat anyone, as he is alleged to do.479.06/1000."
RM851222,"May 13, 2018",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Rebecca"" (1940) was highly entertaining movie for me. I didn't expect it to be so involved into this story which was more and more unpredictable, plausible and simply interesting to watch. And here is a great craftsmanship from this movie from a legendary director - is superbly paced (at running time 2 hours it never dragged), it was flawlessly acted by all three leads and writing was great.Overall, while ""Rebecca"" (1940) is not a masterpiece from ""that era"", its simply a great movie. Its highly involving and superbly made. Great movie."
frankde-jong,"Jun 24, 2020",9/10,"""Rebecca"" was the first American film of Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock still had to get used to the division of labor between the director and the producer in Hollywood, especially when the producer had the name of David Selznick.""Rebecca"" is based on a novel by Daphne Du Maurier. Two more Hitchcock films were based on the work of this writer: ""Jamaica Inn"" (1939) and ""The birds"" (1963).In ""Rebecca"" a young woman is compared to a dead woman so often that it almost seems one is trying to reshape her after the image of the dead woman. This is also the theme of ""Vertigo"" (1958, Alfred Hitchcock). In Verigo it is a man who tries to reshape the woman, and so Vertigo is a psychological film with sexual undertones.In ""Rebecca"" the adoration of the dead woman comes from a woman (the housekeeper Mrs Danvers played by Judith Anderson).
Mrs Danvers moves around the house in complete silence and in so doing resembles a ghost. In the final scene Mrs Danvers shares the fate of the house she has been serving in for so long. Judith Anderson maybe a less known actress than Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier (the two stars of this film), in my opinion it is her performance that gives the film its gothic horror like mood."
reformasauric,"Dec 13, 2020",8/10,"Rebecca's presence in this movie is extremely overwhelming, which is a great techincal achievement. The movie doesn't even need that much to keep itself afloat, and in fact, the murder mistery doesn't really add that much. I think it could've delved into a moral dilemma, and maybe even put the woman's character in Rebecca's side after all, but in the end the way it's handled is also great."
shafatqadri,"Mar 12, 2008",8/10,"Long discussed as the first film Alfred Hitchcock made in Hollywood as well as the beginning of the legendary conflict between Selznick and Hitchcock. Producer David Selznick had just had a great movie the previous year (Gone with the Wind, 1939) and signed on Alfred Hitchcock for the first Hollywood movie by Hitchcock (his earlier movies were all British). What is less known is that in the entire fabulous career of Alfred Hitchcock, Rebecca was the only movie that won him a Best Picture award. And that too in the year 1940, when competition was fierce with the movie, 'Grapes of Wrath', 'The Great Dictator', and 'The Philadelphia Story'.With an outstanding cast and perfect control of the actors, Hitchcock, who resisted the domination of Selznick in his projects, manages to weave out of Daphne Du Maurier's novel, a Hitchcock psychological thriller. Somewhat against Hitchcock's intent, the story indeed is fairly true to the novel, with a few exceptions necessary to satisfy American censor boards.The movie opens with waves crashing against rocks and a narrative by the protagonist, who will never be given a first name, only Mrs De Winter as the plot unfolds. We meet for the first time the silent but dominant character of the estate of Manderley, the ancestral home of Mr. DeWinter. It is a stunning edifice and more than a little imposing.Flashback to the beginning of the story, to Monte Carlo. A young woman who is a paid companion to an overbearing pompous society matron sees a man brooding, overlooking the cliff. She yells 'stop' thinking him about to jump. Irritably he sends her off.....How the movie unfolds you got to see that yourself. The movie was a great success both critically and financially. It got a total of 11 nominations and won 2 awards: Best Picture and Best Cinematography.As a Hitchcock flick, it shows what the master could do with a few extra bucks in his pocket. With a budget that Hitchcock could only dream about in England, the production values show an exponential improvement which include stage sets, lighting conditions, extensive screen tests, and costuming, to create an environment where the film will live.For Selznick, it was the second monumentally successful film in a row. For Hitchcock, it was the beginning of the love affair that American audiences have for Hitchcock films."
jbuck_919,"Jun 6, 2002",N/A,"I'm told that Hitchcock actually only put the finishing touches on this, but I don't care.  It is a devastatingly perfect realization of a great story. In case you didn't know, in the novel, Maxim is actually guilty but gets away with it.  Whether it was Hitch or someone else who made the decision, giving Maxim a legal excuse for Rebecca's death and then never making it come out at the inquest anyway was a triumph of intelligent script writing.I've seen this so many times I can remember practically every line.  Here is not a line, but a bit of acting:  Joan Fontaine suddenly becoming a mature mistress of the house after she hears the whole story from Maxim.  Glorious acting and direction. Heavens!Judith Anderson in a role so epic that it was commented on facetiously in other films (watch Abbott and Costello's charmingly comic ""The Time of Their Lives"").  The complexity of the marriage which is still dominated by love and so well portrayed.  The end where you never do figure out how the second Mrs. DeWinter got out of the burning house and don't care.  One of the greatest movies of all time."
ajrabbits,"Jul 29, 2002",9/10,This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and still be amazed and entertained.  There is not one bad scene nor one bad actor in it. The cinematography is exquisite and the locations are breathtaking.  Rent this movie...or even better...buy this movie!  You will watch it many times over and will definitely get the worth out of every buck you spent on it!
johno-21,"Feb 28, 2006",9/10,"""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again."" So begins the Daphne de Maurier novel and so begins this film wonderfully adapted from it by Phillip MacDonald and brought to life by Director Alfred Hitchcock of the strange days of the life of the second Mrs. de Winter. Despite what it says here on IMDb about Hitchcock winning an Oscar for Best Director for this film he did not. John Ford won for Grapes of Wrath. Hitchcock was nominated five times including for Rebecca but amazingly he never won a Best Director.This did win the Best Picture for 1940 which of course is the big award to win but it was otherwise shutout from it's 11 nominations. This is a fine film with a great cast of Joan Fontaine as the 2nd Mrs. de Winter along with leading man Laurence Olivier as her husband and Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. The film's title character Rebecca, the first Mrs. de Winters never appears in the movie except in a portrait. George Sanders, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny and Leo G. Carroll round out the fine cast. David O. Selznick showed with this film a preview of what great films would come from his studio in the 1940's following his monster hit the year before of Gone With The Wind and Hitchcock with this gave all a preview of what was to come from him. This is a beautifully done film and like the novel is now a classic. It's not as suspenseful as other Hitchcock films to come. It's sweeping landscapes and large interiors has the signature look of a Selznik produced film. I've seen this film several times and would rate it a 9.5 on a scale of 10 and highly recommend it."
mossgrymk,"Mar 1, 2024",8/10,"Hitch's only film to win a best picture Oscar is, not surprisingly when you consider the Academy, far from his best. It falls considerably short of such later, more twisted tales like ""Shadow"", ""Notorious"", ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"", but it is, along with ""North By Northwest"", his most entertaining. It is the mother of all Lady In Distress In Creepy House pics and features the magnificently homo erotic Mrs. Danvers, played to perfection by Judith Anderson. The scene where she shows the new Mrs. De Winter around Manderley and, in the process, fondles the title character's underwear shows just how much kink you could slip by the Hays Office boys if you clothed it in Gothic. And speaking of the title character, the fact that she emerges as the most vividly drawn personage in the film, without once appearing in the flesh onscreen, not even in portraiture, is a testament to the director's elegant, cinematic inventiveness and the excellence of Robert Sherwood and Joan Harrison's adaptation of Daphne's Du Maurier's novel. My only criticism is that the movie is a half hour too long and starts to lose its energy right around the too long, expositional scene in the boathouse. And the trial scene is ok, at best, especially following the splendid miseries of Manderley. B plus."
Loring,"Aug 18, 2002",9/10,"OK, so Joan Fontaine overemotes a bit.  But Olivier is excellent in his effort to act the carefree playboy haunted by his first wife, as is the spectacular supporting cast, the cream of British character acting of the 30's and 40's.  George Sanders plays the part George Sanders always plays (and it is irrelevant whether he is the good guy, as in the Falcon series, or the bad guy, as in most of his other films) and does it better than anyone else can.  Judith Anderson makes your blood curdle while she is being ever so proper and polite.  And then there is the first Mrs. De Winter -- ah, she is the scariest of all to poor, suffering Joan.  A simple but brilliant story by du Maurier directed masterfully by Hitchcock.  A horror movie where all the horror is in your mind, but then, aren't those the best kind?"
