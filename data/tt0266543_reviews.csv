kylopod,"Oct 15, 2005",9/10,"I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"" to DreamWorks films like ""Shrek."" But ""Finding Nemo"" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the ""Toy Story"" movies and in ""Monsters Inc.,"" but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.Humor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in ""Finding Nemo,"" as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I'm sure Gary Larson of ""Far Side"" fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what's going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you'll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.The story employs the same basic formula used in ""Toy Story,"" in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.Of course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, ""Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat."" That's perhaps the film's most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it."
Coventry,"Dec 10, 2003",8/10,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart."
lhseaglerunner,"Jun 5, 2003",9/10,"Remember back when you were little.you know, back when tall to you was about as high as a mailbox? In those days, Disney animated films (e.g. `Lion King' and `Beauty and the Beast') were some of the coolest things out there and were movies to watch over and over (much to your parents' chagrin). Now, animated movies aren't exactly the `coolest' things to see, but an exception can be made for the uber-hip Pixar movies, the most recent of which being `Finding Nemo'.After losing all but one of his brood, Marlin (Albert Brooks) an over-protective clown fish that strangely lacks a sense of humor, has resolved to protect his one (slightly disabled) `child' remaining, Nemo (Alexander Gould). But disaster strikes as Nemo is taken by a Sydney dentist and plopped into a fish tank where he is comforted by a host of other captive fish (William Dafoe, Vicki Lewis, Allison Janney, et al). But back in the big ocean Down Under, Marlin has resolved to search out his one remaining progeny.Along the way on his quest, Marlin acquires a tag-along `friend', Dory (Ellen DeGeneres)-a fish with, well, the memory capacity of a fish. The two must surmount hurdles like a group of sharks (Eric Bana, Barry Humphries and Bruce Spence) that have (mostly) sworn off eating other fish, a nasty swarm of jellyfish, a bird-brained flock of seagulls, and others.This is the bridge! Well, in a way. Back when I was younger, one of my favorite films was `The Incredible Mr. Limpet', which, for the uninitiated, combined live-action with under-the-sea fish animation. What Pixar has done here was bring back that film to my mind and start me thinking, because they have created a wondrous undersea environment (with `normal-looking' fish instead of 1960s animated fish).My favorite feature in this movie chock-full of sweet treats must be the sharks. I have always been partial to the shark family, but what has been done in creating three humorous sharks (what a movie concept), just sent paroxysms of laughter through me. Another thing that (mostly) works is Ellen DeGeneres' fish (character?) that provides a fairly constant source of laughter with her antics (although a couple gags do wear on the viewer with time). On the whole though, there is not a single bit of shoddy voice-acting or animation in it.Compared to `Monsters Inc.', `Finding Nemo' is something of a revival for Pixar. I like how they have stepped up their efforts to make an altogether pleasing film without any big flaws. The thing that I did not like with `Monsters' was the inclusion of a single key (but EXTREMELY annoying) character. Director Andrew Stanton has done an excellent job at making the film work and be (basically) non-annoying to most of the general public (and this critic).I suppose life has come full circle-now that I am (relatively) old as a high school graduate, animation is cool again, thanks to high-powered computers, at any rate. `Finding Nemo' is one heckuva movie and a good one to take anyone you know to, trust me on this-nine out of ten."
FreakingMovieFanatic,"Jun 15, 2022",10/10,"Yes you read that correctly.Finding Nemo had brilliant, breathtaking underwater scenes that blow your mind!! Characters that you connect with, that have emotion, style and humour. The soundtrack is perfect to boot. Honestly what more could you ask for? In glorious 4K HDR with vibrant Dolby Atmos it gives this iconic classic a whole new life!!"
PizzicatoFishCrouch,"Mar 20, 2006",10/10,"Marlin, a nervous and neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective of his son Nemo, who only wants to explore the sea in its entirety. When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.As charming as it is beautiful, Finding Nemo is a joy, both visually and cinematically. The characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them, Nemo and Dory in particular. But the film transcends above just a generic animated film, for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. The film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view, with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. The animation is of all time high for Pixar, and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited, as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by Thomas Newman. He creates the essence of the sea, as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. In short, the music is superb.The voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naïve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film. And the jokes, what jokes  from satire, spoof and slapstick, they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes  ending with the touching, thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents."
nadger_09,"Aug 12, 2003",N/A,"Pixar Studios have done it again. I have to say that these guys are totally good in computer animation, as well as in storytelling. Rarely do those qualities come together but here they are, delivering unto the audience once again something that one can only be drowned with wonder. Such is the marvel of Finding Nemo.The story is about Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a young clownfish who is fed up with his dad Marlin's (Albert Brooks) excessive paranoia over him. He swims to a place where his dad forbids him and ends up being captured by a scuba diver. He is then placed in a fish tank in a dental clinic somewhere along the harbors of Sydney. Thus the quest of Marlin, along with Dory (a hilarious forgetful blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) to find Nemo before it's too late.The story is a simple one but where the film more than makes up is on the overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colors and textures as if we aren't really watching an animated film at all. Scenes such as Marlin bringing Nemo to school while swimming through corals and anemones, to the aquarium where Nemo was taken to, are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtedbly one of the most outstanding animation ever to hit the screen.The world of ""Finding Nemo"" is simply alive with lovable creatures swimming about their daily lives under the ocean, darting across the screen in playful manners. The viewer almost literally dives into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely captivated.The music and screenplay also blend very well with the visual feast that it produces such a high quality movie. From its basic storyline, to the father-and-son relationship theme, to the wonderful underwater world throughout, this is really an adventure through an ocean of stunning visuals and storytelling.Grade: A"
mjw2305,"Jan 22, 2005",8/10,"Those guys and girls at Disney/Pixar have done it again, they've created the perfect underwater world, full of fascinating Disney characters.A truly enchanting story of a father (Marlon) who loses his son (Nemo), and with help of his new found friend (Dory) ventures out into the ocean to try to find him. On this epic voyage he gets to battle sharks, surf with some turtle dudes, dice with some jellyfish and survive an encounter in a whales stomach.All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but my favourite is Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, pure genius.All in all this is another success for Disney and Pixar, It brings out the child in all of us.Solid family fun 8/10"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Nov 15, 2023",9/10,"Marlin loses his wilful son Nemo, and the fact that 71% of the Earth is water, that's a lot of water to find a single fish.Back to a time where Disney Pixar were giving us truly memorable, meaningful and wonderful films. Finding Nemo surely rates as one of the great animations.This film is both funny and moving, it's a film that that whole family can enjoy, I'm sure this will end up on over thr upcoming Christmas period, it usually does, and it always makes us giggle, Ellen DeGeneres truly does provide the laughs as dippy Dory.I'm only surprised to that the followup took so long, and though I don't think Finding Dory is quite as good, it's still worth seeing.As much as I adore Dory, it's Bruce that I like most, his animation is just perfect.It's moving, it's funny, there is definitely a meaningful story, the animation remains terrific.9/10."
RightWingGuy,"Mar 8, 2006",10/10,"I didn't see this movie until it came out on DVD. My family and I don't go to the movies very often, mostly because there's hardly anything worth seeing.But this movie was absolutely flawless. The voice cast was super. The voice of Nemo is Alexander Gould, who is 11 years old now. I saw his picture, and I really like his smile.""Finding Nemo"" is a classic. It'a among my favorite movies, and is a movie everyone should see. Unlike about 96% of movies, this movie is Rated ""G"", and can be viewed by children. There might be a few moments when it gets ""scary,"" but they soon turn into comedy.Watch ""Finding Nemo"" and I think you'll be a happier person by the end of the movie!My Score: 10/10."
Boba_Fett1138,"Jan 11, 2004",9/10,"""Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons.The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs.There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.Mine, mine, mine!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
soymilk,"Feb 26, 2004",7/10,"This is a good film but overrated. There, I said it.This was just too reminiscent of when 'Shrek' first hit the screens, in 2001  the 3D animation everyone was going gaga over, repeatedly hailing as the greatest animated movie ever, and yet didn't really impress me all that much. Seemingly, I was the only person on the planet to feel that way. I didn't really 'get' 'Shrek', don't especially 'get' it even now, and for some reason I didn't quite manage to 'get' 'Finding Nemo' either, the next 3D film to get the 'greatest animated movie' ever proclamation, in spite of the fact that I was really, really determined to kick off my socks and enjoy this one. Well, it's cute and it's colourful, and the idea of a father clownfish (named Marlin) trekking the ocean to be reunited with his missing son (named, oddly enough, Nemo) is a nice one for sure, but there was just something about it which left me feeling strangely unsatisfied. All in all it's a worthy venture for the Pixar cabinet, visually gorgeous and with a handful of effective moments, but seriously, they have done better.The main problem comes in the story structure, which is too rambling and disjointed to do it for me. I actually agree with another viewer who commented that it felt more like that of a multi-levelled video game than a movie. All it really involves is Marlin swimming along and avoiding getting chomped by dangerous sea-dwelling predator after sea-dwelling predator. We meet plenty of interesting characters along the way, but the nature of the story means that they're removed from the action within minutes. For example, the trio of sinister but slow-witted sharks struggling to go veggie, who have a lot less screen time than the promotional posters and trailers might imply and are never given the chance to amount to much more than a few time-filling wisecracks. Nigel the pelican, in spite of Geoffrey Rush's spunky voicing, is a mostly bland character whose motives for befriending and assisting the fish are left conveniently unspoken (after all, naturally he's another sea-dwelling predator himself), and I found the surfer turtles just a tad annoying (particularly the young ones  call me heartless, but bleh!).Another pretty nagging drawback is that neither protagonist, be it Marlin or Nemo, is nearly as sympathetic as past Pixar creations like Woody or Sulley. Marlin is too whiny to be truly likable, and Nemo doesn't really get the great deal of development you'd usually expect in a title character. The script is notably also less sharp than previous Pixar instalments. There was one scene in the dentist's waiting room which had me in stitches, but that was about it. It's mostly just movie in-jokes for most of the time. While in 'Toy Story' the various nods to other movies were little more than subtle extras for the sharp-eyed viewer to enjoy alongside a script brimming with plenty of witty gags of its own, they're pretty much integral to this screenplay. 'Finding Nemo' suffers from the same 'self-indulgent movie spoof' syndrome that you can find in most 3D animation from the Dreamworks stable, with a slew of constant parodies (that most of us have already seen at some point in 'the Simpsons') substituting for real humour. Usually, Pixar are always one step ahead of their rivals in this respect, but this time round even they were unable to resist succumbing to it.There are certain aspects of 'Finding Nemo' that I liked. For example, Dory, the regal blue tang who trails Marlin insistently on his travels  technically she's as 2D as everyone else in this flick, her whole character consisting of little more than the one-joke comedy gimmick that she suffers from short term memory loss and can never remember quite what she's doing. There's so much potential here to be annoying, but somehow she manages to pull through and, against the odds, prove a surprisingly charming character throughout. Perhaps it comes down to Ellen DeGenere's brilliant voice work. Also, I like it that the standard comic relief sidekick can finally be female, and that Marlin and Dory manage to maintain an entirely platonic relationship throughout (no token love interests here).But the most interesting character by far is William Dafoe's hard-bitten Moorish idol, Gill  he's given some hints of a personal history, yet it goes curiously understated throughout. Many of the 'Tank Gang' sequences seem pretty out of place (what does the welcome ritual have to add to the story, other than establishing the existence of that bubble volcano?), but nonetheless, some of the dialogue exchanged between Gill and Nemo is quite nice and add a sprinkling of depth to a film which I otherwise found to be just a little toohollow?Plus, the sight of an angler fish caught up in a pair of diving goggles is unexpectedly alluring - still, the poor, poor creature ;)'Finding Nemo' isn't a bad film by any means. In fact, it's pretty darn good. But Pixar have made other movies which, ironically, could blow this clean out of the water. In short, it's sweet and pleasant but  there's that word again - overrated.Grade: B"
MovieAddict2016,"Jul 28, 2003",8/10,"Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn't say kid films). ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2 and ""Monsters, Inc."" are some of my favorite family films; ""Finding Nemo"" isn't one of my favorites, but it isn't disappointing like ""A Bug's Life,"" and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.As always, Pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. In ""Toy Story"" they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. In ""Monsters, Inc.,"" they showed us the monster world. In my review on ""A Bug's Life,"" I said that the reason the film didn't work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. Well, I guess I was sorta wrong, because ""Finding Nemo"" is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and I still loved it.This tale takes place underwater with the fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. All but one egg which Marlin names Nemo.Years later Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould, Elliot's son?) is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. But haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, Marlin is extremely over-protective of his one remaining family member. Nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scuba-diving dentist. And so Marlin heads off to find Nemo, with the help of his newfound companion Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. (Like when she is showing Marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets why Marlin is following her.)Pixar doesn't let down the audience on this film. There are a few things that one can always expect from Pixar films: They can expect something (such as toys) to be given their own world. They can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. And they can expect humor.""Finding Nemo"" gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. And the humor is always there. All the characters are funny. I especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentist's office, with a bunch of fish including Gill (Willem Dafoe's vocal talents), who constantly tries to escape. By doing so, Gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentist's tools and getting sliced up. This is, of course, a parody of escaping POWs. The fact that Willem Dafoe was in the great war movie ""Platoon"" might have something to do with that.This is taken from my ""Monsters, Inc."" review: ""Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my 'Toy Story' review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters, Inc.,' but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for 'Toy Story 3') and gives them the bare minimum.With ""Finding Nemo,"" I still stick towards what I said. Pixar Animation Studios is probably the best family film company out there right now, I really hope they separate from Disney some day and form their own production company. They know what interests both kids and adults, and it's almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging and fun to watch. This is one to take the kids to, and afterwards, maybe even sneak back into again by yourself."
bookmanjunior,"Sep 13, 2006",7/10,"""Finding Nemo"" is obviously a good movie. But, like many Pixar films, it's overrated. It seems they give more attention to CGI movies than older animated classics like ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty And The Beast"", that deserve to be in the Top 250 instead of this kind of film. There are good Pixar films, like ""Cars"" and ""The Incredibles"", but I don't think that it deserves to rank the 2nd best Disney film ever behind only The Incredibles. Now, they also leave out ""Pinocchio"", ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs"", ""Dumbo"", ""Bambi"", and other classics created during Disney's life. This is a very good movie, but I think it deserves the highest rating of a 7.3 or 7.4."
mcfly-31,"Mar 21, 2004",2/10,"Hmm, let's start with the death of a mother fish, an overprotective, wimpy father fish, jr. fish who says ""I hate you"", then have jr. kidnapped.  And all in the first five minutes!  Throw in big, scary fish and tons of melodramatic search and rescue action, and you've got...a ""kids"" movie?? They don't know any better, so this becomes their only alternative at the theater, which in turn makes it three hundred million dollars.  Usually these family films pack jokes for the older crowd that only they'd understand to keep them awake, along with the kiddie stuff.  Not here.  No fun of ""Toy Story"", with characters and imaginitive action passages to keep you engrossed.  Here we're saddled with a dull hero (voice of Brooks), a quickly annoying ""dumb funny"" fish (voice of DeGeneres) and a slew of not even recognizable celebrity voices who you'd be hard pressed to guess who it is.  The only, only, plus is the always reliable Pixar imagery, colorful and striking.  Otherwise, run.  ""Nemo!  Nemo!  Nemo!""  Shuddup and get me outta here!"
Buddy-51,"Nov 28, 2003",N/A,"Has there ever been a better-looking feature-length animated film than `Finding Nemo'?  We doubt it.  With its shimmering underwater landscapes - be they in the vast immensity of a limitless ocean or the cramped confines of a dentist office aquarium - the film sports a look unlike anything we have ever seen before.  The fish tank setting, in particular, is a veritable wonderland of eye-popping, many-hued visual splendor.Although the script by Andrew Stanton doesn't scale the comedic heights of, say, `Aladdin,' `Shrek' or `Toy Story 2,' it still sparkles with enough wit and inventiveness to entrance youngsters and beguile the grownups who will be joining them in their viewing.  I hasten to point out that the screenplay is blessedly free of all the double entendres and off-color humor that have blighted so much alleged `kiddie' fare in recent years.  This is a film on e can watch with one's children and grandchildren and not once have to blush or turn away in embarrassment while doing so.  Creators of children's films please take note (and take note, too, of its phenomenal box office take).Like many tales designed for the junior set (`Dumbo,' `Bambi' etc.), `Finding Nemo' taps into the fear all children have of being separated from their parents - and the concomitant fear all parents have of being separated from their children.  It is upon this common ground that members of both generations will meet in their emotional response to this film.  In this case, it is little Nemo, an adorable clownfish, who is plucked out of the ocean and plunked down into the saltwater aquarium of a dentist in Sydney, Australia.  The subject of the film's title is Marlin, Nemo's overprotective, worrywart dad who swims his way towards the continent to find and rescue his little tyke.  Along the way, this Nervous Nellie parent learns a little something about giving his son the freedom a boy needs to grow up and become a man, and Nemo, himself, learns a thing or two about just what kind of a fish his dad really is.Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are brilliant as Marlin and Dory, respectively, the latter a befuddled, daffy and utterly good-natured fish who helps Marlin in his epic quest not only for his lost son but his own definition of filial love.  Those familiar with these two fine comedic talents in their live-action performances will actually be able to see many of their distinctive inflections and facial expressions reflected in the animated characters they are portraying.As directed by Stanton and Lee Unkrich, and executed by an army of wonder-working animators and technicians, `Finding Nemo' takes PIXAR technology to its ultimate, final level of perfection - till the studio's next release, that is."

moviemanMA,"Jul 10, 2005",10/10,"Can Pixar and Disney miss with a film? Both Toy Story's, A Bugs Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. These movies are instant classics.The movie in focus is Finding Nemo, a story of a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), trying to find his son Nemo who was taken away by scuba divers. With the help of a fish named Dory (Ellen Degeneres)Marlin bumps into on his journey, they set out on finding Nemo. The only problem is that Dory suffers from short-term memory loss. She can't remember anything except her name. It's sad but brings a lot of comedy to the movie.Along the way they meet some priceless characters like Crush (voiced by writer/director Andrew Stanton), the thrill seeking sea turtle. They also encounter a trio of friendly sharks, Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. They have sworn to never eat a fish again. They also run into some potentially deadly situations with an ugly deep sea fish, also a huge swarm of jellyfish, and a whale. Marlin and Dory must tough it out and make it to find Nemo.Meanwhile, Nemo is now the new addition to an Australian dentist's office aquarium. There he meets some interesting characters. Peach the starfish, Bloat the blowfish, and more sea dwellers. There Nemo tries to fit in, becoming a member of the tank named ""Shark Bait"". He tries to help out Gill (William Defoe) with his plan to escape from the tank and get everyone out. Nemo must come through in order to see his father ever again. A local pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) also tries to help out in the escape. Word has spread around the world of Marlin's trip to find his son, reaching Nigel.FInding Nemo is an instant classic. With great lines and unforgettable characters, this movie is a delight. The animation itself is remarkable. It's as though the fish are really swimming. You can even see particles floating in the water. Light shines through and currents make the fish and surrounding react. The animators have done their homework for this picture.This movie is quite an experience. It is a film the whole family can enjoy for years to come. It is a timeless adventure that people can enjoy. Don't let this film drift out to sea..."

It's the best movie I've EVER seen, and I know I say that about alot movie, but I actually mean it this time. Never, did I ever come out of a theater after seeing a movie smile for the rest of the night. The movie just completely blew me away. I knew it was going to be good, but I had no clue what was in store for me when I saw it opening night. This movie is a work of pure genius. The animation is just beautiful, acting is awesome, the music fit everything that was going on. I could go on and on with this list, but I think I'll stop there. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it didn't lack anything at all. There was just the right amount of comedy, drama, suspense/action, and even romance. And it all blended together beautifully. This is why I gave this movie a full 10. Believe, me if I could give it more, I would."
TheLittleSongbird,"May 3, 2009",9/10,"This movie is just gorgeous to look at, really the animation is just stunning, with the blue backgrounds and colourful characters. My only criticism is that although there are some very funny moments, like Doreen speaking whale(Ellen DeGeneres was born to speak whale, really she was) and Barry Humphries's shark, I don't think it is as laugh-out loud funny as Toy Story. Finding Nemo is definitely the most beautiful visually of the Pixar movies, I would certainly pick it over Cars. The music by Thomas Newman was just beautiful, and I always look out for this in a movie, and it was a delight hearing ""Beyond the Sea"" over the end credits. The characters are genuinely memorable, especially Doreen and Bruce. And who can forget the girl Darla, with the Psycho music?(that is really terrifying)The voice talents are very good indeed, especially Ellen DeGeneres, and I liked Willem Dafoe's Gil. Albert Brooks made a wonderfully paranoid father figure, and I loved the plot about Marlin's son Nemo being taken by divers and Marlin (a clown fish) racing to find him. That is simple, but we meet characters like the turtle, so the film is filled with fun, enough to satisfy the fussiest child. In conclusion, 9/10 for the visuals and the characters. Outstanding!

daily life though I know it's not real but somehow I am just mesmerised by it.I never think about what fishes do, do they study,do they really live in fear,who oppress them bla bla. And how the father find it's son was quite interesting. The aquarium incident leaves me really believe tbat do they really did that in real life🤣"
CyberJackhammer,"Jan 12, 2005",1/10,"When given a poll between watching Shrek 2 or Finding Nemo, I decided to choose Finding Nemo after being told of its high-quality laughs and worthy entertainment value. I'm not a big fan of Shrek 2 but *sigh* this was a bad choice.What many people consider to be witty and original is what I see as imports from early Chaplin films and episodes of the Simpsons. Finding Nemo is the story of the eponymous fish, Nemo. Nemo is the only survivor of his batch after his brothers and sisters (along with his Mother) were eaten by sharks in the egg stage. However Nemo survived (albeit deformed) along with a paranoid Father.The jokes seem tired and lack any moments of stomach-rumbling chuckling but rather a series of humoured snorts. Although the main character of Nemo is likable, the other two major characters are not. Ellen Degeneres' role as Dory is so irritating that you start hoping the diver comes back and batters Dory then at least somebody will get some use out of the poorly-designed character.Although there are smart ideas it becomes jumbled up in overly-immature jokes that decrease the entertainment value. For example the sharks that are dedicated to soothing their blood lust is worth some giggles but it gets lost in the sea(pardon the pun) of poor remarks. I should have known that the immaturity and basicness of the jokes would never stop coming. I assumed there would be a 15 minute farting sequence later on.When Nemo goes to school he breaks away from the pack and is captured by divers causing his Father and an oddball fish to venture after him. Now this seems to be an original plot filled with many creative avenues on which to expand but what turns out to potential ends up as excrement."
lilfreeek,"May 22, 2003",N/A,"Okay, Disney and Pixar did a fabulous job.  The images were so great, the storyline was typical but fun, the characters were well-defined, and the sound was emotive and effective.  And, who could not love a flick that makes references to The Shining, Psycho, and other quality films?I seriously got attached to the little Clown fish, Nemo.  The movie just sucked me in.  Anyway, watch it.  It's worth your time, especially if you enjoy Pixar animation.  The first 10 minutes is a visual overload in a good way.  Very good way.By the way, the voice of Jesus (Willem Dafoe) embodied by a Tiger fish? Awesome."

A fascinating story, made by the creators of masterpieces, Pixar...If I could, I would talk about this movie forever, or until I run out of words and adjectives. The story is funny and touching when it's necessary. It made me laugh out loud and even cry for a second. Fantastic. A must-see!Excellent work by the musicians and the director. That's just it. If I go on, I will get on your nerves as I am extremely enthusiastic about this movie. THE movie, actually."
daniyalkhan857,"Apr 16, 2015",10/10,"""Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons.The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs.As for Nemo, he's inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance.""Finding Nemo"" is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time.Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations."

Sir_AmirSyarif,"May 13, 2021",10/10,"As charming as it is beautiful, Andrew Stanton (and co-director Lee Unkrich)'s 'Finding Nemo' is a joy, both visually and cinematically. It is a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that warms your heart from time to time. The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is excellence and beauty in every frame. Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable. All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. A delight from start to finish."
departed07,"May 11, 2005",10/10,"Pixar has made some of the enjoyable films in the past years: The Toy Story films, Monsters, Inc., and A Bug's Life to name a few. What makes these films interesting is the designs of the films as if they look identical to real life; now the creators have made underwater more realistic than ever in ""Finding Nemo"" where the waves of the water seem to have life of its own.""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish name Marlin (Albert Brooks) who takes on the responsibility of his young son Nemo after the mother and the babies were killed off screen. Now as a single parent, Marlin worries about everything that his young son does, even when he goes off to school for the first day.There is a universal moment in about every Pixar movie where there is always a human nature to relate towards the animated films; with Marlin's parental worries as a single father, most of the dads in the audiences can relate to him, especially when Nemo is kidnapped by a sea diver after getting near a boat.Marlin goes through the sea of Australia where he meets with a blue coral fish name Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has STM (Short Term Memory) where she can remember things and than forget until the final moment. They go on adventures from escaping sharks, getting sting by jellyfish, swimming with turtles and going inside a whale's mouth.As for Nemo, he's inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance.""Finding Nemo"" is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time."
vip_ebriega,"Oct 23, 2008",10/10,"My Take: Simply magical, down to the last computer-animated detail.I was at least 13 or 14 years old when this came out, and only now am I reviewing it. But that can't stop me, I have to lay out my sentiments for this clever and occasionally brilliant animated achievement. Not only is it the best, so far, in Pixar's portfolio of animated films, it's one of the very best animated films ever made, period. FINDING NEMO is a well-told fairy tale adventure, but a well-told story is only a bonus compared to the film's awesome look and feel. The movie is visually stunning, with images that flow like living paintings, some of which almost but leaps out the screen. The movie is beautifully crafted, and sometimes, I almost didn't care about anything else. Almost.On the contrary, the story is quite simple. After a tragedy introduced in the opening scenes, Marlin the clown fish (voiced by Albert Brooks) becomes too over-protective of his last son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould). Every move he makes is always under the watchful eye of his over-protective father, who couldn't afford to lose him. To prove that he can walk with his own two feet (or is that swim with his own fins?), Nemo approached an anchored divers boat and is abducted by two curious divers and taken far off the Great Barrier Reef. Marlin, guilty for his loss, is determined to find his son, captured by a dentist and placed inside a too-small-for-a-fish aquarium in the dentist's clinic. Along his side is a joyous yet forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who gives a helping fin a long the way, whatever she can remember.This is quite an adventure too. Not only are we introduced to a closer-than-life-like reef, we are also introduced with a clever and elaborate band of characters, including a trio of sharks who swore their lives to be vegetarians (until the call of the wild kicks in), a couple of surfer-dude turtles, a charade-playing school of fish and many other wonders. The animation here is, by far, the most brilliant ones I have ever seen. A colorful and life-filled reef, a forest of jellyfish and a crystal-clear aquarium filled of plastic ornaments have never looked more pristine in this lavish and elaborate adventure. But other than its brilliant design which is considerable enough to recommend the picture, the film is not without a good story, and it is told well. The characters have a great deal of features and characteristics. This is most evident on the character of Dory, who not only has the showmanship of the voice who dubbed her, but also the delight we expect from a true family film.If the story may not apply to you, or you might find it cliché, then FINDING NEMO will still do as a brilliant eye-candy, with one of the best sights I have ever seen in an animated film then and now. Sometimes, sitting in front of a theater or even the small screen and just let the elaborate visuals flow right through you is more than enough to see a movie. Sometimes it's a movie like this one that reminds you the fun that going to movies are.Rating: ***** out of 5."
saska-3,"Jun 2, 2003",8/10,"Fresh off a viewing in a packed theater of kids and parents, my initial impression of ""Finding Nemo"" was that I had a great time throughout, but don't necessarily remember why.  The film is similar to the ""Toy Story"" pacing, in that we follow two different protagonists in their attempt to return to one another.  In brief summary, Marlin the overprotective father clownfish must overcome his own fear of open ocean to try and find his only son, Nemo, who has been captured by a diver and transplanted to an ocean-view dentist's office fish tank.The visual impact of ""Finding Nemo"" is unparalleled in animated film.  At its best, it compares to the experience of seeing the sweeping landscapes of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" for the first time - not until we own the DVD and my son has watched it a dozen times will I really have an opportunity to see the details crammed into the lush backgrounds of the coral reefs.  It was noticeable, however, that frequent close-ups in open water were used to reduce the amount of time spent rendering those brilliant backgrounds.  In comparison to Pixar films like ""A Bug's Life"", where every moment of the film includes rich textures and detailed background perspective, this seemed jarring at times.  It should be noted that this is true to what the ocean looks like - if you're not diving in a coral reef, you are probably seeing a lot of floating detritus and gray water - but it's worth mentioning that the fish tank environment of Nemo and his fellow captives is, at times, more interesting than the open ocean.Pixar took chances (or else saved money) with many of the voice actors used in the film.  It was refreshing not to instantly ""know"" a voice was familiar in the case of many of the characters - all of them did a serviceable job, although the well-known actors also turned in some of the best performances. Ellen DeGeneres had no fear as the voice of Dory, gleefully pulling off vocal pratfalls that would have been hampered by someone else's sense of dignity.  I can think of only one other actress - Julia Louis-Dreyfuss - who I think would have been able to do Dory well.  Kudos to Ellen.  Willem Dafoe is also noticeably brilliant as Gill, and it's a bonus that the animated character he plays is gorgeously realized.  John Ratzenberger does a hysterical turn as the school of fish we all saw in the previews.I am surprised at the number of characters whose voices are not credited in this film.  I wanted to know, among others, who voiced Mr. Ray the schoolteacher and the trio of parents with whom Marlin banters.I laughed out loud frequently and heartily throughout the film, but at the end, I looked back and wondered how those moments of amusement added to the story.  Many people have commented that they loved the 12-step program for sharks (""Fish are our friends, not food!"") but in the final analysis, it added very little to the arc and seemed out of character (I realize I'm stating the obvious).  The frequently-dropped comedic digressions were the weak point in this picture, especially compared to ""A Bug's Life"", where the funniest moments of the film are all critical to the progress of the protagonist and impact the end of the story.My 2 and a half year old son was frequently frightened to the point of crying out and grabbing on to me during the movie, and he followed the primary issues easily.  At a particular moment in the film when things seemed hopeless, I heard dozens of young children beginning to cry.  If your child is very affected by scary or dramatic moments in movies, you may want to talk with them about ""pretend"" versus ""real"" and prepare them for the eventuality that everything will turn out all right well before you go into the theater.  His final analysis was that ""the fish movie was good!"" - so take it under advisement if you have kids of similar age.I give ""Finding Nemo"" an 8 out of 10 on the strength of its visual lushness, its enjoyable voice work, and its moments of perfectly timed humor.  It does not, in my opinion, match the strength as a *film* of earlier Pixar offerings, but even in its innocuous state, it's higher quality than most of the family films I've seen in the past 3 years."
Flagrant-Baronessa,"Jul 18, 2006",7/10,"Finding Nemo can be seen as the bridge between Pixar Studios and Walt Disney Studios. It is the result of filmmakers and crew meeting halfway on this bridge and including aspects from both production companies and making it work. Finding Nemo brings some of the adult humour of Pixar (as seen in Ice Age, Monsters inc, etc) and combines it with the morals and lessons that Disney wants to teach (as seen inuh.. every Disney film).While it would be more than OK with me to simply omit the latter in animated features to leave room for comedy and nice visuals, I see at least some faint need for moral statements as films like this primarily cater to children. These kinds of morals and values lessons are thankfully kept to a minimum in Finding Nemo - but they are present and they do drag the film down on occasion.Finding Nemo tells the story of a widowed clownfish named Marlin who frequently goes overboard trying to protect his only living son, Nemo, from the dangers and non-dangers of the ocean world. One day, Nemo is captured by a scuba diver and Marlin, devastated, is left to face his own fears to go and find Nemo.Finding Nemo is an ocean ride with superb animations of sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans. The film parodies human behavior by creating an ocean world that greatly reflects our own (crayfish mowing their lawns, sting-rays as teachers). At the same time it brings some of nature in. I loved the sea gulls more than anything because they are seen in such great contrast to Marlin who is so human; he is complex, thinking and refined. The gulls are simply ""rat with wings"" in this film and are portrayed as such. Totally brainless creatures but providers of the greatest comedy in Finding Nemo. So it is not only Disney and Pixar meeting halfway, but nature and human behavior meeting halfway too.This is probably the closest (aside from maybe The Emperor's New Groove) Disney has come to making an adult-humoured animated film - and they needed Pixar to do it. 7/10"
Simone-6,"Dec 26, 2007",1/10,"Judging from the reviews I just read of Finding Nemo, it looks like there are two kinds of reviewers: those who want a film that mirrors and idealizes their lives, no questions asked, and those who want a film that raises interesting questions. I'm in the latter category and as such, I have to say that this was perhaps the most boring and vapid film I have ever watched. For me, watching replicas of family, school life, dentists' offices, etc. without some sort of commentary just isn't interesting. And no, beautiful animation is not enough. So maybe we need to revisit the eighteenth century, when people -- Americans included -- were proud to think, question, and use reason in their everyday existence. Maybe that would produce an animated film that would allow Nemo and his dad to move beyond platitudes, tell the audience something new, and actually be funny (jokes in the Eisenhower era were funnier than this film). ""Sapere Aude!"" Thank you, Immanuel Kant."
dwozniak,"May 23, 2003",10/10,"If Walt Disney was alive today, he would be proud of Michael Eisner. Building an alliance with Pixar and distributing Pixar's genius speaks well of the good chairman.I guess I was not surprised that(at the advanced screening of the new Pixar/Disney flix,) ""Finding Nemo"" would be brilliant. Entertaining my 5 1/2 year old child, my wife and I, ""Nemo"" made for a great family event. Yes, my son will make sure I pay for a second showing... and you know, I will gladly do so.I guess, all tolled, this animated movie should make $250 million easy. Perhaps $300 million... Okay, let's go for it! $366 million.Enjoy."
planktonrules,"Jun 10, 2007",8/10,"Okay, I am NOT a huge Nemo fan, but considering the film's modest pretenses and how much kids loved it, who am I to complain--especially since the animation is so nice? Plus, the film is much, much better than the knock-off film, SHARK TALE.The film has one of the simplest plots I have ever seen in a kids movie. Nemo loves his dad and vice-versa. When Nemo is captured for a home aquarium, the timid dad springs to the rescue with rather predictable results. There are no major surprises BUT the journey along the way is pleasant and cute. The kids will no doubt love it but some parents may find it a bit ""sticky"" and shallow like I did. But considering how much fun my daughter had watching it, this can all be forgiven."
rgpaeplrp,"Aug 5, 2025",10/10,"Finding Nemo is just one of those movies that never gets old. It's got everything - great animation, a solid story, and characters you care about. The main plot is super simple- a clownfish named Marlin goes on this huge journey across the ocean to find his son, Nemo, who got scooped up by a diver and thrown in a fish tank. Classic ""dad goes on an adventure"" vibe, but underwater. Dory steals the show, though. She's hilarious and kind of heartbreaking at the same time - one of Pixar's best characters. The humor throughout the movie is spot on, and it never feels like it's trying too hard to be funny. It just works. Even for an 2000s film, it's stunning. The ocean scenes are super colorful and detailed- some parts almost feel real. And the music? Chill and emotional without being over-the-top. But what I like is how it balances being fun and being meaningful. It's got those deeper themes - like dealing with fear, letting go, and learning to trust - and it delivers them in a way that's relatable, even as an adult. It's heartwarming, funny, and just well done. A top-tier Pixar film for sure. Would I recommend it? Yes. And yeah, I still quote ""just keep swimming"" way more than I should."
faraaj-1,"Oct 8, 2006",10/10,"Finding Nemo is one of a series of Pixar animation features made in past decade or so and is probably the best of the lot. My three year old watches the DVD at least twice a week and doesn't show any sign of getting tired. The reason is obvious - Finding Nemo creates a complete under the sea world inhabited by creatures with complete personalities.The plot has Marlin, a clown fish, losing his only child Nemo (named after Capt.Nemo of 20,000 leagues under the the sea) to a deep sea diver. While Nemo is stuck in a fish tank in a dental office with lots of other interesting characters, Marlin sets out to find his son. On the way, a crazy blue fish called Dory joins him and turns this into something of a buddy movie (although Dory is female)......There are lots of jokes peppered throughout the movie with Dory supplying a large chunk of them. Writer-director Stanton plays a 'dude' 150 year old sea turtle straight from the 60's and adds to the fun. The visuals are superb, storyline is great and it all makes for a great adventure. I rate this 9/10 because I'm a little sick and tired of seeing it on the DVD every weekend for over a year now!!"
AvidClimber,"Mar 11, 2013",10/10,"Finding Nemo is the heroic tale of fishes, and it's excellent. It opens up with a tragedy and quickly leads us to a great adventure and multiple acts of courage. Who would have thought that such a simple idea could result in such a great production?The animation is extremely colorful, brought to us in great details for a breathtaking look at the life under the sea. The dialogs are funny. The script is very inventive and doesn't call on evil or songs. The story is riveting, with each scene a novelty in itself. Voices are chosen to perfection, and the reactions realistic.A great movie for both adults and kids."
Luigi Di Pilla,"Nov 30, 2005",7/10,"I have to admit that I have been positively surprised and congratulations to all the stuff that helped to making alive the fishes and birds. My three old year son says ""again, again"". Yeah, he liked it too of course and so my wife. The story has many original twists and plots packed in a solid and entertaining adventure trip. But the most I liked was the real special effects and the very clear animation that makes very believable that these fishes are real. Therefore some scenes could have been cut because they were too slow paced and unnecessary but this is not a problem. If you want to spend an unforgettable moment with your kids and family then you shouldn't miss it. Fasten your seat belts and enjoy it. 7/10."
Gryosphere,"Jul 20, 2003",1/10,"When the credits for Finding Nemo started to roll I asked myself, did I see a different movie then everybody else? I do not know how people are saying this is the best movie of 2003 and one of the greatest of all-time. Sure, the animation is outstanding (great job Pixar), but the story is awful (shame on you Disney). After movies like Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc I expected a better film. This movie is for people under 10 or for people who act and think like they are under 10. This is NOT a good film at all. Save your money and 100 minutes of your life, don't see Finding Nemo.0 out of 10"
bob the moo,"Sep 30, 2003",N/A,"Scarred by the loss of his wife and eggs, Marlin has over sheltered his only child, Nemo.  However when Nemo's first day at school comes about, that mothering leads Nemo to swim out to the open ocean where he is caught by a scuba diver and be put in a fish tank far away.  Enlisting help from the forgetful Dory, Marlin tracks the boat and his ocean adventure begins.Now as much as a tradition as national holidays, the latest Pixar animation arrives in the UK on a wave (d'oh!) of hype and marketing.  Officially the biggest summer film in the US and all over buses and Happy Meals (which seems a little perverse when you think about it) it is hard not to want to see it or prevent your kids from demanding they see it.  Happily the well establish benchmark of being kiddie friendly but fun for adults is maintained and the film does exactly what you know it will.  The plot is a little like Toy Story's quest but is fleshed out enough to be interesting and the themes of `letting go' and loss are actually quite well handled and will speak more to adults than kids.The slight problem with the film is that is does do just what you expect and the `animated film with adult wit and kiddie characters' stuff is hardly cutting edge anymore.  However this is a picky flaw as it is still very good fun.  It may not be the strongest of this genre, indeed some bits flag and the sentimental core, while a break from cruel humour or sarcasm, does then to slow things down a bit at times.The adult references are all good but not as frequent as I'd have liked  they seem to be separate from the main flow where I wanted them integral with all of it.  Clever homage's to Jaws (Bruce was the pet name of the rubber shark) and The Birds are distracting and make you feel good about yourself, and the banter is mostly witty if lacking a real sharpness at times.The voice cast are all good are quite an all star bunch.  Brooks does a workmanlike job in the lead  it must be said I didn't think he distinguished himself but then he did have to carry the moral weight of the film.  DeGeneres is much better and her dippy character is a delight at times.  The support cast is not as deep and fun as in other films  Janney and Dafoe are both fun in the tank (as are all the tank characters) it's just that none of them are really consistent.  My favourite characters were the one word seagulls  `mine?'Overall I have been unfair to this film in my review.  If I saw this in isolation I would be praising it to the roof, however using the others as a benchmark this does have a few weaknesses that show signs of wear and tear in the genre.  Not to cancel everything I have said, these weaknesses are all things that I realised after I had watched it  while I was watching it I was too busy laughing!  Biggest downside for me though  no comedy outtakes, booooooo!"
CMTiago,"Oct 4, 2014",10/10,"Having watched this movie back when I was in my 8/9 years of age, Finding Nemo struck me as a very funny movie and I, of course, loved Dory and her quirkiness. Over time I began to appreciate the emotional impact of the story and the detail that went into the animation process, which in turn led to the establishment of this movie as my favorite of all time. Having only been surpassed three years ago by Toy Story 3 (another Pixar gem), Finding Nemo still holds a strong impression on me, as well as remaining one of my top 10 movies and my second favorite animated movie.The plot follows a clown fish named Marlin, that after his son is taken by a human, sets out on a dangerous and treacherous journey to get him back. Along the way he will meet Dory, a blue fish that suffers from short term memory loss. Together they will stop at nothing to get to Nemo, Marlin's son, who along with a group of ragtag aquarium fish will also plan to escape to the ocean in order to avoid a bratty, but, deadly child and get back to his dad.So like I said, there 3 reasons why I love this movie. The first one is the comedy, provided mostly by the goofy sidekick Dory, as well as other characters. The combination of the smart script, plus the voice talent involved makes for the great comedic side of Finding Nemo. The other great quality of the script, is the emotional turmoil that ensues in the movie, and personally I believe that some parents might resonate with it most, even though I myself do not know this reality. Finally Pixar proves why they are the top of the animation game, by assembling the proper research and creating a great oceanic world, as well as the Sydney landscape.Finding Nemo will forever be a cinematic mark in my cinematic history. It is a funny, energetic and entertaining picture, and that is all I can ask from a movie like this. Rating: 10/10"

MattBirk,"Mar 17, 2016",10/10,"Finding Nemo is Pixar's crown jewel and one of the best animated movies of all time! They create an entire world under water, it looks beautiful, but it also captures the scarier things below the surface. Together, Dory and Marlin travel the Atlantic ocean in search for Nemo and along they way they run into some of the most bizarre characters imaginable! The audience is in the same position as Marlin, he is exploring the ocean for the first time, just like us as the audience, and it is intoxicating. The ocean to most people is a giant, wonderland full of mystery and you never know what you will run into, and Pixar takes full advantage of that as we meet a variety of characters.Along the way, we are given the treat of having some amazing comedy bits as characters cultures clash amongst one another. But even as we travel across the ocean and back, the core of the story never leaves us, it's a love story about a father and son and it is an emotional roller-coaster. They brilliantly take the most notorious fish movie, Jaws (which made the ocean seem terrifying), and turns it upside down, making the water now seem like a wonderful land full of amazing creatures. Finding Nemo is the epitome of Pixar's imagination and creative abilities, they have made an eternal classic here.Let's hope the sequel lives up to the first film!"
austinyoung-56965,"Apr 23, 2016",10/10,"Pixar has done it again! That is a phrase we have become accustomed to hearing these past few years. Pixar Animation Studios has taken the children's movie industry by storm. Andrew Stanton takes us head first into the beautiful, strangely bewildering, world of the big blue ocean with Finding Nemo. We expected children to be captivated by this new installment of children's animation, but parents are also catching the wave as well. This isn't just some fish tale! Okay, well maybe it is. Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) is a paranoid, highly overprotective clown fish. His son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) is a young child full of energy, enthusiasm, with a dash a rebellion thrown in there. Nemo was left crippled at birth after an attack that took his mother and all of his siblings. This leaves NEmo with a deep desire to be independent. This is shown while on a school field trip. Nemo, trying to show off to some friends swims out into open waters. A pair of divers come from the darkness and kidnap Nemo.Marlin, with the help a newly found and hilariously forgetful friend Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) start the adventure to save the only thing that he has left in this world. Little did they know Marlin and Dory will run into all sorts of roadblocks along the way. They encounter sharks that have sworn off eating fish, a horrifying Angler Fish, a bale of sea turtles, and a forest of jellyfish. All of this just to track down his son. That's what I call being a good dad! Finding Nemo is the perfect mixture of a great story, witty comedy, and enticing animation. The bright colors of the underwater world are extravagant. The dialogue keeps viewers entertained and laughing. While the depth of the story of a father losing his son hooks them in for good. This tale is fit for all, young and old. When a child sits down to watch this movie, they can relate to Nemo. A young child looking to do his own thing and go on some adventures. Nemo grows along the course of the film. He goes from being a rebellious little punk, to someone who understands the importance of family and how much his father loves him. As Nemo grows, any child who watches him grows as well. This is one of many reasons why this is a fantastic movie for children. As Pixar will continue to reel in fantastic stories every year, Finding Nemo will go down as one of their greatest hits. Children and parents are flocking to this new spectacle. This thrilling tale will warm the hearts of fathers everywhere who care for their children. Although Marlin could be a little extreme at times, it was very clear that he would do anything for his Son. I believe I echo the words of everyone saying that we want more from Pixar."
mfadayi,"May 8, 2016",10/10,"""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish named Marlin losing his son Nemo. This movie is about friendship and how friends can help you accomplish the hardest things in life.""Finding Nemo"" is story written and directed by Andrew Stanton, produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2003. Finding Nemo is about a clown fish named Marlin looking for his captured son Nemo. In this journey, Marlin meets a blue tang fish named Dory. Dory is a fish that is suffering from memory loss, but she helps Marlin find Nemo. Both Marlin and Dory face great danger, and hard situations in this journey. Meanwhile, Nemo is trying really hard to find a way to get out of the dentist's fish tank and find his way to the open sea in search of his father. But it's not that easy when you have Darla the fish killer (the little girl with the braces).""Finding Nemo"" is a great Animated Movie. The movie uses amazing shades and colors, great sound effects, and amazing camera angles. In the scene where the diver pops up in front of the screen is amazingly realistic, it makes the audience feel like they are the ones in the movie. It also makes the audience feel like they are the clown fish when a huge human face pops up in front of the camera; the audience would feel small and also panic like Nemo. The director of the movie (Andrew Stanton) did an amazingly great job at animating the movie and adding scenes that will make the audience feel what the characters are feeling.The theme of the movie is there throughout the whole movie, but the audience realizes it near the end of the movie. The theme of the movie is friendship, and Marlin was able to accomplish his goal when Dory helped him through all the danger they faced. Another place friendship was used was when Nemo was captured in the fish tank in the doctor's office, where Nemo's friends saved his life from getting flushed down the toilet.""Finding Nemo"" is one of the BEST animated movies Pixar Animation Studios made. I strongly recommend for everyone to watch this movie. This movie would make you feel like you are in the movie and not watching the movie.10/10"
Jawidan,"Apr 28, 2025",10/10,"This kind of Family Bonds, love, dramatic and funny scenes are so genius. It's absolutely fantastic!Is an extraordinary animated film that beautifully combines heart, humor, and stunning visual artistry. The story of the little clownfish Nemo and his father Marlin touches audiences deeply, as it explores themes of love, trust, and courage. Especially moving is the emotional depth: parents can relate to Marlin's fears, while children connect with Nemo's spirit of adventure.The underwater world is colorful and richly detailed, drawing viewers of all ages into a fascinating, vibrant environment. Supporting characters - like Dory, with her charming memory problems, and the laid-back turtle Crush - add lightness and many humorous moments.Moreover, the film conveys important values: trusting others, the meaning of friendship, and the strength to persevere despite challenges.""Finding Nemo"" proves that animated films can do more than entertain - they can deliver profound messages that resonate across generations. With this masterpiece, Pixar and Disney created a timeless classic that continues to captivate hearts around the world."
Doylenf,"Jun 30, 2005",7/10,"The underwater visuals here are as gorgeous as anything Disney ever did in PINOCCHIO, and the colors are dazzling enough to keep anyone hypnotized by the lushness of it all.The slender story about an outgoing clown fish, Nemo straying far from his over-protective father (voiced by Albert Brooks) and getting scooped up by a scuba diver (to be deposited in a fish tank), is played for laughs all the way through. Despite all the humor, there are plenty of tense situations that might frighten the very young. The writers have made sure that the plot is a virtual obstacle course full of forces that have to be overcome before the boy becomes a hero who saves the day.Along the way, Nemo's closest pal is the daffy, amnesiac Dory, a bluefish with a terrible memory, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres in what has to be the film's best voice-over. Her lines are all guaranteed to remind you of the comedienne herself and she comes close to stealing the film with her antics.The movie is slanted at the youth market, of course, and kids and their parents will probably both be enchanted and satisfied with the quips that come fast and furious. I had to use the caption feature on my remote to catch all of the one-liners.On an artistic level, the underwater seascape is fascinating to observe and the jaunty background score keeps the pace flowing nicely.My favorites: the seagulls all shouting in unison ""Mine!"" whenever prey was cited and a whole army of them getting their beaks caught in the mast of a ship."
claudio_carvalho,"Oct 11, 2004",8/10,"Marlin loses his beloved mate and all their eggs but one after the attack of a shark to his home. He swears to protect his son Nemo for the rest of his live and becomes a super protective father. On the first day of school, Nemo shows himself off to his friends, challenging his father and getting close to a boat, and is caught by a diver and put in a private aquarium in a dentist office in Sidney. His father, together with Dory, face the dangers of the open sea trying to find Nemo. 'Finding Nemo' is a lovely adventure, indicated to viewers of any age. The story is funny and all the characters are very sweet. Another great movie of Walt Disney / Pixar. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Procurando Nemo' ('Looking for Nemo')"
aage-brevik,"Feb 26, 2005",7/10,"This is very good work. The animation, story and so on. but i miss one thing. cause usually Disney films like this have a lot of humour but i miss that in Finding Nemo. Shrek has a lot of humor. and that kind of humor are made for grown ups i think. Shrek is not a movie made for children but for the older audience. but this one ain't so funny. but we must think on it as a children's movie. i am 15 so i don't think much of the jokes were suitable for me. i like simple jokes with not to much of the good stuff. American comedies exaggerates and destroy the joke. anyway this is a good movie for children and it contains some humor. try not to get tired of the lady fish. cause i did."
ddpierso,"Jan 24, 2004",3/10,"I mean, HONESTLY! This is supposed to be a kiddie flick, right? So, in classic Disney fashion...five minutes in, two days short of hatching, Mum is devoured by a barracuda -- along with 499 of our title character's siblings. WHY??? This movie made me squirm (pun only gently intended). I can't remember a time I've been more uncomfortable watching a film so blatantly marketed at children.I'm a playwright, folks, an award-winning one at that. I GET the concept of conflict as a dramatic device...but must we keep our cutesy-poo lead in constant peril (sharks, nets, aquarium filtration systems, etc.) I'm really disappointed in how gratuitously MANIPULATIVE this feature is, and saddened that the filmmakers think so very little of the audience to foist such drivel on us, disguised as a family film. Sure, it was lovely to look at...but I can't say much more in its favor. I would NEVER recommend this unnecessarily violent, surprisingly distressing, unintentionally maudlin, unbearably sentimental movie for a child -- or an adult.WHY this film continues to rake it in at the box office, and why critics predict this as an Oscar favorite is beyond my abliity to understand. I'm no crochety grump, either (well, at least I wasn't BEFORE I watched this dreadful film). This is just another classic example of Disney lackeys putting FORMULA ahead to STORY and SENSE, all in pursuit of the bucks. Walt must be spinning in his cryogenic chamber at the thought of his name being sullied by association with this horrible film.Parents: do your kids a favor: If they love the little fishies...take them to a real aquarium instead of subjecting them to even one minute of this bizarre and misguided cash cow with mouse ears.I want the last two hours of my life back."
luke-a-mcgowan,"Aug 23, 2015",10/10,"When I grew up, I always thought the concept of Pixar movies was ""what would life be like as a ____"" Toys were fun, Monsters in the cupboard were fun, bugs were fun, and now we landed on fish. And I loved it because it was colourful and funny and touching.Now, watching Finding Nemo with all I know about film, I am able to understand how brilliant early Pixar was. Every one of these early films has two ""whats life like as"" - one for kids (toys, bugs, monsters) and one for adults. In Finding Nemo, its ""what life is like as an overprotective parent."" Finding Nemo is one of the most beautiful stories that can appeal to families that I've ever seen.The film opens with one of the most downright upsetting moments I ever watched as a child. Albert Brooks' perfect voice casting really captures the grief and desperation that Marlin feels, and it so perfectly sets the stage for the rest of the film. Every one of Marlin's overprotective scenes is not completely justified, but so believable to come from him. We also enjoy Ellen DeGeneres' delightful sidekick Dory, who is absolutely hilarious and charming and I could not love her presence more. As Marlin and Dory set out on the titular quest, Pixar does what Pixar does best - gives us a funny and wondrous understanding of their universe. A gang of sharks are recovering addicts from fish flesh. Seagulls are sadistic and brainless. A group of sea turtles are perpetually high. Throughout each of the encounters, not only does Marlin learn more about the ocean he has been afraid of for so long, but he learns about how his overprotective parenting isn't going to help Nemo forever, and he's better off learning to take care of himself wherever he can.Meanwhile, Nemo is confined in a dentist's tank with a gaggle of kooky fish characters, each of whom has their own little ticks because of their confinement (a beautiful little addition to the story). Emmy king and queen Brad Garrett and Allison Janney are hilarious and even funnier is the addition of Academy Award winner Geoffrey Rush, who pops in as a Pelican taking an interest in dental hygiene.The film's story is so perfectly constructed that I can't fault it. The catalyst moments are spread out by moments of character development and sprinkled with perfect doses of humour. Even the final challenge doesn't come across as ""just one more obstacle"" but provides closure on Marlin's overparenting and provides his first real test. Thomas Newman's serene score keeps things moving along at a beautiful pace, and the animation is as superb as anything we've come to expect from Pixar.Finding Nemo is just a delight, pure and simple. Its a lesson to kids and parents alike, but its also so colourful and funny that its a fun watch just when you're feeling flat. Perfect for all occasions."
EileenZ19,"Apr 21, 2025",10/10,"I love this movie. I really like fish, and I both have my own large fish tank and have had the experience of going to the dentist and seeing a fish tank there. The portrayal of the dentist fish tank in this movie was so good - it felt real. The weird tics the tank fish developed out of boredom and confinement was also really relatable. I thought the parts showing the filter and algae growth, and all the components of the tank, were true to reality. The ocean was also really well done. It felt so real, without ever making you lose sight of the fact that this is supposed to be a cartoon. The reef is portrayed accurately, while also adding ""human"" components, like referring to it as a neighborhood, having a school, etc. So much of this movie felt very realistic. But at the same time, you have cartoon elements, like sea creatures who talk. The characters are great - the worried father, the smothered son, the wacko but good-hearted friend, the classic dentist, the surfer-like sea turtle, and the list goes on. The movie deals with important themes of love and loss, the consequences of over-protectiveness, and the vulnerability that comes with love and letting go. The movie is called Finding Nemo, but it's really Marlin's story. The film is also really funny. Some of the situations are just so ridiculous (intentionally so), and others are more subtle. There's suspense and danger as well. Dory is one of my all time favorite characters. She has major issues, but she is so kind and loyal, good humored, clever, and funny. Ellen DeGeneres is perfect for this part. I also love Crush. His appearance in the movie is brief, and he outwardly seems like a stereotypical ""surfer dude"", but inside he's so wise. The attention to detail throughout is excellent. Don't miss this movie."
g-bodyl,"Oct 14, 2008",10/10,"Finding Nemo is a very good animated film, probably it's in the top 10 animated features of all time. The story is about a little clown fish named Nemo. He ventures out into the open sea while not listening to his father. He gets captured by a dentist and now his father, marlin has to save him from the clutches of the dentist and his ""evil"" niece. The story of the film is unbelievable. I don't know how a movie about a fish can be very popular. The voice acting is pretty good. The all-star cast did a great job voicing their characters. The music in this film is sweet. The music will lure you more into the movie. The song in the film is great for people who like music 40 years ago. Once again, Pixar did not fail in its ability to make classic animated films. Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 10/10."

Victor Field,"Oct 25, 2003",N/A,"A number of folks have complained about ""Finding Nemo"" not being up to the standards of ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" - and it's true that it's not perfect; when you think about it, the Andrew Stanton/Bob Peterson/David Reynolds script has a slightly similar plot to the adventures of Buzz, Woody et al (for a toy being taken read a little clownfish missing). Plus the movie suffers from a few too many climaxes (probably because unlike most American animated features, this has a three-figure running time), and there's a definite sign of a formula to Pixar movies.But we'd be so much better off if all movies had it: Pixar movies have proper screenplays, packed with wit and warmth (and restraint - like the pinnacle of the climax of ""A Bug's Life,"" the horrible incident that launches the movie takes place off screen); they have good casts performing the characters, with a particular nod here to Ellen DeGeneres, Geoffrey Rush, Barry Humphries and Willem Dafoe (though one wishes Nemo had a bit more dimension to him); they have plenty of effort put into the look of the movie (one of the strongest achievements is that the undersea world of the Pacific is a lot more comforting than the dry land world of Australia, so that you feel alarmed whenever the action cuts to Sydney); and they have the sense to not go overboard with any cultural references.It has to be said that it's a bit slow going at first, but fears that it'll be Pixar's first real disappointment are soon allayed; with some impressive animation, plenty of fine moments throughout and a wonderful score from Thomas Newman that gives the proceedings a breath of fresh musical air after his cousin Randy's efforts (so when can we expect David Newman to work for Pixar?), this ultimately ends up as another good effort from the bouncing lamp - who else would have a family movie include the music credit ""'The Murder' Written By Bernard Herrmann"" (it serves as the ""theme"" for an Elmyra Duff type who Nemo's in great danger from in the air-breathers' world)? It goes without saying that staying for the closing titles is a must, Robbie Williams's undesired song notwithstanding - no ""outtakes"" this time, but never mind.""I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine. And he shall be my Squishy."""
narenbalaji,"Jul 31, 2008",10/10,"Pixar makes the best animated films and Finding Nemo is one more jewel in their crown. Like most Pixar movies, Finding Nemo too deals with universal themes  parenting, father-son relationship & friendship. With his crisp, funny & sometimes thought-provoking dialogues, director Andrew Stanton takes you on an adventure ride under the rich and colorful sea full of interesting creatures. This movie is so engrossing that you sometimes forget it is just an animation, especially when you see animated characters display genuine human emotions. Dory is the most unforgettable character I've come across in animated movies. Other characters too remain etched in your memory long after you've seen the movie. This movie certainly deserves a spot among the top movies of this century."
hbbio,"Oct 21, 2003",7/10,"Finding Nemo is just an average animation movie. Unlike its predecessors, it's aimed only at kids; the plot is very thin. I watched this just a day after Miyazaki's Spirited Away, and Finding Nemo pales by comparison. I find this movie particularily overrated and I would still recommend it for kids."
Dockelektro,"Dec 6, 2003",10/10,"God bless Pixar. I am not really religious, but for Pixar, I'll convert. Because they are the precious few, part of the species of that rare kind of filmmakers who necessarily have to check out every detail, every bit and particle of their work, and necessarily turn all of them into sheer brilliancy. Today, Pixar has accostumed us to a pattern of quality beyond measure, not only because their work needs special attention but also because the technical part is only a vessel to something much important: a heart. And since every Pixar film requires half a life and half a soul to make from each and everyone of its founding craftsmen, the results are so exquisite and unique that no other movie can be compared to them. One may wonder about their ""secret"". No secret. Just real feeling and love to their job. ""Finding Nemo"" is the new crowning jewel in Pixar's flawless hall of fame, again a movie based on the buddy formula we love so much, this time in a whole new world: the ocean depths. And the prospect of doing a movie in this setting is probably something for the Pixar artists to drool on: just imagine all the quirky ideas they can have in this unexplored realm. And they deliver, big time. Once more, the filmmakers never opt for the obvious, delivering always the right choices, always turning the right way, and once more transforming all of us mere viewers into big children, just marvelling into the beautiful sights and sounds of the big blue. And they make us travel into all aspects of the possible journey, surprising even the most visionary viewer. The result is one of the most warm movies of the year, one of those movies that makes you come out with a smile and makes you forget about all your problems. If movies are a way to make you feel better, then doctors should be out giving prescriptions of Finding Nemo. Combining intelligence, entertainment and art into one is a gift that few have. Pixar does it a naturally as breathing. And once again the result is nothing short of amazing. Movie magic at its best."
Vinny-28,"Jun 5, 2003",1/10,"If your idea of family entertainment is a nonstop series of intense action sequences--almost getting eaten by a shark, almost getting eaten by another fish, almost being eaten by jellyfish, being eaten by a whale--then go ahead and sit through this headache of quick cuts, loud sound effects, and screaming characters.  You know, you could cut out half of these cliffhanger sequences and give us some characterization or some sweet memorable moments. Now THAT would be a good family film.  This is the most visually striking of all Pixar movies, and the most disappointing as a family entertainment. Pass this one up if you have younger children, please!"
98nurdinm-1,"Mar 4, 2005",8/10,"""Finding Nemo"" is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful films you are ever likely to see. Next time you watch it, try this for an idea. Press your mute button and watch it without sound for a while, particularly the scene where Mr.Ray (Bob Peterson) takes all the little fish, including Nemo (Alexander Gould), through the coral reef towards the infamous drop off. It's still as enjoyable!The film starts off quite darkly, which is odd considering the nature of the rest of the film - quite light-hearted. It is, however, an essential part of the story, explaining how the fear of Marlin (Albert Brooks) towards the ocean came about, and also as a result the over-protectiveness he has over his son, Nemo.The storyline itself is pretty simple: Nemo gets captured by a scuba-diving dentist, Marlin swims off to rescue him. What helps the story is the many different and fantastic characters that he meets along the way to ""P Sherman, 42 Wallabe Way, Sydney"". This is of course where he meets the fantastic Dory (played here brilliantly by Ellen DeGeneres). Dory is quite possibly one of the funniest characters in a Pixar movie EVER. Her short-term memory loss is an inspired comedic characteristic that results in some great lines. For example:""It (the memory problem) runs in my family. At least I think it does. Hmm. Where are they? Can I help you?""There are other good characters in this story, though. there are the three friendly sharks, whose motto is ""Fish are friends, not food"". This proves to be their undoing, particularly Bruce's (Barry Humphries - you know, Dame Edna Everage?), resulting in a good chase sequence through a sunken submarine and mine field. We have the school of fish who enjoy making exciting 3d moving pictures (voiced singularly by John Ratzenberger, Pixar's lucky mascot). And of course you cannot forget the ""Righteous! Righteous!"" sea turtles.Nemo meets interesting characters in the dentist's aquarium as well, including Gill (Willhelm Daefoe), who is constantly trying to get back into the ocean from whence he came. The rest are all pretty much bonkers - a cleanliness obsessed fish, a smelly blowfish, and a schizophrenic fish whose ""sister"", Flo, appears every time she looks through the glass of the aquarium.Finally we have the non-swimming characters. The dentist is probably responsible for the scene where more people became scared of them then Laurence Olivier's performance in ""Marathon Man"". His removal of the tooth of the ""Prime Minister"" is a great line that doesn't register first time around. This is probably because Nigel (Geforry Rush) has just crashed into the window. Very funny, and also a rather interestingly detailed knowledge of dentistry. Finally there is the movie's token ""villain"" of sorts - Darla, the dentist's niece, and now famous for been associated with the ""Psycho"" theme for young people.The movie is enjoyable every time you watch it. Throughout it we see the change in attitude towards the ocean in Marlin's behaviour and dialog, and Dory is always there beside him to provide yet another witty comment. (My girlfriend particularly likes the one about men asking for directions). It is also interesting to note that the final opponent to the success of this magnificent quest is humans themselves - in this case, fishermen. Just as in ""Bambi"" with the hunter and his mother - sniff - we are portrayed as heartless predators who are tampering with the beauty of nature. The fact that there is no dialogue or anything at all characteristic about the two fishermen makes the anonymity of them even more sinister.Overall, a brilliant movie. Watch it. Watch it again. It rocks! And remember, ""just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming...""9/10"
joshuaroulane95,"Feb 18, 2015",10/10,"I really enjoyed this movie from day one. I can't help but to find myself watching 'NEMO"" every now and again. This movie has a great story line, and will keep you anxious based on the characters. I will have to say that ""DORI"" played by the wonderful Ellen DeGeneres would be my favorite character in the whole movie. I love how comedic she is. She is clumsy, forgetful, and well you will just have to watch the movie to really she how funny she is. This movie is perfect for all ages, I'm 19 and I still watch it. I can't tell you how excited I am for the movie ""Finding Dori""to come out. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Definitely a 10/10."
acedj,"Dec 13, 2019",10/10,"Long have I loved this movie. This is the story of a lovable, yet over protective clown fish and his son, Marlon and Nemo respectively. On the first day of school, Nemo is taken off the reef by a dentist from Sydney. Marlon sets out to rescue his son. On the way he quite literally runs into a Blue Dart named Dory. Dory has a disorder where she can not retain short term memories. The two set out together and hilarity ensues. This is a Disney owned movie so of course there are some touching moments as well as a happy ending, but the substance of the movie is phenomenal. The detail the animators put into it is fantastic. They also manage to squeeze in some Easter eggs, and not all of them are Pixar/Disney related. The great white shark is named Bruce, which was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. To me there is no better film in the realm of animation out there, before or after."
Lloydee98,"Nov 7, 2018",10/10,"""Finding Nemo"" can be defined by the word ""perfect."" The reason is because that is how the film balances drama, comedy and adventure with perfect story and voice acting, especially Ellen DeGeneres' Dory."
zkonedog,"Mar 7, 2017",10/10,"There have always been three reasons why these animated Pixar films have appealed to us all so much. First, of course, is the fact that they are just plain so much fun. Second, is that they have a message that tugs on the heartstrings of young and old. Finally, they are full of humor for both the target children and the adults watching with them. ""Finding Nemo"" is no exception to any of those categories.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees young clownfish Nemo (Alexander Gould) accidentally become separated from his over-protective father Marlin (Albert Brooks). As Nemo has his own adventures in a tropical fish tank owned by a dentist, Marlin begins his quest to rescue his young son, along the way running into the memory-challenged Dory (Ellen Degeneres) who ultimately shows him a new perspective on life.Visually, ""Finding Nemo"" is stunning. Watching it on blu-ray is truly a visual treat, with the underwater landscapes and their various colors making this effort perhaps the best-looking Pixar flick ever.In terms of humor, ""Nemo"" has enough moments that will have the kids giggling as well as the adults chuckling. It can be a very serious movie at times, but it never forgets to mix a healthy dose of fun into the proceedings.The main plot line--Marlin looking for Nemo--turns out to be quite an emotional punchline, as Marlin slowly begins to discover the things he needs to do different if/when he finds his son.Overall, ""Finding Nemo"" deserves a place towards the highest ranking of Pixar endeavors. Though nothing may ever quite top ""Toy Story"", ""Nemo"" belongs on that ""1-B"" slot right along with ""WALL-E"" and ""Up""."
garethvk,"May 28, 2003",N/A,"The technical magicians at Pixar are back with the new animated film `Finding Nemo' that tells the story of a loving but overprotective Clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks), as he ventures out into the deep ocean to save his son Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has been taken from his home by divers.The loss of Nemo is devastating to Marlin as he lost his wife and all of their eggs save for Nemo and has become very timid in the time since and he fears venturing beyond the safe confines of his home area.Driven by the love for his son, Marlin sets out to follow the boat that has taken his son, even though it takes him deep into the dangerous Ocean and forces him to confront his own fears to save his son. Along the way Marlin encounters Dory (Ellen DeGeneris), a sweet but very absent-minded fish who tags along with Marlin to provide comedy relief for the story.There is also a very good side story involving Nemo and a group of fish in a tank as they bond and try to formulate the grand escape to freedom and return Nemo to his father.What follows is a very funny and charming story as the two fish encounter everything from sharks in a 12 Step program trying to change their image to a migration of surfer dude turtles. Of course there are dangers along the way and parents should be cautioned that some scenes did cause tears from some of the very young viewers in the screener that I attended.While the plot is not the most complex story in the world, it is more than appropriate for the target audience of the film and there are more than enough laughs and smiles in the film to keep even the most jaded adult tuned in. The computer artistry is amazing as it is awash in motion, textures, and colors without being to frantic and providing an array of amazing visuals. I was very impressed at how each creature had detailed facial expressions that carried their emotions without having to rely heavily on the dialogue to convey feelings. In summary, `Finding Nemo' is an absolutely charming film and a true family classic that should not be missed. The film is easily the best work ever from Pixar, and that is saying something with their very impressive resume.4 stars out of 5Gareth Von Kallenbach"
KineticSeoul,"Dec 8, 2012",6/10,"I remember the first time I saw this Pixar movie when it first came out when I was in elementary school. I thought it was alright back then but nothing special. And didn't have the impact on me during my childhood like the movie ""Lion King"" or the first ""Toy Story"" did. Didn't think it was a bad film back then but wasn't enthusiastic about it to the point I wanted to see it a second time. Now seeing it again as an adult in 3D my opinions about this movie is still about the same but I appreciate it a bit more. So the story is about a Clown fish that loses his only son and he goes across the ocean with a friend fish named Dory played by Ellen DeGeneres. Who did a amazing job with her role, in fact her character stood out the most in the whole movie. And through the journey it shows what Nemo is going through after being captured by the humans but mostly shows Nemo's dad's journey with clever fish scenarios thrown in different areas. And the clever scenarios mixed in with different fishes is what drives this movie. Overall it was a alright movie and you can tell quite a bit of effort has been thrown into this animated flick. But it didn't really have that impact to make it all that memorable.6.9/10"
cornwellbell,"Nov 4, 2003",7/10,Decent Disney film that is fine for the whole family but lacks the heart and style of the other pixar films that came before it. The voice acting by all involved is great and the animation is as clear and precise as ever but it lacks a lot of what the first two Toy Stories had and lacks the heart that made those movies such landmarks in the first place.It's a good movie but it really not as good as some people made it out to be.
C42K3,"Nov 20, 2003",2/10,"I'm 27 years old and I have a 9 year old daughter.  For some strange reason, she didn't want to see Finding Nemo when it came to the theaters, so i said cool, i'll just buy the dvd when it comes out.....big mistake.  I should have listened to my daughter. She hated it along with my 2 nieces, ages 3 & 4, and my nephew, age 5.  The animation was beautiful but the story was.....well.....just BORING.  About 30 minutes into the movie, they were ready to watch something else and frankly, so was I."
truemythmedia,"Jun 21, 2019",10/10,"Finding Nemo still remains as a Pixar classic. Near perfect animation and writing bring this vivid ocean world to life. With a vast array of fun characters and set pieces it is impossible to become bored, the humor spreads across every age range, from one of the most perfectly timed fart jokes, to Crush the turtle saying he waxes his shell, there's never a shortage of belly laughs. Pixar really nails down their message with his how far a father is willing to go to save his son, with an underlying theme of teamwork and acceptance. This is a film for animation and non animation fans alike, there's something in it for everyone, as it's just an absolute gem of a movie."
OllieSuave-007,"Feb 12, 2015",9/10,"This is a fun-filled Disney/Pixar movie that is pretty much on par with the Toy Story trilogy. It's a story about a clown fish named Marlin, who swims through the vast ocean in search of his son, Nemo, who was taken by a diver for a pet. Along the way, he meets a blue tang fish with short term memory loss named Dory, who joins him in the search. What follows is an incredible adventure full of dodging sharks, riding with turtles, swimming past jellyfish and trying to go through other obstacles to search for Nemo, while he himself tries to deal with life being somebody's pet.Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich did a great job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention from the start with a dramatic intro, followed by one adventurous scene after the other, making the plot very fast-paced and exciting. The story quickly identifies the issue of Nemo being pretty rebellious and the issue of worrying about his father's fear of the vast open sea. The tide turns within the story as Nemo is fished out of water and Marlin ends up taking the sea on to find him. All these plot elements and unpredictable moments make this an edge-of-the-ride film from start to finish.The entire voice cast did a great job in their respective roles, making the characters very lovable. Ellen DeGeneres did a hilarious and upbeat job in voicing Dory (you could see Ellen's humorous personality in the fish) and Willem Dafoe did a mysterious yet caring portrayal in voicing Gill, who tries to keep a lookout for Nemo. I especially enjoyed seeing the every day human traits and dialog being acted out in these sea creatures, making the movie that much funnier. In addition, the music score from Thomas Newman is quite spirited and the animation team did a spectacular job in capturing the splendor of the sea.I thought, though, the story goes too fast at times, leaving little room for the audience to generate sympathy during the more tense and solemn moments, and I thought some of the characters acted a little too excited. But overall, it's a very fun and heartwarming Disney tale that is great for the entire family!Grade A-"
grantss,"Nov 7, 2014",8/10,"An animation classic.Good family fun from Disney and Pixar. Entertaining from start to finish, with a touch of emotion too. Some funny moments and a rollicking story. Hardly slows down for a moment.Superb animation - such vivid colours, and a seamless movement effect. Certainly a far cry from the old colour-in-inside-the-lines animation.However, it is probably the voices that make the movie. Superb casting in this regard. Ellen DeGeneres steals the show as Dory but every voice is well-chosen and spot-on. Filled with stars too, so it is often a case of spot-the-voice: Willem Dafoe, Albert Brooks, Geoffrey Rush, Allison Janney, Stephen Root.Kids will love this, and so too will adults."
joey_corner,"Jun 3, 2019",10/10,"I loved Finding Nemo ever since I was a little. (It was probably one of the first films I've ever seen). Finding Nemo has beautiful and breathtaking animation, the ocean looks absolutely fantastic! The film also has a great message about parenting, memorable and likable characters and has a heartfelt and funny script. Finding Nemo is definitely one of Pixar's best!"
udeaasykle,"Jan 24, 2004",10/10,"This is a great movie, and i don't see how anyone can say differently. Pixar has once again made magic using cg. I swear sometimes it is hard to see the difference between computer animations and real film. I find that especially the ocean is masterfully done. If you haven't already seen this movie, go see it now!"
EricVierthaler92,"Jan 26, 2011",6/10,"I don't hate this movie but it's not as perfect as everybody says it is. When I first saw it I loved it but looking back on it, it just doesn't hold up to me as it did before. I can understand why Marlin is so over protective over his son because he lost his wife and other kids. But for one Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) was annoying. A lot of people say that Dory is funny but I disagree I thought she was irritating. I just wanted to strangle her. She kept on forgetting everything. At around the end of the movie she says to Marlin (Nemo's dad) that she ""Remembers stuff whenever she's around her"" Um I have to call BS on that because the only thing she could remember was Sydney and she couldn't remember anything else. And the sharks. The sharks are hypocrites. They say that ""Fish are friends! Not food!"" but you clearly see a shark with fish bones in its mouth. That's really hypocritical! Sometimes Marlin got annoying with how overprotective he was. I mean god I thought Simba was over protective in Lion King 2 but Marlin tops him! The music in the movie is nothing special. You might think that I hate this movie because of the negative things I have said about it no I don't hate it. I liked the turtles, the birds that repeatedly said ""Mine!"", the main character that was a bird that helped Marlin and Dory. The plot was good enough to keep me interested but as I have said, it's overrated. Doesn't top Toy Story 1-3. So I give Finding Nemo a 6 out of 10."
C22Man,"Jan 26, 2016",8/10,"Upon its release Finding Nemo solidified Pixar's position as the masters of animation. Just like they did with Toy Story, they'd crafted another fine film that was packed with everything for children and adults alike. On a technical level it is a masterclass, but it also provided a flowing story and a wide variety of characters that it was easy to get invested in. The story concerns overprotective clown fish Marlin whose son Nemo is taken by divers and he then purses them across the ocean. Along the way he meets a fish with short-term memory loss named Dory, sharks who have quit eating fish and a party of sea turtles. The film is effectively Marlin's journey and the colourful characters he meets who help him on his way, whilst Nemo tries to escape from the dentist fish-tank that he's ended up in. The story is straight-forward, but it is packed with so much emotion and excitement that it works to its advantage.The plot works like a road trip movie, we continually come across some colourful characters and we move on, except that there is a goal to achieve at the end of it all. What really makes the story work is that it addresses the connection between a father and son as well as knowing when it's time to let your son have his own adventures. This helps give the film a strong emotional centre not just for the turmoil that Marlin and Nemo have been put through, but also for Dory who simply wants someone to stand by her. Working with the plot is the animation which is truly superb, some of Pixar's most impressive. The ocean can look both overwhelmingly beautiful and incredibly dangerous, while they really capture the vastness of the deep seas pretty perfectly. The colour scheme is also wonderful, everything from the bright character designs to the coral reef simply leaps off the screen in a wash of beauty.With that said, it's the characters that truly make the film shine. Marlin is a typically anxious and neurotic father, but he's never a stick in the mud. He always appears to be very genuine and the journey he's willing to undertake for his son makes him so likable. Dory (a brilliant Ellen DeGeneres) makes a fantastic companion. You'd think her memory loss would get annoying but it's kept fresh thanks to her bright sense of humour and her almost childlike wonder at the world which is surprisingly endearing. Nemo is a pleasant innocent and his enthusiasm is charming, whilst the tank gang are all very enjoyable especially the mysterious Gill. I also enjoyed the tanks pelican friend Nigel and the three sharks that come together like an AA meeting to discuss giving up fish. Virtually all of these characters are different and memorable, having interesting designs and distinctive personalities.Another big positive is the score by Thomas Newman. It is simply lovely. It manages to convey the wide-eyed wonder of the underwater world beautifully thanks to the gorgeous melodies and soothing compositions. There's a real sense of adventure to it that brings you into the ocean world even more and it manages to heighten the excitement at times perfectly. The film also has many memorable lines and inspired comedic pieces. Many of these were so successful that they are now widely known in pop culture, whether it the seagulls constantly repeating ''Mine!'' or the tanks outrageous escape plan. To be fair to it, the film has very few weaknesses. The lack of an over-arching villain isn't an issue because of the type of film it is and both stories are given the perfect amount of screen time.It's fair to say that Finding Nemo is up there with Pixar's best films. It excels in pretty much every area that matters because it does what Pixar does best, which is craft a gripping adventure that is packed with plenty of comedy and emotion. This is a story that is very easy to be engaged in and the massive amount of characters all manage to get enough development. So when the two key areas are as strong as they are here then the film is already on the right road. Adding to that, the animation is some of Pixar's most expressive, the score is wonderful and the film is simply very memorable. There is just something so gripping and rather timeless about the films approach that makes it such a success."
sreeragmeppadath,"May 28, 2019",6/10,"It has a good story.Rather than that,it's not funny or interesting.Can't understand why it's overrated"
MidtownBettie,"Aug 4, 2003",3/10,"The character ""Dory"" was depicted with symptoms of early-stage Alzheimer Disease. That is heartbreaking, not amusing or entertaining. Yet another sign of some deep, sinister perversity in the Disney organisation. Every time I go to a Disney movie, I do so in a state of innocent anticipation, and every time I'm bitten by their warped morality. The Lion King was another case in point. The fact that these things are aimed at children and vetted approvingly by parents who seem oblivious to the underlying theme forces one really to consider to what extent movies like this are a reflection of the values of modern Western society, - or whether they work to bring about those values. Either way, I would be less frightened of the future if they where more frequently subjected to the accusatory criticism they deserve."
EijnarAmadeus,"Apr 6, 2004",10/10,"Pixar Studios is one of the world's most exciting and cool film studios. They deliver every single time for the whole family; fun, dramatic, brilliance, entertainment, moral...everything! Before this instalment Pixar has given us TOY STORY 1/2, A BUG'S LIFE and MONSTERS INC. that's all extremely good films! This, last one, FINDING NEMO is just as jolly good!We follow Marlin, a clown-fish that's on a desperat look for his only child, Nemo, that as said before is the only survivor after their family was brutally attacked by a barracuda and almost everybody were eaten. Marlin hooks up with another fish that shows herself to have extremely bad memory and forgets thing almost before she's get to know them! Now, these two goes on the search of Nemo, who's lost in the big blue ocean, where there are sharks, bombs, whales, birds and much more!The story is this time probably the best detail, off course together with the humour that is also brilliant fun! It is packed with funny scenes and the animation is getting more and more stunning, the dialogs are brilliant, everything works as good as it gets! Dozens of genius characters are packed into this story. It is a very choosy movie and it keeps up it's entertainment in a very fine way, the only thing that's something to put anything on is the end, that's really nothing. But the rest of the movie is pure entertainment and is very, very nice watching!FINDING NEMO's got entire scenes. Like the one with the three sharks that has decided to form a club where they have to promise that they shall not eat other fishes, cause that's cannibalism. Either it's small characters or big, they're all over the place! You laugh a lot, and if it isn't funny, it's just so entertaining or nice made that you can't keep your eyes off the screen. As the movie goes by you feel a small piece of boring in the middle, but FINDING NEMO fixes it with smacking some more characters and keeping the tempo up and keeping the paralell - story interesting with Nemo actually being caught in a aquarium together with other fishes.STARS: 5/5"
kate-stuart,"May 15, 2023",10/10,"I may be one of the few people out there that doesn't love Finding Nemo, it was ok but it didn't really do anything for me.First and foremost, it is GORGEOUS. The colors are striking, the blue tones of the water are realistic at times mesmerizing and the movements of the various creatures are realistic and fluid.Most importantly though is the story. Nemo's journey is one of self discovery, of living with a disability and all of the hurdles that creates in your life. It's about the way it makes others look at you and how she overcomes that. Not with some miracle cure that instantly solves everything or erases the issue altogether in the end, but with honest to goodness character growth."
uniVerse-4,"Apr 16, 2005",10/10,"I've seen this movie at least twice, parts of it four or five times...the humor resonates on all levels (not just age levels, but visual versus audio, double indentures. etc, and reflects realities of modern industrial family and existential experience; it's a simple but great story line (although, much of the entertainment is in a series of vignettes; characters you (well, sort of) care about; spectacular animation. The casting of actors doing the voices is about as good as it gets. One of the amazing things for me in watching this movie a second and third time was the subtleties in the facial expressions and these animated characters. I highly recommend this movie - even for people (such as myself) who don't normally care for animated films."
sean-travers,"Oct 4, 2015",8/10,"Twelve years after its release, Finding Nemo still holds up beautifully in terms of animation. The water effects and the way its variety of colourful marine creatures navigate its bright blue depths is beautiful to behold. Finding Nemo isn't just about style though. As expected with a Pixar entry, there's depth here too (and not just in terms of the ocean). Nemo teaches children about being resourceful and the strength of parental love; while surely holding resonance for parents or anyone in a close mentor role to someone young.The voice cast is fantastic. Brooks and Gould give powerful, emotional performances while DeGeneres became a fan favourite with her humorous performance as forgetful blue tang Dory (expect a sequel focusing on Dory in 2016). As expected, there's some good jokes and fun performances in Nemo although it's not quite as sophisticated as other Pixar offerings like the Toy Story trilogy (1995, 1999, 2010), Monster's Inc. (2002) or The Incredibles (2004). Respectively, the story is fairly formulaic and the humour gears more towards a younger crowd. Nevertheless, Nemo makes up for its shortcomings with its emotionally resonant storytelling, stunning visuals and dedicated vocal performances."
evandewangga97,"Feb 6, 2015",9/10,"Animation, maybe one of the hardest movie to be made. It's filled with the digital image, that isn't easy to be changed. Once the scene is done, the editors sometimes don't want to remade or retake it. The ""cooking"" phase is in the writing section, must be ripe enough to be served by the editorial-department. Especially, when it comes to the blockbuster of cinema, just like ""Finding Nemo"". It's not worth when the screenplay is not as good as the editing, the emptiness of amazing animated feature. But, Pixar never miss the point of great movies,e from the technology in film editing, until the deep message for the young generation. For ""Finding Nemo"", Pixar gave so much visual pleasure with the classic problem of human life. And, still holds the reality of the fish in front of human. Yes, I mean it's from the fish perspective, and it's maybe happened in animal's life, but human haven't notice it yet, even fish is not as smart as in this movie. The colorful settings bring joy to every child who watch this. Moreover, the funny scenario, just added other delicious seasoning in this Pixar first mass blockbuster.Next, to the core of the story. It's simply entertaining and cinematic. I mean this story can be told only by movie, not story or music, etc. Two points of view, with exact transition. The beginning, is honestly like a template-idea. But, just the intro, not the entire. The classic problem of family is given with humble way of cinema. A dad-son relationship, which every child probably feel it, so does the father. More than that, Pixar still gives the smart and funny comedy. Children is pleasant with the animation, story, and the comedy. What's more for them to enjoy. The film actually doesn't only takes one or two settings. It is an adventure, and has many powerful scene. Every scene with new supernumerary, but with educating characterization. Yes, why not added some sciences for children. Catchy fish in every scene, and though-provoking plot. They can't leave the cinema before the end of the movie.And, I may add some critics on this new-standard of animation. Again, maybe some blockbuster not as good as the non-visual-effects- movie. I mean it is good, not excellent. For the warm-up of studio, it is great, but let's not talk about the dimension of time. I really know the perfection of animation, but why not add some more twisting and deep plot. You know ""Toy Story"", is just what Pixar done in genius way. Focus on some deeper characterization of that extra-character and it could be really delightful. My opinion is just for another Pixar's movie. It has already got the mass-editing- experience. And it's ready to launch another classic to the upcoming generation. With that superb quality, and the developing technology, I think Pixar will be made some other ""Finding Nemo""s. And I expect with the mass-effects and wonderfully-written story.A must watch of every 2000's generation, a beginning of new era of American animation."
allendavid50,"Dec 4, 2003",10/10,"A spectacle in every way, this film is guaranteed to delight viewers of all ages. An instant classic, and an example of cinema at its most spellbinding. The animation is cutting edge, the jokes fly thick and fast, there's not too much maudlin sentiment to weigh one down, and the musical score is among the best I've heard in recent years. Flawless!"
Dingataca,"Oct 12, 2007",N/A,"Finding Nemo, Pixar's best yet. Stunning visuals, a great star cast to voice it, an original and heartwarming story, and amazing humour. What more could you want!? Every character plays an important part in Finding Nemo, as opposed to movies that focus on the protagonists. The star cast that voiced this film were purely perfect, e.g. Ellen DeGeneres for Dory! That was absolutely brilliant! She steals the show!Finding Nemo, has what some Pixar/Disney films don't have. And that is morals. They aren't forced into you, they're very subtle, but they are strong enough to keep you thinking and to make an impact on you - which I think is fabulous. The moral is: Loving your kids is great...over-loving them isn't. A moral like this makes sense for the present and I'm sure many young people would understand and relate.The film also defines ""universal"". Many universal films you see have a couple of drops of crude humour, its harmless, as its too little for young kids to understand, but it's still there. Finding Nemo is completely clean, squeaky clean in fact.Whether you're 1 or 100, Finding Nemo is sure to please. This one is definitely a must watch.Watch it! I command you!"
msh6876,"Aug 13, 2015",6/10,"As a child, I absolutely adored this movie! It was full of bright colors and talking fish! Who doesn't like talking animals? The issue came about when I turned 16, one of my friends brought her's over on VHS and we sat up and watched it together. From the very beginning we were discussing how different the movie would have been if something hadn't have happened. We did this throughout the entire movie!!!! It's sad to say, but I think I'm too old for Finding Nemo... now Finding Dory, I still plan on watching. Dory had to have been my favorite fish! I won't tell you why even though everyone has basically seen this movie, I don't want to have to claim spoilers. I wish I could claim that I still love this movie as much as I did as a kid, but once I find every small detail that could change the entire story, the movie is no longer as good. Granted, it does make for some interesting conversations as to how the movie would end."

flexiking,"May 14, 2004",7/10,"Good but not great. I have finally seen this film after much hype and I have to confess to being a little disappointed; whilst the animation is truly spectacular, the plot is flimsy and the characters (on the whole) lack genuine depth. Of course there are places where you will laugh aloud but the humour is too visual to be truly funny and the schmaltzy sentimentality that seems to pervade 90% of all children's films now made cannot be escaped from here either. To be honest, Dory is a 'one-joke' fish and the surfer-dude gag is lame horse, overdone in comedy to the point of boredom. That said, Albert Brookes is fantastic as Nemo's father and I loved the cameos from Willem Dafoe and Barry Humphries. I was expecting more - 7/10."
musre,"Jul 13, 2006",1/10,"OK, i might be a bit of a film cynic, but that's because the  overwhelming majority of wide release films are really bad. finding  nemo is a perfect example of a terrible film, that for some reason  everyone loves. what's wrong with me? OK, i'll give it the nice bright  colours and beautiful, smooth animations, but what else is there?  ""memorable characters,"" ""humour?"" certainly not! i have the distinct  feeling that dreamworks puts subliminal messages into their films to  make people like them, because its the only explanation! all my  friends, cynics, hippies, metal heads, nerds - they all loved it! WHY?  when i ask them, they'll say, ""oh it was funny..."", or ""it was  colourful..."" are they playing games with me? Please, some one explain  how this film is good? It's 2 hours long, for a cartoon, 2 hours is far  too long. It has the lamest, schmultziest story and character  development. all the ""crazy"" characters are really simple stereotypes  that have been done to death a million times before. Hey, i don't mind  if your kid liked it, my question is to the parents who claim, fun for  kids AND adults. I don't understand. the same thing happened with toy  story and shrek. Where were these so called, ""adult"" jokes? why does  everyone insist that dreamworks is so great? Argh! someone help me. or  at least someone admit they also hated this film to save me from  thinking i'm a lunatic. although, i do have an unhealthy fascination  for the moon."
pemfgi,"Apr 14, 2021",8/10,I love this movie. Finding Nemo is one of my favorites of all time - lots of humor for adults and not just children.
brionygil,"Feb 5, 2021",8/10,"They have good casts performing the characters, with a particular nod here to Ellen DeGeneres, Geoffrey Rush, Barry Humphries and Willem Dafoe (though one wishes Nemo had a bit more dimension to him); they have plenty of effort put into the look of the movie (one of the strongest achievements is that the undersea world of the Pacific is a lot more comforting than the dry land world of Australia, so that you feel alarmed whenever the action cuts to Sydney); and they have the sense to not go overboard with any cultural references.It has to be said that it's a bit slow going at first, but fears that it'll be Pixar's first real disappointment are soon allayed; with some impressive animation, plenty of fine moments throughout and a wonderful score from Thomas Newman that gives the proceedings a breath of fresh musical air after his cousin Randy's efforts (so when can we expect David Newman to work for Pixar?), this ultimately ends up as another good effort from the bouncing lamp"
anti-imperialist1194,"Jan 1, 2004",10/10,"This is truly the best animated film ever. It is pure Disney magic. In my opinion it was the best film of the summer of 2003. It also has to be the funniest Disney movie ever made. I hope there is a sequel to this. The only problem is what they are going to call it. They'll have to call it something else unless they're finding Nemo again. Anyway, getting back to this movie, I thought that the absent-minded fish Dori was the funniest character. I also thought those Seagulls that always said ""Mine"" was funny. For some reason when I first saw the movie I thought those Gulls were saying ""Mike"". Then I realized that they couldn't say ""Mike"" because it wouldn't make sense. 10/10. I always love it when Disney and Pixar work together."

Dafoe is perfect as Gill, a moorish idol, and DeGeneres is a nice touch as Dory, a Pacific regal blue tang, even with her cheap jokes of forgetfulness; and let's not forget Stanton as Crush, a green sea turtle. Especially fun for fish-enthusiasts. The scenes taking place in the dentist office aquarium are priceless! A sequel very much welcome!!***½ (out of four)"
JWick23,"Mar 19, 2021",N/A,"An enchanting experience. Kids probably will really enjoy it but for teens and adults I dunno it might be a mixed bag, It was good that I saw the movie and I enjoyed it but FOR ME it was nothing too crazy or special. And the first time I saw this film was when I was 6-7 so I ain't biased or anything it's more of a nostalgia feeling for me.Solid story filled with character exposition and adventure and had a lot of positive messages to it. There were a ton of characters actually most of them being side characters but somehow they manage to make them interesting and unique. The dynamic between father and son, Dory the short term memory fish, and the short screentime for the turtules were hilarious. The visuals were great considering the time it came out in. The animal's design, the habitats, etc. The music really matched with the movie and had great voice acting.Overall an enjoyable film.Memorable: So so (Nostalgia) Rewatchable: Maybe.."
baileycrawly,"Nov 15, 2020",6/10,"Even as a kid sitting in the theater seeing this movie not once or twice, but three times, I can distinctly remember becoming quite antsy before the end. It's a slower-paced movie than a lot of the other Pixar films and, quite frankly, it bored me a lot. My mother liked it, so I went along with it, but it was never my kind of thing.It's a beautifully animated film that's appealing to look at, and it hasn't lost a bit of its quality in that regard with the passing of time. The voice acting is great and, according to Google, it was scored by Randy Newman (who, yet again, I'm not a big fan of). But the biggest appeal of this film is Ellen Degeneres playing the forgetful fish Dory. She was the comic relief in an otherwise grim film, and I think a big part of the film's appeal relies on her and her ability to offer up the lighthearted forgetfulness and stupidity.Overall, though, even on subsequent viewings, the film doesn't really do a lot for me in terms of maintaining interest. It's most definitely worth a watch for anyone who hasn't seen it before, but it's not in my top 5 Pixar films."
Atreyu_II,"Sep 3, 2008",7/10,"I am really not big on CGI productions because what I really like are the old cartoons drawn by hand. However, ""Finding Nemo"" isn't such bad for a CGI production. It isn't ""Cars"", but it's a little better than ""Toy Story"" for example, and much better than movies like ""Shrek"", ""Madagascar"" and so on...""Finding Nemo"" is technically very acceptable. It has great graphics which make the whole scenario look so real and so natural. The story is clever and the movie has lots of dangerous adventures lived by a clownfish and a funny regal tang with memory problems. However, although the graphics are in general good thanks to its quality sceneries and well-designed various fish species, the human characters are awfully designed, especially that horrible little girl who looks like the annoying Sid from ""Toy Story"".Aside the movie's faults, generally speaking the movie is okay, entertaining enough and offers fun for everyone who's watching it. The movie has some quite funny gags, such as whenever a character says something like «He's a clownfish, but he's not funny at all». Another good joke is when Marlin is trying to tell a joke to the sharks and, while he's making a fool out of himself, he suddenly yells «Nemo!!!». Bruce (the shark) is a funny and interesting character. Bruce is a very humorous shark and he's got a funny way to invite the fishes for a dinner with his other two friends sharks. After all, «fishes are their friends».Oh, by the way, I think it's very good that for once a movie includes a blue whale, which is a very forgotten animal in animated films. It is the biggest animal on Earth and it sure is a fantastic creature.Overall, one of Pixar's best films (although not a tremendous film for me) and better than the overvalued and overrated ""Toy Story""."
cmatlin,"Jul 14, 2003",3/10,"This film uses stereotype, boring personalities to tell the story of a lost fish and his scared dad who goes to find him.  Some of the personalities (like the one played by Ellen DeGeneres) are funny at first, but quickly become over-used.  It gets tedious after a while.  Pixar makes it look like a kid's film, but the shark scenes are scarier than Jaws.  It is probably OK for teens, but not for young children."
LordHackfleisch,"Apr 27, 2024",10/10,"I remember well how I watched this movie in the cinema as a kid. I really fell in love with the characters and their environment back then. Over the years I rewatched it and at the end I always thought it's an amazing movie. Now I watched it again and I can say I'll still give it a 10/10. There could be minor improvements but on the other hand, no movie is perfect if you just look hard enough. The thing is, it's perfect to me. The animation is absolutely stunning to this day. The characters are fun and interesting. The story is something I can rewatch anytime. I love this movie and warmly recommend it to anyone."

back2wsoc,"Dec 18, 2003",N/A,"""Finding Nemo"", Pixar's latest project, is a wonderful story about the unbreakable bonds of father and son.  Clownfish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) is an overprotective father who tries to shield his underdeveloped son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) from the ills of the underwater world. One day Nemo is caught in a net by a fisherman, and with the help of a friendly and forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), the duo go about trying to locate the missing boy-fish, encountering various characters along the way (from a shark in rehab to a family of sea turtles). A wonderfully fresh and inspiring film, this box-office hit can only get better with each viewing.  A winner.  ***1/2"
paul2001sw-1,"Feb 18, 2014",6/10,"Many of the earliest screen savers were of fish tanks - so perhaps it's fitting than an early computer-animated movie should have told a story of tropical fish. Some of Pixar's movies have had dark, poetic sides to them; but 'Finding Nemo' is a straight up children's adventure, with a whole shoal of colourful characters, a fast pace, and a positive, upbeat message. A few things made me smile but to me this is vanilla Pixar; there's a one dimensional story here, with little underlying depth, and the gorgeous animation is something we have come to take for granted from this studio. Compare, for example, the opening of this film and that of their later movie 'Up'; they cover similar ground, but the later film's treatment is altogether more poignant and adult."
michellerosen-615ss,"Feb 8, 2025",9/10,"Great film. This has been a concern of intelligent filmmakers all along. Griffith merged the theatrical space with grand vistas of mass movement and did so from a spot no human would normally have. Welles and Kurosawa played with this, the first by working with architecture, the other by flattening in deep focus. But until the eighties we always had to deal with the reality of the ground -- and the horizon. The real appeal of ""Star Wars"" wasn't the cowboy story or guns, nor the pseudo-religious trappings, though we all thought it was. It was the freedom from that hard bottom, the Earth which we interact with in as consistently as breath and blood. ""Star Wars"" -- and ""2001"" before -- gave a thrill because our visual vocabulary was now expanded spatially rather than ALWAYS being referenced to the floor. Pixar's work has always been cognizant of this new frontier even when owned by Lucas. Under Jobs, every film has become more and more dimensional until now. We don't honk around with the camera as much as I would like, but we do set a new standard for interacting space. Naturally, all else is well crafted but serves this notion of space ? Especially the fishtank business.9/10."
Agent10,"Jun 11, 2003",7/10,"Pixar can never do wrong, it will never do wrong, and it will make money from any movie it makes. Without a stellar voice cast or an obnoxious ad campaign, this movie proved that Pixar doesn't need to hype its own films anymore. I really thought this film would be a sinker, but the first week grosses proved otherwise. What I do admire about this film were the underwater sequences, which proved to be rather vibrant and more cutting edge than the previous Pixar films. While being a cynical 20-something, I can't say the film was particularly brilliant beyond visual appeal and animation, but for the younger kids, this is definitely quality entertainment a parent can take their child to."
lound,"Nov 5, 2003",5/10,"Graphics/animation top notch - as one would expect from Pixar. Story and characters puerile, saccharine and thus nauseating - in the post-modern Disneyesque tradition.That it has reached the IMDB top 250 is inexplicable, and is perhaps as much a reflection on the moronic followers of cuteseyness as it is of those who rate state-of-the-art animation. Great for kids under 12 I suppose.Otherwise, pass me the sick bag.Crusty"
jpismyname,"Jan 15, 2023",10/10,"Finding Nemo may be my favorite Pixar movie. I've first seen it as a kid in 2003, and I instantly got obsessed with it and I've watched it numerous times.Finding Nemo is about a clownfish named Marlin and his son Nemo living in the ocean. Nemo is then captured by us humans, and Marlin is desperate to find his son, who is ""imprisoned"" in an aquarium in a dental clinic in Australia.The characters are perfectly voiced by Albert Brooks and Alexander Gould. Ellen is also charming as the voice of the hilarious Blue Hippo Tang with short-term memory loss named Dory. The movie is animated beautifully with a moving soundtrack composed by Thomas Newman.Finding Nemo is an unforgettable film that will still capture the hearts of many in the years to come."
joangil-91050,"Mar 5, 2021",8/10,"The story drives this more than the special effects.Love the story!Once more, the film guys never opt for the obvious, delivering always the right choices, always turning the right way, and once more transforming all of us mere viewers into big children, just marvelling into the beautiful sights and sounds of the big blue.And they make us travel into all aspects of the possible journey, surprising even the most visionary viewer. The result is one of the most warm movies of the year, one of those movies that makes you come out with a smile and makes you forget about all your problems. If movies are a way to make you feel better, then doctors should be out giving prescriptions of Finding Nemo. Combining intelligence, entertainment and art into one is a gift that few have. Pixar does it a naturally as breathing. And once again the result is nothing short of amazing."
msanders97,"Apr 1, 2015",10/10,"Finding Nemo is the compelling story of a fish taken by divers, and his dad searches the entire ocean looking for his son. This movie it great for all ages. A 4 years old and an 84 year old will be entertained by he touching story of this movie. It is here kids learn it is okay to accept help, the ones who truly love you will never give up on you, and just keep swimming, no matter what never give up. I give this movie two thumbs up and would recommend it to anybody. This movie is a Disney classic. I have nothing bad to say about it. The animation is astounding for the time the movie came out. As a result of this movie kids all over the world go to aquariums looking to find Nemo and Dory. Maybe they will find a 100 year old sea turtle as well. This movie is not only entertaining but education as well. This move is unforgettable."

cinephile-27690,"Jul 8, 2018",10/10,"For what, unbelievably, is my 100th review*, I am reviewing a movie that is 100 minutes long!I have seen this many times in my life. In theaters, at home, on TV, even in 5th grade, it was my teacher's favorite movie. It came to a point where I was ""see-sick"" of Finding Nemo. But I still viewed it, and somehow it is now in my top 10 favorite Disney movies. Now that I am 19, not 4 going on 5, as I was when this released, there are many things I get now then when I was a kid. Inside jokes, like Nemo being in a school of fish. ""Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own...""-""SHH! "" stuff like that. I have a friend who prefers to mainly watch Christian movies but a friend showed her this and she loves it, too!

CinemaClown,"Oct 7, 2013",N/A,"Marking the biggest leap for Pixar Animation Studios since their groundbreaking debut with Toy Story in 1995, Finding Nemo brings a whole new level of maturity in Pixar's method of storytelling, a new surge in its humour, creativity & imagination, and another elevation in its already unparalleled animation to succeed not only as one of the best films of its genre but is also exceptional enough to be regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.Finding Nemo tells the story of Marlin; a clownfish residing in the Great Barrier Reef who's very overprotective of his son, Nemo. When Nemo is captured by scuba divers & taken to Sydney, Marlin sets out on a journey throughout the ocean to find his son, is joined by Dory; an optimistic blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss, encounters many more dangers & adventures and in the process, learns to appreciate life a lot more than ever before.Directed by Andrew Stanton, Finding Nemo is drop-dead gorgeous from the first frame to the last, is crafted with immense care, passion & love, has a surprising level of depth in its story, is filled with characters that are rich, charismatic & colourful, captures ocean life unlike ever before in cinema history, brims with clever use of humour, expertly balances its storytelling aspects with jaw-dropping animation and has something in store for viewers of all ages.It's pretty evident from its presentation that Pixar's production design team did a massive amount of research before animating it on the film canvas, the camera-work is jubilantly carried out & fills the screen with vivid colours. Editing makes sure every single scene plays a relevant role in pushing its story forward & steadily paces its 100 minutes of runtime while Thomas Newman's score makes the whole experience all the more touching, mesmerising & emotionally resonant.The level of precision, sharpness & detailing in its animation is no short of an achievement, every single character is skilfully drawn & rendered whether it's the shark, whale, turtles or jellyfish, and is perfectly voiced by its terrific voice cast. And while everyone shines in their given roles, it's Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who turns out to be the show-stealer for she is without a doubt one of the most optimistic characters to surface on the silver screen.On an overall scale, Finding Nemo is love at first sight. It's a stunning, bewitching, magical, emotionally rich & truly unforgettable cinema that has a lot to say about parenting, friendship, trust & determination and sets a higher benchmark for its genre. One of Pixar's biggest home-runs on critical, commercial & emotional scale, Finding Nemo is a spellbinding underwater adventure that you'll want to experience again n again. 'Sea' it to believe it."
shawash,"Jul 17, 2004",6/10,Lets take a look. Finding nemo had no mother because she died. Toy story had no Father. Beauty and the beast had no mother. Simba (Kimba) lost his father. And yet there is no explination or coming to terms with the missing parents (I don't think Simba came to terms with anything). I disliked this movie because it seemed like the same old Disney rant of some one is in trouble and needs help cause they're lost. Guess I just like good animation with an excellent story. Story is a 1/10... animation is a 8/10... Have a good day. Yeah!. Fun! Watch Totoro instead. !!
nightwatch4773,"Mar 31, 2013",9/10,"I used to laugh when friends and girlfriends over the years watched these animated films but since I've turned into a daddy in 2008, I've sort of been forced into watching. Enough of that lets get to Finding Nemo. I LOVED it!!!!! what a great film to watch with my four year old son. It was perfect two boys watching two male fishes in search of each other. It was just a perfect viewing.I just love how the daddy of Nemo just wouldn't give up his search for his son. It was very sweet and I will say a couple tears did flow down my cheeks. My son caught the tears and said ""Daddy why are you crying"". Great stuff and a viewing experience never to be forgotten. Thanks Pixar!!!!!"

It's a great story with SO many lessons for parents and kids littered throughout. It's not my favorite Pixar movie, not even close, but ya know, everything Pixar pumps out is pretty much a solid ten."
schwanny,"Apr 12, 2004",2/10,"Honestly, I do not understand why so many people love this movie. I can normally watch a disney movie and enjoy myself, but this one simply did not entertain me. First of all, I noticed in Finding Nemo was that there were not any songs. most disney movies have parts where the charectors break into song, not in Finding Nemo. Secondly, I found some of the charectors quite annoying, especially the blue fish. Lastly, the worse thing about Finding Nemo is that so many people talk like it was the best kids movie ever made. Because of this i was expecting another entertaining, fun, and enjoyable kids movie, but instead i wasted an hour and a half of my life."
jafar-iqbal,"Sep 23, 2013",9/10,"When his only child Nemo (Alexander Gould) is captured by divers in the Great Barrier Reef, his extremely shy and anxiety-ridden father (Marlin) sets out on a journey to rescue him. Along the way, he meets many friends and foes, including Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with a short-term memory.After 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' is probably the Pixar movie everyone likes to talk about. It took me ten years to watch it, but it was well worth the wait. 'Finding Nemo' is a very good film. What makes the movie so good is what has made so many other Pixar movies so good – the emotion. Yes, visually, it's brilliant (and we'll get on to that), but that Pixar crowd has this amazing ability to tell great stories.In what has become a staple of the company, this film centres on the bond between two characters – in this case, father and son. The opening sequence is heartbreaking, and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The strength of that first scene is such that we invest in the relationship Marlin and Nemo have. We believe in Marlin's fear and Nemo's rebellion. I'd argue that Pixar were able to capture that emotion with much more depth in 'Up', but this was perfectly fine for a first attempt.More than the two leads, the show is stolen by the character of Dory. I've never seen Ellen DeGeneres act but she's extremely good with the voice. The role was supposedly written for her, and she makes the most of that opportunity. Laugh-out-loud funny at times, Dory is a delight to watch, and it's no surprise that she's the focal point of the upcoming sequel.As with all Disney/Pixar animations, there has to be humour, and there is a lot of humour. My only problem was that, for the sake of humour, the story does get sidetracked somewhat. Marlin's desperate search for Nemo gets put on the backburner as he's shooting the breeze with turtles, or taking part in vegetarian shark meetings. Okay, so it's for kids, so maybe I shouldn't look too deeply into it, but it did irk me.Of the Pixar movies I've seen, this isn't at the top. All three 'Toy Story' films probably trump it, and 'Up' is possibly just that bit more funnier; but, with such a strong filmography, 'Finding Nemo' coming up fifth (maybe sixth behind 'Wall-E') is not a disservice at all. Great for kids and adults, it's highly recommended."
anpatterson0607,"Sep 22, 2013",9/10,"Finding Nemo is not only a great animation, but also a great lesson for parents. With a humorous cast including Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, Albert Brooks as Marlin, Alexander Gould as Nemo, and Willem Dafoe as Gill; Finding Nemo sends viewers on a heart wrenching, suspenseful, humorous journey for a fishes only son. This movie had me in tears within the first five minutes of the movie, when a drastic loss happens. The journey shows the battles and heartache that parents face when losing a young one. Marlin, the single parent, has a hard time ""letting go"" to his only son Nemo for his first day of school. When he finally does, Nemo gets lost. The movie explores the ocean while Marlin searches for his son. Marlin faces many of his fears in search of his son. As the movie takes you on this journey, a journey similar to Toy Story, where a lost toy brings unity among all toys; Nemo, as the lost fish, brings unity to fish and birds in search of him. The similarities in plot and underlying story messages are similar however Lee Unkrich, Andrew Stanton, the directors of Finding Nemo, do a great deal to engage the viewers right away. Throughout the movie the open sea and other ocean creatures fill the audience with great invisible sound. The movie gives viewers the ocean like feel with the invisible sound of the ocean animals and ocean water, and also the lighting in the scenes gives the realistic ocean depth. Both of these techniques are used greatly throughout the film while Marlin and Dory face adventures in the open sea. While Marlin and Dory lead viewers through the ocean they face many obstacles. The overall story of the film would be to have trust in one another. A good quote from the film, which is reiterated at the end of the film, ""You think you can do these things, Nemo, but you just can't!"" This quote ties the over-all theme together. Marlin had very little trust in his son's abilities, yet had he given him the benefit of the doubt at the beginning of the movie, it may have prevented Nemo from getting lost in the first place. This movie uses very good techniques that allow the viewer to sink into the ocean, and help Marlin to find his son. Dory plays the humorous girly-fish who adds humor to the bad situation, and who also helps Marlin to lighten up. I think all parents can learn a thing or two from this movie, and could use the humorous outlook on life, like Dory's!"
Mysterygeneration,"Aug 25, 2022",8/10,"Additionally, it adds an unexpected element of beauty through its use of color and form, making it one of the rare films that made me want to sit in the front row and allow the images to fill the rest of my vision. The majority of the film is set in the colorful underwater world of tropical fish, on a shallow warm-water shelf not far from Australia. Even without the story, the use of color, form, and movement makes the movie a delight."
fernandoschiavi,"May 23, 2021",8/10,"Apparently, Pixar wizards love challenges: after the Toy Story and Toy Story 2 dolls, the Insect Life ants and the Monsters SA creatures (including the extremely difficult task of animating Sulley's millions of hairs), the artists from the company led by John Lasseter decided to set their new work in one of the most complicated environments in digital animation: water. The result, fortunately, is a colossal technical victory: in addition to being totally credible, the ocean seen in Finding Nemo offers Pixar artists the opportunity to prove (once again) their visual accuracy, since the extremely complicated underwater photography is beautiful, with amazing lighting effects.When Finding Nemo begins, we are introduced to the happy couple of clown fishes formed by Marlin and Coral, who have just moved, alongside their hundreds of roe, to an anemone with a 'panoramic' view of the (bottom of) the ocean. Unfortunately, a predator's attack results in the death of practically all of Marlin's family, leaving him a widower and with little Nemo to raise - something that turns him into an overprotective father. Thus, it is with great terror that, one day, the poor fish sees his son being caught by fishermen and taken to an aquarium. Determined to rescue Nemo, Marlin embarks on a risky journey in search of the goldfish, being helped by the friendly Dory - who, unfortunately, has a very serious memory problem.As it has already become standard in Pixar's productions, Finding Nemo immerses the viewer (pardoning the pun) in a multicolored and nuanced universe: inhabited by an infinity of cute creatures (and others not so much), the ocean seen here has their own versions of road signs, highways and even support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. Filling every inch of the screen with details that reveal admirable preciousness, the team of animators pays particular attention to the elaboration of their characters' facial expressions, transforming them into fun and charismatic figures - notice, for example, the changes in the face of the turtle Crush while you talk to Marlin and also observe the look of pride that appears on Nemo's face when he hears a certain news about his father. At times like these, the expressiveness of the characters is such that the dialogues become even dispensable.Like all good animation, Finding Nemo presents us with a tale in which family and friendship relationships are the safe haven of its main characters. But this question, which can be considered (in fact it is) cliché, is treated in such a beautiful, fun and extremely intelligent way that one cannot fail to notice the numerous parallels with the reality of the spectators, whether children or adults. This is where the film differentiates itself from the others and shows its maturity. The work is a pearl from Pixar that focuses precisely on the concept of family and how much we are willing to risk when fighting for our family. It is a sweet tale, full of adventure, suspense and a genius humor that leaves us absolutely amazed. It is not just a movie for children, on the contrary. Morality is very adult and the teachings that come from the film illustrate that we should never judge a ""book by its cover"" or give up on those that are most important to us. Something that, in adults, we value much more than at a young age.In addition, Finding Nemo also includes some curiously complex subtexts: the title character's 'fin of luck', for example, is a clear reference to the physically challenged - and brings a beautiful message about the way they face the obstacles that arise in their lives. No less complex is the relationship between Marlin and his son - something that is summed up in a very sensitive way by Dory: 'If you insist on protecting him in this way, nothing will happen to him. On the other hand, nothing is going to happen to him'. And while Pixar's previous work relied on his dramatic moments, none of them ever reached the intensity of the scene in which Marlin swims across the ocean screaming, desperately, 'My son! My son! '.Even though Finding Nemo is an animation film mostly centered on a banal theme, it is the way it combines the elements by providing an excellent evening for the family, which makes it so genuine and so adorable. It is a tale about challenges, about loss, abandonment and above all about reunion, love and companionship. The characters are striking, with strong human traits, which give children a perspective on how they will become when they are adults, recognizing the unconditional value that the family has for all of us.Getting the audience to see themselves in these little fish was the director's first step. The second was to create a world in which the audience could dive, achieving this through an art direction that lives up to the spectacular double between human creativity and the biological diversity of the ocean. What also makes ""Nemo"" timeless is director Andrew Stanton's talent for combining magnificent visuals and exotic worlds with extremely human themes. The fights between Marlin and Nemo can occur anywhere and the public can easily identify with the positions taken by both characters. In this, neither of them sounds, at any time, unsympathetic, but flawed as either. However, unlike, for example, Bryan Mills in the first ""Relentless Quest"", our protagonist is an absolutely ordinary father, not the king of the seven seas or even a heroic action animal. Meanwhile, Nemo experiences his own dilemmas and difficulties at the aquarium, with David Ian Salter's montage skillfully switching between the two narrative lines.On the other hand, Finding Nemo cannot escape its road movie structure (or should I say 'ocean movie'?) And, unfortunately, allows that to make it episodic and irregular. Developing parallel actions (Marlin's search and Nemo's escape attempt), the film jumps from one narrative to another always in a similar way, abusing, for example, the fade-outs (screen blackouts) that illustrate the characters' fainting. As a result, the rhythm of the story cannot be as constant as that of most of Pixar's previous work.As for the pace and dramatic appeal, we shouldn't worry: for every dramatic incident seen in Finding Nemo there are countless other comic reliefs to balance things out: in addition to the jokes involving Dory's memory, the film's script features very inspiring scenes involving three sharks who struggle to improve the public image of the species; a school with a talent for imitation; a group of 'surfing' turtles; and, of course, curious jokes throughout the final credits. The production also includes several hilarious references to works by Hitchcock (the little girl Darla, who could be considered a female version of Sid from Toy Story, is always accompanied by the theme of Psychosis) and adventures such as Mission: Impossible (the plan Gil's escape route is tragically funny).Navigating an ocean of creative possibilities, ""Finding Nemo"" features incredible catchphrases (""keep swimming"", ""worm u-ha-ha""), hilarious situations (vegetarian sharks and hippy turtles) and a range of memorable fish (the aquarium dentist has one of the best Pixar groups). And although the journey in search of the young clownfish is the main adornment of the narrative, it is in Dory that we find the most fun portion of the story. Dory literally has a fish memory. He forgets what he is going to say or do with frightening frequency. And, despite the comic aspect, it is when she teaches us to speak ""whale"" that brings us to tears from laughing so much. It is amazing how both the North American version and the Portuguese version manage to highlight the inevitable perfection of the character. Both Ellen DeGeneres and Rita Blanco are adept at bringing this fish so adorably comical. Dory's success was so acclaimed by critics and fans that she was entitled to her own feature film.The interesting thing is also how Nemo and Merlin's trajectory grows, far from each other, makes both grow. In his search for Nemo, Marlin ends up meeting different groups of sea animals that show him how to be more open, not only towards his son, but also towards new friends. The clownfish, in fact, has nothing funny (one of the big draws in the film), because with the trauma of the loss he ended up totally reclusive. Situation begins to change as he enjoys the presence of the clumsy Dory (a spectacular dubbing work by Ellen DeGeneres, as good as what Robin Williams did for the Lamp Genie in Aladdin, 1992), enhanced when Marlin almost loses his friend burned by a gigantic group of jellyfish.Everyone knows the end of the story, even if they haven't seen the movie. What counts here is not the outcome (which, although not original, can be treated with dignity), but the trajectory and evolution of its characters. Even if Dory says at any time, ""Nemo? Cool name!"", Finding Nemo is not just above average fun, but a subtle way of thinking about the complexity of educating a child and, at the same time, treating this growth in a light way. With a simple, well-intentioned humor, affectionate animation and delicious characters, Finding Nemo is one of the best productions to date at Pixar. A timeless animated classic with a sweet message and its own vision of the concept of family and how much it means to us. It is a spiral of unlimited fun, a mind-blowing adventure, and an ode to everyone who does not give up looking for the most important aspect of life: the love of the family."

snik,"Jun 23, 2003",6/10,"I found this to be the worst Pixar movie. From the first minutes, my 3 year old was terrified of the film, it didnt help that they started it off with a preview of the Pirates of the Carribean movie. The film was filmed with dark imagery and some scary moments, enough that after the first 15 or so minutes, my 3 year old was asking if we could go home now. The clown fish was annoying, not funny. Dory (think that was her name) had some great funny moments, but not enough to save Nemo. The highlight was the turtles and shark moments, but for the most part it is down to a very familiar pattern that is getting old. Pixar needs to bring back Lassiter or they will soon find themselves second-string compared to PDI/Dreamworks."

mnice-1,"Jul 19, 2004",6/10,"I finally got around to seeing this on DVD. I was looking forward to it, but I was rather disappointed - compared to Pixar's other work. I don't know how it could be rated higher than either of the Toy story's.Sure it's technically fantastic, and there are some good moments (Bruce the Shark for example) - but it left me cold. For me there are couple of reasons.I would say it's the most ""Disney like"" of all the Pixar films so far (and for me that's a bad thing!) - all rather preachy and predicable. Although at least there was no bursting into song!I think it could have done with some trims at the editing stage - the film is 20+ mins longer than Toy Story, and you notice it. The Turtle & Jellyfish scenes dragged on, and seemed unnecessary to me.Let's hope The Incredibles is a return to form for 'older' viewers."
robnet24,"Dec 6, 2003",4/10,This movie is surely an achievement in a technical point if view. No need to argue about that. But there is a great problem : it tries to please adults as well as children in an over-speeded plot full of clichés. Do really children need so much complexity and action scenes ? I am not sure about that. Maybe children need more time to understand what is happening on the screen. Too much speed creates a stressed up and confusing atmosphere.There is too much violence and the characters are shallow and stereotypical (I found the turtles to be extremely boring). The anthropomorphic approach of animal characters is becoming more and more out of date. Disney did it a thousand times and I still don't know if it is really a pertinent way of exlplaining things to children. Paradoxal ? A shallow movie set in the dephts of the ocean... Far too much hype for another sterotypical plot.
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Apr 8, 2022",9/10,"This is absolutely one of Pixar's best films. Having rewatched the four films they released prior to this previously,I can also say that this is their first film with 100% flawlessly aged animation. There's a few janky moments in their earlier stuff, and maybe a few nitpicks when it comes to the animation in Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc, but Finding Nemo looks great from start to finish, with amazing water effects, great character animation, and tons of variety in all the environments.The characters are all fun and almost every single scene is memorable. I also love the music, and the way its emotional impact kind of sneaks up on you. As great and as sad as the most moving scenes in Toy Story 2 and Up are (to take two examples), Finding Nemo feels a little more subtle in how moving it is. After the opening scene, it doesn't really hit until the end, and that sense of making an audience feel something without being direct/obvious about it is something Pixar doesn't do a lot (I'd say they kind of do it in Wall-E too, which funnily enough has the same director as Finding Nemo).After Toy Story 2, this is my favourite of Pixar's first five films, and I think it's close to perfect, even now, some 20 years after release. A near masterpiece, and it remains just as funny, fun, imaginative, and moving as it was back in 2003."
total_sweetheart,"Jan 25, 2005",10/10,"possibly the second best animated movie of all time (first being Aladdin) and it is definitely the funniest!! the story was great, and the jokes are unforgettable. props to whoever played dory, because that was the FUNNIEST talking fish i have ever seen in my life. the fish in tanks were cute, and the turtles were cool. i liked the sharks, and the way nemo's name was constantly mispronounced (fabio, etc.) i wouldn't necessarily recommend it for really little kids, as it was a little sad. but overall, i absolutely loved it. i hope they come up with some sort of sequel that doesn't absolutely ruin it, but even if they don't , it's still an absolutely awesome movie."
Blondie1994,"Jul 12, 2013",10/10,"This is one of my favorite Pixar movies! I could sit and watch this movie all day. It's one of those movies that will never get old. To this day, I still cry when Nemo's mom dies. I find this movie to be not only family-friendly, but age appropriate. Anybody of any age can sit down and watch this movie. The variety of ocean life that they use is great for young children because it teaches them what animals live in the ocean. It's one of those movies that's perfect for family movie night or just simply at a sleepover. When I was in high school, my government teacher gave us a movie day and this was the movie of choice. Everybody in the class was so excited and nobody complained. I highly recommend this movie, especially with younger children. You're never too old or too young to watch Nemo."
green14-149-652365,"Nov 2, 2014",9/10,"Finding Nemo is about a fish named Nemo who gets separated from his dad Marlin. Nemo has one small fin, and it's hard for him to swim as fast as the other fish so his dad is overprotective of him in the ocean. Dying to fit in, Nemo disobeys his father and swims far out, and gets abducted by humans. Marlin gets help along the way from a fish named Dory who is dead set on finding Nemo.The film focuses on plot, action and adventure. Marlin played by Albert Brooks; attempts to relocate his son Nemo Alexander Gould; in a huge ocean surrounded by trouble. Along the way he encounters jelly fish, getting lost, his sidekick Dory, voice by Ellen DeGeneres getting captured by fisherman, and almost getting eaten by pelicans to name a few. One of the techniques in the film is motif. The motif would be the idea to never give up that is repeated throughout the movie. Some examples of this are when Nemo tries to swim out with the rest of his class and it's harder for him, when Nemo tries to put the pebble in the fish tank filter, when Dory tries her hardest to remember the address on the goggles, and when Marlin tells all the fish caught in the fishermen's net to swim down. The idea was to keep trying until you succeed. The biggest and most evident example is Marlin going to find his son (the entire plot of the movie), regardless of what he encountered he didn't give up. Being that this film is animated the ""lighting"" and angles used aren't those from an actual cinematographer. The movie still used angles in animation to draw the audience's attention to scenes to make a point. As in most movies, sound in this film played a huge role. In one of the scenes where a nice pelican tries to save Marlin and Dory from hungry pelicans; all three characters end up getting chased and the music for that scene was fitting. It was a fast paced beat; even if you closed your eyes you knew what type of scene was taking place just by the music. In the beginning of the movie, when Nemo was going off to school, the music is very upbeat which signified happiness. This movie in relation to others such as Toy Story represents the same motif, bonding, relationships, and determination. Both films grab the viewers' attention by using bright colors, and sound as texture to bring the film to life."
nosiesnetnieuws,"Nov 27, 2003",10/10,"With Finding Nemo (which has just been released in cinema's today here in the Netherlands) Pixar once again delivers a true masterpiece, easily the best of their films so far, and maybe even the best animation I've seen (and that long list includes Shrek and The Lion King).All one hopes for is provided: stunning images, lovely music (by Thomas Newman, always a firm favourite), a great story with humour, humanity and warmth, great voice performances... Simply perfect.When the words ""The End"" appeared, the entire cinema was sorry (sighs all around) - that says enough now doesn't it... :-)If you're not one of those ""I only like it when it's noisy and violent"" kind of persons, you'll probably love this film over and over again. Be sure to watch the entire ending titles too as there are some little surprises in it... right until the end."

Wonderfully enchanting animated instant classic from the geniuses at Pixar keep their winning streak alive with this remarkably lively tale about life under the sea and focusing on neurotic clownfish Marlin (ably voiced by Brooks in full panic mode) whose overprotective parenting gets the best of him when his only off-spring Nemo (Gould) winds up in the net of a diver from Australia, thus sending him on an incredible journey to reunite with his progeny. On hand to aid him is the dotty blue fish Dory (DeGeneres who is pitch-perfect hilarious and steals the show) whose positive sunny disposition is only circumvented by her consistent short-term memory loss making it a bumpy ride along.Fun for the entire family with some serious belly-laughs of one-liners and sight gags that deserve a second viewing to get them all. Kudos to Stanton (who co-directs with Lee Unkrich and voices a surfer-dude sea turtle dad) who co-wrote with Bob Peterson and David Reynolds the cleverly antic script. ). But it is the amazing visuals conceived via CGI that proves groundbreaking in capturing the absolute FEELING of being in the ocean's murky depths and uncharted splendor. One of the year's best and most entertaining animated films ever made."
timber71,"Jun 1, 2003",6/10,"Finding Nemo was clever, cute, well written and definitely a technical advance in animated story telling.  It doesn't compare, however, to the first Pixar film I viewed - Toy Story.My main complaint is that the story moves through so many locations (if I can use that term for an animated movie), that by the end, everything seems rushed.  While I understand that the whole premise of the story is a journey, the writers might have been better off spending more time in three or four locales, than hurrying through 10+.  That said, my daughter loved it!6/10  (my daughter, 10/10)"

merrywood,"Dec 16, 2003",5/10,"FINDING NEMO is a typical Pixar product: A stunning visual enterprise.  Its avant-garde computer imaging technology wiped out the century old, cel animation process.  It's done, curiously enough, by a studio headed by former Walt Disney people who for some reason bolted Disney to form their own shop.  One can only guess why.  Of course, Disney will distribute. After all it's not only entertaining product but fulfills the single ultimatum of Hollywood: Make Money.  Forget Shakespeare's injunction: to celebrate life.Thus, we find ourselves with an engaging story about a father fish in search of his missing, remaining son after a mean barracuda has gobbled up his spouse and other offspring.  Alas, a skin-diving Australian dentist has lifted the son for the tank in his office, to be held there for Darla, his ever-so-frightening, brainless, little daughter.Finding Nemo is always interesting to watch.  It's a, very clever, sometimes hilarious, six-minute, shtick-filled cartoon stretched into 100 minutes. One can forgive its story flaws in all the fun.  However, the use of a talented, well-known actor like Albert Brooks in the lead role is puzzling. Disney himself avoided the use of major names in order to evade the audience confusion of hearing an easily imaged voice coming out of a drawn character. The most distinct instance of this is in SNOW WHITE where he chose the completely unknown voice of Adriana Caselotti over the reigning voice of the day, Deanna Durbin.  Shamus Culhane, for whose biography I helped him find a publisher and who worked on that classic film, assured me that the decision to use Caselotti (who passed at 80 in 1997) was intentional and not forced by the then prevailing funding shortage.  This was Disney's first feature length cartoon and he wanted the best for it.  Indeed, it lives today, still, over half a century later, as meaningful as the day it was released.Finally, the most unfortunate aspect of NEMO, an otherwise fine product, is its lack of meaning.  It lacks my hallmark for greatness, a soul at its center.  As such, NEMO, like all of the other Pixar products thus far, will be long forgotten when films like SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO are still being heralded as classics.  Why Pixar does this when it has a $94 million budget to lavish on a product begs the question: A shallow fish story in deep water."

A Jay,"Dec 10, 2003",10/10,"Quite why I haven't commented on this before is beyond me, but still, here I amPut simply, Finding Nemo is a brilliant film with funny and endearing characters that are a joy to watch. Pixar have again pushed the boundaries of computer animation to bring us a realistic yet still cartoonish film that will appeal to anyone from 3 to 103. I'm sure most people's favourite bit was the whale speak by Dory, which had me in stitches. However other little incidents in the film really made me laugh so much. When the little baby fish falls off the sponge bed is so typical of how children react when they hurt themselves. The animators and writers at Pixar really know how to capture the way people react to situations. All the little facial expressions throughout the film are beautifully animated.The water effects must have been tremendously difficult to achieve, but they are fantastic. The lighting changes that were required really help set the mood of a scene, even when Marlin and Dory were inside the whale. The story although basic was successfully pulled off with no dip in any of the action. The story kept going when it shifted between Marlin's desperate attempt to locate his son, and Nemo's dispair of being alone with no one to look after him except the new collection of strange friends in the dentist fish tank.Overall I give it 10/10 because it was great. I can't wait for The Incredibles next year, I'm sure it will be just as good."
caedon-29136,"Feb 5, 2021",8/10,As a young child my parents grew sick of this movie as it aired nearly constantly in my childhood home due to my constant demand for it. I LOVE the soundtrack and I did even as a child which was both odd and reason for praise. I don't even know why I am writing this because I'm guessing that everyone here has seen Finding Nemo and loves it as well.
jordyntsmith,"Nov 17, 2022",10/10,"An overprotective father attempts to find his kidnapped son, all the while learning about what it means to have a real relationship built on trust and mutual understanding.This movie feels perfect still today. No line or moment feels wasted. The film is perfectly entertaining. Every character feels real, fleshed out, and developed. For a movie about talking fish, it is surprising grounded in real human experiences and emotions.I would be hard pressed to find someone who would actively dislike this movie. It is a film that captures the complexities, joys, and sorrows of being human in a way that speaks to adults and children."
AMIO-PatricioMunoz,"Sep 4, 2003",N/A,"3D Animation Quality:  Beautiful  5/5  (truly spectacular)Story:  Meh! Lacks creativity 1/5 (Find a better script next time)My 2-Cents:Disney and Pixar are an amazing team.  Pixar has put together some really nice films that will go down in history for their impact in the animation industry.  There is no question that this film was an excellent a crowd drawer and everything Disney and the industry needed at this time.I love Pixar and their contributions to contemporary cinema.  The film however was a great disappointment to me.  One of the things I have grown to enjoy when watching a Pixar Film is their shorts before the actual movie begins.  They showed their classic short, ""Knick Knack"" which was produced in way back in 1989.  I was hoping to see a new short.  I loved ""Geri's Game"" and ""For the Birds"".My biggest beef was not about that.  It involved the story itself.  Toy Story 1 & 2 was written to appeal to both young and older audiences. Finding Nemo seemed to have it's target directly on the kids.  There's nothing terribly wrong w/ that, it's just the story was too simple.  It seemed like the movie was jammed full of FILLER just to lengthen the movie. We could have done without the sharks, for example.  Their role in the film was simply to extend it by a couple of minutes.The novelty of 3D animation is gone.  It's not the 1990's anymore.  People are familiar with complex 3D animation.  It's everywhere we look.  Pixar cannot rely on drawing an audience simply because the film is a 3D animation.  Remember how poorly Final Fantasy did?  The film had great animation with incredibly realistic human characters.  Square One did an amazing job on the animation that just blew me away.  But the story was not appealing to the mass audience.  So, where are they now?  The movie BOMBED and the company literally went bankrupt.Pixar should remember one thing.  Parents have to sit through the film too. Just spend a little more time on the script for your next movie.You haven't lost a loyal viewer in me, however.  I have a lot of faith in John Lasseter's team. I expect great things from the Pixar and Disney in the near future!"
kiyeho,"Feb 19, 2005",6/10,"I would estimate...about 97% of the movie going world loved this movie.However, I did not. I'm aware young children have higher pitched voices, but the particular children for supporting roles in this movies had voices I thought were going to bore into my brain.The story is simple. Nemo, a young fish who is the only survivor of his siblings is dared to go out into open water, and thus is captured. His overprotective father, who seems to have Nemo alone as remaining family, naturally, goes to look for him.From there, we're introduced to supporting characters who I found weren't much more than cheap laughs. Vegetarian sharks, ooh, that's original! All in all, the plot seems pretty much inconsequential to beautiful sweeping shots of the ocean and the coral reefs the fish call home. The scene with the jelly fish I found quite a treat to look at...but other than being yet another piece of eye candy that seems to be a trend nowadays....this movie has very little to offer."
sandnair87,"Mar 31, 2015",10/10,"Pixar's animation wonder Finding Nemo, is a shimmery, velvety undersea coming-of-age story which is aglow with translucent sea flora and gleaming, iridescent creatures. Australia's Great Barrier Reef provides a stunning starting point for this aquatic parable. Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a spunky little clown-fish with a slight disability - a foreshortened front fin. Nemo's single father, Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a dry, wry clown-fish with an excess of anxiety (He is also a clown who can't tell a joke, though he keeps trying to do so quite hilariously). Despite Marlin's suffocating attention, his small fry is scooped up by a scuba diving dentist and gets separated from his father. Determined not to lose his son, Marlin begins a long, arduous albeit seemingly hopeless rescue mission across the sea and soon bumps into an overly exuberant, sweetly scatterbrained regal blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). They search for Nemo together in the face of stinging jellyfish, exploding mines, noxious sharks and other irritable flounders. In the meantime, Nemo makes some very good friends in the dentist's aquarium, including a tiger fish (Willem Dafoe) who helps him plan an escape. From then on, it's a relentless journey of visual excitement and wonder, as the distraught father sets off to rescue his offspring and Nemo finds ways to escape from the aquarium. As is mandatory for a family film, there are plenty of life lessons for kids to learn, but they come sugar-coated with humor and fun. Meanwhile, a more adult undercurrent offers grown-up laughs, and there's even some old-fashioned tear-jerking to complete the emotional roller-coaster ride.Andrew Stanton plays the viewer like a fiddle, and it's a privilege to be played. Its animation is truly stunning, awash (pun intended) in a dazzling array of colors and creating the impression of a living, breathing sea. Every moment is magnificently orchestrated to tease a response from us - anything from awe to aw-shucks. Yes, it's a visual feast, but more importantly it's an epic journey filled with adventure and discovery that encompasses the grandest sweep of the ocean's vastness and the tiniest longing of the heart. While preserving the characters' intrinsic ""fishy-ness"", the silver- tongued voice cast offers great supplementary texture to a marvelous sensory experience. While Brooks is amusing as the ever fretful Marlin, it is DeGeneres who gives a bravura comic performance as the guileless but whacked-out Dory. Ceaselessly forgetful, her endearing Dory makes a difficult traveling companion but a scintillating friend – Dory is a complete hoot.Instead of rising to a challenge, Finding Nemo plunges into it and comes up a winner. All in all, a buoyant adventure that manages to evoke the quicksilver trait of the ocean without necessarily feeling 'wet'!"
d-madar,"May 13, 2007",1/10,"When I saw a rating of 8.2 I did a double take. How on earth did this farce manage a rating of that? The lot is trash, even if your a kid! I mean i'm not that into animation films but I found Shrek quite enjoyable and other children's films like the lion king and the Jungle Book were vastly superior.For a start Nemo himself is incredibly annoying and I was hoping throughout the movie that a shark would come along and snap him up (knowing full well this would never actually happen). Secondly the story line reaches new heights of insanity. All movies aimed at young audiences are silly but this one is so much worse and stupider than any of the other ones. It's boring it's sad and it makes me feel embarrassed than something so horrible and ugly in film could be enjoyed by so many people.Nemo actually means nobody, suggesting that even the guy who came up with the title is laughing at this movie. I can barely understand how children like it but adults as well? What is the world coming to? Please don't watch this movie if you haven't seen it. It's simply disgusting."

fishwad,"Jun 23, 2003",N/A,"Pixar put together a fairly entertaining film with Finding Nemo, especially in light of the crop of terrible Hollywood offerings this summer (Matrix 2 and The Italian Job come to mind).  Not as engaging or amusing as Monsters, Inc, but still an enjoyable diversion.  I had expected this film to be a lot funnier than it was-- there were far too many times when it seemed the writers sensed they needed more comedy and decided, ""Oh, we'll have the Ellen character forget something.  Again.""  But there was enough about the movie that was amusing to keep my attention.The major problem I had with the movie is that Disney and Pixar had a wonderful opportunity to make a fairly strong environmental comment with the potential to reach millions of future consumers (and potential polluters), yet they failed enormously.I didn't buy a ticket to Finding Nemo expecting to see a ""message movie."" I did, however, expect to see the issue of pollution touched on, even in an antiseptic, stock-holder-friendly Disney kind of way.  There were numerous opportunities for this, specifically at the point when Marlin and Dora enter Sidney harbor and are officially in man's domain.  Yet Disney repeatedly dropped the ball.  After having established a lovable cast of characters that the audience was entirely in love with, Disney easily could have presented at least a hint of the idea that mankind is doing serious and possibly irreparable damage to the environment.  And that mankind can do something about it.But that's alright, because Nemo went on to score the biggest opening weekend of any animated film!  And in the end, that's what it's all about, right?"
Drew48,"Aug 30, 2008",9/10,"I love this movie. Although it has a sad beginning, it's a wonderfully funny & touching movie. Albert Brooks' character, Marlin, is very funny as the overly cautious (with reason to be) father. And Nemo is a sweet kid, who manages not to seem bratty at all even when he's being defiant. All the main characters are super funny (& endearing) whether in the sea or in the aquarium. Examples: Bruce & friends are sharks that don't want to eat fish (though it's hard to fight their natural urges); and Jacques is a neat freak, so naturally very bothered when they decide to let the tank get filthy in order to force the owner to clean it, allowing them the chance to possibly escape. However, Ellen DeGeneres' character, Dory, tops them all though. She suffers from short-term memory loss (at times, very short-term), which makes for many laughs. And she thinks she can speak whale, which makes even just stating that very funny. One of my favorite parts is when she tells Marlin that they're not the only two ones in here (the ocean, that is). Basically, it's one of my favorite movies."
ovvldc,"Nov 6, 2003",6/10,"First off: the animation work is excellent. From a technical perspective this is a fine movie. It also has a few truly funny moments (sharks) and fairly decent voice-acting..But this movie is terribly reminiscent of half the sitcoms and children's movies out there. It is like a cross-section of California stereotypes were given plastic surgery and dropped in water. The formula has been been tortured to death by Hollywood in general and Disney in particular.Thus, Finding Nemo makes good watching for young children and people who don't see many films, but movie-lovers will find it boring and stale.On the whole not a bad movie, but hardly an original piece of work: 3/5.."

Because kids don't really care about this, I would give this a 10/10 for children 10 and under.The ending also didn't have that much going for it and felt like another random event.Overall, a great family movie."
kennethtownsend-97230,"Oct 13, 2015",9/10,"Finding Nemo is a fantastic movie about a little fish named Nemo. Nemo was trying to rebel against his dad when he got taken from his father! Now Nemo's dad (Marlin) went everywhere to try and find him. Along the way Marlin picks up a newfound friend named Dory, and she follows Marlin on his misadventures to try and find Nemo.Overall, Finding Nemo was a fantastic movie, with a detailed plot. It teaches kids about companionship and teamwork, shown by Marlin and Dory restlessly trying to get Nemo back from the people that took him. The way the story unfolded would keep anyone enthralled in the story of Nemo and how Marlin tried to find him. Finding Nemo will become a classic for all kids around the world and hopefully will become a favorite everywhere. In the movie, the voice acting is one of the best from Disney to date.

The tank is clean!It's taking every once of my soul to actually leave a review rather than just leave a paragraph of all the iconic quotes. I can recite the entire script of Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone all day long, but Finding Nemo is the movie I consider to be the most quotable. I literally quote the film every single day. Don't watch this movie with me. I enjoy it way too much and my voice will ruin every scene for you.Aside from this film being genuinely hilarious, it's also emotional. Only Pixar can get us emotional over talking fish. Did you see the massacre at the start? Marlin is such a dimensional character and goes through great character development as he ignores all of his principles and does everything he can to cross the ocean to find his son. He finds a quirky friendship with the quirky fish, Dory, and faces all fears for Nemo. It's honestly really crazy how much depth these fish characters have. Shark Tales could never! But that's why this movie works.With heart, humor, and very iconic moments, Finding Nemo has settled in comfortably in my Top 5 Disney movies of all time for literally 20 years. One of Pixar's finest for sure."

michaelgs,"Aug 9, 2003",7/10,"There is no doubt in my mind that Pixar is a great movie-making company. There is no doubt that it's newest installment is technically brilliant. There is no doubt that Dory represents one of the funniest characters in Pixar's very assorted collection. But there is some worry, on my part, that Pixar has been hammering home the same basic plot into us for the past eight years. In Toy Story, it's about Buzz being lost and meeting new friends. In the seccond Toy Story, It's about Woody being lost and meeting new friends. In A Bug's life, it's about Flick being lost and meeting new friends. In Monsters, Inc...well, you get the picture. All of them, all of them are good films. Very funny, and very enjoyable.This film is no exception. Go whether you have kids or not. Rent the DVD whether you have kids or not. If you have kids, buy the DVD as a Christmas present. It will be a real treat. But I hope I am not the only person who will be relieved when there is a change of pace. Perhaps the Incredibles will be what I am looking for, and will convince me that Pixar's success is not merely due to the same basic plot.7/10"

I have loved every film they have done so far... don't get me wrong I enjoyed Nemo for the first 10 minutes. But it just hit me how similar these films are! I kind of hate myself for realising that too, because I so wanted to enjoy this film. Instead I found my self rolling my eyes at most of the events that occurred. I'm sure this film will entertain the under 16's which is the target audience. I just wish as with the other Pixar films there would be something there to entertain the more mature crowd. I'll try and end by saying if I had to rate this film out of 10 I would give it a 6.As a little side criticism I thought Disney/Pixar missed a good opportunity to raise awareness of water pollution with this film. It made the ocean seem like a sparkling clean place, with no environment concerns. A little bit of awareness within the film would have been a nice touch.PS. After saying all this, I have to admit the gulls were some of the funniest characters I've seen in a Disney/Pixar Production."
argento88,"Jan 3, 2005",1/10,"This was by far the most boring, lame, and utterly nauseating of all the cartoons I have ever seen. More proof that Pixar has nothing on Dreamworks (With the exception of ""The Incredibles, that was a great cartoon). I only saw this because I missed the showing for Underworld. What a big mistake, I should have saved my money. I was bored stiff as I watched a bunch of unfunny fish swim around mindlessly. What made this pitiful excuse for a movie worse was the multitudes of toddlers and sad girls who paraded around praising this movie. If you want to honestly want to watch a film intended for people under the age of fetus, then this is the movie for you."
importantabhilash,"Jul 1, 2021",9/10,"Finding nemo is so much into one. Its fantasy of ocean,every creature living there,their daily lives,want,quest and redemption. Its also coming of age of nemo. Its father son story. The aquarium has its own story. It has its own plot plan and climax. Its story about companionship,adventure. Every character have weakness and they have to endure upon and win."
gillmurphydogg,"Feb 10, 2023",9/10,"Finding Nemo is a light-hearted cartoon that any audience would appreciate. The film tells of a fish (Nemo) who is abducted from the Great Barrier Reef and the quest of a bunch of fish to find Nemo.There's some humour elements that are relatable to both kids and adults. I've watched this film several times. I am also an avid snorkeler and can't help but find myself looking for some of the characters in the water.It's a beautifully crafted film with some expert voice acting, great visuals for its time and a musical score that I still listen to periodically. Please watch this if you haven't already!"

Bravo to Pixar for getting even the tiniest detail perfect.BUT...it wasn't funny. It  was mildly interesting, but dragged towards the middle. Even children around me were squirming and asking parents, ""Is it time to go home?""There are too many ""false"" endings--when you think all is well and the constant string of perilous encounters are at an end. But, believe me, there is always ONE more.There are no real laugh out-loud ""bits,"" no really funny lines, and Dorie just plain gets on your nerves after awhile.And, no, I'm not an old grump. I just wasn't amused. Amazed at the technology of it all, but not amused.Give me Toy Story or even Monsters Inc. This one fell flat.Sorry."
darnel04,"Sep 22, 2013",9/10,"Pixar's Finding Nemo is an animation film. It is set mostly in the ocean at Australia's Great Barrier Reef and in Sidney Australia. The main characters are Marlin (voice by Albert Brooks), Nemo (voice by Alexander Gould) and Dory (voice by Ellen DeGenneres). The story is of a father and son and the love they have for each other. In this story father and son are clown fish that live at the Reef. The father is overprotective and son is ready to take on the world even though one of his fins is small. In the film Nemo and his father get separated. The journey begins by Marlin to find his son. Along the journey Marlin faces many obstacles. Marlin also meets news friends that help along the way. This film compares with Toy Story when it comes to friends that are willing to help. One friend that makes the journey with Marlin is Dory a pretty blue fish that has short term memory loss. Sometimes along the journey Marlin is not the most cooperative. He comes to realize you cannot be protected from everything. The background music makes the mood for the coming event. At one point in the ocean Marlin and Dory come upon a shark named Bruce. Bruce takes them through a mine field. The music played is eerie. It keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. Moving among the mines is delicate so as not to set any of them off. The music sets the suspense for the scene. Another scene that using music effectively is after Nemo is added to the fish tank there is a ceremony done by the fish that already reside in the tank. The ceremony starts the music and chanting gradually escalates louder and louder building suspense for Nemo to be an accepted member. The editing in the film has kept the pace of the film moving. The action continues from one obstacle to another for Marlin, Dory and Nemo. There are some conflict scenes and the editing starts the conflict cuts away and re-enters after the conflict with any violence being left out. In the beginning of the movie there is an attack by a barracuda. Marlin tries to protect his family. The barracuda swats him away with his tail. The next scene is Marlin waking up and realizing what has happened. This gives all of the details for the viewer to create what happened in their own minds. At the same time there are no graphic parts for children to endure. I enjoyed the film. The action continues to the end. The overall quality of the film is well done. The color of the many fish in the ocean and the reef itself are worth seeing this film. If you have children Finding Nemo is a must see. As adults the film is still entertaining and worth the time to view. This film can teach a valuable lesson of trust between parents and children."
totalqt,"Aug 23, 2003",1/10,"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I do not think it's ""cute"" or ""funny"". I think the humor is so incredibly lame it would be better if it was non-existant, the sidelines were unnecessary and completely dumb, and I am quite sure that this is the worst movie Disney has ever created (Pirates of the Caribbean being the best!!! I & 3 POTC!!!). Vegetarian sharks?!?!??? I'm a vegetarian, and I didn't even find that funny. Some ppl would get all offended, I don't care, I just think it's stupid & not funny. You are supposed to feel empathy for story characters, but I was kind of hoping to see Nemo become somebody's lunch. OK, joking about that, but there was only like one point in this movie that I actually found funny. I just highly recommend NEVER seeing this awful movie."
doug_funnie,"Dec 2, 2003",10/10,"Pixar has done it again, it seems that whenever Pixar and Disney come out with a movie it is always a tremendous success, and Finding Nemo is no exception. This is the best Pixar film yet and it will be tough to beat. The visual effects are amazing; everything in this Pixar ocean looks so real, from the sand to the sunlight hitting the water. You almost feel like you're underwater and it's hard to imagine that this is animation is not real. The voice work just adds to the animation and makes the movie that much better. Hands down, Ellen DeGeneres is the best in this movie; her voice work as Dory is just hilarious. Every scene that Dory is in I couldn't help but laugh, and with help from the script, the film has some of the funniest scenes in a children's movie. This movie is perfect for kids as it will amuse and entertain them or whoever else may be watching with them. The animation literally comes alive, the humor is everywhere and this all makes Finding Nemo a movie that is extremely enjoyable to watch."
frosty-44431,"Feb 8, 2021",8/10,I can't fault this film. Another classic Pixar film that will be remembered for generations. Love it!
tptrucking1,"Dec 4, 2013",10/10,"There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations."
filmbuff-05706,"Oct 7, 2023",10/10,"If anyone tells you that Disney animated movies are strictly for kids, offer Finding Nemo as a rebuttal. The movie came out the year that I turned 5- in fact one of my earliest memories is seeing it in theaters. I enjoyed it then, but 20 years later, I consider it to be one of the best animated movies ever made.The plot follows Marlin and Nemo, a father and son clownfish who live in the ocean within their anemone. Nemo's mother and unborn siblings were killed in a barracuda tragedy, and Nemo was the only survivor of the attack.Because of this incident, Marlin is very overprotective of Nemo, and is uneasy about him starting school. (Nemo also has one fin that smaller than the other, this is another thing that concerns Marlin.) His worst fears come true when Nemo is kidnapped by a diver, and lands in a dentist office in Sydney, Australia.Even though Marlin fears the ocean, he faces it and the creatures within- from sharks to jellyfish to friendly turtles to find him and return him safely home, with the help of Dory, a friendly but forgetful Blue Tang. And hopefully Marlin saves Nemo in time to save him from the dentist's 8-year-old niece who is cruel to fish!Finding Nemo works brilliantly on many levels. For one thing, the animation is breathtakingly gorgeous. From the blue water to the colors of the fish to the details in the dentist office (including a Buzz Lightyear toy in the waiting room), the animation is a marvel. In fact, Pixar's previous works all have animation bits that are a bit dated looking today, but Finding Nemo may be the first to hold up well even now.On that topic, film critic Roger Ebert noted in his best of 2003 episode (Nemo was his #4 pick) that he usually sits in the back of the theater to watch a movie, but to view Finding Nemo, he sat in the front to let the animation ""wash over him.""The voice cast is stellar as well, with Albert Brooks as Marlin, Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, Geoffery Rush as Nigel, Willem Dafoe as Gill, Allison Janney as Peach, Brad Garrett as Bloat, and more.My favorite aspect of Finding Nemo, apart from the animation, is the humor. Finding Nemo might be one of the funniest movies released by Disney. Most of the jokes are easy to chuckle at- like how quickly Dory can forget something.However, there are many clever jokes that you catch when you are older. Like- Nemo goes to school because a group of fish is called a ""school of fish."" Nigel is always knocking into the dentist window glass because birds can't see glass. Dory sees the whale as ""half full"" because she sees the bright side of things.When Dory and Marlin find Sydney, there is opera music heard as an angelic ""ahhhh!"" This clearly references the Sydney Opera House. There are many examples like this that either make me chuckle or laugh out loud.There are also many clever references to other classic movies- like Psycho with the famous score, Bruce the shark sharing a name with the Jaws shark, a pun on the famous line of The Shining, and a whale scene that recalls Pinocchio.On top of all of that however, Finding Nemo has a ton of heart, perhaps the most heart of any Pixar film, and debatably any Disney film in general.Marlin is very overprotective of Nemo, but his perseverance and courage to face the ocean to find him is very moving. There is a scene in which many sea creatures and birds spread the news of his odyssey to find his son, and it literally brought tears to my eyes.Marlin learns to face his fears and never give up, but he also learns to let go of his son and let him face the world too. On this level, Finding Nemo works again for adults.Nemo learns a lesson too, that he should listen to his father, even if his rules frustrate him. This is another level for the kids to admire the movie.In fact, as a Christian who hates most faith based movies, I admire Finding Nemo on a theological level- in which the story of Finding Nemo is similar to the story of The Prodigal Son- a story about a Father who loves his rebellious son regardless of his rebellion. Both Nemo and The Prodigal Son are beautiful stories of a Father's love for his son and God's love for us.But focusing on Finding Nemo as a secular film, it is a masterpiece. With its beautiful animation and story, Finding Nemo is one of Pixar's greatest films, and one of the best animated movies of all time. It's great when you are a kid, and fantastic when you are an adult.PS: I once asked my Mom what some of her all-time favorite movies are. This is one of the movies that she named. It was also my 5th grade teacher's favorite movie. I should also mention that my mentally and physically challenged sister loved this movie, and ""speaking whale"" with Dory. When I bought the Blu-ray at a used DVD store today, I hesitated watching it today because it's the anniversary of her passing. However, it turns out that watching Finding Nemo today was just what I needed to pass the grieving."

This is another proof that animations are for all ages and if the story is good and it has a moral that relates to all of us, it's a success.Really well done. Great voice acting. Fluid animation and cute characters that are alive.Loved it! Watched it several times... and every time you discover something new...Try to catch the pelican saying ""nice"" with an Australian accent and flying way... did you get the reason? Hilarious.

CinemaSerf,"Jun 9, 2023",7/10,"""Nemo"" is your typically adventurous and curious offspring. Living amidst the wonders of the Barrier Reef has began to wear on the young clownfish, though, and he yearns for the open ocean. His dad knows best and has forbidden him from leaving the safety of their home waters but one day his nose gets the better of him as he espies a fishing boat and next thing he is caught by a diver who whisks him off to the surgery of a dentist where he is deposited in a tank with some fellow prisoners - awaiting the arrival of the man's daughter who is to be the new owner of ""Nemo"". Now young as he is, he's not without nouse and is soon working on a plan to return to the open sea - which they can all see from the window! Meantime, pop ""Marlin"" is in a panic and in his search for his wayward son encounters ""Dory"" - a forgetful fish who thinks she's seen a boat, but then again... Loads of colourful and enjoyable escapades follow as the pair use ingenuity and take quite a few risks to become reunited. First things first - ""Dory"" just annoyed me. Right from the start I was hoping that she would become shark fodder. She has short term memory loss - but how does she remember that? Anyway, apart from that there are loads of endearing characters here from the vegetarian sharks, the loveable ""Peach"" and the characterisation of ""Nemo"" imbues him with an innocence and mischievousness that has to raise a smile - and even engender a bit of concern - as he seems destined for transit in the same plastic bags we all used to use for our goldfish back in the day. The animation is gorgeous and the clever soundtrack (there's even a bit of Herrmann's ""Psycho"" in here) adds loads to enrich this classy and charming adventure. It's really a big screen experience, if you can."

But honestly didn't understand what the big deal was about. There were parts of the movie that were pretty slow and boring, and as someone else commented, this movie had the same story line as Toy Story 2, where they had to go into the human world to get them back to the toy (in this case the ocean) world. I gave it a 7 because it was cute, but this movie is not at all exceptional."

daoldiges,"Jan 17, 2023",8/10,"I had modest expectations going into my viewing of Finding Nemo, and those expectations were completely upended by this totally charming film. All of the performances are on-point, DeGeneres in particular shines bright. I won't rehash the story specifics here as that's already been done by many others but I will say that for the most part Finding Nemo moves along at a brisk pace as we follow a clown fish's journey to find his lost son. Along the way we meet many interesting characters and unique and dazzling sea creatures. In the end it's a fun adventure film with lots of heart and very much worth checking out."
saadanathan,"Apr 5, 2020",10/10,I love Finding Nemo!. It is considered one of the best Pixar pictures ever and definitely a game changer. What i love so much about it is the great dynamic between marlin and dory. The jokes are great. And I've seen this movie too many times to not like it. Besides it is very emotional and Pixar are always masters at creating emotional movies that can be so fantastic. The whole journey is full of excitements and key moments. Many messages are planted in this movies such as: father and son relationship and how you gain friends in unexpected ways.
xnawtkaylix,"Dec 22, 2003",10/10,"I think its very funny that you people who are insulting Finding Nemo are insulting a G rated, kids movie. Finding Nemo is a very sweet movie and its really cute. I have many younger cousins who are 2 all the way to 12 who really enjoyed this movie and talk about it all the time. So I think its hilarious that adults are coming on this board and ragging on the movie about how stupid it is. And yes, I am aware that G means general audience but G usually means its great for kids. But, yes, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Think about how its for younger audiences before you go on about insulting it. Well I'm going to watch it with my 10 year old brother. Bye!"
qball_82,"Aug 30, 2003",9/10,"Hands down - this is the best movie I have seen all year. These days it's rare to come across a flick that has you walking out of the theater feeling like you really did get your money's worth, Finding Nemo is one of these.Being a late session, the entire audience consisted of teen/adult viewers and I feel confident enough to say, judging from the incredible amount of laughter, everyone enjoyed it. I certainly did.The three major selling points. The gorgeous rendered visuals, Pixar continues to out do themselves with every film they produce. You can't help but be amazed, and if it weren't for the colorful cartoony fish darting around on screen, you would swear this was filmed live.Secondly, the amazing voice acting, I dare say this film wouldn't have done half as well without it. You'll recognize a number of familiar voices in this film and they all do a wonderful job, but I have to say it, Ellen Degeneres completely steals the show. Her characterization of Dory had myself and the audience in stitches many a time.Bucket loads of humor and action mixed with some drama and quiet, poignant moments all tied up with a wonderful story, the most important aspect of all. With so many animation studios releasing these days, Pixar is the *only* one that is able to get it right, creating stories with heart that are able to connect with people of all ages, on every level. The tale of Finding Nemo is an enjoyable journey from start to finish and not once did I lose interest.I know this review is incredibly gushy and all, but I honestly cannot fault this film. I cannot wait to own it on DVD to see it again. With so much rubbish being released into cinemas, both animated and live-action, Finding Nemo is a gem. Adult, teenager, kid, whatever - do yourself a favor and go see it now.Long live Pixar."

We can tell that the producers of this film worked hard to bring to life the under water world in such an engaging and comedic way, and the quality of animation, captivating bright colours and suited cinematography, as expected was fantastic which we felt also aided the entire viewer experience. With each character's unique personality being perfectly distinguished in a clever way highlighted much creativity and places this particular movie at the top of the our list of awesomely produced animated films.

Zingbot_9000,"Jun 9, 2003",6/10,"I am in my mid-thirties and have always enjoyed the Pixar movies. Can't say i didn't like this movie but I was expecting more. I thought Ice Age for example did a better job of entertaining adults. Had more humor and was better executed for adults - and also satisfied children. Both movies also were out of this would visually.As for Nemo, Visually A+. And I did think it had it's touching moments.I didn't find Dory all that funny. Okay she has short term memory loss. Didn't amuse me.After leaving the theater I recalled how my mom wanted my dad to take her to see this movie. My wife and I thought would he enjoy it. And I thought no, I don't think he would. It was too much of a kids movie. And don't get me wrong it was supposed to be. I just wanted to offer a different perspective of this movie. It is not flawless. It's not for everyone as reviews seem to indicate.Actually I enjoyed listening to all the little kids reacting to the movie. My daughter is too young for this one yet - a baby. One thing I was thinking was that this movie might be a little too scary for some of these kids. I would say there were at least 6 times when 'the fish' almost died. There where some scary predators - including humans. After all these are little fish - little fish make good food for big fish. Which would be fine but the predators were also very scary looking. Geez, when I was a kid the Wicked Witch in Wizard of Oz scared me, that is nothing compared to the creatures in this movie.Also, when watching this movie I could already see a sequel. I would bet that Dolphins have a very big role in the second one since they were almost ignored here."

Along with the help of a forgetful fish named Dory and a host of other sea creatures, Nemo's father, Marlin, sets out on a journey to find and rescue his son.One of the strongest aspects of ""Finding Nemo"" is its animation. The film's use of color and detail brings the ocean to life in a way that is both beautiful and believable. The characters are also incredibly well-developed and likable, with Nemo's struggles to find his courage and Marlin's overprotective nature leading to both comedic and emotional moments.The film's themes of family, friendship, and determination are expertly woven into the story, making ""Finding Nemo"" not only a visually stunning film, but also a poignant and relatable one. It's a film that can be enjoyed by both children and adults alike, and is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good adventure story.""Finding Nemo"" is a classic that will be enjoyed by all ages, with a story that will make you laugh, cry and leave you feeling inspired."
august_sanders,"Mar 21, 2025",7/10,This movie was in a weird state for me for a long time. I was unsure if I actually liked it or not mostly due to only watching it when it came out at the ripe age of 7. I couldn't remember most of the movie. However now I can say that this movie is quite good. The jokes still hit (sometimes) and the emotion is very emotional. It's a good children's movie. I will say it was an awkward watch just due to not being 10 years old anymore but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie by any means. The development of the characters is very in your face and works well as a moral for the story. Watching Martin and Nemo figuring out that they need to let go brought tears to my eyes. Amazing movie.
nshaw,"Apr 18, 2005",1/10,"You know in the real events that the real life story that ""Finding Nemo"" was based upon, Nemo was put in the garbage disposal in the sink at the dentists office (after some of the other fish in the aquarium contracted fin rot from him and died) and his father was eaten by the pelican.Disney always has to give perfectly acceptable stories with a moral to them these ridiculous happy endings which are not healthy for children to watch because they give them false expectations of life.Let kids get to know the truth for once, Disney!!! Another complaint is that I did not see a Pink Snapper in this hole movie. What a disappointment. Its my favorite dish."

Very well written Superbly acted. I have seen this several times and notice new stuff every time. Ellen DeGeneres is fabulous. Far superior to the likes of Shark Tale. Ten lines is a lot to expect in a review about a film, you don't think that ten lines is an awful lot until you start to write a review for a film and then you actually realise that ten lines is actually a lot of lines to write and repeat yourself. I have tried not to repeat myself but not really very hard. Perhaps if I was to try harder not to repeat myself then the task of not repeating would be easier but as the situation stands at the moment, I fear that I might be repeating myself, perhaps I could go swimming in the sea or in a swimming pool or a lake or loch or a big puddle."

Lady-of-Rohan,"Mar 27, 2005",N/A,"I saw this film at a 9:40pm show about a good month after it's release date. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but lo and behold Pixar completely blew me out of the water. Finding Nemo is a beautiful and gorgeous film about a clown fish desperate to look for his adventurous son, who has been captured from the ocean and put in a destist's office fish tank. The adventures along the way never stop Marlin's quest from being accomplished. It's a wonderful story on love, determination, and tenderness delivered with pure wit and magic.The film's visuals are Acadamy Award worthy. I went to Hawaii last Christmas and went snorkeling in a reef and I instantly thought of this film. Pixar animators captured the colour and life of a tropical reef wonderfully, alive with magic, and beauty. And not many films can do that. And the voices are top notch. Ellen Degeneres is side-splitting as the not-so-smart Dory. Other voices provided by Geoffrey Rush, William Dafoe, and Eric Bana are also nice touches.Whether you have children or you're a child at heart, Finding Nemo deserves to be bought and added to your DVD collection."
VitalyBe,"Aug 23, 2003",7/10,"This is an enjoyable film but it simply doesn't make it up to ""Toy Story"", ""Monsters Inc"" or ""Shrek"". It isn't as funny or dramatic, while it is still fun to watch, I wouldn't like to watch it again. For me it was merely another animated flick like ""Bug Story""."
mengel44,"Nov 15, 2003",6/10,"My wife and I both got tired of this after about half an hour. By now, this kind of story has become formulaic and cliched. The adult in-jokes; the anthropomorphic sentimentality; the perils and chases--much too cutesy and much too contrived, even for a Disney film. This is totally lacking in the inventiveness, humor, and appeal--or creative animation--of Monsters Inc., Shrek, or A Bug's Life, all of which I loved. It's probably easy to become overwhelmed by the nice colors on the big screen; in this case, seeing it on DVD is to see the film more clearly and to realize it doesn't live up to the hype."
WheezyJoe,"Jan 13, 2004",9/10,"Wow, the digital realm is easily forgotten when you first lock eyes on the visual wonder created for yet another charming tale from Disney/Pixar Animation. `Finding Nemo' is Pixar's fifth outing and after a moderately spotless track record they keep this one swimming in a wealth off colour and three-dimensional form. Their visual language has proven to be a clear and successful method of storytelling. It captures the imagination and accommodates some fairly decent stories to-boot. And what setting could be more exciting than Australia's exotic eastern coastline.But it's a mix of Pixar's wonderful craft and a well written story that keeps audiences enthralled, and this time director/writer Andrew Stanton serves up just that, on a silver platter. What remains is the winning formula of comedy and gravity within the screenplay. Stanton has been involved with all of the other Pixar features in the past, and it shows. Even deep under the ocean, far removed from the human subtleties that are woven into usual animations, is a rich tapestry of lifelike environments and genuine character's that are easy to connect and relate to. And in the usual Pixar tradition you get a film that bridges the age boundary and becomes wholly enjoyed by all, young and old.I enjoyed myself for the entire duration of `Finding Nemo' (that included the final credits). I recommend it to all, no matter what your cinematic preference may be. Besides the lavish visual elements that have made Pixar much admired this has been a labor of love for Andrew Stanton that started way back in 1992, prior to Toy Story. It's a new development in the path the entire production house is heading. Thomas Newman's involvement in writing music for this project shows us exactly that as his score gives the film a new emotional style. It's also a `new high water mark' for CGI (computer generated image) animation in general. Pixar is now an established force in animation but politely recognizes others in the industry as well. For example you have the address (amongst other things) Wallaby Way that will be instantly recognizable to ""Wallace and Gromit"" fans and a way-cool Sea Turtle (Crush, voiced by Stanton himself) with a very close resemblance to those four ninja friends of his. There are also plenty of fun references to Jaws, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Monty Python and nearly every previous (and upcoming) Pixar feature. You also have Pixar's own Joe Ranft, who made famous the character of Heimlich the caterpillar from `A Bug's Life', making another special appearance as the voice of Jacques the cleaner shrimp. Kids won't get these in-jokes but for the adults it's a warm welcome. But, when it comes down to it `Finding Nemo' is aimed at just about anyone, as long as you enjoy a well-told and inventive story. From the vibrantly lush to the murky dark this is an absolute lure for the eyes and a treat for the funnybone.Score - 4 out of 5"

Chaser923,"Jul 28, 2021",9/10,"Amazing. Another W for Pixar, Another essential Gen Z childhood starter pack film. You can really tell how much better the animation is getting as the years go by. Tbh, every single Pixar film through 2010 is incredible. This is no exception, the story is as entertaining and sentimental as it gets, with amazing characters like Nemo, Dory, and Marlin. No wonder it's a classic, it is to this day still one of the best movies Pixar has put out. It is still very funny, and is definitely up there with my best animated films ever."

Caroher,"Aug 10, 2003",N/A,"Allright - the animation and the bgs are cool. Really great pictures of reefs and the marine life. Well, but this is just all. I do not know what film other people have seen, but it must have been a Finding Nemo with a good story and strong characters. The constant action was to much. The beginning of the movie was just horrible - okay, it was not the first time, that characters in Disney-Movies died, but what was good circumnavigated in ""Tarzan"" when the gorilla baby was killed, in Finding Nemo it was a terrible solution to introduce Coral first with a speaking part and kill her instantly after a talk about the Clown-fish-family, the babies and so on. After this it was not a problem to me that Marlin was overprotective and always wanted the best for his disabled son (why did he need a stunted fin at all?). The biggest probem was Dori - If you ever knew someone who sufferd on Alzheimers disease, you will not find this fish funny - shame on you Pixar, this was not so nice, why couldn´t she just be silly? Bruce and his group was funny, but this did not save it. Most scenes where too tough and nothing for younger Kids - nevertheless it was also boring for adults most of the time. Fish are Friends - not Food - well, but what are the human characters in this movie - Monsters? I did not like this. Overfishing of the seas is one thing, caring for an aquarium another.After this great trailer I expected more from it, better watch good old 2 D Animation next time - there is enough assortment from Studio Ghibli and a lot of Disney Classics to watch."
Vartiainen,"Jan 4, 2019",7/10,"A morose and neurotic clownfish named Marlin is raising his son Nemo alone after a barracuda ate his wife and all the rest of his children. (Trust me, it's a family film.) But then Nemo gets taken by Man, that great monster from the above world. And so Marlin has to go and find him. And we have our movie.I remember seeing this film when it came out and thinking that Pixar had really upped their game. Monsters, Inc. looked nothing compared to this and it's only a couple years older. All the locations underwater are breathtakingly beautiful, even today. Bursting with colour and life, hiding all sorts little details, nooks and crannies. And the fishes look great as well. There's a subtle scale detail on Marlin and Nemo that you only see in close-ups, but it's that extra layer of detail that completely sells it.True, the human characters are still a bit wonky, but even they have improved a lot from Monsters, Inc.Unfortunately, what keeps this film from being one of Pixar's all time greats, is the fact that the characters are not as good as they have been up to this point. Marlin especially is an aggravating character with his constant whining and scaredy cat antics. Yes, it's understandable and sympathetic to a point, and he does learn, but it's played up just a bit too much.Nemo is also a bit underdeveloped, but luckily the film has good characters as well. Chief amongst them being Dory, who's a bit of a one-joke character, but somehow the design, the jokes themselves and the voice acting by Ellen DeGeneres make it work beautifully.Finding Nemo is quality entertainment, don't get me wrong. It only pales in comparison to other Pixar films, and even amongst them it's up there. Definitely worth a watch for kids and adults alike."
elispaul,"May 31, 2003",10/10,"Nothing really needs to be said here about Pixar that hasn't been said before.  Their track record for producing amazing entertainment is currently unparalleled.  That track record just gets better with ""Finding Nemo"". This movie is gorgeous, heartstopping and hilarious.  I don't think many of the adults in the audience were really expecting it to be as drop-down funny as it was.  The characters are instantly relatable and, in a nice touch, there are really no villains.  Even the shark and the whale become quite endearing. (there's just the barracuda and he's gone before the opening credits)Ellen Degeneres is wonderful as Dory.  Every line that she delivers in the entire film is absolutely perfect.  Actually that can be said about all of the performances, but her character steals the show because she is, at the same time, the funniest and sweetest fish in the ocean.This movie is perfect for adults, perfect for children, heck, perfect for teenagers.  See it again and again because it is, without question, the movie of the summer and deserves every bit of praise it gets."
xoxcaitlin_kissxox,"Jul 2, 2007",6/10,"When Finding Nemo came out in theaters, I was nine years old and I instantly fell in love with it, alongside my friends and family.Four years later, I've either become cynical, or I've sobered up slightly. Looking back, I find some strong and weak points in Nemo, but I'll start with the dominant good points.1)Humor. This is undoubtedly the funniest movie Disney has created ( with the exception of maybe Toy Story). Dory's character is ingenious and draws viewers in with her innocent humor, never coming off as cheesy,awkward or inappropriate. Even characters who are not meant to provide comic relief have their own uproarious moments.2) Animation. While I'm slightly bitter over Disney's switch to computer animation, this movie defied my mind. The under sea landscaping was gorgeous. The characters had beautifully done figures that still retained a cartoony quality.3)Characters. All characters have nice forms, and are relevant to the plot. Their personalities are 3 dimensional and make them seem lifelike.4) Script. It perfectly blends humor, drama and action to make the movie deeper.Now here's for my down factors.5)Music!Music!Music! My biggest grudge over Pixar is their neglect of the songs that made Disney so timeless!If the movie had a few decent songs, perhaps I would believe it deserves all its awards and praise.But, evidently, the good outweighs the bad. So I decide the movie is fun and entertaining but needs just another sprinkle of Disney's magic dust."
educallejero,"Aug 24, 2018",1/10,"Ellen DeGeneres/Dory: What to say about this? Apparently, if youre famous you can't do anything wrong? She's beyond annoying, but she's never funny. Her voice is disgusting to listen too, so if the intent was to capture how annoying that type of character with a memory problem could be, that was a good job, but totally unnecessary and harmed the movie. That character didn't need a recognizable voice but a sweet one. The situation was annoying (and could've been funny) without an annoying voice.Barry Humphries/Shark Bruce: And then this. My GOD. How can you screw up a shark? The thing of not wanting to eat fish was clever (playing with Sharks sense of smell). But again, the voice was obnoxious (when he was on eating mode) and dumb (otherwise) rather than terrifying and dumb, which is the way it should've been.You had WILLEM DAFOE and GEOFFREY RUSH BUT YOU GAVE THIS PART TO BARRY WHO? ARE YOU STUPID?This movie has an 8. That's disgusting and shows you that you can throw dirt to people's faces, but with the name Pixar/Disney they would love it."
tightspotkilo,"Dec 17, 2005",9/10,"I have watched this film umpteen times with my 3 year-old granddaughter (I own the DVD), and I'm going to go against the grain and say that, while others may say that Finding Nemo doesn't quite measure up, I say that in many ways this film excels.I believe that what most people find lacking in Finding Nemo is the adult-oriented humor. And it's true, there is very little of it here. There is nothing approaching the risqué or double entendres here either, those things that are supposed to go over the kids' heads and give the adults a big guffaw. So, as a result, adults looking for that kind of stuff don't find it and are therefore disappointed.But if my granddaughter is any kind of a yardstick to measure it by, the kids love it.While this film may not be a masterpiece, it's the next best thing to it. That's because the artwork is superb, unparalleled and unmatched. The coloration, textures, use of light, and shadings are the finest that have ever been done on any animated film ever, before or since. Shrek2 and Shark's Tale, for instance, came out *after* this movie, and, good as they are (and they are very good) they are nowhere near as beautifully rendered as Finding Nemo. Particularly Shark's Tale, which in some ways seemed to be a blatant theft and rip off from Finding Nemo, but in my opinion fails because it's just not as good, either art-wise or story-wise. But Finding Nemo remains a visually beautiful piece of artwork, and the kids love it. And that counts for a lot."

jmeredith44,"Oct 30, 2007",N/A,"The Incredibles is a far better movie on all points. Finding Nemo pales in comparison, in fact I found the movie somewhat ho-hum, despite the plot's best efforts. Too formulaic. I am surprised to see this on the top 250, and surprised at the 8.3 rating. I think it's popular the way Olive Gardens are popular. It wasn't awful at all, just mediocre. Perhaps Pixar wanted a follow-up to its previous successes. Monsters, Inc. also was a much better project...imaginative and great little subtle humor jabs...Monsters, Inc. in fact might be Pixar's best yet...the ticklish fun of Monsters, Inc. is enhanced by wonderful performances by the voice actors. The play on the monster-under-the-bed fear with suggesting real monsters, and that fear being harnessed as power is a great example of universalism. The ending of Monsters, Inc., replete with scenes from ""Put That Thing Back Where It Came From Or So Help Me"" utilizes the running joke form of comedy well, along with other little gems, such as the repeating of Mike Wyzowski's name. The effort of Nemo suggests a tiredness...."

Okonh0wp,"May 31, 2004",10/10,"4 Stars: With a sense of imagination that only a child could have, Pixar has finally struck gold. En route to becoming the highest grossing animated movie in history, and deservedly so, Finding Nemo is a real gem for both kids and their parents. Its first move in the right direction is setting the picture underwater. Amid a previously unseen and pleasantly quirky world of spaced-out sea turtles and 12-step program sharks, the movie presents a heartwarming story about a father's search for his son. Add in witty dialogue and extroadinary performances by both Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks and you got a movie that's too good to miss."
GSmith9072,"Jun 20, 2007",6/10,"Being a film that titillated female viewers, children, and even some men alike, ""Finding Nemo""'s awe-inspiring animation and wonderful voice work may have caste the illusion that this well-made little film is something of a masterpiece. In reality, Nemo floats well, but there's not much beneath the surface, making it an enjoyable but over-hyped cgi flick.The film borrows heavily the pacing formula of the brilliant ""Toy Story"", and that's not really a bad thing. What gives the film it's mass appeal is undoubtedly, aside from the stunning graphics, the characters. Although I couldn't really connect with them, I can see why so many enjoy watching them. Dorry is the conventional half-wit (Sid from Ice Age, Donkey from Shrek) who for no real reason other then for conventional cinematic interest, finds herself accompanying Marlin on his journey to locate his missing son out of the vast ocean. Just a small twist, she has short term memory loss. I comment frequently on the use of the suspension of disbelief. I don't usually have a problem with it, depending on the context and how often it's used. Here, the unreality of the film leaps out at me with it's teeth barred. Not everyone who boats lives by the shore, and even though Marlin was lucky enough to have his son's captor live so close to the ocean, just how was he planning on getting up there without the help of a winged sympathetic fish-a-vore? Still, the film has enough whimsy for that not to get too problematic, but it allows the writer a lot of area in creating the story, and I wasn't as impressed with the results as others, aside from the films sporadic strong points.Dorry is bubbly and fun for many to watch. Just like with the tepid ""Ice Age"", it takes more then a character who's easy on the eyes and ears to become a character worthy of layering. She doesn't really improve or change much over the course of the film, she just occasionally in a very Disney-like fashion unintentionally helps Marlin escape some near fatal situations. Marlin has the task of forming a friendship with her, because she can grow a tad bit annoying. There's Nemo, who's blow up at his father seems rather unwarranted. I'd assume Nemo knows his siblings were killed by the hundreds, and I'd think he'd at least sympathize with his father for being so overprotective. He can still get upset, but to use the word ""hate""? And of course there's the tank gang, another hoot to watch (each having a cartoon personality), and the serious Gil.Back to the story, it's basically our heroes almost getting eaten, and nemo's attempts at an orthodontist's office to escape his aquatic prison. Some of the sequences succeed better the others. The film also revels in not demeaning animals who happen to be carnivorous, another plus. The film also quite well provides more then shallow entertainment for everyone, and I mean everyone. As long as you're not to young to watch a movie, ""Finding Nemo"" is accessible. That's the film's strongest quality, but aside from that, it really isn't anything much more. Some of the emotion seems trite and ill-proportioned, moving back and forth from believable to not so much. Being a kid's flick, it certainly is better then many other films out there. It just doesn't tackle that much in order to be considered over so many other films, which is usually the case. The story is very linear and it doesn't amaze that well outside of itself. The animation not only delivers, it delivers a natural biome that in itself is one of the most amazing places on earth. The animation on the fish is glorious, capturing the realistic way in which real fish move and partnering it with comedic human movement. The animated reef with it's human makeover, however, is even more brighter and colorful then most actual reefs. The film is like an inviting turquoise pool with a temperature of 85 degrees. And with a riveting score and perspective camera angles, the film launches itself away from other shtick to become noticed, but in my opinion, not really all the praise is worth it."
iammadeofcheese,"Aug 11, 2004",10/10,"After a good year has passed (well, it wasn't really a good year in my life, nor was it a good year in the cinema, but it was undoubtedly a long year, allow us all to the calm down. Finding Nemo is a children's movie. It is not an achingly poetic masterwork of biblical proportions. For all its polished aesthetic splendor, it is one of many recent Pixar cuddle-tear smorgasboards that have smack of the Pixar ""formula."" This is, of course, more multifaceted than you might hope. First, and foremost there is the element of the micro society where one least expects it: the anthropomorphic personification in various aspects of the animal kingdom or underwater or inanimate objects like toys, insects pretty much anything that looks cute. Pixar, which has modeled itself on Disney (for starters...in that, it is trying and succeeding to be the 2nd successful animation studio in the history of the cinema) is taking a page from Herr Walt, but not just simply by making animals...talk. There is the now mandatory wacky assortment of characters in whatever new environment our cutesy little poopy poof protagonist enters: usually an inexplicably dumb character, a hardened, raspy-voiced pessimist who has the seen the outside and yearns for a taste of liberation, a simple character driven mad by the plasticized existence of the microcosm they are confined to, the optimist, completely spiritually and intellectually fulfilled with appeasing the idiotic requests of the master, or overlord or Orwellian gumbent-a-clef, easing into a life of quiet desperation, finding simple pleasures in the banal daily regimen and the emigrant, caught in the middle. Perhaps these scenarios which Pixar seems to be ejaculating in majestic, new colors every few years are truly subversive and anti-American with their One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nestesque allegories...or maybe they're just smoking PCP. Still, they're a whole lot better than the CGA DreamWorks is churning out. Don't believe me? Compare the Incredibles (which is going to rock ass even if it sucks because look at Sam Jackson's character, man is HE black!) to Shrek 2. Shrek 2 sucked. For more on Shrek 2, see Shrek 2. Eddie Murphy needs to quit. C"

nickmesafilms,"Jul 9, 2011",10/10,"Talking toys! Talking bugs! Talking monsters! Now, there's talking fish? Awesome! The movie, ""Finding Nemo"" takes place on a father who tries to find his lost son fish, with the help of a fish with a load of short-term memory loss, portrayed by Ellen DeGeneres, which made me laugh a lot. Along the way, they encounter sharks, sea turtles, jellyfish, and tank fish. The story then explains a true loving message of father and son. Okay, I think Nemo is another personal favorite film from Pixar. The story felt true to life, the characters were all hilarious, including Dory, the best Pixar character ever, for most of the laughs, and the heart of this tale kept beating like it was going to teach a big lesson where to respect your loved ones, and taught the true meaning of father and son. And they use this true fact with talking fish! How cool is that? ""Finding Nemo"" was quite a story to die for, and the story was so loving and sometimes heartbreaking that everybody wants to see a movie like this! Looks like Pixar has a soft side of drama, and has a big heart for family. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again, and I'll never be tired of it. This is one of the best animated films of all time. ""Finding Nemo"", in my review, ""a loving portrait of father and son, with talking fish""."

I was particularly impressed with the various atmospheric conditions from the colourful reef, to the pitch black depths, to the world war 2 wreck, the polluted Sydney harbour, etc etc.Of all the pixar films so far, there was more to tug at the heart strings here. Maybe because I am a parent."
madmattuk,"Oct 12, 2003",7/10,"Not my mark but its position among Pixar films.  Lacking the invention ofMonsters Inc and the strong characterisation of the Toy Story films, I foundFinding Nemo slightly disappointing.I'm sure children will love it, but despite some visually beautiful scenes(especially the jelly fish) I don't think there's much here for the older viewer.Not a bad film exactly (I gave it 7) but not up to the standard of the other three."
jose-cruz53,"Jan 8, 2013",7/10,"Pixar has always been masters of their craft: making excellent children's movies. Indeed, this is among their top 5 best, perhaps, as it not only deals with subjects that interest children but also seeks to teach their parents something very important: to not overprotect their children since the kids need to tackle the world in order to grow, even if they are under some risk, the fact is that the parents need to accept the dangers of the world and that it is impossible to protect their children absolutely.The main character of the movie is an overprotective father who lost 99% of his unborn children (i.e. eggs, since he is a fish) and his wife due to the attack of a very large and powerful predator fish. Traumatized by the experience he overprotects his only remaining offspring but when he loses his child he embarks on an adventure to find him again, hence the name of the movie."
onepotato2,"Apr 24, 2004",2/10,"After the over-the-top praise this movie received, I was surprised to find it to be an pretty unremarkable movie, and one that's not especially imaginative/visual. It is uncomplicated by any element not approved by committee, which means you get regurgitated under-sea relationships, with slightly modernized shtick. (Yep, there's a shark chase, but he's in recovery ?!) Take any three familiar mass market plot lines and average them together and you get something as tepid as this. This movie was gone from my mind the second it ended. I don't recall a frame of it.The only way you could be a fan of this movie is if you think a movie is supposed to spell everything out for you and cause you to emote every twenty minutes. It never touched me and it never engaged me.Nobody ever went broke tossing look-alike projects at undiscerning American audiences."
bibleman24,"Oct 8, 2011",10/10,"'Finding Nemo' is definitely one of Disney's best films and according to our dear IMDb it's one of the best films that has ever been made (currently #172). It also won an Oscar for the 'Best Animated Film of the Year' in 2003. So clearly, this is a film worth watching. But if you're still not convinced then perhaps some of these comments will help.The story is engaging. A fish-father Marlin has only one precious son called Nemo, who happens to be the son of his now deceased fish-wife. But Nemo is taken away from Marlin. Because of Marlin's vow years ago to never let anything bad happen to his son, Marlin goes in search of Nemo. It's a journey which takes Marlin through much of the ocean. Along the way, Marlin encounters plenty of action, characters, terrible situations and is increasingly discouraged that he might never see Nemo again. But along the way he learns a few important lessons about parenting and the value of true friendship. Also, his determination in seeking to find his son is well worth viewers learning from. Family is something that cannot be replaced and should be protected and nurtured even if it costs you everything you have, including your life.The script and characters are both brilliant. Some of the ideas are wacky, but it's the kind of thing that both adults and children have found really funny. Dory is generally the first character who everybody remembers. She is really good company and she is a classic character in Disney film-making history. Imagine it: Marlin needs help finding his son and of all the fish in the ocean he gets stuck with one who has short term memory loss! The main character Marlin is enjoyable to watch and it's interesting to see his slow, but certain progress as a father who loves his son. Bruce the great-white shark, though he is not a main character, is also very unique and entertaining. Just about every character in this film is memorable: Gill, Nigel, Nemo, and the rest. They are all great and the script-writers have made them interact beautifully and creatively!The special effects are incredible. You really feel like you are watching a story taking place in the big-wide world called the ocean. It's breath-taking. I remember going to see it in the cinema in 2004 and it blew us all away. It was another step forward for its time.For some reason, I always love to re-visit this film and it's never disappointing. It's a real feel-good film. It's funny, it's extremely entertaining and it will also make you cry if you're a right sissy like me. Brilliant film and worth buying to enjoy again and again.10/10"
k-king2,"May 30, 2003",8/10,"I have 3 kids, 7, 5, 4 (boy, boy, girl) they all really enjoyed it.  Paid attention the whole time, which is how I judge if they like it or not. The movie has a solid story, some great one liners and jokes.  My kids and I both laughed, my wife even commented on my laughter, I guess I don't laugh as much as I use too, old age and all.  Great picture for the whole family, nothing offensive or scary.  Clever inside jokes here and there.. for instance the Shark's name is Bruce, this was the name given the mechanical shark in Jaws by the film crew.Pixar has delivered another top notch film, imho they are batting 1.000, all 5 movies have been good to great and all of them are still fun to watch again."
eldreddsouza,"May 23, 2021",8/10,"When the film started I honestly was kinda bummed and thought this film was just another overrated nonsense. The whole Nemo getting lost thing seemed kinda forced. An overprotective father causing his son to get annoyed and in turn disobey him which eventually leads him to get trapped by a diver felt annoying because all this feels like it could have easily been avoided. But then in order to enjoy it I thought it would be best to ignore that part and to watch the rest of the movie with an open mind. As the film progresses I find myself actually engrossed and enjoying the scenes as they come along. The new characters, Dory, shark, turtles, etc. Are introduced who are quite fun and interesting. The shark part was a bit unnecessary though. They could've kept it as a friendly shark or something, but the bloodshed was too much I feel since it is a kids movie.The last 45 minutes of the film are the best as we are taken out of the ocean for a breath of fresh air and are in a search for Nemo. The dentist scenes are the funniest part of the movie and the little cruel girl haha is the highlight for me as it is during her scenes that I found myself laughing the most. It's a pretty cool story and the way the fishies in the tank act to Help Nemo return back to the ocean is pretty wholesome and sends out a good message to kids.It's really impressive how fine the animation is in a film released in '03. It's just beautiful to look at and especially the scenes that are outside the water.Extremely beautiful film. You may feel bored or annoyed I the start but it just gets so much better and ends on a high note."
ehctwin,"May 5, 2015",9/10,"""Finding Nemo,"" is an excellent movie for viewers of all ages. In this movie, three valuable life lessons are shared: 1) parents protect their children because they love and care for them, 2) teamwork is important in being successful, and 3) your differences do not define you. These lessons can apply to viewers of all ages and are presented throughout the course of the movie.Overall, ""Finding Nemo"" was nearly flawless. From the outstanding animation, to the talented voices of actors/actresses, to the entertaining jokes and plot, I find this to be one of Disney Pixar's best movies."

No teenager's life will be fully complete without having watched this movie. Grab a bag of popcorn, grab your remote, and begin to endure the wonderful journey of beautiful little fishies in the ocean. Believe it or not, this movie has made me cry. And laugh. And sing. And dream. It's beautiful and the graphics are truly amazing. This movie makes me want to go to the beach and find Nemo so I can keep him for the rest of my life in my room and enjoy his pretty little colors. Watch this movie. Bye.

patrick_dunne,"Jan 19, 2006",7/10,"It's always a pleasure to see Pixar come out with another movie. Pixar has the power to make you laugh, and make you smile. When you walk out of the theater, you can show off that big grin crowding your face.Okay. Well enough of the corny-ness. Finding Nemo is a good, fun movie. It is a movie about a fish named Marlin, who is trying to find his little son in a big ocean.While it is a good movie, I found it to be over-hyped and disappointing. With most of the Pixar and Dreamworks movies working more in the comedy department, we would expect Pixar to go in a more comedic direction. But, Finding Nemo wasn't the laugh-fest I expected it to be. Sorry about my bias, but I was pretty disappointed! I also thought certain lines such as ""That snail was about to charge"" were a bit corny. That upset me a bit too. Besides, the plot is a bit similar to Toy Story. A character gets lost, and somebody goes out to rescue him. But, that's just my opinion.7/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."
danila_1,"Jun 3, 2003",6/10,"This is not Monsters Inc. and, of course, not Shrek (by DreamWorks). Animation is excellent and leaves nothing to complain about, but the story is not that good. It feels very disjointed and fragmentary, you don't really feel the flow (despite it being set in the ocean). Often it is too predictable (I know, it's not a thriller, but still you can make it somewhat original and surprising sometimes) and during some moments even boring. There is not really much for adults in this film (like there was in Shrek), except for quite funny Memento-like Dora with her short-term memory loss, a couple forced semi-funny jokes, like ""what's with men asking for direction"" and supposedly funny ""totally cool"" turtle ""dude"".I recommend renting it on DVD or cassette just to see the eye-candy (even a cam version would be enough) and that's all. It's not that special."
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Nov 16, 2003",3/10,"OK, I went to Best Buy the day this movie was released. I just wanted to look around for some movie to watch later in the night. As I was checking out, I noticed everyone had a copy of ""Finding Nemo"". Some even had 3 copies! I couldn't believe it. So, I figured that it has to be some movie. But I knew my aunt bought the movie already, so I'll watch it with my cousins at home.Boy! Do I regret that. Now, it was cute at times. But not as funny or amusing as ""The Lion King"". And computer effects? I'm getting sick of it. But it's for the kids, I'll let it go. But I'm looking over the top 250 films of all time, and this was on it?! Over other classic movies?! Why? All I want to know is why?! ""The Lion King"" isn't on there, but it was the most successful Disney movie. And ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Peter Pan"", and ""Beauty and the Beast"" were not on there.

dynver,"Apr 7, 2018",9/10,Still one of the best Pixar movies to date. This was better than Finding Dory because it had more depth and emotion in the movie.
margaretwestlake-1,"Feb 24, 2005",10/10,"God is in the details in this so endearing film. The beauty of the undersea terrain is unparalleled, in real life or art. The faces of the creatures are so expressive and dear that one cannot help but connect emotionally. Brooks is exemplary, he is the worried, unselfish, loving father. Everyone was exemplary in voice and emotion. I heard a TV critic say that Ellen DeGeneris deserved a prize, and if you knew how these complex characters are created by voice and then drawn, you would have to agree. Through emotions of both sadness and joy we felt love for the family. The humor was agreeable to my age (over 50) and it must have been agreeable to children too, considering the high box office. The young kindergarten characters were so joyfully portrayed that I can still see them in my mind. I have seen this movie four times and every time I run across it on Cable I can't help but stop for a minute or often two hours and watch it again. Always fresh, and enchanting. I wish we had more family movies with this loving quality."

wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Mar 13, 2004",N/A,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsEver since his wife was killed,Marlin the clownfish has guarded his young son Nemo like a hawk and is especially apprehensive of his first day at school.On the day,Nemo finally tires of his father's constant over-protectiveness and commits an act of open defiance.This results in him being caught by a deep sea diver and taken up to the surface,setting Merlin on a desperate course to find him.Despite the mass rave reviews,I was initially sceptical about seeing Finding Nemo,as I couldn't really see the appeal a film of it's ilk would have for me.However,I was then reminded of a film from Disney and,more significantly,Pixar Animation Studios from a few years ago that I really enjoyed called Toy Story and,to this day,I still find that enjoyable,so maybe I could hold out some hope for this.It was an enjoyable film for what it was,very funny and charming in parts,but something of an uninvolving experience.***"

FeverDog,"Feb 11, 2004",7/10,"I'm not much of a fan of these computer animated films.  I've seen them all, but have only liked ANTZ and MONSTERS INC.  But FINDING NEMO is a passable flick, mostly due to its stunningly gorgeous visuals.Wow, what a beautiful-looking movie.  I was especially impressed with the jellyfish scene; there was something dreamy about their look,  It's hard to explain, but they felt both real and unreal.I laughed several times, but I'm bored with praising the movie (Ellen was marvelous, blah, blah), so let me nitpick.  Well, not nitpick exactly - these are just thoughts I had while watching it:*Much of it seemed like a video game, where you survive a challenge and advance to the next world.*Why did some characters have American accents, and others Australian ones? And how were their voices so clear in the water?  (You ever try talking under water?)  And how did their voices sometimes echo in the water?  And howcum their voices sounded the same both in and out of water?*Can fish adapt so easily from salt water to fresh and back again?*Do fish really sleep on their side?  Do they sleep at all?*A little surfer-dude speak goes a long way.  How would sea turtles acquire such a patois?  Do they spend a lot of time on the beach?  Or licking funny frogs?*Would a doctor give a fish with a visual defect to his daughter as a gift?*Why would a doctor (or anyone) write his business address on a pair of cheap goggles?*There was one climax too many.  Did we really need one more perilous situation?*What's with Pixar and bad kids with braces?I guess that's about all the questions I shouldn't ask.  None matter, do they?7/10"
IMDbabe1807,"Mar 20, 2019",10/10,"One of Disney & Pixar's finest - visually, musically and emotionally stunning. Perfect for the whole family, such a wholesome story and so wonderfully executed. Cannot fault it."
Bladerunner•,"Jun 6, 2003",10/10,"I have two sons, one six and one nine; we hugged, laughed and cried during this whole film. People that whined that their kids were ""traumatized"" by the action must be smothering their children. Only a very small child (well under two) or a kid in desperate need to loosen the grip from mommy's apron strings could possibly be ""terrorized"" by this film. Movies are about love, loss, fear, laughter, surprise, etc. Asking a film to be some bland thing that every little wimpy baby can see without boo-hooing is absurd. Get a life, and quit raising simps.The message of the film is very pertinent, especially in today's world, yet it is not bludgeoned over the audience's head. It takes head on the fact that children are increasingly pushing for more freedom at a younger age, and shows that a balance can be reached. It doesn't shy away from the fact that danger exists, and no parent can safeguard against every possible threat. It embraces the fact that each parent must loosen the grip, while maintaining as safe an environment as possible.Another wonderful aspect concerns little Nemo's ""lucky"" fin. He actually has a damaged, or handicapped right fin, although the movie never portrays Nemo as disabled, in the traditional sense. Instead it is an allegory for a parent's justifiable reluctance to allow their children to pursue their own independence in a dangerous world - and a very subtly powerful one at that.The voice talents are excellent, with Ellen DeGeneres stealing the show. Even if you don't like her, you'll like her... here. Willem Defoe and Albert Brooks also give performances, which take advantage of their public image, but add delightful twists to deepen the impact.It is a film that focuses on the father/son relationship throughout, whereas many Disney movies kill off the dad early on. This isn't to say that everything is all roses here either. Caulk a realistic relationship, with the faults and missteps present therein to a Pixar team that increasingly continues to school animation studios on the fact that STORY MATTERS MOST.This film is a great opportunity for families to feel close to one another without the impression you checked your brain at the door to achieve that. My boys and I hugged for five minutes after this film ended, and then proceeded to crack up during the humorous end credits. Parents who balk at the fear factor, need to put away the pampering powder and concentrate on bringing up kids equipped to deal appropriately with a frightening world, at that age. It's not Alien for crying-out-loud. What it is, is great movie-making and real fun, especially for families with strong, independent kids testing boundaries - as all healthy children do."
moviewizguy,"Mar 18, 2006",10/10,"Just keep swimming...--This is a line from the movie that is funny. This film is simple. A fish gets kidnap by humans and his father goes on a look out for him with a help of Dory.Dory has a short term memory that runs through her family. Or maybe its not. Well, she's played by the funny Ellen DeGeneres. She's the one who makes everyone laugh during the whole film. This film is funny for both kids and adults. It's really entertaining with peril here and there. This film is also sad, including the beginning that is hard to see, even for me.The animation, overall, is great. Obviously, Pixar's animation is always great and it'll never become bad. It's wonderful to see the ocean. Everywhere is colorful on the screen. This is a masterpiece. It'll soon become a classic. This film is not overrated. It's fine where it is right now. This is the best animated film of 2004, in my opinion. The moral of the story is good for all of the parents to hear: Do not become over protective to your kids. Sooner or later you'll have to let them go with their own life. Ellen is the perfect character for Dorry. She's just adorable that it makes you put a smile in your face.This is an entertaining and funny piece of work. It's great for all ages and everyone should see it. Go SEA it and have a hopping good time!"
WasiReviews,"Aug 20, 2020",8/10,"What can I say about Finding Nemo that hasn't been said before the script, animation as usual for a Pixar film is great and the ability to make a boring animal fish which can be hard to adapt as seen in Shark Tales in 2004. The whole story is a father-son bonding after the mother dies."

nobrainer22tx,"Jun 9, 2003",10/10,"Well, this is another hit from Pixar. I did not think anything could top Monsters, Inc. but this movie certainly did. The thing that really made this movie great was the incredible animation and beautiful scenery in which it is set. Some of the other Pixar movies did not have this advantage.The plot is mature enough for adults with humor that only they would get. But it is cute enough to hold the attention of youngsters also. Although, I would say that very young children would probably not be best suited for this movie. It is very fast paced and deals with a subject that could be scary to a kid. Just image being 3 and seeing a movie in which a kid has no mother and is taken away from his father. Then the father is chased by sharks, and while the sharks were cute and rather humorous, they could still scare little kids. Many of the very young children in the theater were crying and screaming at various parts. Maybe children under 5 or 6 should wait till video to see this so it isn't so loud and overwhelming.Other than that, I loved it! I am 22 and saw it with my 46 year mom and we thought it was wonderful. You are never too old for these movies!"
MLDinTN,"May 24, 2004",N/A,"I can't say enough about the animation.  It was so realistic.  The fish looked like they were solid, especially, Bruce the shark.  He ""felt"" so much larger and like the shark actually took up space.  You see the seaweed swaying in the water, etc...  There's no telling how long it took to put together.With that set aside, I didn't think the story was that great.  It was OK, but definitely overhyped.  And I was expecting a lot of laughs based on other reviews, but I laughed once.  The story wasn't very original either. Rather than a friend searching for a friend, it's the dad going on an adventure to find his son.  Along the way, he gets help from an oddball. And since it's Disney, you know how it ends with lessons learned.FINAL VERDICT:  The story is OK, but the visuals are amazing.  It's worth at least one viewing."
freq32,"Apr 6, 2004",9/10,anybody who doesnt like this movie is a pussy.  This movie was more than tolerable for an animation.  The concept was solid and the characters were likeable and superbly animated.   The voice actors were cast perfectly and gave great performances.  The entertainment value is a five out of five. The action sequences were so brilliantly done that it doesnt lose value with each time you view it.  The transitions where creatively done and kept the storyline well in pace.  I look forward to seeing the next Pixar animated film THE INCREDIBLES although i wonder if it will be much different since its written and directed by Brad Bird.  Pixar is where it's at in the world of new high end animation..and like i said ..if you don't like this movie .. then you're just not a true fan of cg animation.
andylong6,"Dec 10, 2003",6/10,"You'd be better off watching Toy Story in the animation category than this, which is a beautiful piece of computer animation, but bland in terms of dialogue particularly.  It's actually rather annoying.  And it lacks humor in my opinion."
timopekkafr,"Jul 10, 2008",3/10,"In IMDb I really like the option where one can read the reviews in like-hate order. One like, one hate; I think that's one of the best ways to get a real picture of a picture :). But let's not forget, that it is essential to also see what one has written elsewhere, what that person likes or dislikes. If I don't know about a movie I try to find a person who shares my views and choose a movie she/he liked. And do not believe a person, that rates everything down.Nemo is dull and confusing. Not in the manner, that one can't understand things going on, but I saw this film once and do not want to see it again, ever. I don't like it when cartoons are about shouting and screaming all the way. Something good happens: scream, something bad: scream, if you don't scream, than shout. It's just stupid. One could just ignore the biological and geographical - and all the other illogical - ""mistakes"" this movie has to offer, it was catching in any other sense, but no. This movie is just cheap entertainment for people who don't care what they are looking as far it's drawn well. If you are thinking what to rent for the evening or for a trip I advise you to choose Happy Feet or Anastasia instead... that is, if you don't like cheap thrills. Points go for the fact, that I really saw this movie from the start till the end. 2s and 1s go for movies I couldn't even bare to watch all the way."

Many fun gags-the Pelican(Geoffrey Rush!) and the Cliff Clavin fish school...great.Lotsa heart too-you care about these guys an awful lot more than you do the live actor portrayals in 'Matrix Reloaded', within the first 4 minutes. This one will live on for ages as a classic.

I, myself, will have to say (other than Pixar) I agree. But what Pixar has done to animated movies is just genius. To start off, Finding Nemo presents a lot of hidden adult themes that adults would only understand. It also contains heart, which no animated movie has ever done. It makes you actually feel for an animated creature and that is just almost magic. Pixar explores childhood in a way nothing else can, and I just adore these movies. I also have to admit, Finding Nemo put a tear in my eye (and for an animation) that is just complete brilliance. I respect Pixar for doing these such things. The film also has amazing voice acting and you can actually see the emotion the actors put out to make this movie, something only Pixar could do. This movie is an absolute heartwarming, hilarious adventure that digs into your heart and toys with your emotions. For all you punks out there you cannot look past the childish aim, you are missing out incredibly. This is definitely the best animated film. 10/10."

Quinoa1984,"Jun 11, 2003",10/10,"Finding Nemo, from co-directors Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich (who have worked as directors on past pixar films like Bug's life and Toy Story 2) have devised an adventure film that takes the viewer far beyond anything imaginable with Little Mermaid. In fact, much of the humor and dialogue reminded me of the sophistication that went with an animated movie like Antz, where the top celebrity personalities came forth to give voice to wonderful creature creations.And speaking of Antz, this time there is a neurotic, obsessive caricature of a comic in Finding Nemo, here named Marlin and played by Albert Brooks. After his wife, a clown fish, and his hundreds of eggs are devoured by a larger fish, he finds one egg left and becomes compulsive in securing it's safety. His son Nemo, it turns out, gets caught in a diver's net and taken to a Dentist's office in Sydney, Australia. This sets Marlin off on his quest across the ocean, along with a fish who forgets things as soon as their mentioned, voiced by Ellen Degeneres. They encounter sharks in rehab, turtles with Californian accents, a whale (quasi-Pinnochio there), and much more, all the while little Nemo, inside the fish-tank and renamed Sharkbate, starts to gain the courage his father never considered he had, and vice-versa.The Pixar team, like in their previous treats, deliver worlds that usually can only exist in the imagination - the under-the-ocean scenes, making up about 65 percent of the film, are obviously breathtaking in design while not going overboard in realism, and the scenes in the dentist office and on the pier are precise too. It's like we've thought we've been here before, but now the filmmakers take us right into the nexus of it. This splendor, along with the voice work by Brooks, Degeneres, Willem Dafoe as the leader of the fish-tank pack, Geoffrey Rush as a pelican, and all the supporting parts, give anyone in any age group the finest animated spectacle of the summer.By the way, those seagulls are the funniest thing Pixar's come up with since the aliens in Toy Story!"
erv-7,"Nov 26, 2009",5/10,"The movie is both good and horrible at same time.The Good: It has a lot of absolutely hilarious moments and scenes. Many of them of those involve ""Dory"" character, which also has excellent voice acting. There are a lot of places where you will laugh (well, unless you have absolutely no sense of humor).The Bad: The parts that aren't funny are extremely weak. Plot and characters involve a lot of clichés, characters have nearly no personality (perhaps with exception of ""Dory"" fish), they don't really develop much. All scenes that are supposed to bring any emotional impact(or to be tragic) simply doesn't work and feel unnatural, often they feel ""out of place"". I had to skip certain moments because they were extremely boring to me and I felt like I saw something similar before.Summary: There is only one truly memorable and interesting character in this movie: the ""Dory"" fish. ""Dory"" certainly looks better than both ""protagonists"" (father and son), mostly because of excellent voice acting. Besides ""Dory"" it is hard to miss certain little girl (because of music theme and associated funny scene) that appears on screen for a short time. There are many funny moments, but outside of them movie offer very little. Overall it is much weaker than ""Up""/""Wall-E"" (which were released several years later) and may be on par with Ratatoille. Graphically movie isn't bad, but isn't impressive either, and I could swear I saw texture filtration artifacts or poor bump-mapping work in two places, although I'm not completely sure about it. Animation is perfect as always, but it doesn't save you from weak parts in the story.So if you want few laughs and don't mind mediocre story - this is for you. If you want ""deep"" story, you can skip this movie."

Some kids movies are syrup flavored saccharine drops, that can make a more mature viewer choke. But here in Nemo is a gently, loving and observant film that can speak both to a child and an adult. This film gives me a warm fuzzy feeling whenever I think of it. In my opinion it's better than the Incredibles. The characters are better developed and more likable, and the storyline is more cohesive and accessible to children, while not boring adults. There is also a lack of bitter sarcasm and meanness that sometimes rear their ugly heads even in children's films. What makes this movie so great to me is the fact that i believe it to really be not a children's film, but a film for adults that happens to be wonderfully appropriate for children. It doesn't try to talk down to kids and teach them some silly lesson about sharing and caring etc... but simply exists as loving entertainment."

The exploration into ocean life is perfectly animated, however most amazing is the realism with which Sydney is portrayed. The visual style is not alone what makes this great however, it is as the film's delightful characters and sense of humour that make it enjoyable. All the characters are funny, each in their own way; the film reaches hilarity many times; and the whole production buzzes along well to the brilliant choral music of Thomas Newman. The sound in terms of the sea and seaside noises is excellently recorded and edited too. This is not only perfect family entertainment, but also a perfect film overall."

John08,"Jun 6, 2003",10/10,"This is a very good movie.  Very funny and a great message for all ages. I was impressed with the graphics, characters, and the story.  Finally a movie you can take a 3 year old to see and not have to worry about hidden messages, and inappropriate comments, but can also be enjoyed by adults."
obrofta,"Oct 21, 2006",10/10,"What a delightful film. It's difficult to crack a top ten list, which hasn't changed in seven years (since Dances with Wolves), but this movie gets in my top ten. Ellen Degeneres' Dory creates her own chemistry with the sea and all the characters with whom she interacts. Yes, there is a special spark between Dory and Nemo's protective father fish, voice by Albert Brooks. Degeneres character would test the most stodgy and stoic of audiences. Who could mot crack a smile under Dory's amazing repertoire of forgetfulness and forget-me-nots?Who knew Nigel (Pelican from down under) was voiced by Geoffrey Rush? I think we are all still throwing in our own ""mine, mine..."", whenever we find the opportunity. All the way to the end and beyond (don't forget to watch the credits!)it's a story of adventure, heroism and love. Even if you think you a have an aversion to animated features, I double dog dare you to watch this movie, and try NOT to crack a smile. Nemo will wear you out with laughter, and make your heart grow fonder. Even if you thought you didn't have one (a heart that is)."
preppy-3,"Jun 1, 2003",10/10,"Pixar Studios (with Walt Disney) has done another incredible computer-animated family film.  (Their previous works were Toy Story 1 & 2 and Monsters Inc).This one involves a clownfish (voiced by Albert Brooks) trying to find his young son who was ""captured"" by an Australian dentist for his fish tank in his office.  He's ""helped"" by another fish (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who has no short-term memory.This film is just dazzling to watch.  The underwater sequences are beautiful, full of color and life.  In every single case the voices match the animals perfectly.  The jokes are great--they can appeal to both children and adults (my favorites were the shark being called Bruce--a reference to ""Jaws"" and DeGeneres trying to ""speak"" whale).  There are some scenes that might frighten very small children involving some vicious-looking animals with big, sharp teeth--but the movie is not violent or bloody at all (it IS G rated).Basically a really fun great film.  See it!"
