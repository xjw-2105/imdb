The_Fifth_Echo,"Jun 16, 2010",10/10,"I decided to watch Grave of the Fireflies yesterday. My friends told me it was extremely moving and sad. I hesitated at first, but then I said ""Oh well, I'll give it a try."" At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film, I've ever seen.This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.This movie isn't your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I'm not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn't trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie, that just brought me to tears.I am kind of upset, that this movie didn't get many awards as it should. In that regards, it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi's best movie they have ever released.I truly advice you to bring a handkerchief, cause chances are that you will cry.An Emotional Epic Animated Film, that I recommend everyone to watch.Quite Simply 10/10"
Nogami,"Aug 26, 2001",10/10,"I had the fortune of being able to see Hotaru no Haka on the big-screen in Seattle a couple of years ago.  It was truly the high-point of my film festival excursions.  At the end of the movie, there was silence, absolute and total silence in the theater - and then, only an occasional sniffle until the end credits had finished rolling and the house lights came up.  It would've seemed almost disrespectful to profane the silence with words.Seeing a movie like this really changes attitudes about war - about who really suffers, and that the honor and glory is shallow comfort when you contemplate what has been lost in the struggle.I've made the comment to my friends that if you ever see someone who isn't moved (usually to tears) by this movie, you've found someone without a soul. As difficult as it is to watch, turn off the phone, dim the lights, and immerse yourself in the film with ones you love - you will be a better person for it in the end.There are many other reviews of this movie, and most of them are probably far more comprehensive than my own - I'll conclude by saying that this movie should required viewing at some point (as should the peace museums at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) for everyone.When you see war and conflict in the news or read about it in the paper, think back to this movie - your perspective will probably be broadened, and your eyes opened a bit more.I've only watched this movie about 4 times - it usually takes a year or so to ""decompress"" after watching it.  To see it too often would lessen the impact, and that would be the worst possible thing to do to this movie."
Black Rainbow,"Jan 28, 2001",10/10,"I was warned this movie would be emotional, but I had no idea just how understated that was.  By the end, my friend and I were huddled together, pouring out tears I've never shed for any movie before.  It was a mix of horror, empathy, sadness, and so many more emotions I can't even begin to list.Visions of this film have haunted me since first watching it, and I would find it hard to watch again, simply from it being so heart-wrenching. Only one movie has ever hit me hard enough to keep me from subjecting myself to it's strong emotions again (The thief, the cook, his wife and her lover).I strongly urge all to watch this, as it rises well about any films I've seen, anime or not."
dee.reid,"Aug 28, 2004",10/10,"""Grave of the Fireflies"" is one of the most ambitious, depressing, and quite frankly, best films that I've ever seen. I was nearly moved to tears by this film's brave treatment of such critical subject matter. Yes, it's an Anime' piece, but surprisingly, it came out in 1988, during a time where most Japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths, borderline pornography, or both.As a fan of the Anime' genre of film-making, many great pieces have achieved some sort of cult status here in America, yet none have really reached mainstream success. Some have broken through the barrier and have gained acceptance with American critics, like Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira,"" or ""Princess Mononoke,"" or ""Spirited Away"" (both films directed by Hayao Miyazaki). One that I've seen and has been barely mentioned by most critics is ""Grave of the Fireflies.""What we have with ""Grave of the Fireflies,"" is a story of innocence lost and two children who ultimately face a losing battle with trying to survive in a small Japanese village in the closing days of World War II. WWII was the costliest conflict in world history, with millions dead and thousands left to pick up the pieces.In the center of it, are the aforementioned two children, who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid. Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family, they're sent to live with their aunt, who is at first warm and welcoming to them, but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter. From that point on, the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.Very easily one of the best Anime' films that I've ever seen (or any animated film for that matter), I find it difficult to believe just how truly overlooked ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is. The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).We get a sense of the dread of the two lead characters, who watch as the world around them crumbles into heaps of ashes, and aircraft loom ominously overhead, dropping their deadly, incendiary cargo on unsuspecting Japanese villagers.The director, Isao Takahata, obviously has a special resentment of the war, but manages to avoid condemning it outright. The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children, who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. I probably shouldn't say this but I am anyways, but this film has to be the ""Schindler's List"" of animated pieces. It's brave, it's not overly sentimental, but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality. It should be required viewing in any high school world history class.A beautiful film; not to be missed by anyone."
bdod5489,"Feb 3, 2005",10/10,"This film is utterly emotionally draining whilst being rewarding at the same time.The animation is both realistic and stylized but that's not the point, the main focus of this film is the character development of the brother and sister protagonists. Their relationship is nothing short of beautiful and touching.And without spoiling anything I have to say that this film touched me in a way no other film has ever touched me in my adult life. One or two films have upset me and reduced me to watery eyes but Grave of the Fireflies had me in fits of sobbing despair. I was a mess! I'm talking total emotional breakdown. Couldn't talk without sobbing! One of the best films I have EVER seen, animated or not."
Dark0,"Oct 9, 2003",10/10,"Being my first Anime review I thought I'd start off with my one of my favourite pieces of work from who else but Studio Ghibli. Ghibli have rarely produced anime that doesn't fall short of great but Graveyard is something different indeed.Set in the aftermath of World War II, Graveyard is focused on the lives of a caring brother and his young sister (Setsuko and Seita) and how they struggle against both the elements of wartime and a depreciating Japanese empire. The most striking thing about Graveyard is probably how real everything seems. The animation is very unconventional to the likes of say Spirited Away or Laputa but in a good way. The horror of war is beautifully realised through the animation, whether it be the American destruction being shown or the bleak outlook on peoples lives, namely the two main characters. Thankfully it earns every shred of emotion it conveys through these two sympathetic characters that only the coldest of hearts wouldn't warm up to.Avoiding any Hollywood sentimentality, it is often a bleak and depressing perspective depicted but all the more brutally powerful in the process. With my eyes welling up through the duration of the film, it occured to me just how well the Director understands what raw heartfelt emotion is and how to play the audiences heart strings. Nevertheless nothing is shown in a heavy handed approach, no empthasis is put on the Americans nor is there any special attention taken to the war details. If anything the citizens of Japan are shown in the coldest light often giving little help to the plight of others, but demonstrating furthermore what desperate situation everyone is in.Takahata instead decides to focus on the plight of it's title characters against the background of war. With the empire of Japan in crisis and food shortages everywhere it is heart breaking to see a brother struggle to meet ends meet for his sister. Due to the approach taken it borders on being horrifying but fortunately the tone is changed with the spirit put into Setsuko's character. Much like 'The Pianist' the issue is not the war but the struggle and will to survive in it. This is clearly displayed in a plot that revolves around the downward spiral Setsuko trying to feed himself and more importantly the younger and more vulnerable sister Seita. The animation though detailed and indeed beautiful in some sequences (namely relating to the title), is not by any means flashy but captures emotions and interactions between the characters perfectly. It's the perfect mixture of such animation, realistic and highly likeable characters that makes the whole film one tearful experience. Dealing with such difficult issues it's very hard to imagine this being a film and if it was I don't think it would of been done as well.Part of the brilliance also comes from symbology and the association to many different worlds in such a understanding depiction. The child, Seita, is nothing short of perfection in child like behaviour happily oblivious to the desperate situation, amusing herself with simplicity and the quirks of nature and the outdoors. The older brother Setsuko who must carry the burdon of everything is also perfectly portrayed and to watch there decent is painful to say the least. To struggle is one thing but to have shock, shattered dreams and be depended on is something anyone can empthasise with.There may be some people who will shy away from Anime, disregarding it as a mere cartoon. To those people and everyone else I recommend Graveyard as the tonic, which can be appreciated by anyone with a heart and soul. Among the finest pieces of Anime created and one of the most touching war films ever made."
Teebs2,"Jan 3, 2006",10/10,"This film proves without any doubt that animation isn't just suited to tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy and violence. This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy, Seito and his younger sister, Setsuko, as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II.The story itself, based on a true story, is powerful enough but the decision to animate the film truly elevates this film to a higher level. This would have been a powerful enough live action drama, along the lines of Spielberg's Empire of the Sun or even Schindler's List. However, the Studio Ghibli team, have brought an extraordinary amount of life to all the characters, but especially the young siblings. Now we're not talking realism as such here - the characters are in no way photo-realistic, they do have the usual characteristics of Japanese anime humans, large eyes and exaggerated expressions. What this achieves however is a heightened level of subtle nuances in expression which are arguably more powerful and provocative than anything a real-life actor may achieve. Some may claim this is overly manipulative or sentimental, but coupled with the characters movements and actions, it gives the characters such a strong, and very human, presence. You truly care for these kids, which is an astonishing achievement. The voice cast (original Japanese) contributes significantly here also.It is the tiny moments which give this film so much power and emotional depth - from subtle expressions to brief scenes showing Seito playing with his sister at bath time, attempting, unsuccessfully, to cheer her up when she misses her mother. The painted backgrounds are works of art in themselves, just beautiful. And of course the scenes with the fireflies bring a touch of pure magic - a heightened innocent reality to contrast the horrific realities of the war.The greatest achievement of this film is that, apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes, such as Setsuko's sobbing or illness, it doesn't force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It's completely honest to it's own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly, which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened, you don't need to see anymore. Another of it's strengths is that it really doesn't comment on the politics of the war in any way, just the effects on innocent people.This is an intensely moving film and a masterpiece of animation. If you aren't moved by these characters, you really need to check your pulse. 10/10"
gavin6942,"Dec 17, 2014",8/10,"A tragic film covering a young boy and his little sister's struggle to survive in Japan during World War II.Apparently people, including Roger Ebert, consider this one of the greatest -- or perhaps the greatest -- war film ever made. Now, that is interesting because it is a cartoon. You never expect that, and this might not be something you want to show kids. It is pretty bold, with wounded people, maggots, and anyone can die.Even more interesting is how it takes place from the point of view of a Japanese youth during World War II. He is not nationalistic, he is not anti-American, he is just a kid. And is that not the truth of war? No matter who is right or wrong, millions of kids become the victims."
dbborroughs,"Jul 6, 2004",9/10,"One of the great animated films of all time Grave of Fireflies tells the story of a couple of kids as the try to survive in war time Japan. What happens to them should be seen by anyone thinking of starting a war since it tells very graphically what happens to those often forgotten, the children.Like its companion piece, Barefoot Gen, which tells the story of survivors of atomic bombing and the horrors that were experienced by those unlucky enough not to have been killed out right, this film proves that war is hell for everyone, especially the children.Its very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film (The previously mentioned Barefoot Gen spawned sequels, this has not) but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience, however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war. It helps that however depressing this is, its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.9 out of 10"
TheLittleSongbird,"Apr 3, 2010",10/10,"What an amazing film! Very rarely have I been moved this much by an animated film. Watership Down yes, Bambi yes, Secret of NIMH yes, Beauty and the Beast yes, Land Before Time yes, but Grave of the Fireflies is in a different league. A film that is once seen and never forgotten, a film that is beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating. It is slow moving perhaps and ""depressing"" but it is very poignant as well. I find it very difficult to fight back tears at the film's end. The animation is amazingly detailed, the backgrounds and characters are drawn with such care and you just marvel at the detail that goes into it. The music is both haunting and melancholic and one of the main reasons why the film is as it is. The story is harrowing, as it details Seita and Setsuko's hopelessness. The characters are easy to relate, Setsuko isn't precocious or obnoxious, instead she is quite cute, and Seita shows real love for his sister as well as being a strong protagonist. There are many memorable sequences, but one that springs to mind is the one with the nocturnal fireflies, which is something of true melancholic beauty. Overall, a masterpiece, pure and simple. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
The_Void,"Jan 7, 2005",8/10,"Animation is often seen as a childish medium, and for good reason as kid's films often are animated. However, every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story, and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films. Through it's well observed and very real characters, Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss, heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are. We follow Seita and Setsuko, a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country. How the two go about doing that and the boy's development from a child to a (somewhat) responsible adult due to the change in the surroundings makes up the spine of the movie.I'm not a big fan of animation, but there are some films that are so great that a person's personal preferences are irrelevant, and this is one of those films. The animation is beautiful and certain scenes, including the air raids and anything with the fireflies are amazing works of art. The way the music blends with the images on screen is haunting and beautiful, and helps add to the tragedy of the story. Because we are able to care for the characters, the tragedy is increased ten fold and the story on the whole is a sad one, but few movies have ever matched up to this film's ending in terms of pure despair. The conclusion is absolutely gut wrenching to an extent that few movies have ever matched, let alone animated pictures. The fact that it's so plain and blatant, with no attempt to console the audience takes the tragedy to a whole new level and I don't doubt that many audience members will be holding back tears upon the film's conclusion.This film is a must see."
Seraphion,"Sep 29, 2014",7/10,"The story opens up strongly having the ending shown first, and letting the main character to tell the rest of the story. All around we see people trying to be strong, to be tough in the middle of the harsh environment of war torn civilians. We also see every scope of human nature manifested in this kind of environment, in which people tend to seek their own survival, whatever the means may be. Those can also include how the aunt cheated on the kids about the food and that the aunt's daughter eventually did nothing to help them. What I like from the movie is that there's no depiction of depressed desperation as to leading to suicide. This convey the message to be strong. I watched the Japanese version with English subtitling; the voice acting is very nice. Setsuko's voice are very much the standard cute Japanese little girl, While Seita's voice can really make the character relate to how brothers defend for their kid brother/sister."
abmong,"Oct 1, 2008",10/10,"Now I'm usually your typical Die-Hard, Guns Blazing, Sword Swinging, Magic Wielding Anime fan! So there shouldn't really be any surprises when I say that ""Grave of the Fire Flies"" is not ranked among my list of all time favourites. And the prospect of watching it didn't sound too appealing to me at first, considering the rather subdued DVD case cover...(I know, I'm ashamed)That said, this film is a masterpiece of story telling, the calibre of which my current favourite films pale in comparison. I don't think I've ever been more moved by any other films, period!!! I've vowed never to see this film again, as I think revisiting it would lessen the emotional impact of the first viewing. In any case I don't think I need to re-watch it as it's been burned into my memory forever.This is a film that I hate and love at the same time. The beautiful story and the capturing of facial expressions which only a hand drawn animation could fully realise. On the other hand the film reduced me to sobbing wreck, a bitter sweet ending which left me so depressed it took me another two days to get over...Its a must see, but be sure to have lots of tissue paper on hand. I'm temped to say it's a life changing experience, certainly has been for me. The rest I leave to you to decide."
the amorphousmachine,"Mar 1, 2005",7/10,"(SOME MAJOR SPOILERS) Animation is often a favourable genre as far as I'm concerned regardless of the maturity of the content. 'Grave of the Fireflies' tackles a tough issue, and is pretty much an animated film for adults or older children. As the content deals with the children who are left behind during any-given war, and how they become adjusted to a new way of living.Naturally, being an anime film, it takes the Japanese perspective of World War II, and how the American fire bombings affected the civilians, particularly from the viewpoint of teenage boy, Seita, and his extremely young sister in Setsuko. In the opening scene of the film, it displays the tragic outcome of the lead character, so we immediately know that this isn't going to be a very happy film! The journey of Seita and Setsuko is an interesting one, but also, a frustrating one to watch.I found myself a little annoyed at some of Seita's actions, although it can be related to youthful rebellion and ideals of being able to survive in the wilderness on your own. The conflict between the Aunt towards Seita and Setsuko seemed extremely harsh, and there could have been more depth to the Aunt's intense dislike of her relatives, cause I think it was needed. Although, I did like the play on the Aunt's use of provisions, and her sense of worthiness when allocating them to her immediate family- even though Seita had provided those provisions. It was a subtle way of showing something deeper to the relationship. The Aunt seemed to think they were ungrateful, yet she was equally ungrateful for what they had sacrificed! The scene where the Aunt asks Seita about school is priceless in displaying the undertones of her manner towards him, revealing the nature of her contempt for him- but I still wish there was more exploration as to why she disliked a young boy and his four-year old sister so much. It seemed a little harsh that any person would treat children like that after a horrendous aftermath to their living situation, and especially during wartime survival, and that's why I think there should have been more exploration of that family unit's history. There was a subtle hint at the Uncle's cowardice, but again, his character was hardly in it to be given depth.The other problem I had was Setsuko. She was far too young to be realistically left in the care of her brother, and she seemed to be able to comprehend far too much for someone so young, and as a character, I found her slightly annoying. There was some touching moments between her and Seita though, especially when she follows him to the police station, as well as when he's trying to shield her from the horrors of war. 'Grave of the Fireflies' really gets over the desperation of trying to cope with hunger, shelter in the aftermath of war- but it just lost me with the lack of humanity of Seita's closest relatives, and with the irresponsibility of his later actions. Even during the first bombing, I seriously doubt any mother would leave her youngest daughter out of her own sight. So, while some people may say this film is the essential war film, or more precisely, ""anti-war"" film- I personally think that is tad overstating its importance. A good animated film that is anti-war- and shows the aftermath of it in a realistic manner-- then perhaps that is fair! However, it's not the essential anti-war/war film, and if you can cope with the characters, then this film is pretty rewarding and somewhat haunting! It is, however, a tad overrated in my book! A reasonably good animated film for adults showing the repercussions and the aftermath of war! ***½ out of *****!"
Leofwine_draca,"Feb 10, 2011",10/10,"It's better not to learn too much about this film before watching it, for fear of spoiling it. I'd heard it described as the saddest film of all time, but even that didn't prepare me for what I saw.Speaking from the point of view of somebody who avoids animation as much as possible, I found this to be a piece of exceptional film-making. Use as many superlatives as you like: amazing, engrossing, compelling, outstanding, it all boils down to one important thing - this film tells a story that grips us with its exploration of the human condition. I imagine virtually everybody who watches it will be able to identify with it in some way or other.So forget this one's a cartoon and just go into it expecting a tale packed with emotion and feeling. And if you have to go back and watch the beginning again after you've seen it all the way through, that's fine too."
Hitchcoc,"Feb 9, 2021",10/10,"This is a film about the sad reality of war. When war is waged, we often think of it as this army against that army. Lost in the mix are the civilians who die horrible deaths--not just from the weapons of war but from disease and starvation. We give great power to the power structure that makes the decision to wage conflict. Often their words sound good and we embrace those words. This film shows what happens to a small, seemingly insignificant pair of children, trying to get a roof over their heads and have a bit to eat. Their mother has been killed in a fire bombing and their father is in the Japanese navy. It shows the efforts to maintain dignity and the cruelty of those who could help but don't. Japan paid a huge price for trying to expand the Empire. The leadership convinced the populace that they were driven by a higher power that wanted them to crush their enemies at whatever cost. But here we see the price. Fire bombings, air raids, and, of course, eventually Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is the saddest of stories, shown in spotless animation. It is a story of hope and hopelessness. Outstanding."
johnpap1982,"May 18, 2018",10/10,"""English is not my native language so apologies for any mistakes""As the title say, this is the saddest movie I have ever seen. I was crying for days after I watch this, by just seeing a picture of setsuko on my phone. This movie was a life changer for me, it made me see things much different in the world...The movie is a masterpiece. The characters, Seita and Setsuko are so well made that at the end you feel like are your own children! This movie should be taught as a lesson to schools, to create an anti-war character to children.I read many reviews and youtube videos and all people feel the same... they all cried a lot. Our cries are for the millions of Seita and setsuko in the world :(. Lets all do what we can, so there will be less and less children suffering from stupid wars!"
Quinoa1984,"Apr 12, 2008",10/10,"In 1988 Grave of the Fireflies was placed on a double-bill alongside My Neighbor Totoro. Two of the most endearing films ever created- animated of otherwise- were paired alongside one another, more than likely to balance each other out; after being submersed in a pure tale of innocence and delight like Miyazaki's great film, there could be accepted such a bleak, heartbreaking story of survival. And both films, incidentally, were based on true experiences, and while Miyazaki's story wasn't without some sadness in real life (his mother was really sick with TB in the hospital), Akiyuki Nosaka's story is one drenched in the worst horrors imaginable for a child. It's basically about two siblings, an older brother and younger sister, who are left practically orphans in a Japan completely devastated by the constant barrage of bombs falling all around, and with very little hope in sight. This lays the groundwork for their relationship, a bond very fragile and incredibly endearing.Not since Rossellini and De Sica had a filmmaker, in this case Isao Takahata, touched a nerve so deeply etched out in deconstructing the horrors of wartime. By leaving us with these two characters, who piece by piece are stripped of their innocence in just the simple task of fending for themselves in a shelter (they at first stay with an aunt who considers them freeloaders) and scrounging for food any way possible, we're left with nothing else but their struggle, essentially. The backdrop itself almost becomes abstract, something so huge that we don't even know that it's Americans dropping the bombs, as it's already too much to grasp that a child's parent is no longer with them. Like Elie Wiesel's book Night, the backdrop and horror is used to pit these people in an untenable situation, and it can only end, honestly, without compromise.So, indeed, Grave of the Fireflies is bleak as hell, but compelling because it doesn't stray from its path with these characters, and that in many scenes we're connected to them without the overbearing heart-tugs of a common Disney feature (though, ironically, as Ebert points out on an interview with the DVD, the big eyes in most anime is based upon those in early Disney films). The animation is exceptionally refined without being excessive in violence; images are visceral for just what is briefly revealed, without the extraneous shots that one might see in a work not meant in a G-rated film (i.e. when Seita sees her mother, dead and wrapped in bandages with the maggots and bugs crawling all over), and at the same time there's a sense of wonderment as the two children watch the fireflies in the shelter. The voice-work, too, doesn't strain credulity- these sound like, if it were a regular live-action feature, the kids who would play these parts (and, speaking of neo-realism, the two credited for Seita and Setsuko never worked before or again).Most often, the film is heart-rending because of how things build with the situation. It's tragic enough to see the loss of the mother on the son, but then to hide it from the little girl becomes a greater challenge. Each time a layer of emotional defense is peeled back, it becomes harder not to connect strongly with these characters, such as when Seiko casually says she knows her mother is dead as she buries the fireflies and Seita finally cries out for the first time, or when Seita is left broken and humiliated after being beat up by the farmer for stealing food for sick Setsuko. And, finally, there's the last ten or so minutes, which I won't mention here. Suffice to say it's one of those times in movies where the opening of the film- Seiko dying homeless and famished- is explained to a perfect degree by film's end. It's a harrowing experience, and one of the very best animated films."
tomc-15,"Jan 1, 2003",N/A,"I cried watching this film, something I haven't done in years.  It's been two days since I saw it and I still can't get it out of my head.  My wife and I have talked much more about this film than most others and I have spent some time researching the film online.  Never has a film hit me on such a personal level.  I am the father of two small children and after seeing this film I went into their rooms while they slept and kissed them and whispered that I love them.Having done some research on the author and the truth behind the story I realize it has lots of symbolism and literary and cultural references which I as a Westerner cannot understand, so I'll keep my comments on the personal level.  The film gets its message across that in war, it is the most vulnerable of society who suffer the most. It troubled me because as an American I don't see the daily struggle for existence in regions torn by war and hunger(Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Balkans, and possibly Iraq to name a few of many conflicts).  It also troubled me that my country really doesn't care either.  As a father of a 5 year old son and a 2 year old daughter, I want the suffering of Seita and Setsuko to stop and someone to acknowledge and help their emotional pain as well as their hunger.  As a parent, I dread the thought of my children being without anyone or being in their situation. As a kid I read lots of WWII books and knew that we had firebombed several Japanese cities and that Navy fighters were strafing small towns.  This film made all that history seem very real and present. As an evangelical Christian, it also reinforces for me how cruel and how kind people can be and how lost we truly are.I read Roger Ebert's review of this film and I agree with him that it is one of the best I have ever seen, because it troubled me deeply on a personal and external level.  I can't look at my daughter now and not think of Setsuko and her beauty, sadness, and innocence.  See it, but don't see it alone.  Remember it's not for children since it's more than a cartoon."
Ado_123,"Mar 9, 2025",7/10,"This movie is pretty sad. It is an excerpt from the new everyday life of two young people in Japan at the end of the Second World War. The movie does not try to be surprising, not to postulate anything, but simply to show a slice of reality from that time. The aesthetics of the film are outstanding. The movie is soberingly honest which is a very refreshing change from the whole modern ideologically infiltrated movie culture. The length of the movie is also pleasant, not too long, but long enough to say what is to be said. Due to my uncertainty about the rating of this movie, I will make a specification here: 6.7 rounded up to 7."
vicky-bahl,"Dec 27, 2008",10/10,"I am crying right now while writing this comment. It's my birthday, and I wanted to seen a movie that was a definite masterpiece, and I found this one. Never wanted to cry on my birthday, but couldn't help it.A tale of a brother and his kid sister in WW2 Japan, which actually tells you the suffering of a common man had a family, a life, a smile and a future, but lost everything for no fault of his own. It's so touching that you cannot help breaking down to tears. I won't reveal the plot here, but I'll suggest you watch the Japanese version with English subs. This is surely the one which will move you to the core, it felt like I lost something too, when the movie ended, and 'she never woke up'.Great stuff - 10/10 (or even 11/10 - as an anime moved me more than a human film)"
emasterslake,"Aug 28, 2005",7/10,"This is Isao Takahata's very first movie for Studio Ghibli.It was shown along with My Neighbor Totoro back in 1988.What unique about this anime movie is it's more like seeing a live action film than an animated film.It shows how much the Japanese suffered during the WW2 period.Those who think anime is just for kids will be proved wrong with this one. It's just as good as an Accademy Award movie.This movie is tempting in a way. Reason why is that it has allot of deaths, sad moments, and bombings in Kobe.Please know this is not something for little kids to see. I recommend 13 and older. Idon't see a little kid watching this movie. It has allot of people that die from the bombings and a few moments of blood.I recommend this movie to those who like powerful/serious animation."
Java_Joe,"Mar 24, 2025",5/10,"This movie is not without problems. My biggest gripe is how they seemingly went out of their way to make a sad movie. Not a good movie that was sad but just a sad movie. And they succeeded in that. Most people I know that have watched it have cried. It's a hard sit. You feel for these characters so it makes sense you'd be overcome with emotion and shed a few tears. But that's exactly the problem. It's not a good movie that is sad. It's just a sad movie trying to be good.The acting, the animation, the visuals, the scenes and all that? Not a problem. It's Miyazaki after all. There's no doubt that the man has passion for his work and it shows. But I felt the story suffered a bit in what he was trying to show.I don't regret seeing it. But it's one of those movies that leaves such a lasting impression that it has almost no rewatchability.And just remember this is manufactured pathos."

lost-in-limbo,"Aug 8, 2007",10/10,"Just marvellous! This hearty masterpiece of Japanese animation is incredibly moving, sincere, haunting and captivating in detailing the special bond between brother and sister caught up in the horrifying and unforgiving face of war. It guides us on one really tragic, but rewarding trip where it truly has an impact. Never does it get overwrought or push itself onto the viewer, but still it manages to leave a lump in your throat and have you emotionally drained when the credits begin to roll. This one is not afraid to stay gloomy, and because you know the outcome at the beginning, this makes the significance of the story's journey more potentate in its increasing pain and devastation. By that alone, the wonderfully textured plot doesn't take the easy way out and the reality of the situation is never lost because it's animated.Staying simple and focused, kept it rather flawless in its in-depth story telling of emotional pride and lasting effects. Slow it might be, but there's too much subtle richness within its characters, premise and visuals to really bother about the loose pacing and lack of action. Isao Takahata adapts the novel of Akiyuki Nosaka, and gets us deeply involved with the civilians, and the mere war stays in the background. A contrast between two different worlds, one being the war itself and secondly the one the two children find themselves in to forget it. Namely those scenes where they're experiencing the beauty and freeness of nature (at if they might never get that chance again) and those sequences with the fireflies admirably paint the feelings of what's to come. The budding relationship between Seita and Setsuko is tremendously done, innocent and full of colour. Even capturing the Japanese citizens and families in this cold plight is believability achieved, as it throws questions, issues and metaphorical messages. These people (including our two central characters) are doing it hard, but their wills won't collapse after what they've been through, but things do take their toll when everything you ever care for can suddenly vanish and the heartache turns to utter numbness. Because what kept you living, is no longer there to hold you.Breathing heavily on the mood is the soft, lovely musical score that certainly weeps with its melodic tone. The vivid animation is gorgeously crisp and enchanting, and the background scenery is profoundly vivid and convincing. Many beautiful, striking illustrations are framed with a sincere touch, where darkness treads neatly together with the lighter moments. What a delightfully effective and soulful meditation piece of sublime art by director/writer Isao Takahata. This one has plenty to say on the topic at hand, and it gets even more relevant everyday.Magnificently heart-wrenching and sensitive war-time story on the people who find themselves dealing with the unbearable consequences of war."
itzvinay,"Nov 7, 2010",10/10,"This is my first review for any movie and the feeling is paradoxical...on one hand I feel impelled to write this review and on the other I also feel that my review will be inconsequential considering the greatness of the work..To start, this is not merely another movie...it's much more than what we know as Cinema. It shows you the mirror...not just any ordinary mirror..one in which you see your soul. This work truly penetrates the material being and reaches your soul where the epiphany of being a human occurs. Being a human means the one who feels, the one who has emotions...In today's stressful life we often feel that we are emotionally invulnerable..In fact to succeed in your life today..you need to forget that you feel and act like a machine. This movie wakes you up. I can say that because there is no one person who would not cry watching it. It's not a shame. It's not a weakness. It makes even adults cry because it hits your soul of whose existence even you might be unaware of before.To consider it a movie will be doing injustice to the effect it generates. It's a soul-stirring work which we usually tend to associate with archaic literature. As a piece of Art, it is one of the best tragedies ever written...not only on the silver screen but in the entire human history. If you think I am exaggerating, you have to see this movie and it will have the same effect on you as Romeo-Juliet or Hamlet or Macbeth will have or maybe more since it's presented through the modern and hence, more understandable modes of communication.In my opinion the top rated movies and so the greatest movies are about gangsters, murders, bad guys. No disrespect to them, I am a movie buff and those are my favorites (The shawshank redemption#1, godfathers#2,3,and others like pulp fiction, goodfellas,the good,bad, ugly), but honestly, ask yourself..how many gangsters you know...or superheroes for that matter. Those are great works but they are fiction in the truest sense. you cannot relate to them. Those are fantasies. While 'Grave of the Fireflies' lets you relate yourself to the protagonist through the HUMAN connection.I have seen most of the top rated movies and without being a braggart,can safely claim to have developed a taste and an eye for great works and to me this is the greatest work of cinema. Astonishingly simple but powerful like an A-bomb(ironically) which devastates all your beliefs and ideals about War, Human Relations and Life in general."
gmiranda5247,"May 12, 2015",N/A,"Grave of the Fireflies is a underrated, grossly misinterpreted Ghibli masterpiece of a film that you never wanted to see again.not going to make review about it as there are hundreds of reviews already Just to make some points: Grossly Underrated - The fact that it is not even considered as a mainstream Ghibli title when it deserve to be placed as one of the greatest animated films (or just films) of all times shows that it is grossly underrated.Grossly misinterpreted - many critics and reviewers interpret the film as an anti-war movie. Cant be further from the truth. Graves of the Fireflies is about the story of a siblings and their hardships in life, thats it plain and simple. The story is the authors confession of guilt and desire for atonement after her young sister died in his care in real life. It just so happen that the setting is WW2.In reality it can be applied to any situation where human hardship, particularly children hardship, are involved.Right now there are millions of young desperate Seitas and little innocent hungry Setsukos all around the world that are abandoned, dying from malnutrition and hunger, being unable to afford medical care, being sold into slavery, physically and sexually abused... and yet people like us (who were torn by the feeling of not being able to help Setsuko and Seita character in the film) are not making any effort to help these millions of real life Setsukos and Seitas out there.. is what i believe the true tragedy of this film."
enas_nikos,"Mar 4, 2017",6/10,"Before watching the movie, and after reading all the reviews, I had built very high expectations. A very moving and intense movie. I was almost opened up a position for it, among my best ever movies.I don't know if it was the high expectations, or just the movie, but I rate it as average. Slow rhythm, average plot. But most of all, got the feeling that the movie ""pushed"" it a lot to be ""moving"" and ""touching"". With several ""tearful"" cliché. Didn't make it for me.It has some good moments and I liked the way that the main character ""presents"" the story.It is not a bad movie but definitely not one of the best I have watched."
stanescu_g_david,"Mar 28, 2015",10/10,"I'll start out by saying that I've seen over one thousand movies and only a few of them brought me close to tears, but I've never cried before. This is the first movie that made me cry and I've cried during the movie and I've cried well after the movie was over. I finally stopped crying and decided to write this review (my first movie review) and typing these words thinking about the movie brought tears into my eyes again. I'm a pretty tough guy and I rarely get emotional, but boy did this movie hit me hard.I think everybody should see this movie, even though it's such a heart wrenching emotional experience. It will definitely touch you and you'll have a different outlook on life after seeing this movie."
SnoopyStyle,"May 9, 2014",8/10,"This animated movie starts with young boy Seita dying on the floor of a train station after Japan surrenders in WWII. His spirit leads the audience to his story with his little sister Setsuko. During an air raid on their home town, they lose their mother. Their father is away with the Navy. The siblings go to live with their unsympathetic aunt. Seita clash with her, and the siblings go live by themselves in the bomb shelter next to the waters. It doesn't go well as their lives deteriorate to the point where Seita dies alone on the floor.It is the saddest of tragedy. The animation is the perfect foil to the subject matter. The animation style is children's story but the movie is all too realistic. The characters are not cartoons. It is ripped from the pages of history. The children animation style draws the audience in, and it hits the viewer in the heart."
yayasan40,"Dec 29, 2015",10/10,"I was a geeky teenager in the 90's who loved anime. The thing I liked about anime was that even though I was getting too old to watch cartoons, I could make the claim that in Japan cartoons were made for grown-ups and justify my love for them.I would go to Tower Records and rent every single anime as they came out and then copy them with two VCR's (90's version of torrenting) and this was released by Central Park Media (one of the three American companies releasing anime back then) so like all the others I rented and copied it. But oh my God this blew all the other stuff I was watching out of the water. IT made me cry, it made me feel. I HAD to show my parents this film to justify my love of anime.And I did, and my parents who really don't like cartoons both cried. Bawled. My dad says he still remembers it and that it haunted him.Anyways, fast forward to the present day, I am now an adult approaching my 40's, i have a family of my own, I've outgrown anime (let's be honest the majority of it is garbage) but my dad reminded me about this film, so I decided to watch it again all these years later to see if it would still hold up.I cried even more. Once you become a parent, as many other reviewers have said here, you put your loved ones faces on the animated characters and it makes it even more powerful. I don't know if this could have been even more powerful or more heart-wrenching if it was live action. You can watch it and because it's animated you can project onto the animated characters and setting even easier than if it was live-action. You can see war torn Kobe as your hometown, you can see it as Iraq, you can see it as Afghanistan, it makes the film all the more powerful.Being a dad now I watch a lot of cartoons, and all the Disney ones, and Pixar etc with my own little Setsuko...this film blows them all out of the water. This is indeed, the greatest animated film of all time if for nothing else than the fact that it is able to transcend the genre and shows the full unfiltered power of what the media is capable of showing.If you are a parent, or have little ones in your life this film will hit you harder, but even as a teenager it hit me hard. I think it shaped my views on war, and had a very profound affect on me. I don't understand the people who say they wouldn't watch this again because there is something strangely cathartic and beautiful about being able to bawl your eyes out. I guess people are afraid of their own vulnerability but I have to say, I enjoyed getting back in touch with that empathetic part of myself. It's strangely relaxing. Highly recommended."
siderite,"Jun 11, 2005",9/10,"This is a war time story and, while it has a slow pace, it couldn't have been told any other way. It's like a knife being slowly inserted and twisted in the wound.Everything begins with a ""La Vitta e Bella"" atmosphere: mother dead, father at war, brother and little sister going to a distant relative, brother sheltering the sister from the realities of war as much as possible. But the end of the film (which again, doesn't come abruptly, but gradually) is nothing like happy.This has no action scenes, no fight or physical violence scenes, no sci-fi and no fiction. It's an anime harsh reality that makes you cry your eyes off at the end of the movie. The movie is great, it's a must see for anime lovers or anybody else.I recommend to see again the start of the film after you have seen the whole movie.-- update 2023, seeing it againI watched it in the cinema this time, as part of a Japanese festival. People were sobbing at the end of the film. I liked how the story unfolded without a particular judgement. Yeah, war is hell, but even the most disgusting people in the film can be sympathized with, while the best can be criticized. Anyway, prepare your paper tissues for the end of this film. Great film!"
Matadora,"Sep 17, 1998",N/A,"I made the mistake of sitting down to watch this movie thinking it would be your basic anime flick, replete with scantily-clad women with hypertrophied hooters.  Shows you what I knew. I spent the rest of the evening weeping about the cruelties of war, and all the innocent people who get winnowed out in the aftermath.  My American education tells me we had God on our side, and whatever we did to the Japanese mainland was justified in the name of sovereignty.  I'm not a politician or a general...I don't know.  But the story of Setsuko and Seiji (sp?) caused me such grief inside.  What is right, anymore?  Is this right?"
lee_eisenberg,"Jan 10, 2013",10/10,"Hiroshima may have been the most famous bombing of Japan, but the air raids were often just as destructive. One such firebombing is the setting of Isao Takahata's ""Hotaru no Haka"" (""Grave of the Fireflies"" in English). It looks at both the struggle for survival and loss of innocence that accompany war. I've never seen any other anime, but is one movie that should truly be required viewing for everyone. Not only in looking at how the brother and sister try to maintain their hope amid hardship, but two lines in particular stood out. One is where someone mentions that the war is eating up Japan's resources, making it harder and harder to feed the people. Another is when the brother learns that Japan has surrendered. Long taught that the Japanese Empire was invincible, he now has to realize the unpleasant truth. These are important reminders for everyone. The fact remains that the common people will suffer the most in any war, and the movie makes that very clear.Like I said, a movie that everyone should see."
matthewssilverhammer,"May 7, 2018",10/10,"Seriously. I just...I can't even with you. Oh sure, you're absolutely perfect in every possible way, but still...I can't.

insaneoff,"Feb 21, 2019",10/10,"I have always been afraid of war. See all the people that I love being murdered for no reason, just political. When war, violence and blood flood the lives of children, they have to become adults faster and take care of their loved ones. This is what our protagonist Seita, takes with himself to the grave. The film treats you as a spectator of a reality, not as a simple film. The reality of war in the eyes of the children. The reality of the people who suffer it and give their last breath to survive. This film by itself is a masterpiece, but its ending ... well just remember everything I cried with this and the words I wrote here are useless. This is one of those films that changes the perspective of things in your life and makes you remember that maybe, this world would be better without the violent human beings that we are."
Neon_Gold,"Mar 28, 2021",8/10,I think the saddest thing about this movie is it's roots in realism and childlike fantasy.It deals with such awful things but though the lens of two young children just trying to survive.It shows the damage done to the innocents in wars. That for as hard as it is for the people fighting it there is a struggle at home for the people left behind to deal with. I appreciate this aspect of a war being shown.The characters are wonderful and you will warm to them instantly.It's a sad watch but a great one.
gulfcoastsurfer,"Mar 26, 2009",7/10,"I honestly don't know how I feel about this movie. It wasn't at all like I expected; very, quiet, subdued. A lot seemed unoriginal, flat, just played out for dramatic effect. I didn't like the unrealistic animation; at times it seemed to be out of sync with real movement.But then there are moments that completely contradict everything I've just said. The quiet combined with the very unchanging surroundings at times produced some amazingly subtle and beautiful imagery like at the beach scene or the strafing fighter. The first bombing is so much more effectively surprising and horrific because of the empty, quiet streets; when Seita is confused by the napalm sticks, so are we.Perhaps the most confusing thing about this film is the emotions it raises. I did not cry and yet after finishing it I felt empty and cold. I felt like this film is like watching a slow death and it's horrible. It ends on a whimper and a whisper and it is truly tragic, despite what I said above :)"
mokono,"Aug 24, 2016",4/10,"It's not an unpleasant experience overall: a simple story, cute kids, good scenes - just trying to be too dramatic without actually much content.If you've been watching any recent movies, you can see the art of making you feel has been improving considerably: good timing of dramatic music, paused dialogue and close-ups, etc. Even if you were not particularly caring for the characters, suddenly you find yourself feeling ""this is serious"" and maybe even your eyes water up - only to ask yourself why a few minutes later.Grave of the fireflies takes the basic formula: sad setting (war) + likable characters (cute children) and lets it unfold, adding cardboard characters as needed (cold portrayal of Japanese society, impolite or uncaring neighbors for no reason, etc).There is a senseless ""flashback"" from the main characters watching themselves which adds nothing. Character development is a bit limited, as you see the survival strategies ramp up a bit, but no real effect or reason on why that is. In fact, the conclusion arrives for lack of awareness, not lack of resources. Which contradicts the negativity of the war setting..Anyway, not too unpleasant, except for the ""intellectual dishonesty"" of shoving drama down the throats of the viewer."
cruzwindt-46534,"Oct 16, 2018",10/10,"God .... the movie is great but damn why did I watch this ? Its way too sad for me.
It's a great piece of art but , be warned, bring tissues if you are going to watch it, cuz there is a 99% of probability that you'll cry, and a lot."
david-provins,"Mar 24, 2007",10/10,"I was not so much surprised as I was elated at having an Anime movie move me so much. The attention to detail was exceptional.The expressions and readability of the characters' faces was impressive. This is a movie that helps you find truth and life.It is not a religious movie directly; however, there is great spiritual stirring in it.I was not moved to tears, rather, more like people experiencing this type of horrifying event, I was stunned.I cried later.This is one of the best of hundreds of movies I have seen in my 42 years. I will never forget it."
vandy1888,"Apr 9, 2003",N/A,"Tears swell up in my eyes just thinking about this movie. To simply give it a rating or praise would not do it justice. Keeping that in mind, this is still the best movie I have ever seen. It has changed my life. After watching this movie, I keep asking myself why do we kill each other? What drives this putrid hatred in us that pushes us to war? Can't we see that no one wins in war...no one wins anything. We only lose loved ones and cause unbearable pain and suffering on each other and for what? Our country? This mass of inanimate land? Or perhaps some perverse idea of honor and pride? What honor is there in killing Seita and Setsuko?I can't say anymore about this movie... You simply must watch it to feel its awesome power."
roquedog504,"Nov 26, 2005",10/10,"I had heard of this film, yet not until recently had I actually seen it. Boy......I love it without question now, but I can't see a moment in my future where I won't regret seeing it. I won't deny it brought me to tears. The movie, right from the beginning to the very end, wrenched my heart again and again. It describes the struggles of a young boy caring for his much younger sister. In the throes of a world war, the difficulties increase exponentially. It is just a very tragic film, and I know I will never forget it. I suggest it to all; it is certainly not a bubble-gum and sunshine anime, however. This movie will crush your heart."
mwalzak,"Jan 21, 2003",10/10,"In my opinion, Grave of the Fireflies is the best film ever made, animated or otherwise. I have never been so affected by a movie for so long afterwards, and I have watched a lot of movies. It stuns you with its truth. I purchased this movie not knowing anything about it 2 days ago, and sat down to watch it with my 20 year old daughter. I expected good things, but this was something else. The story line has been well documented on this site, so I won't dive into that. Needless to say, it will affect you for days after watching it, no kidding. We are both still sniffling. It's the attention to the subtle detail that makes you identify with the charecters. Everyone knows a toddler like Setsuko, and the quiet strength of Seito. There is a scene where Seito and Setsuko are watching the stars at night (after going to the toilet, no less) and he tells his younger sister about the days before the war. When he looks over, she is asleep. He goes to put his arm around her to cuddle up. I thought the would have panned out on that scene and left it at that for emotional impact. But no, what does the little girl do but throw his arms off her (much like my own toddler would do). The whole movie is like that. The ultimate message about the real casulties of war, the innocents, who suffer and endure events not of their own making, is heartbraking. Buy/rent this movie and be haunted forever. It will change the way you look at things and you will be a better person for it."
SquigglyCrunch,"Sep 26, 2016",7/10,"Grave of the Fireflies follows a boy and his little sister as they try to live on their own after losing their family to the war.The story itself is interesting and well presented, and there's lot's of twists and turns throughout that only increase this aspect.There's not a whole lot to say about what's good. It's an interesting story and I think it deserves the rating I gave it, but as far as specific things it lacks in those.Maybe this was because I watched it dubbed, but the voice actors really bothered me. Not because they didn't suit the characters, but they just read their lines with little to no expression. The city is being bombed, for crying out loud! Sound a bit more worried voice actors, come on.Some aspects of this movie were a little confusing, specifically the air raid/bombing scenes. There were multiple points in the story where characters would go to a bomb shelter, then come out and live life normally. So, did they get bombed? Did they not? I don't understand. I eventually kind of figured it out, but regardless it was pretty unclear for a non-history junkie like myself.Everyone says that this movie is super sad and all that, but I didn't think that at all. The ending is super predictable, and I kept wondering if maybe there'd be some crazy twist that proved why the movie was so sad, but nope. It ends exactly how you think it will. Sure, the events leading up are unfortunate, but I was never legitimately sad about any aspect of this movie, save for the lack of ability from the voice actors.Overall Grave of the Fireflies is pretty good, but that's it. The voice acting is subpar, some aspects are a little unclear, and the ending is very predictable. Next time I'll definitely watch the subbed version. In the end I'd still recommend it, just go for subbed. It can't be any worse than the dub."
specismaster,"Sep 6, 2010",10/10,"I ordered this movie from Amazon expecting a shameless exploitation of the destruction and death wrought upon a defeated Japan near the end of World War II. What I did not expect, but indeed found, was a shockingly personal story with some grounding in real events, one that focused much less on the wider war being fought (and not at all on the politics behind the war, thankfully) than on the battle of a teenage boy to simply keep his young sister and himself alive.Consider this the antidote to the typical American war film, particularly those set in the Pacific theater of World War II. This story is one that lays bare the real consequences of war in the modern age. Nobody is spared, not even the youngest children. The film's heavily sobering nature is, however, intermingled with scenes of a happy brother and sister, striving to live their lives together in the face of the worst possible occurrences. This is likely what makes the film all that more difficult to watch; it is beautifully portrayed through its backgrounds, simple musical score and detailed animation, which are alone enough to set this apart from the average anime feature.I might have been flirting with pacifism before I watched this film, but it certainly pushed me over the cliff; one knows before seeing it that most of the casualties of war are the truly innocent, the civilians in their own homes, but such a fact is much easier to ignore when it's not visible in such a concrete portrayal.To put it simply, Grave of the Fireflies ought to be shown to every American social studies student, as it strips the glory of war away to reveal the true suffering it brings, not through a callous and gory festival of horrors, but through the love of two siblings for each other in the face of their earthly demise. I can barely make it through this film without crying, any time I watch it. Politics and national enmities have no place here, just pure love."
romanhans,"Oct 1, 2006",7/10,"This is a nice film. Interesting, good characters, at times beautiful. Sad, then, that's there's absolutely no reason to watch it.Don't know that war is bad? That it affects innocent children? That some people are horrible? Want to spend some time crying, and spend the rest of the evening depressed and/or haunted? Then this is the film for you.For the rest of us, applaud the film and the obvious effort that's been put into it, and stay away.I'm glad this work exists, as a document of a historical time. And occasionally I'll look back and remember some of its beauty. But I almost wish I hadn't seen it -- my life needs energy and beauty rather than depression -- and it's the only Miyazaki film I wouldn't recommend."
stylgeo,"Jan 4, 2009",10/10,"First of all I'd like to explain why I gave this film a 10. I don't rate in comparison to other films because I take each film on its own, and I couldn't fault this film one bit. I was thinking of rating it a 9 just because it was a bit short in length but then again I thought that it was that good that I wanted more. The animation is amazing. You forget that it's just drawings one after another, and then you see something so breathtaking and you realise why the creators decided to make this an anime. To be honest I was expecting nothing less from studio Ghibli. The story is haunting in its simplicity. They are right to say its one of the best anti-war movies of all time. The creators don't even try to present the then Japanese empire as something magnificent, on the contrary. They give us the raw nature of the human kind and most of all the unspoilt love that can only be found between siblings. I watched the subtitled version of the film. It's truly worth it. The laughter of the small girl still haunts me and I'd love to watch this film again and again"
RohitRajkumar,"Aug 19, 2009",10/10,Some movies are always made to make you shed a tear or two but BEWARE this might just bring about a tsunami in your house.It is a Japanese movie made in 1988 so I caught the English dubbed version.There is an anti-war social message and can be easily compared to great war films like 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.The dubbing artists have lent their voices perfectly to the lead pairs in the English dubbed version and retain the same emotions as in the Japanese version.It is definitely going to emotionally stir you and undoubtedly can be called as one of the greatest movies ever made.It's a crime to miss this outstanding piece of cinema.
riceowensmoss,"Nov 28, 2007",10/10,"i just finished the movie and if not for my 2 dogs I would have to drive to someones house at 2am because I could not be alone right now. I dare not give anything away but I will say that the movie really got to me. I consider myself very educated and informed about the most troubling issues facing the planet I live on, but this movie really shook me up. I had to hold back tears with all my might because I was scared to let go, I was afraid because the movie, a cartoon, became so real I forgot I was watching a movie, I was completely lost in the story and it was scary. A cartoon should not be able to do that. Please watch the movie and remember it is a true story."
hikkifan1986,"Nov 27, 2006",10/10,"One only has to look at the rest of these comments to see that this movie really affected people. It affected me as well. I've never cried so much during and after a movie so much in my life.Roger Ebert and another famous critic (I forget his name) compared this movie to Schindler's List. That's an apt comparison. This movie is so human. So very human. It will make you want to hug all of your loved ones just to make sure they are safe and happy.That this movie is animated doesn't hurt it a bit. In fact, it makes it better. Instead of connecting the characters that are so well-developed in the movie with an actor, you only connect them with the idea of a person you've created in your head. It's like reading a book. Without explicit visual cues to go by, one has to create the images in one's head. It makes the characters that much more powerful and moving because instead of being on a screen, they are in your head. That said, I could not get them out of my head for days. Especially the little girl. I love her!"
Bored_Dragon,"Apr 5, 2018",6/10,"Beautiful, but very sad story about consequences that war has on common people. I like the idea and essence of the story touched me deeply, but realization of the movie left me quite indifferent. When it comes to sad movies, I'm unbelievable cry-baby, but this one just made me yawn. It's not that boring that I had to force myself to finish it, but if something interrupted me in watching it, I would probably never get back to it to see it through. Excellent story, but overall impression of the movie is barely6/10"
San-Wan,"Oct 31, 2020",7/10,"This movie is a haunting emotional masterpiece that you probably never want to watch again. It truly showcases the horrors of war and the impact it has on the lives of people, especially children. The ending was absolutely heart-wrenching. This is a movie that will make you want to help people who are going through the difficulties of war. After you have seen this movie, take some time out and make a donation to a charity who is providing aid work in war torn countries or helping refugees. Also give thanks and blessings for having a roof over your head and enough food to eat."
kiwikwi,"Jan 4, 2006",5/10,"So, there's this boy and his little sister, and they go through a lot of suffering during World War II, after their mother dies during a bombardment. However, that's not really the reason for their suffering.They have no place to stay, because they don't want to stay with their evil aunt. But that's not the reason either.They suffer because they're starving. Ah, they have no money for food, and that's why they're suffering! Well, actually... Let me try again.It's tough to lose a family member, during war or anytime else. You could have made a perfectly good film around that alone. Then there's the aunt. How is she evil? Oh, she's angry that the boy hangs around home all day, doing nothing. She also sells the clothes of the boy's late mother (her own sister, I take it) for food, and only gives half to the boy. That makes her evil. (Who wrote this script, an angry teenager?)And then they've got no food.Let's face it, there's really no good reason for them to go through so much suffering, except to make the audience sad.Making innocent characters suffer is a sure way to engage the audience -- however, it's a cheap trick, and a shallow substitute for proper characterisation. The only character we get to know is the protagonist, and by the end of the film, he still seems like a bit of a cipher. Okay, so he loves his sister a lot, briefly mourned the death of his mother, and kinda looks up to his father... but mostly, he just loves his sister. Oh, yeah, and he's going to die (we learn this from the beginning). The next hour and a half is his slowly drawn out death sequence.All other characters are ciphers, easily summed up in a word or two: The sister? (Sickeningly) cute. The aunt? Evil. Farmer? Wise. Their late mother? Nothing less than perfect.The film sucker-punches the audience to cover for its outrageous characters and aimless plot, with the sole intention of making the audience sad. I guess it worked."
theotsiavos,"Aug 10, 2018",10/10,War brings only ruin and misery both for the heroes and the villains.Its easily overlooked in western media how Japam was devastated during the final days of the war.A whole country became the sacrificial lamb the Usa needed to showcase their dominance through the globe.And children are always the first victims
Det_McNulty,"Oct 24, 2006",10/10,"There is no denying that Studio Ghibli is the finest animation company ever and have made some of the most stunning pieces of cinema ever. The fact that they never fail to craft some of the most beautiful and compelling masterpieces proves the brilliance. Ghibli animators make films that are intelligent, fulfilling, complex and burst with joy. The animation is one that can appeal to people of all walks of life and perfectly sums up what cinema is all about. I've never once been disappointed by a Studio Ghibli work.Grave Of The Fireflies is certainly far from easy viewing and is one of the most harrowing war films ever made. When released in America Grave Of The Fireflies caused controversy because some people felt it was anti-American and the fact is that it's not. The film doesn't take sides to anyone and understands that everybody did awful and horrific things during WW2. One thing that is obvious when watching the film is the fact it's anti-war and shows how the innocent are the people who become the most effected.It's not easy to make films about subjects like this one because they become very emotional and hard to make realistic. Yet Grave Of The Fireflies succeeds in every way other war films don't. The story is a magnificent tale of love and friendship between an older brother and his young sister. The loss of innocence and the real-life brutality that these children see are something that nobody would ever want or be prepared for.The cinematography is beautiful and every frame of animation holds so much substance and inner beauty. There are very few films that manage to play with my emotions as easily as Grave Of The Fireflies because it remains a haunting study of a brother and sister's friendship. I found it hard not to cry and I'll be honest I did cry towards the end of the film. The fact that you fall in love with the characters and become attached to their personality, surroundings and situations is why it remains so provocative. The film's style is excellent and helps set a perfect mood. I love the use of operatic music at the end of the film as it was profoundly effecting.A genuine masterpiece of cinema, one of the greatest animations (anime), one of the greatest war films and one of the greatest films ever made. Recommended for anyone of any age, a film with mass appeal and wide range. Holds a wonderful message and a genuinely inspiring story. Sheer brilliance for what is such a daring piece of film-making."
luisc7410,"Jan 14, 2005",10/10,"This is one of the most emotional films i have seen. Do not make the mistake of thinking that this movie will not be as emotional as some have told you, many make this mistake because it is an animated feature. This is a great film, and the fact that is animated, i think, only adds to it's realism.This is such a great film because it contains much more than the story of a boy and his sister, it illustrates the tragedies of ww2 and what many Japanese people had to suffer trough. the emotions that you will experience during this film prove to be but a glimpse of what the Japanese went trough. Very quickly you forget that these characters are animated, you become involved in their world and get to know them as people. you will suffer trough their tragedies and will hopefully come out of this experience knowing not only more about them, but knowing more about yourself as well.If you have ever wanted to experience a film that will move you and not only show you a different perspective on ww2, but also help you learn more about how you relate to others, i highly recommend this one."
trminator-35198,"Aug 20, 2020",7/10,The art in this film is visually pleasing amd helps convey how much of a surprise and devastation the WW2 events were to those who did not have a say in Japan's involvement.
liyep-53441,"Dec 5, 2021",7/10,"Flat out great - as in a classic film in general - anime. A brutal, post-war tragedy about the dissolution of a Japanese family and a pair of children coping with the loss and imposed responsibilities.Just incredibly animated, now with a cleaner ""print"" to do the film it's proper justice."
presence,"Nov 11, 1998",10/10,"Grave of the Fireflies is quite an experience.  I've seen the movie two times already, and the emotion it brings never changes or decreases.  As many times as I see it, I will never get numb to the melancholy mood of the story.  I've tried so very hard not to cry, but it's hopeless.  This movie is an unbelievable piece of work.  The animation is done extremely well, and the soundtrack increases the somberness of the movie. It is an all around outstanding movie, much better than any live action movie I've seen recently.  This is definitely one of Japan's gems, and should not be missed. Rent it at your local Blockbuster.  You won't regret it"
baz_trinity,"Dec 10, 2006",10/10,"To describe the emotion of this film in words is like trying to describe how food tastes to another specie, it just cannot be explained without experiencing it yourself. This movie will literally bring you to utter sadness within minutes and will continue to do so for 90 more. It will bring out a range of emotions throughout the film but most of them being heartbreaking scenes of turmoil and complete shock towards the events that unfold. But it is just beautiful in its delivery. The animation and dialog of both Seita and Setsuko makes you feel so much for them and this is why this film works so much. It will move you like no other movie and to that I applaud it. The animation is superb, beautiful landscapes, masterful drawings and an incredible use of color to which it is a visual masterpiece.The story tells of a brother andhis small sister in a fight against poverty during WW2. It is most definitely anti-war, but it does not point fingers, because it doesn't need to. It does not want the viewer to feel anger towards the circumstances of the war, it wants you to feel strong emotions for the consequences and effects it had on people DURING the war.This is an unforgettable piece of film that shows the sheer honesty Japan has towards the past events and I recommend it to anyone.Powerful, heartbreaking, upsetting, beautiful and utterly brilliant.Amazing."
gerardatienza,"Sep 23, 2005",10/10,"Hotaru no Haka depicts the most grueling side of war, wherein the innocents of society are the most devastated. Especially during the downfall of the Japanese during the Second World War, the film depicts the darkest times of the common people during the different bombings. Not to mention the apathy and individualism prevailing among the people. Also, it tackles on how life may be unfair for some people. There is still a face of hope, dreams, and life amid the many horrific faces of tragedy, death, and suffering. This film is extremely tragic and depressing, but very meaningful and realistic. Though it may match the quality mainstream anime, it, more often than not, goes beyond the boundaries of commonplace anime. There are no exaggerations, just real-life situations.Kudos to the makers of this film! More power to you!Always remember, as implied by the film, that there is no such thing as a war of peace, and the innocent are the true victims of this inhuman act of man!"
Red_Identity,"Mar 22, 2015",N/A,"Dear god, not something to be seen when you aren't in the right set of mind for it. It's achingly beautiful and really powerful without ever feeling manipulative. It's very well one of the best animated films I've ever seen, no question. The film also makes its intentions clear by showing these characters' fates in the beginning, and so we're not concentrated on hoping they survive or anything but just witnessing the deep pain and suffering that befell so many people during this time. Definitely a must-see film, one that isn't easy but very well reminds us o the tragedy that people went through and the human suffering, and how lucky the rest of us are for not having gone through it."
davidriffmeister,"Oct 31, 2020",7/10,"Let me give you some advice: If you feel like some light-hearted typical Studio Ghibli fare, watch a different movie. If you're sensitive like I am, this movie might make you cry. Grave of the Fireflies is very good but very depressing. This movie will help you to see the horrors of war. I give it 7 out of 10."
pomeroy-nick,"Jul 5, 2011",10/10,"Studio Ghibli's Grave of the Fireflies is a lesser-known anime from the creative studio responsible for the Oscar-winning Spirited Away. The lack of fame is understandable due to the sadder side that Grave of the Fireflies brings to the table, but don't let that difference dissuade you. This masterpiece is arguably a more well-rounded story and should be on everyone's list of anime films to see.Starting off with a family in Japan during World War II, the bond between brother and sister is instantly there to see and is the main focal point of the feature. This is a relationship that everyone can see in their own lives, if you have siblings or not there will always be someone who in that situation you would protect and do absolutely anything for.After the death of their mother and the terrible treatment their relatives show them, they have no choice but to go it alone. Surviving on scraps of food, morsels they can steal and barter for. All seems to be going well for a while until the plot takes us down a slippery slope full of turbulent emotional conflict. Complications in their lives quickly arise, and without substantial nourishment and proper shelter they struggle to stay well.The end is expected but nonetheless manages to still bring a tear to the eye of any human—however, strangely, it is not entirely out of sadness that you cry. Their horrendous ordeal to survive is over. I have yet to meet someone who it hasn't touched and wholly convinced them how important family and friends are in their lives.Films depicting family bonds and sibling dependency are not uncommon but where some only scratch the surface Grave of the Fireflies brings a whole new side to the idea and will leave you with a lasting impression.Even if you don't enjoy films that leave you in tears this is a must- watch Ghibli classic. Go home, get some ice cream, find someone you love and, with them, watch these 89 minutes of story-telling mastery."
jalvaro,"Jun 6, 2023",2/10,"Really? No matter how bad her aunt was and she was right only she didn't said it nicely. When her sister life was in danger, any human being would have gone back or at least leave her there. Even more when he found out the obvious fact that his father was dead.It's not technically bad it just doesn't make sense. If this wasn't a Ghibli movie it wouldn't have more than a 6.It clearly wasn't made by Miyazaki, but it's not a bad movie it just dosen't make sense. Ok you can stop reading now it's just that now IMDb reviews have to be 600 words long, so it's hard to make a good movie it's harder to make a good movie with a hard ending."
slyman-is-god,"Aug 8, 2005",10/10,"Studio Ghibli really did it with this movie. It shows War at it's worse and really gets to u.... Setsuko is absolutely cute and you really love her... such a sweet little kid confronted to her mothers death and being left alone....... and Seita, a young boy who has to take care of everything and being faced with complete helplessness.. and who really has a hard time surviving with Setsuko in those adverse circumstances.... It's hard to watch... I got really depressed when it was over and stayed like that for at least 3 days... u really start to hate Americans and war when u see what Japanese people had to go through... and considering that it's a true story.... it's twice as bad.... if u can, watch it... it's absolutely worth your time.... there a few War Dramas that can compare to this..."
Movie_Rating_n_Ranking,"Feb 3, 2025",7/10,"Studio Ghibli's magic recipe is visually stamped everywhere in Grave of the Fireflies. But Miyazaki's absence is noticeable. This story is heartbreaking but for some reason it feels like a typical, constant emotional blackmail for the audience. Fortunately, the emotion is quite believable, as it comes from a context and a group of situations that are taken from reality itself, although of course, with some tweaks to make the entire experience more cinematic.Returning to the aesthetics and visuals, the backgrounds are good, but they lack life and movements. They are static images that only serve as a basis for the atmosphere of each sequence. The animation is fine for a 1988 film, but it doesn't stand out much. The best point of the animation is the reference taken for each scene, especially those involving the human figure.The music is austere, but effective. The sound editing is austere and falls short. The voice acting is very good.Grave of the Fireflies is an oriental animated classic that is worth revisiting, although it doesn't come to revolutionize or shake more than a couple of hearts susceptible to moderate emotions."
iguth,"Apr 27, 2019",6/10,"Grave of the Fireflies is a good film. I will say that first. It is a pretty film and incredibly moving. The relationship between a brother and sister during WWII Japan is not only the main focus, but done incredibly well. The concept is very interesting to an American and provides a great perspective on the events of WWII. It has good pacing and each step along the way moves the plot forward. The biggest issue for me however would be that the movie could not hold onto my attention for much of the middle of the film."
adamschretz,"Dec 1, 2021",9/10,"This is one of the most realistic animated movies I've ever seen, because its based on a true story. The main characters, two siblings, were great and rational characters for their age. I think everyone, who watched over a younger sibling can feel/understand Seita and his struggles, while caring over Setsuko in the absence of their parents. But the siblings haven't had only tough phases in this cruel world (for incident discovering the body at the beach), but also pleasant moments, which shows, that they are still kids.It's an absolutely great film, which is almost a 10/10 for me."
misssarah1129,"Aug 22, 2013",10/10,"My daddy is the hardest man I've ever known. He was describing the movie to me while we were in line at the local bank. Now mind you, I've never EVER SEEN THIS MAN CRY, not when he talks about his deceased father, biological mother (hung herself, blamed my dad in her note, he found her ) You get the idea. He started crying just telling me what it was about! I started crying A because my dad was crying and that scared me and he shouldn't cry alone no matter what reason, and B because the description was so moving ( he didn't even give anything away!) This movie touched us both to the heart. Just writing this review is bringing me to tears. The movie is stellar, especially for Japanese anime coming out in the later 1980's! It's an extraordinary film, about famine, war, sacrifice, struggle (Amongst other things), but most important thing that can never be replaced, FAMILY! A must see, and a MUST BUY, AMAZON.COM, comes in English!"

priyantha-bandara,"Dec 1, 2010",N/A,"Most of the time some categories of movies are limited to express a certain kind of typical story lines. When it comes to Anime most of the movies are related to fantasy or science fiction. If you want to see half human half robots , or dragons from distance mystic lands or vampires from the east and Gods from the forests; anime are the best place for it.But time to time there is a movie which comes out that breaks the trend. 'Grave of the fireflies' is one of such great anime movie which speaks of a different purpose. It speaks of humanity and living. Rather than being super natural it has a story which makes you think twice or maybe thrice about life and what we really do to our society. Occur in the times of the great world war 2 a young boy named Setsuko and his kid sister named Seita are refugees after their city is bombed. Grieving their mothers death Setsuko tries hard to take care of his sister amongst many difficulties. Ultimately neglected by their relatives the brother and sister seek shelter in an abandoned bunker. Not having much to eat and running out of supplies Setsuko does things that he himself is not proud of because he wants to keep her little sister happy and alive.The story is wonderful and so moving that you may forget that its actually an anime. Heartwarming at times and depressing 'Grave of the fireflies' makes most of the Animes look like child's play. I don't know what else to expect from an anime as 'Grave of the fireflies' is so emotional and sure to give you a tear or two in its climax. Originated in 1988 I wish such great movies will hit screens often. Definitely a keeper."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Dec 5, 2011",10/10,"Set during WWII in Japan, 14-year-old Seika is the only one to take care of his 5-year-old sister, Setsuko, after their mother is killed in an aerial firebombing of their village, that also destroys their home. Their father is off fighting, and they have to go to live with their aunt, who scolds them at an increasing rate and level. After a while, they move out, into a shelter. This follows their struggle to survive, on dwindling food supplies and sudden plane raids. In the way of a classic tragedy, this hints at its inevitable conclusion from the very beginning. This doesn't make it ""predictable"", as the point is not to surprise; it renders it even more powerful, as we find ourselves losing the battle in trying to deceive ourselves of where it is headed. I have not read the novel and can draw no comparisons. Like the other Studio Ghibli pictures, this feels very true to life and natural. The astonishing attention to detail, the immense realism, the tiny little human aspects, these have you forgetting that you're not watching live-action(the mood is spot-on, and you're transported directly into the situation). And the animation is impeccable. This is deeply moving and engaging(and it is more focused on this than the plot). If it does not tug at your heartstrings, you are officially a robot. At the same time, it isn't manipulative, and your sympathy and empathy are awoken in an honest manner. The sound design is excellent(and it uses the absence thereof, silence, to fantastic effect), backing up the visuals in recreating something very close to the real world. While there is stylization, and not everything in this is what it appears, it doesn't betray this objective of credibility. This builds and maintains atmosphere extremely well. Whether it's the siblings having trouble getting by, them playing together, an explosive assault from above, it comes across as genuine. The pacing is perfect. At about 90 minutes, this is not in a rush, and it lets you absorb the individual parts of what's going on. The acting is phenomenal. I base this on the original version, not a dubbed one. There is a bit of highly disturbing, bloody, violent, gory and brutal content in this. The DVD comes with a feature-length track of alternate angle storyboards(and another 10 and a half minutes of extra ones), two interesting interviews(one with the writer/director that comes in at 17 and a half minutes, the other with film critic Roger Ebert, that has a running time of 12 minutes), an informational 12 and a half minute documentary (""Historical Perspective""), a 6 and a half minute Japanese release promo, a 4 and a half minute DVNR featurette, a 3 minute art gallery, one US trailer and one Japanese(both 2 minutes). I recommend this to fans of Anime and drama. 10/10"
faraaj-1,"Oct 24, 2006",7/10,"Grave of the Fireflies is based on a true story. The central characters are an orphaned brother and much younger sister in WW2 Japan. The city of Kobe has recently come under Allied fire bombing and most of the wooden houses have burned down including that of Seita and Setsuko. The children first live with a family friend who quickly becomes very nasty. They then move to a bomb shelter and try to survive the war.I like the fact that this film is anti-war and it does tell a touching story. But, I don't consider it, on first viewing, to be quite the classic it's made out to be. To be honest, I couldn't get into the whole anime thing. Even the faces were not realistic. If this had been a real movie with real actors, it would have been tougher to make, but the impact (for me) would have been far greater. Some of the plot points didn't make sense either. If Seita could access all that money in his mothers account, why did Setsuko have to reach a point of starvation for him to get his hands on it.Please don't let my views on this film discourage you from watching it. Overall, it is a good film and very well perceived by critics and IMDb voters."
fijihiji,"Jun 12, 2006",2/10,"Perhaps because I had such high hopes for the movie, but I was so utterly disappointed by this movie. The kids? In a deplorable situation, abandoned by all. But as the relative pointed out, the boy could have tried to find any kind of work to afford things to eat. Before the strike in his neighborhood, he had worked at the local factory, after-all. He kept on waiting for his father, lamenting his sad state of affairs, but in effect, not doing anything about it. Also, the voice of Setsuko really started to get on my nerves about twenty minutes into the movie. Oh, boohoo. The boy was so obviously in denial about everything, the death of his mother, no contact from his mother, his sick sister. I got quickly sick of this movie. To me, the stubbornness and denial of the boy character represented the Japanese Empire's attitude towards reality before, during and maybe even after the war. To that end, I felt no sympathy for the children."

I haven't bawled so hard after losing my granny. The end was just tragically beautiful. Many scenes were tear jerkers but what got me completely invested was when Setsuko asks her brother holding the dead fireflies that why do good things have to die so soon. The metaphor was daunting and just could not be ignored.
I cried so much at 12am that I couldn't control myself.
Thank you for this brilliant masterpiece that I don't think I can dare to watch without crying. This has just become my favourite animated movie of all times.

r0h1t,"Aug 6, 2023",10/10,"I've never cried so much while watching a movie. This cinematic masterpiece undoubtedly stands as one of the finest wartime films ever created. It can make you truly appreciate the good things in life and remind you how much your family and life itself mean to you.The film revolves around two siblings navigating the harrowing aftermath of war on innocent lives. With moments of poignant poetry and a consistently somber undertone, it delicately balances a few glimpses of lightness amidst the pervasive darkness. Yet, ultimately, it shatters your heart into a million pieces.I've observed people raising questions about Seita's choices, yet the essence of the movie doesn't lie in expecting a 14-year-old to navigate flawlessly through decisions. Just like real life, making mistakes is an inherent part of it, and it's important to note that Seita's decisions weren't driven by selfish motives. Each decision he took was guided by his love for his sister, and he embraced the immense responsibility of safeguarding her, regardless of the cost."
ZachDVD,"Sep 4, 1999",N/A,"This film will leave you speechless. And Anime fans, you're in for a treat. The animation looks very realistic (they use the soft brown edge process, not really used much more in anime) but the story... the story of war and it's effects on the innocent will make you feel broken hearted and feel for those who suffered in war. The film focuses on a brother and sister, who, after their mother dies in an air raid goes to live with their cruel aunt. Soon they can't take anymore of their aunt and decide to live on their own... but can they survive? This film will break you down and make you emotional... especially the end. The music fits perfectly... okay, I'll shut up now and let you go see this movie. Buy it, rent it, just see it. You'll never look at war the same way again."

I think it was totally underrated for the prizes or awards it should have won. There were single moments of sheer bliss like the moment when Seita and Setsukuo catch fireflies and use them to illuminate their cave. In a nutshell this is a movie that sums up both the horrors of WWII along with beautiful sense and the simplicity of the relation between a brother and his little sister."
kbogosian-34228,"Mar 22, 2022",7/10,"I am a sap for tragic war stories so I had high hopes for this one, only to be a bit disappointed. The story was simplistic, it basically just follows one character's actions, and his irresponsibility - while understandable since he is a child - makes it a little difficult to empathize with him. It's not a big story about the devastation in Japan, it's mostly just a tale of a child who can't afford any food. There were nice elements as other people say but the story just didn't bite.Agree with the content of Galcian's review (although he only gave it a 3), go check it out, I especially agree that it's silly to call this an anti-war movie. For a movie to have a genuine anti-war message it has to do something more than merely show a tragic event that is the consequence of a war. This movie does nothing to interrogate or even acknowledge the motivations and moral choices made by anybody involved in the Japanese and Allied war efforts, it just presents a snapshot of the end result. ""Sometimes war leads to starving children and that's very sad"" is not a novel political message, it's a basic fact that people have known for thousands of years.I mostly liked it because I still like sappy tragedy movies and as other reviews have said, there are nice elements to this one. If you don't like sappy movies, I'd say don't bother watching it."
Imdbidia,"Feb 22, 2011",10/10,"The story of survival of two Japanese brothers, little Satsuko, a 4y.o. girl, and her brother Saita, a 14y.o. boy, at the end of the Second World War in Japan, based on the semi-biographical novel of Akiyuki Nosaka.Grave of the Fireflies is one of the saddest stories and movies I have ever seen. It puts face to the the children in any war, those who lose everything and have left with nothing, those too easily forgotten and so easily neglected. What makes the movie sad is the verisimilitude of the story, that something like that happened and is happening any time that there is a war.The animation is marvelous, colorful, attentive to the detail, scenic and intimate, with a lyricism that only Ghiblin Studies are able to create. The drawing of the Japanese countryside is simply superb, and the same can be said of the drawing of the city environments and destruction; the best from Ghiblin to me. The atmosphere is great. The colors a little more saturated than usual from Ghiblin studio, and really precious. The music by Michio Mamiya is extremely subtle and beautiful, perfect for the story. The characters of the two brothers are wonderfully drawn and performed by the Japanese actors. Some of the intimate scenes of the two brothers are really magical, especially the ones involving the fireflies that give tittle to the movie.What is great about this movie is that, very soon, you forget that you are watching animation, as the story is so strong, captivating and engaging, that those drawn characters become real as you and me.A classic animation movie difficult to forget, soulful and marvelous in every possible way.The best animation film I have ever seen and one of the best ever made. No doubt. No perhaps."
ellasavard,"May 25, 2021",9/10,"This film shows the dark truth behind war and poverty. It provides an inside glimpse to a world so many of us will never have to set foot in. I can admit I am left with a feeling of guilt and unsettlement after finishing this film. But that shows just how amazing it is, it takes you into another world and allows you to understand and take part in all depths of it. This is truly an eye opening film and I highly recommend everyone watches it as it will change how you view your own life."
DarkestOperator,"Feb 15, 2010",9/10,"I am going to start out by saying that this was one of the most depressing movies I've seen in my entire life. But it was definitely one of the most beautiful animated films I've seen also, a film typical of the late 80s anime films by Studio Ghibli. What I liked about this film was the fact that it wasn't fantasy like say, Spirited Away. This was real, based on a true story, based on events that were definitely not just limited to one pair of children during wartime Japan. That's what makes it so heartbreaking: the fact that this is based in reality and that life is cruel and does not always have a happy ending. But the story of Seita and Setsuko is beautifully told and Setsuko is one of the most heartwarming little children I have ever seen in an animated film, she's just that convincing. The music fit the mood perfectly and the voice acting was top-notch: if you get the chance to watch this, watch it in the original Japanese. On a side note, this film made me appreciate the things I have, the fact that I have food to eat everyday and the fact that I have a place to stay and am not caught in some war. It just makes you feel so lucky to have what you have. Also, I would not recommend this for kids because of events that take place early on.Great film, made me cry and realize how lucky I am. 9/10."
darren-cb,"Oct 18, 2011",10/10,"I am 15 years old. I am a boy. I have a younger sister. I have never really thought of the effects of war on countries like Japan in World War II. I watched this on my own, Thursday night, not knowing much apart from the basic plot. I was moved. On Sunday afternoon I watched it again with the rest of my family. I cried. Both times.This movie is so strong, anyone who wants to not be able to sleep tonight, who wants to be kept awake judging their own morals, the effects of war and evaluating their own relationships - watch this movie! If you don't, watch it anyway - it must be seen.I shan't spoil anything but it will touch you out of the sheer cruelty of our modern world and the stupidity of warfare. If I was Japanese or American this movie would make me feel somewhat guilty for the events of the film and it becomes even more poignant to learn that is based on true events. The relationship between Seita and Setsuko is so amazing, for the first hour it is not only extremely realistic but heart-breaking by the end. Even if you don't feel morally different about war, the emotional impact is enough to put me in a state of confusion and feeling so sad ... for days. The single greatest thing is the relationship, it is the most realistic and saddest thing I have ever seen in cinema.If you're between 12 and 25, this is must see. You need to watch it, either to question your own morals or to re-enforce them. And although the creator claims the movie is not an ""anti-war"" film but one about the relationship then watch it anyway - the relationship makes this movie so magical and the war themes just give it context. If you have a sibling - watch this. If you want to know about war - watch this. If you're between 12 and 25 - watch this. If you want to see something so powerful you'll be moved - watch this. If you want a war film - try something different, watch this.Just watch this movie.Why do fireflies have to die so young?"
ed_two_o_nine,"Dec 9, 2008",8/10,"This is a remarkable film. The sort of animated move that would never be made in the west. An animated film that deals with adult themes and achieves it with excellence. This is the story of a brother and sister orphaned by the second world war in Japan, who end up having to fend for themselves. Everything here is achieved with excellence. I watched the subtitled version (which I always feel is best) and was really taken aback by the great little film. This film deals with the harsh realities of a civilization under siege and also with Japanese culture superbly and the director here must tack a huge amount of credit. There are scenes of great emotion as the film works it's way to a hugely emotive ending. Superb. One to be viewed again and again."
kaplara,"Nov 21, 2004",10/10,"I think often times one knows the value of the movie they watch through the effect it has on them. That being said, this is one of the greatest movies ever made. I watch movies from many cultures and of many genres. Though I usually prefer a good action flick to any kind of sentimental rubbish; that tends to be because most movies which try to be sentimental fall short of creating a reaction. This movie creates a reaction, a big reaction. One of the ways I test a movie's greatness is to re-watch it, a lot later. As time passes and the movie sinks in, it loses its power to effect you. I watched this movie in 1998; a month ago I tried to watch it again. I did not make it past the movies opening scene. I do not easily come to tears, but I could not watch this movie a second time, I could not bear that kind of pain. That is level of power this movie evokes, and that is the level of strength the story conveys. There is no way my words can properly express the feelings which this movie creates, do not be afraid because it is in a foreign language or because it is animated, what this movie touches transcends all that. There is no more to be said, watch it and find out for yourself what I mean."
oneflewovertheapocalypse,"Sep 24, 2004",N/A,"I am not to keen on Manga/Anime movies but I do know a lot of Isao Takahata Other films like Spirited Away etc. My girlfriend is a huge fan and bought the DVD and I was glancing at it from my computer desk but the more it went on the more I started to pay more attention. The images of some of the animation is incredible as much I don't usually watch these films I always complement the people that draw and makes these film because of the stunning imagery.This film hit me pretty hard which was unexpected because of the little girl and her brother's story during World War 2. I was say that this was an animation version of Schindler's List because of the horrific images of death. If you are not for the faint hearted of tragic stories then avoid this because I find myself quite close to tears in parts but it's fantastic story of hope and survival is what grabs you and never let's go. I expected a good film but I wasn't even watching it to start off, only by turning my head and listening to parts is what grabbed me and for that to do to somebody who generally doesn't watch these type of films says a lot about the film altogether. I am now going to go threw my Fiancés collection of Manga and Anime films and see what else can do the same as The Grave of the fireflies did and that was changed my opinion of a genre that I have cruelly ignored over the years. Trust me, to anyone who reads this, if you like film-making and storytelling all together especially animation then watch this because there is nothing else like it."
kaustavsanyalece,"Apr 10, 2020",10/10,"I'm shaken to my core....
The tagline of this film should be... Cry till you die!!!"
johnnyboyz,"May 9, 2013",6/10,"I suppose I enjoyed Grave of the Fireflies about as much as I enjoyed something like 2009's ""The Road"", a film with an atmosphere and a 'look' more-so a character study; a narrative arc or an actual spine. The comparison to a film set post-apocalypse is somewhat fitting here, since Studio Ghibli's 1988 effort often has the feel that the world is coming to an end; that there isn't much hope left and what the central characters have is the best they'll get lest they be dead. What IS coming to an end, however, is not the world itself but The Second World War – something which, if you're in the likes of Berlin; Paris; Hiroshima; Tokyo, or anywhere else synonymous with the conflict, is going to be a lot less pleasant than if you're situated in the United States, or even parts of Great Britain. As a result, towns are flattened; people are fending for themselves; food is hard to come by and to escape the threat of further dangers; one appears to have to flee to the countryside: this is a post-apocalyptic drama if ever I saw one.Like most of its ilk, story and character sputter to get going out of the fact it's the end of most of what's left in the world and there isn't much left with which to interact. Grave of Fireflies is no different; its elevated status in the popular eye is born out of the fact it's an animation first and foremost, and people often grade such things for its appeal to a child – thus, when something as adult as ""Grave"" comes along, hysteria and praise will follow. Additionally, it is a Japanese film and a Japanese film tackling Japanese life at the end of The Second World War; a sum often enough for people to see films from certain countries in regards to certain issues sensitive to said nation as being a bit better than what is normal.As for the film itself, and following on from My Neighbour Totoro, the gleefulness and the ambiguity of the situations young children found themselves in as monsters and supernatural elements ruled their breakaway roost has been replaced by a starker, darker reality. Grave of the Fireflies depicts children veering away from their parents or guardians and into a realm not populated by mythical creatures, of whom are little to no threat, but into the unremitting world of street life in which the reality of actual starvation is very much a threat. We are a long way from the flights of fantasy abound in said example, wherein interaction with monsters and such took kids out of living with parental protection and forced them to fend for themselves.Here, The War is coming to an end and young siblings Seita (Tatsumi) and Setsuko (Shiraishi) suffer the death of their mother during a Kobe bombing raid that additionally destroys their home – thus, they are forced out and about onto the already dangerous streets of Japan. In Japan right now, the skies are red; ash rains down; the rain that falls in black and they have a mere tin of fruit sweets between them in terms of food supply – they must, however, troop on in an attempt to find father who's with the Navy. To an extent, the film is reminiscent of the preceding year's Empire of the Sun; a superior film in its depiction of a young infant caught up in Japan's spree of invasion through the Far East at around this time, events which eventually gave way to the Pacific theatre of World War II. On top of this, there is a burning amount of inspiration drawn from a lot of what Italy was producing in the immediate fallout of the war; these neo-realist pictures about an individual (plus, on occasion, a companion) trawling through the proverbial debris in order to get somewhere that may or may not be anywhere in particular.Seita adopts the role of the lead from Setsuko, on account of being much older; their tale in a late-war Japan, a Japan losing two separate wars to China and the Allies, is an interesting snapshot of life at that time, but no more – a piece not offering as much as one would like beyond the thirty minute mark, by which time we've understood all that's been provided and wait to be challenged with something more. Throughout, the Japanese are resentful and full of spite towards the children; a depiction of aunts and doctors, those of whom you would have thought would show compassion, an instance of few punches being pulled by the makers in what appears to be a set of depictions designed to sync up with the merciless nature of Japanese attitudes at that time.Grave of the Fireflies is no doubt a brave project, with well-constructed, oppressive atmospheres of hopelessness and decent cinematography, but this will only get you so far. The effectiveness of films such as these, projects with later significant deaths and a series of scenes not propelled by narrative but by survival, are often determined by the creativity behind the uncanniness of the scenario, with the likes of 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead scoring highly. Grave of the Fireflies, while competent and well designed, is not a horror film per se; its drama is wearing, its runtime tiring, in spite of it being below ninety minutes and its characters two dimensional (they might be of any age and of any background). Its droll repetition, instead of capturing the desperately sad and desperately slow paced nature of survival, instead creates the sense we're being dragged down the same scenes over and over again – and this is precisely what happens."
sappersil,"Jul 10, 2006",4/10,"(Possible spoiler, though you know about a character(s) death in the 1st 15 seconds anyways)This is NOT a story about 2 kids fighting for survival in war-torn Japan. This is not about kids begging for food. This is not about kids scrounging for food. This is not about kids staying with adults who feed them. This is not about kids who line up to get their rations. This is not about kids who go to an intact city with their money and buy food.This is the story of a moron who unfortunately had the care of his kid sister. The social commentary here is that society was so broken down that it did not notice the brother abusing his little sister.This got a 4 for story and animation. It did not get a higher rating because I really do not like stories about helpless morons who cannot do what it takes to survive but who refuse to see they are unable to care for anyone else. I also did not like that most of the reviews make the moron/murderer into a hero and seem to admire him. I felt deceived by the reviews as I was expecting a sad story of kids who TRY to survive but are unable to. I did not expect a story of a kid who refuses to survive except on his own terms and who makes his loved one live those same terms. He must have been a clueless elitist. Other Japanese were/ are quite good at survival.Within about the 1st 15 minutes, you can tell Seita is a moron and too good to work. It just takes awhile to get to the murderer part. I should have followed my instinct to stop watching the movie when he puts his sister in danger gawking when planes are flying overhead. I really wanted to bash his head in at that moment --- Let me think: save sister vs shoes; save sister vs. watch planes, save sister vs talking to people...hmmm. Perhaps there is another statement in the movie -- that Japanese males were/are like this -- shoes before baby sister.Mothers will starve for their children . . . why do so many reviews seem to admire Seita and call this a struggle to survive? I thought the movie was more a statement that in war, some people will always choose to die, re: Seita, but most of society moves on. Unfortunately, the deathwishers will also sometimes take other people with them, usually those they love the most. Ah...I finally figured this movie out -- this is a drawn out story of a murder/suicide."
ariztoz,"May 24, 2021",10/10,"Fantastic piece of art, explores human emotions in a deep level, wonderfully made drama."
xiyiper,"Dec 4, 2021",9/10,"Grave of the Fireflies is known as one of the saddest animes ever made. Yes, there are some truly gut-wrenching moments, and happy Hollywood endings are nowhere in sight, but the film is far from as hard to watch as its reputation might suggest.Grave of the Fireflies isn't exactly uplifting. Still, the tale of the two siblings, trekking through a bombed and torn asunder Kobe at the end of WWII, approaches wartime atrocities with encouraging innocence.The story grabs hold from the very first sequences, and holds you tight till the end credits roll. Do not let the dead serious theme stop you from checking out Grave of the Fireflies. Behind the heinous exterior hides a profound and heartfelt story that is not to be missed."
NerdyNinja49,"Jan 1, 2015",10/10,"I don't cry when I watch movies. Very rarely when I watch something will a tear spring up, and it usually only lasts a second. The final half hour of this film tears were streaming down my face. It's so good at pulling on your heart strings. You love the characters, you're there with them, so watching both of them fail to carry on, especially after all the older brother has done, hurts. That being said, I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. It is one of the most amazing anti-war films I've ever seen and it impacts you even more so because it's animated in the gentle Studio Ghibli art style. A beautiful film, something I was sad to find isn't more openly distributed. I was luckily able to find it at an awesome library in town."
liooizki,"Sep 16, 2020",10/10,"This movie won't make you feel good. No. It'll make you feel like trash, and that's ok.It's a masterpiece. In 1988, with all the difficulties that the animation had in that time, they achieve to make you feel like in 1945, suffering along these young people.I was angry, and felt impotent all along the movie, but it was only a couple hours later that I appreciated the tremendous movie that I've watched.Would absolutely recommend for all the people that loves people, that loves caring for others and that loves history.It's a reminder that wars should end immediately.10/10"

bk753,"May 9, 2025",6/10,"I was far more into the historical and sociological aspects of this film than I was with the characters and the story. Many view WWII only from the way we are taught, with no thought to the stories from the other side. In this regard, this film is a powerful glance at pain and suffering, of innocents under siege from an enemy above, in the final days of conflict.This animated tear-jerker goes behind the abject horror and focuses on one sad story among millions... a boy and his young sister struggling to stay alive and together amid the chaos. And it just wasn't strong enough for me. The translated dialogue was stiff, the art wasn't anything exceptional, the ""fireflies"" as a theme wasn't fleshed out enough, subplots appear and disappear... and it just gets brutally sad. Yes, war is hell.The horrible events of the day should have yielded a better movie. Too many raves for this one, as is. It's an okay film but it doesn't belong anywhere near the Top 50 of IMDB's Top 250, certainly not ahead of many far better films. Not a terrible watch, but terribly overrated. Sorry."
Mnemosyne15,"Mar 18, 2020",9/10,"War, separation, death. . . Humanity is indifferent, displaced, and one child raises another. He was forced to helplessly in order to survive, stole, survived in the cave, and worked hard to live. But he failed to save his sister in the end.

I hesitated at first, but then I said ""Oh well, I'll give it a try."" At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film, I've ever seen. This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war. This movie isn't your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I'm not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. I Really Enjoyed This Movie So Far And Enjoy The Movie That Really And Awesome Movie."
heseinfathi,"Oct 5, 2022",10/10,"I am glad there's an afterlife for the sakle of those whom lives were squandered in a needless, brutal, unhuman aggression by the so called civilized people.I'm glad the offspring of really stupid parents (so stupid that they decide to have children whilst overall incapable, and too stupid to properly tend to them) have another chance in the afterlife.That alone is good enough reason to believe there is another life. One life is just too unfair for the vast majority of our failed species.One more thing (unrelated to the movie). How vast is the difference between people killing the weekest among them over limited resources than modern societies setting the prices too high and thus poorest from access to life support so they perish?I say we're but a joke. I can't mention this and not bring up the joker's quote, """"You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

I have seen a bevy of animated movies and series but this leaves an insurmountable mark and is literally without fault in terms of its brutal honesty of this world and characters too.I am utterly mystified with the beauty of this movie as it often makes my depression go away and make my life more appealing to me.

SinjinSB,"Nov 24, 2002",9/10,"This is the most touching animated feature I've ever seen. I truly cared about the characters and was saddened at the tragic events they had to deal with. A young teen boy and his four year old sister are orphaned while their father is in the Japanese navy and their mother is killed in a fire bombing. Though there are a few small bits of humor as a way for them to cope with their situation, I caution you not to think this is a typical Japanese Anime story. It's as gut-wrenching as any live-action war movie and shows the attacks on Japan in a way I've never seen depicted before, from the personal point of view of two children. If you can take it, I think it's an excellent film that tells an important story."
briankhutchinson,"Sep 18, 2016",10/10,"I don't cry at movies.Sometimes I am sad. Maybe I even feel a bit wet in the eyes. But I don't cry.This movie devastated me. Literally had me in tears during and destabilized me for days afterwards. It has probably been ten years since I watched it. Regardless I still tear up reading reviews or seeing the title screen.The fact that it is animated is irrelevant. The movie lays out the sad reality of the real victims of war.I wish that every world leader would be required to watch this before assuming command of their respective countries. Sometimes I think that it is too easy for them to look at objectives and forget the realities and suffering that come with armed conflict.So many reviews already summarize the plot of this film. Maybe it cheats a bit while pulling your heartstrings but it is truly beautiful and every human should see this once.Disclaimer: I have a son and daughter who were around these ages at the time of viewing. While I believe this is a phenomenal film, my emotions may have been affected by the parallelism."

I never felt such emotional impact by movie before. This film changed my look at animation. This movie is so harsh, realistic and sad, that you'll stay shocked for quite a while. It shows that war is deadly beast taking lives of Innocent people, especially children. The way the bond between brother and sister is depicted is truly amazing. It shows how small things are important even in dire times, when death lurks behind every corner. If you have chance to see this film, do so, but be prepared for beautiful, but shocking experience.

scobbah,"Jul 27, 2004",7/10,"Grave of the Fireflies is, probably one of the most touching animes I have ever seen. The story takes place in Japan during the end of the WW2 and we get to meet a brother and his sister, trying to survive during the hard times and misery Japan faced at the bitter end of the war. The anime, who is from 1988, feels like it's delivering an old vibe of the anime style, and with a smooth roll the story develops and tightens up into something you never would've imagined before you pressed ""Play"". Too bad though that I had such big expectations on this piece. I've heard it's ""so sad"" and that you're about to cry for a lifetime, but hey it's a piece that won't get you to smile but it won't ruin your mood forever either! A 7 out of 10 - and it would've gotten higher points unless it didn't felt so short and empty of action from time to time."

It is a beautiful piece of cinema and is truly one of the greatest given that it's a 1988 movie. If you want to experience something new in yourself do watch it. PLEASE DO WATCH THIS. This is coming from a 25 year old man with a heart that he felt was impossible to melt down."
the-evil-cult,"Dec 10, 2004",7/10,"One common criticism of this movie is the sentimentality. I did find while watching the movie that the child's constant crying did become annoying after a while. Some people are more easily influenced by sentimentality than others, but the sob elements in Grave of the Fireflies seem too excessive to be realistic. The child behaves too much like a child, almost as if the maker wanted to emphasize that the victim was a child to artificially heighten emotions. Towards the end though the sentimentality becomes more effective.My dad walked out on the movie because it was an anime. Anime and cartoons are often seen as childish and some people are too proud of themselves to watch movies they perceive as childish. Dad returned halfway through the movie but complained that nothing was happening, so he left again. All viewers are different. Hollywood executives are aware that a significant proportion of viewers are averse to a movie in which nothing big happens. This leads to a situation in which action (mainly violent action with explosions) is often interspersed throughout a movie -- maybe a chase scene added in the middle of a boring dialogue session or a sex scence for shock effect."
cameronscarlett,"May 22, 2021",1/10,"Honestly can't believe how well received this film is. The story is sad, yes, but it's also extremely boring and slow. I wasn't floored or depressed like many others claim, my tears were from boredom."
leonasker,"Apr 16, 2018",10/10,"Grave of the fireflies is truly one of the most touching films that i have ever seen and it is such a beautiful movie that shows the relationship between a brother and his younger sister trying to survive in a war-torn Japan during WW2. The story revolves around Seita and his younger sister Setsuko, as we see them trying to survive.
If this film proves anything it is that animation is no just suited to tell kids tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy. Japanse animation or ""anime"" is a style and sometimes you have to look past the style of a movie to appreciate a beautiful and heartbreaking story. 
But what this movie really excels at is showing the results of war and also the victims of war as we see our two main characters Seita and Setsuko dealing with the situation there in.
Grave of the fireflies is one of my favourite films of all time and it brings me to tears every time i watch it."
rsaavedra,"Nov 26, 2002",10/10,"A most unusual blend of beauty, and sadness, to display the cruel consequences of war. Slowly and steadily, as if in slow motion, we are slapped in the face with the miserable reality of the main characters, devastating and cruel reality, shown so simply and so powerfully from the very first to the very last second of the movie. Some parts literally smash your heart to sorrow. Graphically speaking the movie displays such a breathtaking look. Not just the sceneries and overall style, even minor details like the leaves and debris flying across the scenery in several shots truly resemble the paintings of Hokusai or Hiroshigue (which I happen to be very fond of). The artistic value of the visuals works perfectly in service of the powerful emotional substance explored in this movie, the combination is just perfect. There are several moments that I personally find truly poetic and most sublime in Grave of the fireflies. Forget whether you hate or enjoy war movies, or whether you like or dislike animated or manga movies. Grave of the Fireflies really stands far beyond any preconceptions you might have for these categories."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jul 13, 2023",10/10,"Young brother and sister Seita and Setsuoko face a battle to surve as American bombs fall on Japan as the end of WWII approaches.My exposure to anime movies has so far been limited to just Princess Mononoke and Spirited away, I loved both, I absolutely loved this one.Grave of The Fireflies is an incredibly powerful movie, one that had me totally engaged, and at times had me with tears rolling down my cheeks. It's an unusual story, very much seen from the point of view of two innocent children.It's quite a long movie, but it's so interesting that it doesn't drag. Some may argue that it's somewhat depressing in parts, and that is true, but it does deal with some pretty bleak ideas.It's hard to fathom that this film dates all the way back to 1988, it looks and feels so much more up to date, it is such a visually appealing film, the animation is so sharp, several scenes look breathtaking, that scene with the fireflies is enchanting.The music is haunting and melodic, it fits the film perfectly.I'm stunned by the lack of awards, I thought this film would have done a lot better.10/10."

This film has good animation and a touching heartfelt story that isn't afraid to have the worst things happen to the protagonists.I found this film too long, with a shallow story. It establishes food is hard to find and then keeps riding that to the end, there are really no interesting steady supporting characters or additional plot lines so after the first half, its more of the same to the end. I think there were ample opportunities to develop more with characters like the fishing boys or the policeman that let him go etc. But story seems focused on ratcheting up the misery, it doesnt even try to get your hopes up things will get better for protagonists, if even just to crush them.I feel there could be 20+ minutes of food hunting and annoying sister moments shaved off this and it would be even more emotionally powerful as you wouldn't be pulled out of the feeling of the main plot."
pere-25366,"Jul 20, 2016",10/10,"I just finished watching Grave of the Fireflies and wow. Just wow. I am at a complete lost for words. Until this point, I had only watched a few animes but this heart-rending tale isn't your typical animated film. No, it is SO much more. It has unexpected depth. It has soul. It has a genuine message that shan't be overlooked.This is an extremely poignant and moving story about a young boy and his little sister struggling to survive in Japan during World War II. Above all, it is based on experience, situation and exploration. And this film offers us a tragic look into real atrocities, real horrors from the perspectives of two joyful kids, Seita and Setsuko. They share a magnificently uplifting and eternal connection (the latter quite literally, as many would argue) that makes you feel all kinds of warm inside just watching them interact with one another.The animation in this film is simply breathtaking. The painstaking attention to detail, particularly with the surrounding landscape is awe-inspiring. Certain images like the luminous fireflies at night, the glistening pond outside where Seita and Setsuko reside and the beach they visit with its magnificent sunset will resonate with me for a long time. It is hard not to appreciate animation of such quality and finesse.The impact of this film is heightened with a mesmerizing score and the introspective pauses that are not only tolerated, but encouraged, in Japanese animation films. Majestic sounds used throughout also add to this captivating, almost dreamlike vibe. And yet, it was the true to life storytelling that made this film such a realistic, enchanting piece of art.I was somewhat confused of the beginning without any context and I later re-watched it after the film's end. It is a beautiful beginning (or rather end) and makes you appreciate the film even more than you thought you did. This wonderfully crafted film deserves a viewing from anyone at least once. It is not simply a movie about war per se, but about the beauty of life and the blissful ignorance of youth."
apokteino,"Aug 12, 2020",6/10,"A tragic tale of two young children, siblings, trying to survive in the wake of war. Heart breakingly difficult to watch. It's a well told story - perhaps too well. The harsh realities of war are laid bare."
mjensen-3,"Aug 10, 2004",10/10,"This is the Greatest anime ever made, this film shows the horror of war and what happen during that time because of our actions. Can the world ever live down world war two, I don't know but I love this film. The beauty, the script, it all works, and it doesn't take cheap shots like most fims.  This is a brilliant masterpiece.THE PLOTIn the aftermath of a world war two bombing, two orphaned children struggle to survive in the Japanese countryside.  To Seita and his four-year-old sister, the helplessness and indifference of their countrymen is even more painful than the enemy raids.  Through desperation, hunger, and grief, these children's lives are as heartbreakingly fragile as their spirit and love is inspiring. Grave Of The Fireflies is a tale of the true tragedy of war and innocence lost, not only of the abandon young, but of an intire nation.This is the greatest anime and one of the best war films of the 20th century. I give this film a 4 out of 4 stars."
sknmonkey2004,"Jul 22, 2006",10/10,"extremely heartbreaking story of a boy about 14 years old who has to take care of his sister during world war 2. It is possibly one of the saddest movies you will ever watch and at the same time its heartwarming in a way. It really puts the life at the in japan at the time into perspective considering it is in the most part a true story. You really must see this movie, if you think things are bad for you it really makes you think twice about it. Its a studio Ghibli production so you know its going to be an amazing movie, nothing else needs to be said to make you watch this movie, but you really should. Girls show it to you're boyfriends and see if they have a heart or not, ha ha. Not really, i watched it alone, I'm a guy and I hate tearing up in front of others. But this wouldn't be a bad one to see with a girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife..... but i wouldn't consider it all that great for friends to watch together."
tuxpixie,"Mar 5, 2006",10/10,"before i start i would like to mention that this is referring to the subtitled version of the movie, i have not viewed any English dubbed version.first off, before i saw this movie every review i read seemed to warn me to prepare for an extremely harrowing experience.. so i prepared myself and... was pleasantly surprised, my overall feeling having watched this movie is that it is quite simply one of the most beautiful and realistic examples of the anime genre.yes it is sad, the subject matter is not really a happy one, and i have to admit to having tears in my eyes during more than one scene. but the story is told in a very beautiful manner and there are plenty of happy moments to balance things out.we already know the outcome of the film within 5 minutes of it starting. what matters most is the journey along the way. the characterisations are very realistic with setsuko as probably the most realistic 4 year old I've ever seen in an anime movie. and seita as a normal teenage boy.. making decisions as he sees best, so maybe they aren't the best decisions he could have made but they are his none the less. i did not find the film to be overly gratuitous in its anti war message, and what little gore there was was confined to occasional scenes and over quickly. the art and animation was stunningly beautiful as i have come to expect from the incredible studio ghibli.highly recommended."
strokemp,"Oct 4, 2019",10/10,If you don't cry during this movie there is a big chance that you are not human.Beside that movie is brilliant!
auuwws,"Oct 18, 2020",9/10,"The film is one of the saddest films that you can see in your life, and it is of great artistic and aesthetic value because this film narrates the pain of war from the point of view of the defeated and the film tells the story of a young man and his younger sister while they are living the ravages of the Second World War, and unlike the American films that show the side of strength more of this. The film narrates the tragedy with a tongue from the fire of war, to be one of the most prominent films that painted the chapters of the war in Japan from which a devastating expression came out, and the expressions and the amount of feelings will leave you with a quantity of feelings when you finish watching the film"
Rirath_com,"Jun 22, 2003",N/A,"Grave of the Fireflies is a great movie about a boy and his young sister during WW2. It's a rather emotional movie, and it's often called one of the best anti-war movies ever. I don't buy that this movie is at all anti-war. It's much more of a personal experience than anything. This is a story about the human spirit. The film never seems to point fingers or lay blame.First off, this is indeed an extremely good movie. The story is great and the characters are very likable. The Japanese voices are spot on, even the girl. All the parts are well written, and very believable. Nothing seems stretched to the absurd.The art is simply beautiful. Fans of movies such as Kiki's Delivery Service or Mononoke will notice things feel very familiar, due to being these all being from the same studio. The colors range from dark and sad to bright and cheery, sometimes fitting with the mood and other times as a stark contrast to the reality around them.At any rate, it's a really good story and one that's hard to forget. It's well told, it's memorable, it's likable, and it's at times quite sad. If you're looking for something different and serious rather than the normally light-hearted crowd of anime, give this a shot. You won't be disappointed.Rirath_com"
Nabila_T_Antora,"Jun 20, 2018",7/10,"The reviews were great and the movie lived up to its projected image too. However, the effect wore off too soon. Maybe I didn't get as emotionally invested as most people did.The bond between Seita and Setsuko really makes you relish the beauty of love amidst the brutality of the world. All the emotions overwhelmed me from time to time - the sadness, the laughter, the reality, the dreams of a little girl and her brother protecting her with everything he's got. It was all there, just it didn't consume me long enough to leave a mark in my thoughts."
lordbaldrick,"Sep 5, 2020",5/10,I find it incredibly hard to buy in the logic that this is anti-war because Setsuko died a horrible death. None of the other Japanese in the film including the brother himself were malnourished to the point of no return. Setsuko died because of her brothers foolishness and stubbornness. No amount of melodrama is going to change that reality.
electronsexparty,"Jun 10, 2005",10/10,"You'll cry at least once during the course of this film.This somber story of a loving brother and sister trying to survive in a war savaged Japan is beautiful. The siblings situation is hopeless and yet hopeful all at the same moment. Through all the sadness and death there is still a sense of the carefree and innocent. The soft animation makes the movie so much more fantastic.If you are looking for a hack and slash anime, this is not the film for you. However, if you want a mature and beautiful piece of Japanese animation reminiscent of something of Miyazaki's, go rent or buy this film."
jkidd-39359,"Aug 20, 2015",10/10,"To start, let me say that this is one of the most powerfully emotional films I have ever seen. Some people might be turned off by the fairly simplistic animation style, or write it off as a children's movie without really giving it a chance. While I can't speak for everyone, I believe this would be a mistake.I won't put any plot details here, for two reasons. First, there are literally hundreds of other reviews here with that information, if you really want to know, and I believe that films have more impact if you go into them with as little information as possible. But as good as this movie is, I don't think I'll watch it again, at least not for a while. It's so powerful, so utterly affecting on a primal, visceral level, that it's a real ordeal to watch. But don't let that deter you. I believe this is a film everyone should see at least once.The one thing Grave of the Fireflies does better than any other film I've seen is to show the real human cost of war. We all read about World War II in history class, with varying degrees of detail, but reading dry, detached stats in a book about a war that happened before most of us were born is vastly different than seeing the thing like this, up close and personal. It's too easy for us to just see the people on the losing side of our bombing raids as the enemy, and not as real humans that suffer as much or more than we do. That, more than anything else, is what endeared me to this movie. It made me think about things differently, things I was sure I already knew. That's rare in any movie, much less an animated one. So in conclusion, I definitely highly recommend Grave of the Fireflies, but don't make the mistake of thinking it's lighthearted and whimsical just because it's animated. It's heavy, profound, and deeply moving. 10/10"
xiaoli7377,"Aug 27, 2020",9/10,"Note: this review was done while watching the 2012 English language dub of the movie. I do not speak Japanese, and I don't mind watching a dubbed version of an animated film. In my opinion, dubs are worst when viewing a live action film.""Grave of the Fireflies"" (Japanese: ""Hotaru no Haka"") is the story of siblings Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi/Adam Gibbs) and Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi/Emily Neves), who are both struggling to survive the final months of World War II during the American bombing of Japan. They spend time living with their aunt (Akemi Yamaguchi/Marcy Bannor) for a while before her nagging begins to get on Seita's nerves. She feels like Seita is lazy and neglecting his duty to serve the country and fight for what is a doomed cause. Seita is only concerned with the safety and well-being of his sister, as their mother dies in a firebombing during the beginning of the film.Many people mistakenly classify this as an ""anti-war"" movie, but the director, Isao Takahata, has repeatedly stated that it has no such message. This movie is not anti-war any more than it is pro-war, and it is not anti-American any more than it is pro-Japanese. It is deliberately non-political, choosing only to show the human and civilian side to armed conflict. There are no soldier characters in the movie. The only things military at all are the faceless American planes that rain bombs down upon the cities, and a flashback scene of a naval exhibition (shown more in terms as a nostalgic longing for the past in Seita's mind). The only character that shows any concern for the war effort at all is the aforementioned aunt, who mostly just uses it as a source of derision to use against Seita.It's pretty mundane, a lot of the film is spent just showing the interactions and daily life things that happen between the brother and sister. Taking baths, playing together on the beach, cooking food and eating together. The title of the movie becomes pretty symbolic as well. The amount of emotional attachment that the viewer grows for Seita and Setsuko over the span of a ninety minutes long animated film is a remarkable achievement. Don't let its identity as a Japanese children's anime fool you; it will tug at your heartstrings as much as any three hour long Hollywood saga will.This isn't really a complaint lodged at the film itself, as I've never seen the original Japanese version. But some of the English voice acting is a little bit hammy. I wasn't really expecting Oscar-worthy performances from a 2012 dubbing that was put together for a Blu-ray release of the movie, and the voices of Seita and Setsuko aren't bad, but some of the minor characters aren't very good.It's heartbreaking and tragic, and it's one of the most human movies of all time. Check this one off of that watchlist when you get the chance; you won't regret it."
djc-3,"Sep 23, 1999",6/10,"Interesting reversal of conventional civilian war story frequently lapses into melodrama, but is entertaining nonetheless.  Heavy handed symbolism is obvious to even the dullest viewer.  The plot doesn't really make much sense (why would two children endure this much suffering because of pride?) but the atmosphere is great."
goneja,"Jun 9, 2006",10/10,"One of the finest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Also, one of the saddest movies I have seen in my entire life. Not much to say that hasn't been said already, but I love this movie and I remember crying intensely the entire last half-hour. Remains quite neutral in terms of the war, as an American I did not feel 'offended', rather ashamed that this viewpoint is not more largely exposed. This is just one of those films that teaches you the value of human life and the misery that war brings upon innocent children. Quickly entered my theoretical 'top ten' list. May possibly be the best anime movie ever made, not only for it's beautiful animation, but the feelings, emotions, and thoughts that arise from watching it. And every time I watch it, it's always a little sadder than the last time."
workshed,"Feb 17, 2008",5/10,"It seems to me that this is an often over-praised film, mostly due to it's sensitive subject matter.Yes, war is awful, but that does not mean that all movies that deal with war are great films.For example, though there are great themes in Grave Of The Fireflies, the film itself is nothing special  it has average animation, average writing, average everything.Many say, ""but this film is so sad,"" to defend it, but what film involving war isn't? If anything, making a small, overly cute child the main character cheapens the possible impact of the film, making it less believable.There are plenty of better films dealing with the same subject matter."
Gandoon,"Jun 27, 2003",8/10,"To give Hotaru no haka a fair judgement is hard. It is without question one of the best animated films I have ever seen. The way most of the kind of action you would expect in a war movie has been scaled of and replaced by plausible characters and beautiful and powerful scenery, always created so that it seems as if a painter were creating a new masterpiece in every cell, it makes the protagonists lives seem more real than just about any other war depiction I have seen this far. It is quite special in another aspect as well, as it depicts japanese civilians during the second world war I can honestly say that this is the first such film I have seen, a situation I think many can identify with. The fact that the film does not demonise any human beings, not even the enemy, which can only be seen as anonymous bombplanes high up in the sky, but just tells a tragic and timeless story about a boy and his sister and their struggle to survive in wartimes is actually what makes this film a true masterpiece. This will be hard for any western filmmaker to surpass.The summation can only come to this: if you haven't seen Hotaru no haka yet, do it, you will not regret it."
rektruax,"Jan 24, 2010",10/10,"A beautifully told story about the often forgotten victims of war. This picture sticks with you. You'll be tempted throughout to coach and counsel the two main characters, but ultimately it's not your story to tell. It simply takes its course to devastating effect.If you read enough of these reviews, you'll eventually run across the occasional know-it-all with any variety of ""he should have done this or that"" type scenarios. Ignore them. They are no more capable of putting themselves into Seita's position than anyone else. Just enjoy this film for what it is... An absolutely heart wrenching tale of the human condition."
BehzadRezayi7500,"Mar 4, 2019",9/10,"This movie is a masterpiece that shows darkest sides of war, also shows the dark side of humans . a tragedy that never go out of your mind ,hate , anger , sadness ... . The movie is a powerful, touching, magnificent piece of work. Watch it at list once ..."
japhearttok,"Sep 21, 2004",10/10,"Few movies can touch one's being to the core. Its impact was totally unexpected as I watched the film only because it happened to be the other feature in the 2 film-in-1 DVD I purchased. I had absolutely no idea what the film was all about. Now I can't get those profoundly moving scenes, Setsuko's face and voice off my mind. Though the film depleted my energy/vigor at the end, it was a welcomed feeling as it leaves one in touch with one's ""forgotten"" sense of humanity. Or the film heightens it, if it's not forgotten. I was utterly silent, deeply sad, ""devastated"" and brokenhearted when the final credits rolled. I felt both the actual and potential ugliness and beauty of being human all at once. Many films have been existentially moving, but few are as simple, direct though subtle, and as matter-of-factly as ""Grave of the Fireflies"". It's an unforgettable and emotionally ""haunting"" film; beautiful and painful at the same time."
shneur,"Mar 25, 2006",10/10,"I am no fan of animated features, but this film is extraordinary by any standard. The Japanese ""anime"" method doesn't focus on the animation per se, which would be considered ""primitive"" by contemporary American standards, but the scenery and backgrounds themselves are dream-like watercolours, even if many of those dreams in this case would be nightmares. The story is set in Kobe during the Allied firebombing, but the message is transmitted obliquely through the plight of a young student and his little sister who are rendered homeless in the devastated city. In an interview, the creator remarked that it would never enter his mind to use adults for the children's voices, despite the arduous task of guiding a five-year-old girl through the multiple takes required in a full-length film. Always by indirection, this sincerity makes a great impact. Perhaps I'm just a softy old coot, but I'm choked up even writing this review. This is NOT just another movie about WWII."
orangehorizon26,"Oct 27, 2021",9/10,"I've never cried before from a movie, but this one broke me. Grave of the Fireflies is a beautifully animated, emotional movie that shows you how ordinary citizens can suffer during wartime. It's a powerful movie that will change your feelings about war. I'm not sure I'll watch this movie a second time cause it's just so emotionally draining. I recommend seeing it though because it's a finely crafted movie that deserves to be seen."
rogerlio,"Sep 8, 2000",N/A,Grave of the Fireflies is a very sad and thought provoking.  The movie touches on such emotional issues that it is hard not to become involved in the plot and characters.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who can deal with such issues.  This movie is not to be taken likely and but I do think everyone should see it.Roger Hurtado
bigbubbabacon,"Aug 6, 2010",6/10,"I have this belief that there are certain ""rules"" movies are suppose to follow. One of those ""rules"" is the build and release of emotion. It goes back to Hitchcock talking about a bomb being hidden under a desk: We show two people talking while cutting to short shots of the bomb. This builds emotion.But, the bomb can't go off. If the bomb goes off there isn't a release - just an explosion. All of that tension stays built up inside of you.That's my problem with this movie, no matter how gut-wrenching, sad or even realistic it is, it has a fatal flaw. The audience, in my opinion, is never given a moment to release the tension - just an explosion.This movie, following Hitchcock's example, is a series of tension building moments, followed by small, quiet, extremely depressing explosions.But, maybe the intent of the movie was to build emotion/tension and not release it. Maybe that was the point."
brower8,"Jul 2, 2003",9/10,"Grave of the Fireflies, set in Japan during the hellish summer of 1945, tells the story of a boy who takes on the duty of looking out not only for himself but also his toddler sister under some of the most dangerous conditions possible -- a catastrophic war with a horrible famine -- after his mother is killed in an American air raid. There's much work to do, but practically no food.The son does surprisingly well in letting his little sister be a little girl, introducing her to the beauties of nature and the Japanese culture even under the extreme conditions. Two things are lacking -- food and safety. Not all the fireflies are the innocuous insects; some are the small pellets of incendiary thermite that the US Army Air Corps drops upon the wooden buildings that are the norm in Japan.To go further I would have to spoil the movie ending.The animation is excellent, the symbolism is effective, and so far as I can tell, it could only have been an animation. The situation is simply to dangerous for live actors of any age, let alone children, and the destruction necessary to establish the true horror of war and hunger would be violate every ethic. A must-see, a classic anti-war film that puts the lie to the idea that the common Japanese people of World War II were unfeeling automatons who deserved what they got."
GregDexter,"Dec 24, 2004",4/10,"If this had been a live action movie done with the style, acting, and gravitas of, say, ""Schindler's List"", it would deserve a place in the IMDb.com Top 10. And it could have been done that way with very few special effects. But it wasn't, and that's exactly what I find wrong with it. I feel that this was a horrible, horrible choice of material for an animated feature. Shouldn't an animated feature give us what can't be done in live action as movies like ""Spirted Away"", old Disney features, and anything by Pixar so incredibly do? As it was, I could not help but feel the strain as the movie makers tried to turn this into a movie that gets the viewer completely sucked into the emotional aspect of it all. Personally, I got more choked up watching ""Spirited Away"", and for that matter, ""Finding Nemo""!I understand why and how badly people want to like this movie, but for me it didn't work at all. And I find the elevated ratings for it ridiculous. There are much better anime flicks out there than this."
daredevil_81,"Aug 8, 2002",10/10,"Simply one of the most honestly told, beautiful, heart breaking films ever made and it's a shame that this undiscovered gem isn't known throughout the animation realm. Perhaps it's a good thing that Grave of the Fireflies isn't well known because it will be free from the corrupted minds of cheesy Hollywood producers like Jerry Bruckheimer, who would of missed the point of the message entirely and add a brain dead script along with Josh Harnett as Seita. Or George `one trick pony' Lucas who would of used CGI Muppets to play humans, and add Jah Jah Stinks in there `for the kids' that leaves us with a kind of humour that makes us cry in despair. Anyway enough of my moaning.I first stumbled upon Grave of the Fireflies whilst surfing on Amazon for the Princess Mononoke DVD were it popped up on the recommendation list, I was Hooked on the title and the plot. After watching it I was totally not disappointed with what I saw, and was left with a tear in my eye from the sheer power of it all. As you all know properly know that fireflies is set in 1945 Kobe during the closing months of World War 2, The main characters in this film are Seita and Setsuko where their mother dies in the American bombing raids  whilst their father who is a navy officer on the cruiser `The Maya' not knowing if he is alive. They stay with their aunt for awhile who scolds them for being lazy and not doing anything for the war effort, and is reluctant to share rations with Seita and Setsuko. Even though she trades in their goods and their mothers goods to buy food. Eventually they leave and take refuge in a disused bomb shelter where after a few their hunt for foods leads to stealing. The one thing I truly admire about Fireflies doesn't use over dramatic images of destruction during the bombing raids and when Setsuko is grouchy for her mother. My mother loved this film and it reminded her of the Village she lived in, during 1950's Turkey. Where she lived in a very poor family with none of the things we take for granted like electricity and running water, and where kids had to make their own toys e.g. dolls with sticks, rags and cotton wool and playing with insects like dragonflies and fireflies. My mother cried when she saw Seita and Setsuko used fireflies to light up the bomb shelter it reminded her of how her brothers and sisters used to chase fireflies that would enter their room.Grave of the Fireflies is directed by Isao Takahata who was one of the directors of the ever popular TV series of the 1970's Heidi', which became a social phenomenon in Spain and Italy (where in some cases that episodes were repeated due to popular demand) he was also one of the key animators on Hayao Miyazaki's critically acclaimed Princess Mononoke. Ever since I've seen Grave of the Fireflies and Princess Mononoke, I've grown obsessed with anime in particular with Studio Ghibli  which has a great list of films to its name and I'm looking forward on seeing Studio Ghibli's next release Spirited Away which is due to hit British shores. I highly recommend this film and you won't be disappointed. I would like to end this mini review on a quote that sums up the films message and I believe Ecclesiastes put it best: Rejoice, O young man in thy youth'."
jr_isidore,"Jul 21, 2005",10/10,"This movie is about two orphaned siblings (an elder brother and toddler sister) trying to survive in the war torn Japan of the second world war. I think it would be a mistake to call this an anti-war film. Certainly it will pluck some chords in you as to the stupidity and cruelty of war. However, I think this is a film mostly about love, selfless devotion and atonement. The elderly brother who himself is basically also a child, takes the care of his sister into his own hands. He makes some poor decisions. These decisions are very natural given that he is just a naive child, and moreover the proud, somewhat spoiled child of a war officer. The story unfolds very realistically, you just know that everything will spiral down for the lonely children in an unforgiving world, but that the love between them will last.This movie presents the film making art at its best. The story telling, excruciating attention to details, directing, all faultless. I like this film also for the acting, I think it would be impossible for a child do the acting for the Setsuko character (the toddler sister) in a non-anime movie as is done here. She is so natural and real, it is difficult not to be moved. The only flaw I can find with the movie is the musical score. Mostly it is OK, but it could have been better.I am not very familiar with the Japanese culture, but I can say that the film includes some subtle but powerful criticism for the nationalistic fervor which led in that time to the ruin of Japan. You see officers rooting for the emperor in the ashes of a burnt down city full of burned corpses. You see half-starved children still chanting the songs about the proud steel warships of their empire. And you see the same proud children later but this time hurraying for the enemy planes because the bombs they pour are the only way they can feed themselves. Our world needs more films like this.Finally, this is a very moving, deep movie which deserves and needs more than one viewing."
MuatazAbulKhair,"Oct 28, 2013",9/10,"The real meaning of tragedy in an animated film. Your tears will be so close. This is the first time I almost cry in an animated film. The film reveals the catastrophes of wars. The film is influential on all ages.The film opens on September 21, 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, at Sannomiya Station. Here, Seita (清太?), a 14-year-old boy, is seen dying of starvation. Later that night, a janitor digs through his possessions, and finds a candy tin, which he throws away into a nearby field. From the tin spring the spirits of Seita and his younger sister Setsuko (節子?), as well as a cloud of fireflies. Seita's spirit narrates their story alongside an extended flashback to Japan in the final months of World War II, beginning with the firebombing of the city of Kobe in March 16–17, 1945.The flashback begins with a fleet of several hundred American B-29 Superfortress bombers flying overhead. Setsuko and Seita, the two siblings, are left to secure the house and their belongings, allowing their mother, who suffers from a heart condition, to reach a bomb shelter. They are caught off-guard as the bombers begin to drop thousands of incendiary bomblets, which start huge fires that quickly destroy their neighborhood and most of the city. Although they survive unscathed, their mother is caught in the air raid and is horribly burned. She is taken to a makeshift clinic in a school, but dies shortly after. Having nowhere else to go, Setsuko and Seita move in with a distant aunt, who allows them to stay but convinces Seita to sell his mother's kimonos for rice. While living with their relatives, Seita goes out to retrieve leftover supplies he had buried in the ground before the bombing. He gives all of it to his aunt, but hides a small tin of Sakuma fruit drops, which becomes a recurrent icon throughout the film. Their aunt continues to shelter them, but as their food rations continue to shrink due to the war, she becomes increasingly resentful. She openly remarks on how they do nothing to earn the food she cooks.Seita and Setsuko finally decide to leave and move into an abandoned bomb shelter. They release fireflies into the shelter for light. The next day, Setsuko is horrified to find that the insects have all died. She buries them all in a grave, asking why they have to die, and why her mother had to die. What begins as a new lease on life grows grim as they run out of rice, forcing Seita to steal from local farmers and loot homes during air raids. When he is caught, he realizes his desperation and takes an increasingly-ill Setsuko to a doctor, who informs him that Setsuko is suffering from malnutrition but offers no help. In a panic, Seita withdraws all the money remaining in their mother's bank account, but as he leaves the bank, he becomes distraught when he learns from a nearby crowd that Japan has surrendered unconditionally to the Allied Powers. He also learns that his father, captain of the Imperial Japanese Navy heavy cruiser Maya, is probably dead, since nearly all of Japan's navy is now at the bottom of the ocean. He returns to the shelter with large quantities of food, only to find a dying Setsuko hallucinating. Seita hurries to cook, but Setsuko dies shortly thereafter. Seita cremates Setsuko, and puts her ashes in the fruit tin, which he carries with his father's photograph, until his own death from malnutrition in Sannomiya Station a few weeks later.In the film's final sequence, the spirits of Seita and Setsuko are seen healthy, well-dressed and happy as they sit together, surrounded by fireflies. The camera then moves showing the two looking down on the modern city of Kobe."
ignatzb,"Jun 25, 2018",10/10,"This is quite possibly the saddest movie ever made. It is, however, worth seeing once, particularly if you were not involved in your sister's death. I will never watch it again, but I'll set it up for you to run if you stop by some time.It is about a young brother and sister who are made homeless by allied bombing of Japan in WWII. They are taken in by a relative but with times being hard they leave there to strike out for themselves and for a while they get along all right until things get really bad and they get really hungry. At that time, when there is nothing left to do but steal things turn worse and worse.The film pulls no punches about the trials of the children. It's rough."
Boris-57,"Dec 24, 2004",10/10,"Before setting out praising this movie, just a little message to those who (agAIn) ask themselves what the point is of making anime so realistic, since anime is supposed to be used for stuff that can't be done in real film. Well, two replies : a) then anime should be abandoned altogether, because they can pretty much do anything in film by now - ironically, often with special effects that are little more than computer generated anime! b) that remark testifies to, besides an extremely narrow view of what a particular art form can be, a profound lack of respect for anime as a medium equal to plain film. Since, what it's saying is basically ""in specific cases anime is better, but when both art forms can do it, film is always superior"". But there's more. Apparently, none of the folk who put forth that limited view on anime have ever heard of the idea that the more abstract a figure becomes, the easier it becomes to identify with it. So, to spell it out: where a normal film might keep a certain distance between you and the characters, anime characters are more easily generalised and thus identified with.But what about Grave of the Fireflies? Well, to put it plain and simple: if you haven't seen it, you're an utter idiot. I won't tell you what to feel (except in the summary line), but the film's perfect. Pacing, direction, photography, plot, you name it. And it avoids the easiest ""ho let's go for the big emotion"" style. It does go for it, but in a very no-bul**hit way, drawing a straight line and following it.I do like Miyazaki films, but since I bought the Ghibli Box (which did not include Fireflies, as it isn't distributed by Disney outside of Japan, and the box's DVD's come from HK) I must admit that, especially in his later films, Miyazaki tends to go for Big Messages. Instead, the three films by Takahata I've seen thusfar (especially Fireflies and Only Yesterday) are marvels of understatedness. By which I mean, it's more a thing of showing the facts and letting you make up your own mind, rather than chewing your emotional food for you. Not that Miyazaki isn't good, but Takahata has made three of the best Ghibli films. And he's not afraid of showing a darker note in his films, whereas Miyazaki tends to keep his films (except Mononoke) on constant feelgood mode.Anyhow. Required viewing. Just take my word for it. If not that, just do it out of fear for being considered an idiot..."
tamie74,"Apr 3, 2005",9/10,"I am not a film critic and had never reviewed films......But thought i'd put in my two cents......As I was purchasing Spirited Away and Casstle In The Sky...I came across Grave Of The Fireflies.....I knew or heard nothing about this film...In fact, I didn't know much of Isao Takahata's work at all....And being an anime fan....I bought the movie....Finally, I had a chance to watch the film.....and I could not stop crying....Not only because the film was a sad film......but also a heart warming.....when the spirits of the two siblings reunited..... The opening scene gave me the chills and haunted me a little....The last thing I expected was the main character telling me the day and year he had died as an opening line of the movie..... True to its nature that not all manga films are made for the children.....This film is quite realistic.......here we see the lives of two orphans in the closing days of World War II thorough their eyes and how little people care for one another when it comes to wars......and how it affects them.....I am going to buy a copy of this film and send it express post to George W Bush........and ask him to review and rate this film....I grew up with Japaness animation and will murder anyone who does not have an open mind or at least appreciate it for what it is..d(*_*))b.....Please watch this film......"
Yutaro,"Jan 27, 2003",N/A,"I am a Japanese-Canadian and saw this movie in 1990 on a video cassette that was sent to my parents from some of their friends in Japan. I was 18 at the time and thought that I'd sit and enjoy another typical Anime film. Boy was I wrong. This movie tore me apart. So much so that I never wanted to watch another Anime feature again without reading a plot synopsis first.I purchased and viewed the DVD version again yesterday. Even with full knowledge of the outcome and story, it still tore me up. ""Princess Mononoke"" was good. So was ""Akira"" and ""Perfect Blue."" None of those  movies has stuck with me like ""Grave of the Fireflies"" has. It made me realize how lucky I am to have grown up in the place and era that I did. It reminded me of how spoiled we are. We don't need to feel guilty about how lucky we are, but a movie like this makes us appreciate it.There is no good and evil in war. In WWII both sides did their share of evil deeds. ""Grave of the Fireflies"" shows us a human element that extends beyond the soldiers.I will not re-hash the plot since many fellow IMDB members have done so. I will say that the scene that touched me the most was the scene in which Seita pours water into the empty fruit drop container for Setsuko to drink. For some reason that sequence wrentches my gut. At that point I realized that metal container symbolized Setsuko herself and how all that was left were traces of flavors. She is happy in the scene, but that is what makes the scene even more difficult to watch. At least you do have the knowledge that when her spirit is released at the beginning that she is not only reunited with her brother, but with her precious candy as well.It's funny that in the novel that this movie is based on, the metal tin is barely mentioned. Only as a container for Setsuko's cremated ashes. The director made it a point to make it a more important element of the movie.In closing I'd like to say that I highly recommend this movie. However, I'd be emotionally prepared before I do sit and watch this. As one other reviewer said, it is better to watch this with someone so you can discuss it during and afterwards. It does stay with you even if it doesn't tear you up as it did me."
Elfie-5,"Jul 10, 2003",7/10,"The only thing I'd heard about this movie before seeing it was many people saying that it was the saddest movie they've ever seen. I finished watching it about a half an hour ago, and I can only conclude that the people who think so probably don't watch many sad movies.It was very good and even sad, but it was far from the saddest movie I've ever seen. Perhaps it's the first five minutes of the movie that ""ruined"" that element for me. It was made perfectly clear what was going to happen by the end, so expecting it made it less sad. To me, anyway.I guess I'll have to chalk this up to another ""est"" movie- saddest, scariest, funniest- that many have viseral reactions to that I simply don't get."
raven_sc,"Oct 1, 2005",4/10,"Nothing happens. It's just boring.Their entire lives could have been changed if Seita had just, oh you know, done some damn work instead of being a lazy ass. How do people feel sorry for this moron? It's HIS fault his sister died. He's an idiot. The movie was bland, nothing happens, I actually fast-forwarded just to make sure there was credits so I wouldn't have to watch a full hour and a half of the movie.If he really cared so much about her, he would've said sorry to the aunt, and SAVED her.This movie is way too over-rated. I feel duped."
thenekassyni,"Jan 29, 2009",9/10,"I've read most of the negative reviews for this movie and I really pity the members making them. There's just a shear lack of understanding and/or appreciation for what had gone on. As a kid during the same war period I can relate to this story and can understand why these negative reviewers really can't see nor understand why this is happening the way it is.For example, them leaving because of the Aunt. This is a classic case not just in Japan but for many cultures. Her attitude towards them is so disgraceful there is no choice but to leave. Yes, he could have stayed and help his sister out but eventually they will not get any food, water or shelter. Worst yet, they'll get beaten to death simply because the Aunt will choose to support her family instead of her Sisters. That's how evil this scene is without even being told out completely. Viewers don't understand this it seems. Maybe everything needs to be explain for them every step of the way, I've no idea.In fact, my Father, sister and I just started talking for hours the other night about the family's ""travels"" to avoid the war and get the kids to safety and eventually to the US. Let me tell those that don't understand; my Father's sigh from telling the story is a sigh that I will never be able to reproduce. No matter how hard my life has been up until now, it can never compare to what they have gone through and what little I have witnessed during the escape.Honestly, you can't imagine how hard it is until you've been there. Having said that, this movie does a good job at telling it's story. If you're reading the reviews for this movie I hope you consider what I've said. Some people aren't open minded enough to see what is being communicated with the movie and assumes by taking some things too literal, as in the boy not taking up a job. Do yourself a favor and watch the film with an open mind, you'll enjoy it more."
ibbeman-54676,"Apr 4, 2025",10/10,"I do not think a movie has ever made me feel these feelings this movie did.The movie is about a young brother and an even younger sister trying to survive the horrors that come with war.I could go on and on about how simple yet masterfully the animations are but the most important bit about them is how they are able to portray emotions so well in this movie.The score is haunting yet beautiful and fits every scene perfectly.The characters are very realistic even if i do not agree with the brothers actions and what in someway became the consequences I can understand why he did what he did throughout the movieTo put it very blunt it is a movie that simply shows the beauty and horror that humanity is capable off, I am just surprised that this movie has not won more awards because it is one, if not the best piece of media depicting those feelings.I also have to add that Setsuko has to be the cutest character ive ever seen."
Riricokuzgun,"Dec 17, 2025",10/10,"Striking, wounding, heartbreaking. I don't know if watching this movie late at night was the right decision because it completely shattered me. Everything was so sad and so realistic. After it's over, you'll be in for a heartbreak, swollen eyes, and a headache, folks. I was so upset, and even though it's just an anime, these kinds of things unfortunately exist in some parts of the world, and people experience them. It was a painful, heartbreaking story. Watch it, recommend it to others."
UTSHOK-0,"Aug 28, 2025",10/10,"Just heard touching movies.And iThis movie not only highlights the horrors of war but also shows the infinite love of a brother for his sister. Everyone should watch it at least once.Although the setting of this movie is World War II, it sets an example of how all wars destroy the normal life of people.Such creations are rarely seen. Recommended for everyone."
vitalogst,"Jun 10, 2002",10/10,"This film was made with such breathtaking care that I don't expect to see another film that will move me with such intensity. The story line is told with painstaking detail, and that's what makes this movie so poignant, you understand the characters, through the little details, so well, that you cannot help but feel that what you perceive is what these characters are feeling. I literally cried throughout 15 of the films' 90 minute runtime, not just a tear in the eye ""oh that's too bad,"" but sobbing ""OH MY GOD WHY, WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN?!"" I remember a comment kept running through my head, ""this is not fair, it's not fair it had to happen to them, it's not their fault, dammit it's not their fault."" This film is a representation of how good dramatic anime can be, if used correctly. There are no kung fu fights, or mysterious dragons, only reality. Such horrible wonderful reality that one will find that they cannot think about war in the same way as they did before. I know that this was the greatest war movie I have ever seen. It also might just be the greatest film ever. See it, don't walk, run, you must see this film.Brandon Gilbrech"
sohylejain,"Apr 14, 2017",10/10,"This Movie by Studio Ghibli is one of its kind. It is a must watch for all fans of the Studio Ghibli movies. It is also a must watch for every human being irrespective of who they are or what their age is. Just watch it. This Movie should be in every persons bucket list. Try to watch the English dubbed version to live it better. It deals with the story of a brother and sister during Hiroshima and Nagasaki Bombings in Japan. Their story is touching and lovely. You cannot help but cry. Watch it if you love emotional movies. Trust me, it will stay etched in your heart forever."
Mr Parker,"Oct 3, 2003",N/A,"A friend of mine asked me what I wanted for my birthday recently and I asked for a DVD copy of this movie. I had heard a lot about it and was curious to see it. I got around to watching it last night and went to sleep feeling absolutely miserable. This one ranks right up there with those other cartoons that I consider to be sadistic, i.e Charlotte's Web, Watership Down, The Velveteen Rabbit, the one with that Tin Soldier and his girlfriend getting shot to pieces, etc.I'm glad that I saw this movie now at 29 than if I had years ago because it might have caused me emotional damage. To put it bluntly, I strongly recommend that you don't watch this movie if you are anywhere near a good mood because your good mood will be a thing of history after watching this.The story revolves around a young boy and his younger sister, struggling to survive during WWII. They face the threat of air raids constantly. Food is scarce due to strict rationing. The children are hardly given a second look by the other people, including other family members, trying to piece their lives back together. The two children are a joy to watch together. The relationship is sweet and loving, with hardly any bickering between the two. It is perhaps this aspect of the film that made me feel so terrible at the end of the movie. The little sister is so cute that you just can't help but smile when her face lights up with happiness. The older brother tries to carry on, with the weight of their survival on his shoulders and it's heartbreaking to think that any child should be burdened with such a responsibility.I want to cut my review short here, as I don't want to give away too much. I think this film should be watched by all but I warn those of you who haven't seen it to prepare accordingly. I was in tears at the end of the movie but ultimately, I was glad to have finally seen it.Rating: ****1/2 out of *****."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 26, 2023",7/10,"Other than this film and Spirited Away, you would be hard-put to find any Japanese anime worthy of serious discussion for content. Generally speaking, Japanese anime is a collection of boring violence and/or sex, with about as much intellectual content as a Tom and Jerry comic book. These two films, however, rise above the mainstream of the genre. Grave of the Fireflies has a more somber message than Spirited Away, but an important message, nevertheless. The effect of war on children is always a tragic subject for any film, and has been done several times in the past; mostly revealing life among the ruins in Germany, Italy and other countries affected by WW2. This time, we get to see the Japanese carnage among the civilian population; an area seldom explored by Hollywood producers. A good film for children to see as well."
milang-28897,"Feb 17, 2019",10/10,"This movie is beautifully made. It potrays a lot of emotion to the watcher.
It doesn't sugercoat things but presents the spoils of war in its raw form. The characters were amazing.Just watch the movie."
mitja,"Aug 24, 1999",3/10,"This is definitely the worst Ghibli-movie yet, Takahata is certainly no storyteller, he should leave the script to others like in the excellent 'Omoide poroporo'. I feel repulsed at Seita's stupidity and arrogance and how Setsuko gets to suffer from that, and how Takahata tries to force us to feel sorry for him. The ""I'll manage my own even if times are rough""-attitude just doesn't work at wartime."
asrkr,"Sep 16, 2020",10/10,"""Grave of the fireflies"" is undoubtedly the finest anime movie I have ever watched, and it will be the only movie I will never watch again.
As much as I would love to I just cannot bring myself to watch this film again... Never has a movie ever made me cry so much..
it was so depressing"
russ_mike,"Jan 2, 2007",10/10,"Having lived through the 2nd world war in London and subsequently moved around the World, often as Master of some small vessel or the other, I'm not easily moved to emotion. However, this beautiful animation, somehow it had to be an animation, conveys the brutal reality of how we allow ourselves to be controlled by monstrous people. It lets you follow, almost as an unseen intruder into their plight and their brave suffering and spiralling decline. The pathos and poignancy being heightened by the knowledge that it not only happened to hundreds of children in Japan at the time but is still going on, all around the World today. So will it as long as there are dictators, politicians, rulers and military."
mabroukhamzah,"Jan 4, 2018",10/10,"GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES proves a lot of things.one of them is that the animation is not just to the kids but to all ; not just for FANTASY COMEDY but there are more ;the animation critisizes the war by show us the bloody results ;also show us our
Neglecting to orphans.
the movie combinates two important human cases , it is one of the few sad ends that I liked , just because the subject needs a sad end to open our eyes and see that the orphans need us."

loftyraj,"Jun 10, 2025",10/10,"A must watch, though no one can have courage to watch it again. Well, you don't have to watch it again coz no one can possibly forget the gut wrenching feeling and grief that reaches so deep that scares the hell out of you. No one will choose to feel the same again only wish others to experience it once for their own good. The feeling of apathy and helplessness is mind boggling. Changes your perspective towards life. Revolves around war but not a tiny bit political which is amazing thing to achieve. Feels like a really sad dream where you witnessed someone else's life and felt absolutely everything they felt and more. Then you wake up and keep living it continuously for an inordinate amount of time. Absolute must watch."
athena-no-sainto,"Jan 4, 2012",N/A,"GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is one of the most intense,emotional and saddest films I've ever watched but at the same time is one the most brilliants..I truly believe that cinema is the art to create emotions,This jewel does it perfectly telling the story of two orphans, a little girl and his older brother, during world war 2 in japan.The movie shows the cruelty of war not from the eyes of the soldiers but through the eyes of the true victims,that innocent people who becomes the victims of the time they had to live..this movie is also a good example of the quality of Japanese animation, not only as an entertainment but also as a way to touch people's heart and makes you think about life and even makes you change the way you see life- - HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT"
alizohrehkermani-55779,"May 22, 2021",10/10,"The most sad anime i have ever watched
Thank you Akiuki Nosaka."
eldreddsouza,"May 3, 2021",4/10,I don't know what was I thinking. I was not expecting this level of depression. This film is Sad. Sad. It's a simple story about survival in war times. Nothing much. The whole film is about the kid crying and being annoying and her brother trying hard to survive themselves. I was not ready to be this sad. I did not sign up for this level of sadness. But then that's my fault. If you want to be depressed this film is for you.
jgonzart,"Aug 8, 2022",9/10,"Grave of the Fireflies is masterly shown to us through amazing top notch animation that conveys all the emotions of the characters and their struggles to stay together and survive. It shows us another aspect of war, one that gets easily overshadowed by the stories of glory of the soldiers who fight in these wars, but not the impact and suffering on the people who did not ask for these wars, but were forced on them by the men in power. Be prepared to ball your eye's out as your bask in this amazing and unfortunate tale."
meri,"May 27, 2002",10/10,"For those who insist that cartoons of all forms, and particularly anime, are for children, I present you with Grave of the Fireflies. This amazingly well-done anime has some of the most touching, most depressing scenes I've ever seen on a screen, regardless of format.This film is set in Japan near the end of World War 2. Seita and Setsuko live in Kobe with their mother, whom they adore. When the air raid sirens sound, Seita and Setsuko run ahead to the bomb shelter, leaving their mother (who has a heart condition and cannot run) to follow. Seita is obviously not happy with this situation, but the early teen youth cannot carry both his toddler sister and his mother, so he agrees, sure his mother will join them at the shelter.From here begins the long, sad tale of the losses that Seita and Setsuko suffer through together. This is very much the story of a young man forced into the role of provider, protector, and nurturer years ahead of time, and of his little sister who adores him. Seita struggles to provide for himself and for Setsuko, and refuses to surrender himself to despair, regardless of the obstacles he is presented.I feel that this movie is all the more heart-wrenching for the way that the hurt and the pain and the fear are interspersed with the moments of joy and lightheartedness. For much of the movie, it is almost possible to believe that Seita and Setsuko will come out of this together. Of course, since the movie opens with Seita dying, alone, you know that your hope is misplaced, but you want them to survive. The love they share, and the joy they take from one another make you root for them.The characters in Grave of the Fireflies are remarkably well acted. Seita, standing strong, doing whatever is necessary to take care of his little sister. Setsuko is the perfect toddler. Happy one moment, crying the next, unsure of why anything is happening, but sure that Seita can fix everything. The children's aunt, a cold, sarcastic, bitter woman, taking every opportunity to ensure the children, especially Seita, is aware of how much they impose upon her and her patriotic family.In addition to the quality of the story and the caliber of the actors, the beauty of the artwork is just incredible. The facial expressions, the landscapes, the atmosphere. It's all wonderful, drawing you into the story. I found myself checking to see if the prone form of Setsuko was breathing as she lie ill, then realizing that wait, this is animation.This provocative, compelling tragedy is based upon a true story. The original author, Nosaka Akiyuki, wrote a novel based upon his real-life experiences at the end of the war in Japan. This story was then turned into a manga (Japanese comic book), and the story became very popular and well-known.Trivia buffs might be interested in knowing exactly how this movie made it to the screen. A director by the name of Hayao Miyazaki was working on a project named ""My Neighbor Totoro"" but the production company was worried that nobody would be interested in the tale of two little kids and a monster living in rural Japan. Therefore, they decided to make a movie they felt would draw viewers based upon the familiarity of the tale and for the educational value of the story, and make it a double-feature with ""My Neighbor Totoro"", billing and packaging the two movies together. Those who are familiar with both movies find the concept of packaging or viewing the cheery, light-hearted romp that is Totoro with such somber, depressing fare as ""Grave of the Fireflies"" mind-boggling, but the tactic seemed to work, though Totoro has become far more popular and well-known of the two movies.I cannot recommend this movie enough. It is a poignant story of the love shared by a pair of siblings in the worst possible conditions. And you'll never look at fruit drops the same way again."
Zanthulu,"Feb 5, 2017",10/10,"As the summary states, this film is what I would call an immaculate portrayal of innocence and all the emotions that come with it.The film pulls no punches with its stunning realism of the horrors of war and morbid consequences civilians (and more precisely, children) have to go through; experiences that even the coldest and most hardened of men cannot begin to fathom, nor deal with.The fact that Studio Ghibli is behind this might catch some people off guard, as this is in no way a feel-good film.It will rip out a piece of you and leave you feeling hollow.It is an essential film to watch, but not one you'll ever watch more than once."
muge-kuyumcuoglu,"Jan 9, 2022",9/10,"This film scarred me for life. I can't tolerate Japan WWII movies after watching this one. The reality of it all. What a slap of a movie.If you wanna know what war is really like, watch this one. What it really means to be plain people, plain children in lost times, holding on to survival, and the amount of loss it takes to make you let go of that survival, to give up on life. A film about pride, childhood, war, reality (the real).We watched this movie with my 4 year old and my husband. We felt like we were beaten up when it finished. We didn't know what we were getting into when we started. I am still glad we watched it."
rominaguaychacabrera,"Apr 12, 2021",10/10,"I don´t really cry with movies but when it comes to children suffering i cry until i can no more. Little did i know that this film was going to become my biggest weakness. The writer knew exactly what he wanted and in my opinion he achieved it very well. It was short but concrete, sad yet with very happily moments. I hate when movies try to be emotional so they put characters suffering, it´s so obvious that they want the audience to cry but don´t get me wrong GRAVE OF FIREFLIES has the intention with the only difference that is well made, realistic, and it´s not only people complaining about the life they have. Moonlight 2016 for example didn´t give me a message, advice or enjoy. It´s just a guy complaining i know his life is hard but he´s doing nothing to change it, not even trying.The florida project girl also has a messed up childhood yet she´s trying to be happy well that´s movie.GRAVE OF FIREFLIES DID WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO AND IT WAS PERFECT."
morindur,"Jul 22, 2002",N/A,"This film is not recommended for people suffering from depressive fits. Surely you have seen sad movies before, but this one burns through where it hurts most.  This is by far the most bitter, saddest, moving and heart-rending film I've watched so far, and I've seen quite a lot. What can I say?  I scrape the very last rice corn off my bowl cause I can't keep my memories away from one scene.  I see a beggar with outstretched legs at a subway station and I remember the film.  And I see fireflies and weep... This movie is highly recommended to people who still think that war can be ""for the greater good"", could be reasonable, helpful and justified. It can't.  Watch and see."
buckleym-1,"Apr 20, 2003",10/10,"This is no knock on ""The Lion King"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Fantasia"" or ""Snow White and Seven Dwarfs"", but ""Grave of the Fireflies"" has done something very few, if any animated features (I feel) have ever done. The film has an emotional power, which is drawn from its serious topic of war and the human spirit. Plus ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is rich in animated detail and human feeling, which towers this film above most animated films.Perhaps one of animation's few downfalls is its simplicity. Animation for the most part is viewed as a child's medium. There are many reasons for this, but ""Grave of the Fireflies"" proves without a doubt that this is a falsity. Director Isao Takahata shows that animation has all the capabilities of approaching difficult issues (like war and its consequences) with a personal heart and creative touch.The story is about a brother (Seita) and a sister (Setsuko) who deal with a great tragedy and struggle after a bombing during World War II. Yet this film has so many moments of beauty to respond to the moments of horror. The moments of Seita and Setsuko swimming or of Setsuko burying the fireflies are absolutely wonderful in their subtlety. There's not a ton of action going on in those scenes but they're so richly detailed in the animation and narrative that your eyes stay glued to the screen.This film is a testament to the human spirit and living life to the fullest. I will not lie, this film is fairly hard to swallow, it deals with difficult issues. Yet it is because of this challenge that this film stands above about every other animated films. It proves that animation is not just for children, but for everyone. This film made me smile and almost brought me to tears at the same time. ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is truly one of the greatest animated films of all-time. A 10 out of 10."
moritzherz,"Apr 14, 2023",7/10,"Grave of the fireflies is a true Studio Ghibli classic. It's heartbreakingly sad but evenly beautiful to watch. The story is greatly written, you care for the characters and animation is on high standards.This movie is about a boy and his young sister who lost their mother during a bombing attack and now their on their own and have to survive. Their aunt does not want them so they live in a cave. Scenes oike the fireflies-show are amazing. The emotions of the characters are depicted brilliantly by the superb animation, so you feel with them.Studio Ghibli is by far the best anime studio out there and this movie is yet another proof for that. Go watch it."

Sparrow_in_flight,"Nov 20, 2003",10/10,"I just saw this movie for the first time, and wow. First off, it's very well done for an anime film - great art. And second, the storyline can easily be believed.  Wartimes change people, or so I've heard, and so two kids could easily be ignored.It's great, although sad."
anirguha-60-851453,"Mar 12, 2021",9/10,"I came across the name of this movie while reading the book on Great Movies by Roger Ebert. When I watched the movie the experience was like a beautiful dream. Has there been any more lyrical with hard realism portrayed before? This can very easily claim its position amongst the greatest movies ever presented to the likes of All Quiet on the Western Front or Pather Panchali (Song of the Road). The fact that it has not really amazes me. Is it because it's an anime? Or perhaps it's from a country which has not been known beyond Kurosawa, Ozu or Mizoguchi or likes of them?
The beauty of Hora no haka does not lie in the fact that it shows realism. Nor in that it shows the effects of war on common man and thus humane in nature. Nor because it's simplicity as if viewing through the POV of two kids - one in his early teens and his sister who is barely perhaps 5 years old. It's about all of these told in a most poetic way.
The director Isao Takahata's masterstroke is to create an anime instead of a feature film. He perhaps couldn't have depicted the wide range of emotions of the characters, particularly the two children in a better way had it been anything else. The anime has provided the director the complete liberty to portray the feelings in a most telling way, stripped off completely from the physical presence of actors of sets or even the nature itself which can be sometimes distracting.
I have stopped short of giving it a perfect score perhaps because of this only. But through this I have been part of the director's and story teller's imagination, shared the emotions with its players, lamented at their losses, hardships and agony, enthralled by the beauty and openness of the nature; absorbed within the sweetness of its tune.
Few other films have achieved this and few will be able to provide such an immersive and beautiful experience."
De-illusionist,"Aug 14, 2018",N/A,"My mother was not political person.Didn't watch many Animes.
One day,I think in her late 60's,we were watching This movie,I think I wanted to watch because I've read Nosaka Akiyuki's book when I was in Middle School.When whole movie ended,I heard unusual sound.My mother was wailing.Like,Screaming.with,gut wrenching voice.I have never heard My mother cry like that.She was older than Setsuko,younger than Seita.She has Older brother,and younger sisters.She had both parents,but they were always hungry after WWII.With people like my mother,or,Mr.Takahata,Mr.Nosaka,Human memories will fade.I still remember my mother's voice.She was wartime kid like Seita and Setsuko.I hope you watch this movie and imagine what war did and still does to kids."
saadkhan-61833,"May 8, 2021",7/10,This movie is too depressing. I watched it once and could not forget about it and I cannot watch it again as it will always make me feel sad. You need a Brave Heart to Watch this one.
9Mohaja,"Aug 13, 2025",7/10,"Sad and beautiful, but it didn't make much sense. There surely could have been better solutions-at least the girl could have lived in better conditions, and the boy could have gone to work or lived somewhere else. Also, according to the boy himself, they had money, so all that starvation didn't make sense. Still, it's a beautiful film."
aeasmmikey,"Jun 19, 2019",3/10,The american woman who voiced over for the little girl was just terrible. Her voice totally ruined this movie for me; it was just not a good fit
Christopher_Reid,"Oct 10, 2025",10/10,"I watched this movie many years ago with my brother. I couldn't remember much except it was generally sad and felt a bit uneventful and anticlimactic. I decided to finally revisit it and I know think it's one of the greatest films ever made.In a word, I think what sets this movie apart is patience. Most movies keep shifting mood, going from one scene to another, constantly moving and trying to keep you engaged. Some movies are conversely dull or lazy or predictable. Grave of the Fireflies is patient and confident. It has a story, a simple one, and it completely commits to it. It doesn't shy away. It doesn't force things, it doesn't manipulate you. It just observes, takes its time and focuses on what it wants to focus on.I think a lot of people miss the point of this movie entirely. Some think it's an anti-war movie which the original author has explicitly denied. In any case, did you really need convincing that war was bad? Does anybody seriously think war is good? Do people go into this movie thinking ""gosh war is so cool, I can't wait to see this really happy, uplifting war movie""?It's puzzling. Obviously war is bad, but compared to what? Japan didn't have to attack Pearl Harbor and they had every chance to surrender. If America didn't attack, more Chinese people would die. Lots of people died in lots of places. The best way to end war is with war. But that's not what this movie is about. The war is merely the backdrop, not the focus. And such a braindead, obvious message of ""war is bad"" is not the point.The movie is about innocence, strength, kindness and, indirectly, regret. The author of the original story felt guilty about what happened. He felt he didn't do enough for his little sister. Without being there, it's hard to know the truth. Maybe he's being too hard on himself, or maybe he was very selfish and careless. Either way, he's racked with guilt and the story seems to represent what he wished he did.I suppose that's the thing with humans. We're flawed, especially when under duress, but we aspire to be better. Let movies capture that hope. How ironic that one of the most famously sad/depressing movies (this one) is actually a nicer version than what really happened?But that to me is the point. As Bane says, there can be no true despair without hope. What makes this movie powerful is not the scenes of war, of death and destruction. You can find that in documentaries, in books, in photos and footage from the time. You can watch horror movies with all kinds of gore.What this movie focuses on is the innocence of childhood. Simply playing. Laughing, running around, being curious, investigating the world around you. Suddenly feeling hungry or tired. Being impulsive. Being emotional.Both the characters are likeable and pure. The teenage boy Seita is strong and decent. He tries his best and looks after his sister as much as he can. He holds back his emotions and controls them, as much as he can. We admire his strength and character for his age.The little sister Setsuko is cute and adorable. At times she cries and is weak and emotional. But that's normal. She is very happy under the circumstances.Both children are captured in impressive detail. The voices and behaviour feel completely natural and spontaneous. And the movie simply observes them. It's about human beings enjoying life and trying their best despite the circumstances. It's about how life can break you.It's deeply sad. But it's also incredibly uplifting as these characters are inspirational. Most of us go through a tiny fraction of what they do but we complain endlessly. It puts things in perspective. The emotions feel real, not controlled, not designed to elicit any specific reaction. It doesn't feel tedious and it doesn't feel rushed. It doesn't feel perfect. But there's a lot of beauty in the music, the backgrounds, the animation, the voices and the details of the story.It's not all neat and tidy. Like real life, we're not sure where things are going. But few movies are as intimate with their main characters. Few movies capture such deep emotions and experiences humans inevitably go through. And few movies do it with such beauty, patience and attention to detail.The great movies work on multiple levels. They work hard to draw you in. And they linger well after the movie has finished. For me, the main thing which lingers is the haunting image of children having a wonderful time, innocently playing, laughing and exploring in the midst of a horrible, agonising war they don't understand. By juxtaposing the two, it makes them both more intense and profound. But it's not about the war. It's about the kids."
varenik-19247,"Jan 19, 2022",8/10,"A cartoon that shows how difficult it was for everyone, especially for children, during the World War ll. During the entire viewing, I was very worried about the fate of the main characters, as if going through all this difficult path with them. War is a terrible thing and this is clearly shown in this picture."
clubamta,"Mar 4, 2019",10/10,"I Have watched The Grave Of The Fireflies without having an idea about its plot, I just saw it once on social media so I googled it and checked its score and I found it on the Top 250 Movies list, which encouraged me to watch it without reading the plot.When the movie started I thought that's going to treat the world war topic and its social/political effects generally and not on personal situation. I was impressed with the graphics of the movies at first it was so perfect as if it was produced in the 00s, not in the late 80s. The characters were so great and especially the Little Girl, they got her so cute and you'll love her from the begging of the movie and you'll be attached to her.So this isn't like all animated Japanese movies this one has a special thing in it and it will surely have an effect on you personally and make you think about the cruelty of wars.I really advise you to go and watch it and you'll understand what I mean and you'll agree with me with no doubt.Simply Best Animated Movie 10/10 A MASTERPIECE!"
abhishekrp-62521,"Aug 21, 2022",10/10,I Have No Words To Explain How I Feel After Watching This Anime. I Just Crying In The Climax.I Watch Only One Anime Movie Before Watching Hotaru No Haka That was Your Name. I love About Anime Is How They Built The Character. In The End We Feel For Than. No Strong Point No Weak It Just Pure Hearts Movie With The Heart Broken Climax Ever Made In Cinema.
xander_jon,"Oct 9, 2003",N/A,"casualties of war. apocalypse now. platoon. born on the fourth of july. these, among other countless films, pale in comparison to the breadth and emotional power of the grave of the fireflies. and what's even amazing is that it's in animation. i have never seen a film whose camera chooses to show the atrocities of war and the children that are affected by them. what's unique about the film is in its painstaking efforts in letting us see the details of childhood and innocence lost, the quiet moments between siblings, the horrible effects of war. nothing is wasted in this film. a shot of an abandoned pail of water near a well evokes a deep symbolic meaning. we were fortunate enough to have seen this movie during a film festival held in our university. everyone came out in tears. this is not to say that the movie is wretchedly sad, as it also evokes a firmer resolve that something like this should not be permitted to happen. GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is the best war (or anti-war, whatever that means) movie ever made. and i'm glad mr. ebert included this gem in his golden movies."
SAMTHEBESTEST,"May 24, 2020",7/10,"Grave Of The Fireflies (1988) :
Brief Review -A horrible and shivering reality of poverty during World War II. Grave Of The Fireflies brings horrible firing reality of poverty and struggle of livelihood on screen in animated form. There are limits to reciprocation of emotions in animated form of cinema because most of the content looks insensitive and unrealistic. The emotions have to embark in mind to tug a ring in heart but it doesn't happen unless the narrative immerses you into it. If the expressions of actors or real faces & bodies makes you feels it many times and it's natural only, then that thing is lacking here. May be that's why Grave Of The Fireflies looks roughly dramatic even though it had strongly sensitive content. The story of Siblings struggling for livelihood during final phase of World War II in Japan is never gonna look nerveless or weak in any part of the world and any time hence it works here too. The only matter is it comes with lot of cinematic shortcomings and limits. I don't know why this film is taunted as One Of The Greatest Animated Film ever. I would choose other Pixar and Disney Classics over it easily. May be it came much before those Pixar Classics happened and that could be the reason for high appreciation but still the narrative wasn't worthy enough or timeless mania kind of stuff. Overall, Grave Of The Fireflies is a good story blended with Brother and Sister's Love and emotional bond to work high on nerves but there isn't anything like extraordinary or outstanding by any chance.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestesy"
MehdiTaba,"Sep 5, 2022",9/10,"This animation is a masterpiece from Studio Ghibli. Actually the best, as far as I've seen from them.It's really emotional and beautiful, filled with lots of references and symbolicism.Hotaru no Haka, the original title, tried to show the world the real face of the war from the youngster perspective and their suffering and pain.Most of the scenes were absolutely beautiful and could help the message to be digested even by the worst right-wingers.Michio Mamiya did a great job. Film score is something deep in this animation.The way they meticulously picked every scene with delicacy was something rare.The chemistry between this brother and sister is splendid to watch.It's just sad that some people are still after war...8.7/10."
deepakdavid-71727,"Sep 4, 2025",10/10,"This will take you through a rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish. Be bold and watch this movie to the end, IMHO this is Ghibli's best work. Yes, it is sad and does not leave you with that warm fuzzy feeling inside like other Ghibli titles do. This movie hits all the spots to bring the viewer in and keep you engaged and feel genuine emotion for the characters in it. This is a masterpiece and deserves all the accolades it gets."
phydias,"Feb 15, 2009",10/10,"There is a possibility of minor spoilers in the following review, but I didn't tick the box, because I'm not sure if they pose a problem or spoil the movie for you.I have yet to find another anime that is similar to this title. And for the record, that's meant positive. I'm a fan of anime, and I don't care what some might think of that, but this is a movie I recommend to anyone. So to those that hold prejudgments to anime, be it because you really don't like it or because you just don't know better, watch this movie.From start to finish, Hotaru no Haka intrigues everyone that watches it. The opening scene has been criticized a lot, but to me it was done brilliantly. Based on a novel, Isao Takahata had a urgent need for a proper narrator in his film. And when you think about that, you even marvel at the first scenes more, for he has found the perfect way to present the story he is going to tell. Though it is true some scenes were perhaps to long and to sentimental, they didn't bother me. If you were drawn inside the story from the beginning (that is meant to happen), you would barely notice and those scenes would give you some time to reflect about what you just saw.Having seen this with subtitles, I cant say anything about the English voice-actors, but the Japanese have put together a splendid cast in this one. Many inexperienced seiyu have given their all, most notably the youngest (Setsuko) who was but five at the time. But the most important thing in this movie is the story, and the meaning behind it. How difficult is it for humans (let alone teenagers) to swallow their pride? Thats watch it's about. You can easily sympathize with Seita (age +/-13) and you could feel at that very moment you could've done the same. But when you think of it later on; Was it the right choice? Was it OK for him to step outside the system?It is clear where I'm taking this I guess. If you are an anime-fan you should've already watched this. If you aren't watch this and keep possible prejudgment about anime aside, for they do not apply. That said, Grave of the Fireflies manages to present a realistic war-torn Japan in which two children try to survive outside the system. Just the fact that there isn't a single trace of humor (don't confuse it with pity and other emotions) and virtually no violence alone, make this movie worth a view."
ayankhantnp,"Jun 16, 2025",10/10,"The whole movie maintained my attention till the climax, then I cried, went to wash out my tears and continued. Again, I started crying, went to wash my tears and continued. I did this 3 times till the end of the movie, and still I was shocked, thinking this in reality happened with innocent children in Japan and anywhere the war took place.If you have watched Barefoot Gen, then you should watch this.If you're looking for sibling (brother-sister) anime, you should give it a try.The artwork of Studio Ghibli was beautiful as always.The characters were realistic and enjoyable.Everyone will love the series, knowing that it was based on true events."
RareMD,"Dec 5, 2020",10/10,"Before I saw this anime, I had a bad idea about anime and I believe this is the most powerful anime. It's much more powerful and seriously crafted than movies. I would recommend this anime to anyone who has never seen it. This is a master piece anime"
CinemaClown,"Apr 25, 2014",N/A,"A profoundly moving, emotionally devastating & truly heartbreaking tale that'll effortlessly find itself on the list of cinema's greatest tear-jerkers, Grave of the Fireflies is a beautifully crafted story that explores the relationship between two siblings & covers their struggle to survive in the war-torn city of Kobe, Japan during the final months of Second World War.Directed by Isao Takahata, this is his first film under Studio Ghibli production banner, which he co-founded with Hayao Miyazaki, & remains one of the proudest achievements for not only the director or the animation studio but the entire animation genre itself. The dynamics of the brother-sister relationship is beautifully expressed on the screen & voice actors have done a splendid job too in bringing these characters to life.The hand-drawn animation is beautiful, evocative & aesthetically pleasing, the effects of war on civilian life is strongly felt, music is minimal yet eloquent & the manner in which the fate of its main characters is unraveled is so depressing that it'll leave many teary-eyed. On an overall scale, Grave of the Fireflies is an absolutely heartbreaking, haunting & harrowing piece of quality cinema that remains one of Studio Ghibli's most defining works & is powerful enough to rank high amongst other war films too. Highly recommended."
