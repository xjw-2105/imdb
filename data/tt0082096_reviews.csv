rr30re05,"Jan 15, 2005",9/10,"War movies have been biases to one side or the other. This movie does not make hero's or enemies of the German U-boat sailors. Instead, it grips the viewer with realistic depictions of what it was like to be a U-boat sailor for the Gemans in WWII. It starts off with young (17 year old to 25 year old) who have been filled with propaganda about the war effort and glorious battle. After this young crew of immature sailors start to experience the true horrors of war, you can not only see, but experience with them the boredom, laughter, camaraderie, team work and death. In a world where you have no windows, where your ears have to be your eyes, where a cat and mouse game is played and the looser dies, these young men age 10 to 15 years It makes the viewer realize the horror of submarine warfare in WWII. The most realistic war movie I have ever seen."
secondtake,"Dec 19, 2010",8/10,"Das Boot (1981)Widely considered the most impressive submarine movie ever made, I'll go so far as to say it's easily the most accurate that I've seen. The action scenes, the sense of doom, the eerie quiet and then explosive depth charges, the grime and the crowded conditions, all of this is palpable.But more impressive, I think, is how the movie works as a German movie about Germans in a war where the Germans were painted as evil. American movies to this day still glorify and make heroic their roles in WWII (unlike the willingness, at times, to show the problems of Americans involved in Viet Nam, say), especially in the European side. But in movie after movie, the German film industry has confronted the real problem of being aggressors, and of being under the Nazi sway. ""Das Boot"" is typical, and key. The captain goes so far as to openly make fun of the German propaganda coming in on their radio. It isn't just that war is bad, but that the Nazis are bad.Nevertheless, there they are, and they have a job to do, and they're going to do it well. So a small group of men in a small underwater tin can try to survive the boredom as much as the British, who come very close to getting them several times. It's a great movie, one of the best at capturing the feeling of being there.What is less impressive, at times, is the more ordinary character development that seems inevitable in a movie this long--2 ½ to 4 hours depending on the version you have, I saw the long one, the director's cut. I think the acting is superb, and so it's easy to go along with the conversations and interactions, but they aren't always compelling in themselves, more just creating some space before the next conflict arises. Maybe, in some honest sense, this is exactly how it would have been. Life for most people is pretty ordinary.But this movie is not. Or it makes what is ordinary in war--the nostalgic to the profound and deadly--believable, and not simply big and dramatic, which it also is.For full German effect, I suggest seeing it with the original German language track on and subtitles if you need them, though I tested the dubbed version in English and it's really well done. I also suggest, if you have doubts about such an involved war movie, trying to find the older, shorter release. The visuals are not enhanced, but some of the character development sections are left out and I don't think you'll miss them. Then, of course, if you want the whole kit and caboodle, try to find the 5 hour version released in sections for British and German television."
Essex_Rider,"Dec 7, 2020",10/10,"My late father served in the Royal Navy in WWII and was torpedoed by a U Boat, so when I sat with him to watch this in 1986, I fully expected him to be filled with hatred for them. Nothing could have been further from the truth. He told me that seamen, even those on opposite sides, share something unique. He told me that his ship picked up some U Boat survivors from a ramming. They were just ordinary men doing the bidding of their masters, just like he was. They were put down at Scapa Flow as POW's after being at sea for 5 weeks. Many of them had formed friendships with the Royal Navy men, including my father. He formed a friendship with a submariner called Gotz Stiffel and they remained friends until Gotz passed away. My father attended his funeral in Duisburg and he was welcomed as an old friend by the survivors of that U Boat sinking. My father said that film bought tears to his eyes. They were just ordinary men caught up in extraordinary times and this film captured everything from fear to boredom and relief. He said, and I utterly agreed with him this was just about the finest anti-war film ever made."
shmuey barak,"Jul 7, 2000",10/10,"on modern ""boats"" life isn't easy- but compared to the living hell that the German U-Boats were, modern submariners have nothing to complain about. People in certain professions don't like to watch movies about those professions (Doctors and Nurses shy away from hospital dramas, for example). Submarine sailors are different. We love to watch every submarine movie ever made, from ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""Destination: Tokyo"" to ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"" and ""U-571"". Why? Because we can always use a good laugh. For those in the know, submarine movies are usually absolutely hilarious. Except this one. After being in the Navy for four years, serving with around 350 different men, and being acquainted with a further 200-300, all of them submarine sailors, I think that I can state with absolute certainty that this film is the ONLY submarine movie that ALL submariners take seriously. And that is the highest praise a movie like this can possibly get."
susy-7,"Sep 8, 1999",10/10,"Das Boot is not just a great war film: it's a great film period. Maybe it is true that epic themes make the greatest novels and films.  Here is a movie that explores heroism, duty, patriotism, hope, fear and the futility of war--all grand themes--explored in the confined, and collapsing, spaces of a German u-boat.I saw this film when I was a freshman in college during a weekend that I later dubbed my ""depressing movie festival."" (The Wall and Apocalypse Now were the other weekend ""entries."")  Of these films, it was Das Boot that haunted me--when I laid down at night, I saw Jurgen Proctow's pained blue eyes.  When I woke in the morning, I felt as if I were escaping through the hatch of the submarine.  I could not shake the images, and now some fifteen years later, I still remember how completely meaningless the movie made everything seem, and the nihilistic message stayed with me for a long, long time.  How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level.  To say this film is ""powerful"" seems so weak a description.Part of the ""power"" of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction.  So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over-acting, and overblown images.  Too much.  These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level.  Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen.  Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital ""W"".  It is reality, not a grand concept.  The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.Story is a 10, direction is a 10, acting is a 10 and the cinematography is a 10.  One of the all-time greatest films."
keithhallam,"Sep 16, 2005",10/10,"I spent 17 years of my life in Royal Navy submarines. 'T' class, 'A' class and 'R' class. Das Boot is the only submarine movie that shows exactly how it was. It could be a documentary. Bouncing around in the Bay of Biscay with the sea too rough to be able to dive safely and get away from it. 'Goffers' pouring down the conning tower and the control room deck ankle deep in the green stuff. Going down backwards at 500ft and you know there is 10,000ft below you, with seawater pouring in through a burst cooling pipe and one main motor out of action. Existing for two weeks on kai or oxo because your stomach is rebelling against the elements. Laying in your bunk in ultra quiet routine with the sweat just dribbling down. When the sweat starts to dribble upwards you know it's a cockroach crawling up your body. And that Klaxon. 'Hunt for Red October', 'Crimson Tide'. They are just adventure films."
jaywolfenstien,"Apr 1, 2005",N/A,"What impresses me the most about the film, as the title makes apparent, is that it's a German made film about a German U-boat. Patriotism for my own country would tend to make me hate the crew on this ship by definition (especially if portrayed as typical mindless killing machine Nazis), but these characters are so well developed and played like human-beings facing difficult decisions that I find myself sympathizing with these guys.I love the flow and pacing of the Director's Cut; it takes its time, and does not feel like typical Hollywood formula ""first major plot point at minute 12"" cookie-cutter routine. Das Boot gives us plenty of time to know these characters, discover how they kill time while waiting for orders, how they feel about their job and each other. Then when the action finally starts: how they deal with the possibility of dying deep underwater, how they react to the sounds of a sub going deeper than it should, the look on their faces as a destroyer is heard pinging them, and dozens of little personality quirks--subtle details that bring the crew to life. It truly does feel like an epic about a submarine crew, and I'm interested in some day viewing the 6 hour TV version.The underwater battles somewhat remind me of Sergio Leone in that Wolfgang Peterson takes forever and a day to get the fights started. Unlike Leone, once the torpedos are launched and the depth charges dropped, the cat-and-mouse game is ongoing and relentless, but never boring.And despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine, Das Boot is never boring to look at; in fact, it's a visually spectacular film (given the dated special effects, who hold up reasonably well and add to the old-school charm). And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters -- particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war -- it is both haunting and beautiful.Jurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I've ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he's forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.The rest of the cast also delivers amazingly believable performances, and trust me, I could write an entire review on the film's characters and their portrayals. It's both disappointing and satisfying that I'm not given enough space to do so (I wish I could state that about a tenth of the films I've reviewed here on IMDb.) I liked the entire crew of this U-boat, the war correspondent and his character arc as he realizes the truth behind these ""heroes"", the chief and his longing to return to his wife, Johann and the story of his redemption--all well cast, well acted, and believable.Another aspect I adored about Das Boot - the controversial scenes simply rolled by with no more or less emphasis than any other statement the film makes. In fact, I saw the film before really reading anything or researching it and found myself somewhat shocked to hear about these ""talked about"" scenes. Granted, the film does pose some moral questions, but I felt the film handled it with grace and great subtlety, showing what it needs to get the point across and not a step further . . . unlike typical Hollywood where controversy gets bold print, italics, and a highlighter. Maybe I should move to Germany.I can go on for a long while: Over three hours of wonderful visuals and strong performances, a sparse but great score (this film's lack of music is quite appropriate, making the presence of music much more impactful in its key places). Realistic writing from people who lived the experience first hand. As I said, I can go on for awhile but I'll sum it up and end this review with one statement: Das Boot is the definitive submarine movie."
Mike_Wiggins,"Mar 25, 2005",10/10,"While it has been a very long time since I have seen this movie, it is one of the very few that I own. Wolfgang Petersen's magnificent accomplishment in ""Das Boot"" is reiterating the dictum that ""war is hell"", no matter which side you look at it from and no matter where the battlefield is located.*** Minor spoilers ***The plot has been well described by other viewers so I won't rehash it again. But my personal observations, as an ex-submarine sailor, are that Petersen probably portrayed life on board the sub pretty accurately. I say ""probably"" because todays subs are hotels compared with the German U-boats and American submarines. The commonality between yesterday and today is how the crew deals with being closed up in a ""sewer pipe"" for weeks at a time. More importantly, you as a viewer become an invisible crew member as the crew lives in very cramped conditions (American WW2 subs used to be called ""pig boats""), deals with an unfortunately believable political officer, deals with drills, actual torpedo firings, actual ships casualties, and deals, most frighteningly, with retribution from the ""enemy"". My own experience watching the depth charging of the U-boat was such that I was thinking ""stop it, Stop It, STOP IT, STOPITSTOPITSTOPIT...!!!!!"" That's how real it felt to me. For the rest of you, I feel certain you will too be dragged in and know what it is like to live on board a WW2 U-boat.This movie also shows how leadership is so important in keeping the crew (and ultimately the sub) together. Petersen's direction for Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock was masterful because it didn't portray the captain as a god. It showed him as a man who knows how to lead, knows his submarine as if he were married to it (and in many ways he is) but isn't perfect at the job. It also shows that even with great leadership qualities, Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock can not do the job alone: he must have both officers and enlisted men who have the knowledge and skill to not just do their jobs, but to also advise the captain. Petersen also managed to give each member of the crew their own separate personalities instead of the predictable cookie-cutter personalities that Hollywood feels is needed.I could go on and on. So I will close by saying that with the plot, direction, cinematography, acting, sound, music, editing all being top notch, this is one of the few movies that I can truly rate a 10 out of 10. I also preferred the German version with subtitles.------------------------------------I believe that this movie was either the first or one of the first to use Steadicam technology. It was truly amazing for me to see a camera zip its way through a submarine, specifically through the open watertight doors, without a break in the filming. Up until I heard what Steadicam was, I was always wondering how Petersen managed to hide the camera dolly track or the wires the camera hung from.(It turns out I was wrong: ""Bound For Glory"" was the first.)EDIT (12 OCT, 2006): I have been corrected by an observant viewer. Wikipedia has the following comment on what I thought was Steadicam usage:""Most of the interior shots were filmed using a hand-held Arriflex of cinematographer Jost Vacano's design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It had a gyroscope to provide stability, a reinvention of the Steadicam on a smaller scale, so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mock-up. Vacano wore full-body padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mock-up was rocked and shaken.""So, literally, a Steadicam was NOT used in the filming of ""Das Boot"". However, a camera that resembled Steadicam in function (in the way it gyroscopically leveled the filming platform) was used.------------------------------------Even though todays submarines are far cleaner then their predecessors, and we have refrigerators, freezers, air conditioning, are able to take showers, etc., there is one aspect of living in an enclosed space that still lives on: the smell. While the smell of the ""pig boats"" of WW2 was truly atrocious, even with todays ability to clean the atmosphere, you can not escape the fact that any smell that is created, from burned toast in the galley, from the smell of the ""sanitary gasses"" (to be kind), to gasified hydraulic oil and diesel fuel, all these particulates will eventually become absorbed in your clothing. You, as a sailor, may get used to it, but when you get home, your wife will most likely declare that you smell like a submarine and demand that whatever you are wearing get thrown in the wash ... immediately!"
JonDavidCampbell,"Jul 29, 2004",10/10,"""Das Boot"" is a classic. This film couldn't be more intense and emotionally draining. It is a work of genius. Jurgen Prochnaw gives a spectacular performance as the German U-Boat Captain. The acting is first rate as the cast of characters is as realistic and believable as it gets. Don't watch this film unless you are absolutely prepared to immerse yourself into the drama of life as a crewman aboard a German submarine during war. This is a very rare portrayal of battle through the eyes of our enemy and will actually have you cheering for the ""bad guys"" at times. This is a one of a kind movie that must be seen to be believed. Words in a review cannot describe the experience of ""Das Boot."" A tremendous film! A 12 on a scale of 10!"
filipemanuelneto,"Sep 24, 2016",7/10,"This interesting war film shows us a little of what was the daily life of a submarine crew during World War II. As the film is German, not surprisingly, is a German submarine. And tastes good to hear the dialogues in the original tongue, giving more authenticity tho the movie than the English, which most of films used indiscriminately, because of commercial interests.This film is, of all submarine movies, the best I've ever seen. The more realistic and closer to reality, without dramatic contrivances, without the flying imagination of those who have never seen a submarine but has to make a film about it. Its based on a book by Lothar G. Buchheim which, I believe, describes real events. The script reflected this effort, this search for reality. I do not know any of the actors, I am no expert in cinema, but I enjoyed the interpretation of Jürgen Prochnow, the captain, and Klaus Wennemann, who played chief engineer submarine. I will not be very surprised if someone says to me that some footage was shot in a real submarine... whole scenario was thought to detail and it shows how submarines are claustrophobic.Far from the American sensationalism, this European film makes a very interesting picture of a reality that most movies rather fantasize the extreme. It is a proof of how thin can sometimes be the line between documentary and a cinematographic work."
Jamesb_2,"May 28, 2004",10/10,"I first saw this film on the BBC when it was aired in it's mini series format. I was 13 at the time and was totally blown away by it. Up until then, the only war films i had seen were gung-ho movies, with GI's firing tommy guns from the hip at hoardes of evil Nazis.To see a film that showed 'the enemy' as human beings, with hopes, fears and dreams was something else to a 13 yr old kid. As i grew up i began to understand more about the second world war and was able to make up my own mind as to whether the 'evil Nazis' were all that the cinema portrayed them to be, but 'Das Boot' always stuck at the back of my mind as an outstanding example of how to show fighting men, from what ever side, in the best possible way.Lots of people rave about 'Saving Private Ryan' being the ultimate WW2 film. Although good, it isn't a patch on Das Boot. The Boat has everything; Fine actors, an excellent script (which doesn't deviate from the Novel at all) and excellent hand-held camera work, supported by brilliant lighting, and 20 years before 'Private Ryan' too!Das Boot is an excellent example of how to depict the horrors of war without resorting to a blood and gore fest and it remains a film that everyone should see it it's entirity at least once."
Angry_Arguer,"Aug 18, 2003",7/10,"Few movies are as nerve-shattering as Das Boot and, for once, I can recommend the Director's Cut of a movie.  Unlike such foolhardy examples as Terminator 2, the special edition of this movie adds to its overall value. I strongly recommend a minimum of one viewing of it.Sound in Das Boot is a strong factor, the Academy was totally stupid to ignore the level of detail here for E.T.  In submarines, sound is the basis of life and death, no other movie has captured the essence of being stuck in a tin can 500 feet beneath the surface of the ocean.Realism is the second strong point of Das Boot, from the boredom of the hunt (thrill is the exact opposite word to use) to the terror of being hunted.  I found the way the camera is thrust through the bulkheads and hatches, following the crew, to be a strong saving grace in the cinematography department.  Kudos.The crew is presented not in a stereotypical fashion, but as sailors without patriotism and not in the mood for dying or heroism.  There is no glory in war, everything is futile...that's the message of Das Boot.Overall, a superior war movie to others.  Too bad Wolfgang Petersen has fallen into a ""money pit"" with such garbage as In the Line of Fire and Air Force One.  See this instead of U-571.  4 out of 5 stars."
jamiehardy,"Oct 4, 2002",5/10,I have tried watching this movie countless times and despite everything I find myself mentally composing a grocery list or just somewhere else. I cannot stay focused no matter how hard I try.I understand that many people have found this movie to a true cinematic gem but no matter how I try it just loses me about 30 minutes into it. It's obviously just not got the correct hook for me.
caffienated mind,"Apr 18, 2000",N/A,"Das Boot is one of the most emotionally involving movies I have ever seen. The characters are developed richly, without those awkward moments in movies when you realize that the director is doing so.  You sympathize with the crew, and FEEL their plight as they struggle, cramped in a rickety U-boat against the odds.  At times the movie grows slow and drawn out, but that is intentional- to make you feel like you are trapped in an underwater coffin with nothing to do, no where to go.  The directing is great, the sound is fabulous!  I've never heard faint noises tell a story like this before."
st_soulboy,"Oct 16, 2004",10/10,"The first time I saw this film I could not take my eyes from it. I was mesmerized with the transition of a hearty young crew leaving port evolving as the sheer moments of terror (deep under water battles and personal struggles as well as the final scene) lead them all to rethink their actual cause, and their very own mortality (as well as our own in the perils of war!). I can't imagine another film actually displaying what it must have been like to be on one of Nazi Germany's U-boats - young nationalist boys being plucked from their mother's bosom and cast into the claustrophobic iron wolfs in the heat and height of the second world war, who begin to doubt the cause and victory of the fuhrer they've been taught to love and trust. Very colorful, contrasting characters and a script and plot thick with surprises and emotional drama/trauma. Top-notch direction, action, acting and sets. This is perhaps the greatest movie ever made in my opinion. Sorry I couldn't be more specific with the review, there is just too much to cover without spoiling anything for those yet to enjoy it, and thus I just highly recommend it to anybody, not just war movie buffs. I have seen both the regular version and the director's cut (which I own on DVD now) and I must say that the DC is superior. A masterpiece!"
bigkeeko,"Apr 12, 2006",10/10,"If you've never seen this movie then beg, borrow or steal a copy. It'll actually make you admire/feel sympathy for the German Serviceman caught up, in what was the most horrific of wars. Tense, realistic and gripping this one off has yet to be bettered in my opinion. The start doesn't really remind you of a war movie but believe me thats armed forces behaviour all right. As WW2 progressed Hitler drew on ever younger recruits and the historical accuracies are in abundance for a change. This film makes modern junk like the new Pearl harbour look limp wristed.As shocking as the statistics are (30000 out of 40000 never returned) It makes you wonder why so many young men volunteered for the Untersee boot 'Kreigsmarine'. Pride and patriotism counts for everything. Its a 10 out of 10 for me.Don't take my word for it. Watch it."
tammolotz,"Jan 25, 2000",10/10,"Using the term 'authenticity' in connection with any kind of art is rather difficult and daring as well. Sometimes it looks posed or is by certain purposes manipulated. Referring to Petersen´s ""Das Boot"" however, I consider it justified to call it authentic and true. I think this statement can be strengthened mainly by the fact that Lothar Gunther Buchheim was consulted. He composed the novel this breathtaking movie bases on and he himself was employed as a war correspondent in the Second World War.The entire plot has no weak points. Starting at ""Bar Royal"" at the very night before the forces living journey of the submarine crew begins, the director fittingly manages to confront the audience with the protagonists and their way of dealing with the pounding uncertainty. Once put to sea, the character of the scenes changes abruptly. Every member of the crew and the audience as well comes into very close contact with the tightness of the action space. At this point it is necessary to underline the excellent work of the cameramen. The fast and partial hectic cuts draw an exact picture of the drama on board. Too do not forget the outstanding lighting. However besides this abundance of obvious suspense, there are also a number of moments going into in-depth psychology and thoughtfulness. To outline only a few of them: At ""Bar Royal"", when the chief engineer reflects about the uncertain fate of his family, or when the captain, with a kind of 'Weltschmerz' in his eyes, is astound and proud of the unbelievable efforts of the crew. It would probably be too laborious to refer to the decisive symbols the director uses, therefore I recommend this movie to everybody, especially those who are interested in the Second World War.It presumably sounds pretty weird, yet I suppose that mankind gladly participates on the misfortune of others, without being closely involved with it. This closing notion may account for the huge success of this movie.>"
everyones-a-critic,"Mar 24, 2004",10/10,"What can be said about this epic that has not already been said? Peterson has created the grittiest, most realistic war drama ever. It knocks hollywood epics like Saving Private Ryan on their sorry overproduced, oversentimental behinds, it torpedoes other submarine films before they have a chance to shout ""dive!, dive!, dive!"".I first saw this in its original form as a miniseries with english subtitles, and if you can find this version then this should be your first port of call, although the Director's cut I now own is also top notch and doesn't miss much from the series.where to begin? The lurking claustrophobia, the dark humour, the gritty reality of the piece. The excellent acting, the perfect timing, the garotte of suspense tightened with every passing minute in much of the undersea scenes. The lack of any known ""star"" who you know will just save the day and live to tell the tale. The historical accuracy and attention to detail. The lack of a demonised ""other"" figure for the enemy. The lack of any kind of preachy message in the finale other than ""War is Hell"". It has everything you could ask of a TV series or film about the era. 10 out of 10."
ClassicRockFan1,"Sep 11, 2022",6/10,"If you're looking for a realistic submarine movie, this is as close as you're going to get. However, anyone who ranks this as a 10/10 has clearly not seen many movies. The Hunt for Red October is far less realistic, but it's a much better submarine movie and has far more replay value. At least an hour could have been cut from this movie and nothing would have been lost. It's fine, but after seeing it, I have no desire to see it again and I'm only going to give movies 10/10 if I'm willing to watch them again and again.It should also be noted that you'll have to watch subtitles, but most of the dialog is slow so even the slowest readers will be able to follow along without a problem."
claudio_carvalho,"Nov 25, 2017",10/10,"In October 1941, the German Capt.-Lt. Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jürgen Prochnow) of the U-96 U-Boat receives the war correspondent Lt. Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer) to cover the work in the submarine during their mission in the Atlantic Ocean. They sail out of the shipyard La Rochelle and along the next weeks, Werner learns the lives, loves, fear and behavior of the young crew, the veteran Captain and his officers. The skilled captain hunts British vessels to sink and dives to depths below the limit of the boat to escape from the destroyers. Near Christmas, they plan to return to La Rochelle; but out of the blue, Captain Henrich receives an order to cross the Strait of Gibraltar to go to Italy. But the captain knows how protected the area is and plans a means to lure the British Navy. Will the U-96 succeed in crossing the Strait of Gibraltar?""Das Boot"" is a German masterpiece by Wolfgang Petersen with 2h 29 min. The ""Superbit"" director's cut on DVD with one additional hour is a supreme masterpiece of a war (or anti-war) film. It is impressive how a 3h 29 min film is never boring, keeping the viewer on the edge of his or her seat until the very ending. The claustrophobic and tense story increases the drama and the character development in this version, becoming one of the best movies in the cinema history. The German captain, officers and crew are not shown as one-dimension character or sad killing machine like in many war films, but as human beings with families and friends, very efficient in their works but with fear and other feelings. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Barco: Inferno no Mar"" (""The Boat: Hell in the Sea"")"
neilpollock,"Jan 21, 2001",6/10,"There have been many good films examining the useless and barbaric reality of war.  For Cannon Fodder 101 I recommend Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket, as well as The Thin Red Line, Gallipoli, the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, as well as the epic television series by Ken Burns on the American Civil War and the BBC series on The Great War.  Add Dr Strangelove for some light relief.Having just seen Das Boot in 2001 on DVD, I'm very pleased to add it to the list.  What makes this a very good film is: * The depiction of warfare as composing of long periods of boredom and anxiety followed by short bursts of terrifying action.  The Thin Red Line presented similar imagery. * Its reluctance to show people as heroes.  The U-boat crew were well disciplined professionals rather than the individualist risk takers who are so boringly strutted out by Hollywood studios (refer Saving Private Ryan). * Evocation of the claustrophobic world of the submarine which those ""up periscope"" movies of my youth never captured.  [I once started to tour a sub. in Sydney Harbour and just couldn't handle the claustrophobic conditions]. * Attention to the fact that war is a time of rapid technological change. The U-boat war was being lost because the British has developed technologies to better track and destroy them.The film worked well with senses.  I felt I could almost smell the stench of men living in such close proximity; could appreciate the slow asphyxiation of men stalled on the bottom of the sea; the cold wetness of the North Atlantic; the amplification of sound under water; and the limitation of vision from a submarine; the pressure of water on metal at untested depths.It was also good to see Germans as Germans, rather than Nazis.That said I found the ending disappointing (I saw the Director's cut). The final two events stretched credulity. However I understand the book is based on true events.  Perhaps this is a case of truth being stranger than fiction.I read somewhere that 75% of the U-boat men never returned.  This movie shows why."
romac-2,"Apr 21, 2012",10/10,"I come from a family of submariners. My grandfather commanded a sub in the Pacific during WW2, and my dad went on to do nearly 30 years as crew and finally skipper in a nuke hunter/killer. So I kinda know the history of subs 1st hand. This movie pulls no punches and is stunningly accurate. It is a work of genius from one of the greatest directors of our time.I must qualify that by saying PLEASE don't watch the dubbed English version. This film has to be seen in German with subtitles, and you absolutely have to see the director's cut. Three and a half hours of laughter, terror, claustrophobia, tenderness, and finally a sense of the futility of war. It's just brilliant.Jürgen Prochnow has made some good films in his career, but he will never better this performance. He is the epitome of a sub captain. Steely, yet sensitive to his crew. Determined and sometimes rash, but always in control, and the love of his crew for him is clear throughout. Even I would follow him until the end!!I kinda feel bad about praising Jürgen Prochnow so highly because, seriously, this is one of the few movies I've seen where EVERY member of the cast is just perfect. All credit to the casting people. You would not change anyone. Bernd Tauber as the Chief is just awesome. Erwin Leder as Johann is just so right, and Herbert Grönemeyer as the raw reporter who grows up is amazing.This film should be up there with the greatest war movies of all time. Unfortunately, I think because it's told from the German side, it will never get the recognition it truly deserves. Very sad, as it never glorifies Nazism. It's simply a tale of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances - which kinda sums up all wars.Incredible film from an incredible director."
Rick_Terminal,"Sep 8, 2006",10/10,"10/10.8/10 for the cut version.This is a superior war film, and I don't want to add to the reviews praising it. It's one of those films that will make you watch if only you can spare the ten minutes it takes for it to grip you.Being British, I thought it impossible to feel sorry for the U-boat crews, especially after what they did to us - but this film forces you to realise that we are all fragile and emotional (despite what Hitler says).I would recommend people watch the mini-s rather than the film (i.e. German subtitled version) to get the full flavor.As a side note, my grandfather (twice decorated destroyer captain) burst in to tears watching this at two points: One was at Gibralta, the other on the straights :| Says a lot."
Ruskington,"Dec 8, 2020",10/10,"Astounding piece of cinema, presenting the horrors of war in a particular powerful way. Amazing use of colour and tone. Unlike other films in this genre, there is a real sense of humanity. Might well be the greatest film I'll only be able to watch once."
film-critic,"Sep 25, 2004",N/A,"If I had the time to take this movie door-to-door and sit down with everyone in America to watch this film, I would. Everyone needs to realize that I have a fascination with submarine films. I loved The Hunt for Red October and Crimson Tide. Both of them rank as my top action films. I don't know why I love this genre so much. I think it has to do somewhat with my passion for sci-fi. The ocean is almost like fighting in another world. So many times we have seen wars play out on land, and while there is only so much you can show with a land fight, the war field on the open sea allows for so much more creativity.Director Wolfgang Peterson gives us some great characters. While not much dialogue happens in this film, you can see everyone's expressions on their faces, and those expressions tell better stories than words. You can see their fear, their excitement, their sadness, and their power by just the way that Peterson directs them. With his direction, I felt that I was on this U-Boat with the crew. Peterson perfectly portrays a feeling of crampness and claustrophobia wrapped together as one. I think that during one of the bombing scenes I broke a sweat because of what was happening on screen.Finally, I am also a fan of films that tell a different angle on the story. So many years I have watched war movie after war movie that show the victorious American's beating the classic ""evil-doers"". Now don't get me wrong, these are fun sometimes, but I love to see a different angle. In history class we didn't learn about the casualties of the Germans in WWII. We learn about them as a statistic, and never put these heroes on a human level. This film humanizes the German's conditions during the war. The Germans are human being also, who fought for their country just as valiantly as our soldiers did during WWII. They had families, they had pasts, they had homes that they left to become a part of history. To fight for your beliefs. That is what America teaches us, fight for what we believe in....doesn't it?I could talk about this for hours, but instead I am going to sit back, relax, and tell you how wonderful Das Boot was to watch. I have not been this entertained for a long time. Bravo to everyone involved in this film. I think it IS the best war film ever released (that I have seen). I want everyone to get out of their seats this weekend and go rent this movie. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.Grade: ***** out of *****"
AKS-6,"Jun 12, 1999",7/10,"""Das Boot"" is a very intense movie, and it must surely be one of the best ""war films"" that has ever been made. It is claustrophobic and the men in U96 *radiate* fear and fatigue. The acting is great, as is the directing, and Klaus Doldinger's music is among the best I have ever heard. Great film."
yenlo,"May 13, 1999",9/10,When you go to a liquor store to buy Vodka you can purchase one of several brands or you can purchase Stoli. That's what Das Boot is when it comes to Submarine films. You can watch any one of several or you can watch Das Boot. Like Stoli Vodka it's in a class by itself. Superb film either way you see it i.e. subtitles or the dubbed version. See the directors cut if you can. The German crew could be any nationality the film is so well done it doesn't matter. Andy Rooney once said that when you're in a war you live life at 100%. The opening scene of this film demonstrates that. The men are living life at 100%. I never saw any other war movie that captured that like Das Boot.
aviator-287-783530,"Jul 20, 2017",6/10,"I saw this film when I was a freshman in college during a weekend that I later dubbed my ""depressing movie festival."" (The Wall and Apocalypse Now were the other weekend ""entries."") Of these films, it was Das Boot that haunted me--when I laid down at night, I saw Jurgen Proctow's pained blue eyes. When I woke in the morning, I felt as if I were escaping through the hatch of the submarine. I could not shake the images, and now some fifteen years later, I still remember how completely meaningless the movie made everything seem, and the nihilistic message stayed with me for a long, long time. How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level. To say this film is ""powerful"" seems so weak a description.Part of the ""power"" of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction. So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over-acting, and overblown images. Too much. These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level. Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen. Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital ""W"". It is reality, not a grand concept. The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.Story is a 10, direction is a 10, acting is a 10 and the cinematography is a 10. One of the all-time greatest films."
SnoopyStyle,"Dec 21, 2014",9/10,"It's the Autumn of 1941. The German U-boat fleet is starting to suffer heavy losses. The Captain (Jürgen Prochnow) shows Naval war correspondent Lt. Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer) around as his men party while on leave. The Captain is a pragmatic veteran. Some are on the verge of a mental breakdown, others are concerned but all respect their captain. They leave port for the dangerous North Atlantic. After a tough tour, they are redirected to pass through the Strait of Gibraltar and go to Italy.This is one of the first movie to show submarine warfare with gritty realism. The setting is claustrophobic. The characters are compelling and specific. Each of the main actors bring life to their characters. The action scenes are exciting. They hit the audience in the gut. This movie doesn't take a stance on the war other than being as real as possible. There is nothing about the holocaust. There is a general sense of war weariness which is the central message. It shows the futility of war in the best submarine movie up to that point. It can be argued that it has yet to be surpassed."
teenah_mansey,"Aug 12, 2006",10/10,"I am not a fan of war movies. I find that war movies, especially American ones, glorify war and portray those who fight as 'heroes'. The typical war movie simplifies war to a struggle between good and evil, though real war is so much more complex. Das Boot is nothing like the typical war movie. It shows World War II for how it was: horrifying, ruthless, and ill-planned. The U-boat crew are ordinary guys, with lives back home in Germany which they long to return to. They are not heroes, they are men who are afraid and are in the line of duty out of self-preservation and patriotism, not because they are psychotic Nazis. (they're not.) It is a story far more complex that good and evil, it is about human decisions and mistakes, and the complex struggle between one's loyalties and one's nature. Watching Das Boot, you forget that the crew is German, which in Western society we are taught is the 'bad team' of WWII, and see them for what they really were: ordinary men. I loved this movie, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a film that's really about something, without the warm-fuzzies and Hollywood conventions steeped into most movies. It is gripping and consuming, and once you see Das Boot, you're not likely to forget it."
faraaj-1,"Sep 7, 2006",10/10,"Das Boot (The Boat) is film-making at its finest. Not only is this the greatest naval film, it is one of the finest statements on war ever filmed.Jurgen Prochnow is the excellent lead as the Captain of a U-Boat faced with impossible odds. A compassionate man, he is a veteran at the age of 30. His performance really ties the film together and gives it a strong human touch.The tension in this film reminded me of Clouzot's Wages of Fear (especially the last 45 minutes). This is a deeply impacting film because the audience really feels the claustrophobia, the filth, the tension and all the other emotions that the 42 crew members of the U-Boat go through.The sentiments of Das Boot are decidedly anti-war. By showing that it consists of bureaucratic senselessness, German officers living in a fantasy world, the despair of the fighting men - it makes for a touching tale.The director's cut is the version to be seen although it is long. Each scene of the movie is a classic and will show you the realities of war."
baselli,"Apr 3, 2005",10/10,"My two uncles where submariners in the 2nd WW. Both survived, and I had the opportunity to meet the one that was a commander. Although he would not talk much about his experiences, I was able to extract from him his opinion of the TV Mini-Series when it came out. With the exception of the noise levels that crew members made in the movie (for drama purposes) he told me that it was a very faithful depiction of the life and hardships a submariner lived on a U-Boot.I personally have always admired the film because it depicts war without glorifying any of the participants. You are not guided by the director or the plot to identify with any particular character - you can actually relate to many of them, and therefor immerse yourself in the claustrophobic experience they live.Its an excellent piece of film making that combines drama and action into a very powerful anti-war message. Although I personally prefer the original mini-series, the directors cut with its remastered sound is also a great experience."
DICK STEEL,"Oct 31, 2005",10/10,"This is touted as one of the best WWII submarine films of all time, and it's not difficult to understand why. From the story to the cast, from the cinematography to the sound, everything's top notch on this German film directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who's now helming more Hollywood flicks). I'd rate it above U-571, K19: The Widowmaker, Crimson Tide, and The Hunt for Red October.We follow the exploits of the crew of German U-boat U-96, as it gets sent on its mission to destroy Allied convoys. We learn of the frustrations of inaction, having no targets, and living the lonely life aboard a submarine. We experience the claustrophobic environment, one which is shared amongst crew, where maintaining hygiene and tolerable living conditions is of the utmost importance of staying well. We pick up on the fear of the Captain about his inexperienced crew, most of whom were in their early twenties, and haven't seen much action in the high seas.What's gripping in this film is when things start to pick up. Technology those days aren't as advanced, and we see that U-boats are more likely to be sitting ducks when Allied destroyers hover above them on the water's surface, dropping multiple depth charges to rattle and hopefully destroy their underwater prey. The U-boat is the hunter, but once it has hunted, it becomes the prey.And such is the marvellous depiction of Fear in the crew's eyes, as they huddle in silence each time the enemy lurks above. The suspense literally keeps you at the edge of your seat, the silence, deafening. Many set action pieces bring out the different scenarios and challenges that the crew face in their voyage on the seas, and all these capped by the beautiful soundtrack which accompanies each scene. My favourite was the charge through Gilbratar.Although this movie takes on an Axis power's point of view, one can discard the political aspect of this film, and understand that lives on both ends are similar - each are fathers, brothers, husbands, and are thrown into a senseless political war. It doesn't go preachy on who's right and wrong, but touches on more human and basic issues of survival. Boys become men, and it is this transformation that is most obvious throughout the story.If you've got the chance, you must see the Director's Cut, running at about 209 minutes, just as Wolfgang Petersen envisioned it to be. Excellent stuff!"
TxMike,"Nov 6, 1999",N/A,"This is a review of the DVD version of the 1997 ""Das Boot - The Director's Cut"".I remember, in 1981, when this movie came out and received so much acclaim. I didn't see it, mostly because it didn't sound very interesting, and I didn't like watching sub-tilted movies.I still would not have watched it if my neighbor hadn't brought over his DVD and said, ""you have to watch this.""I was overwhelmed.  It is one of the very finest movies I have ever seen (I'm in my 50s), maybe even the very best!  Yes, it is about war.  Set in 1941, it is about the German U-boat fleet.  A statistic shown at the beginning says ""40,000 German men were sent out on U-boats and 30,000 never returned."" This movie is about one of those U-boats, its battles, and the lives of its crew. Two-thirds into the movie the captain says, ""You have to have good men.  Good men, all of them.""  And that's really what this movie is all about.Even though it is almost 3 1/2 hours long, it never becomes dull or boring. Even if you don't like ""war"" movies. It is based on actual events, and will probably make you want to never serve on a submarine! I watched half on successive nights.This DVD is the ""Director's Cut"" which is (we are told in the extra features) almost like a new movie.  All sound tracks were digitally remastered. Scenes were totally re-edited and 60 minutes total were added. New ""foley"" editing was done to provide 8 tracks of sound (down to 6 on the Dolby Digital 5.1 on the DVD).  And, of course, it has both German and English language dialog tracks.  All the main characters came back to work on this movie to dub in their own voices in English, so they look and sound authentic.  You forget very quickly that it is a dubbed version.And the sound!  You'd better have a super subwoofer, because the dynamic range of sound is amazing. Explosions are the most realistic sounding I've heard on a home theater system. And the perfect surround sound balancing makes it seem like you are really in the submarine.Do yourself a big favor - see the new release of ""Das Boot"" if you haven't already."
pietclausen,"Jun 11, 2017",7/10,"I saw Das Boot recently as I don't like watching foreign spoken movies, which spoils the viewing, having to read the subtitles. But I had heard many people praise this movie for it's realism without glorification of war. As the movie is based on true events I finally crossed the line.I got hold of the Director's Cut, the restoration copy, which runs for almost 3½ hours. Indeed it is a very dramatic movie and I am pleased to have seen it. But the extra hour made it too long and the events are stretched out, perhaps to give the viewer a personal apprehension and fear of being trapped whenever the boat was in dire straits. Life was constantly hanging by a thread and you experience this feeling too.The acting was superb, but in this longer version the movie only qualifies for a 7. I feel confident that I would rate it an 8 in the shorter version."
paddingtonoggs,"May 26, 2005",10/10,This film is an absolute piece of art. Unlike so many war films it does not make heros of one side and villains of the other instead it focuses on the the emotions of the crew and how each one goes from being exhilarated in one moment to terrified in the next. The acting is absolutely first class the characters totally believable and although u do not get to completely identify each of them you really do start to imagine what life on board a WWII u-boat in the latter part of the war must have been like. The sense of fear and anxiety is their for u 2 see in the eyes of these sailors whose faces are covered with a mix of sweat and oil The absolute horror on their faces when they test the sub to depths beyond that of the original trials: just gripping! For me at least this is definitely one of the most realistic war-films ever and also probably the best.
monticellomeadow,"Nov 10, 2008",7/10,"I agree with the recent comment that the short version is better. I saw the movie in its theatrical release 27 years ago and enjoyed it immensely - if that can be said about a claustrophobic, depressing submarine movie! I recently rented the DVD director's cut version. It is an hour longer than the theatrical release, coming in at three and a half hours. Too long! The shorter version - itself two and a half hours long - does a superb job in creating that claustrophobic, hopeless atmosphere that infuses the movie. The longer director's cut just makes you want to shout, ""Stop, stop! I get it!"" Actually became a bit boring. If you have an option, go with the shorter theatrical release version.Also, whichever version you watch, do not turn on the English subtitles. They are simply awful! At the start, I had the English-language dubbing AND the English subtitles turned on. I quickly noticed that whoever did the subtitles did a terrible job. They were in a late-20th century vernacular that made no sense for a WW II movie. What you were hearing the actors say and what was in the printed subtitle were substantially different ""interpretations"" of the German. Terrible! I turned the subtitles off and enjoyed the rest of the movie in the English dubbing, only."
dbogosian-1,"Jan 10, 2008",9/10,"I've seen a fair number of war movies, but none can come close to ""Das Boot."" I saw it first in theaters when it was first released, in German with subtitles (great); saw it again in theaters, dubbed in English (awful); and then just saw it on the DVD director's cut with subtitles (excellent). The last was definitely the best.No war movie has ever captured the reality of the soldier's experience like this one. It's a submarine movie, so of course you're going to get the stock scenes of destroyers on the surface, tense men listening to the sonar ping, depth charges, diving deeper and deeper, etc. But it is so much more convincing in this movie than in any other in its genre (""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""The Enemy Below"" come to mind).But don't expect non-stop wall-to-wall action; the realism of the movie comes through in depicting the long periods of time when there was nothing to do: cruising through stormy seas, wandering about with no particular task or mission, the frustrations of the crew after weeks of inaction, etc. As a movie, this presents a problem because the viewer is taken through all that time in somewhat realistic fashion, which in turn makes the film long and not quite as gripping.The real punch of the movie, though, are the characters, their life on board, their hopes for a successful cruise and a return to normalcy. The actors do a fantastic job, all of them, but the captain and the chief engineer are probably the best, along with the journalist on board. The best scene, one which I remembered clearly ever since I first saw it in 1981, was the one where the sub crew goes on board the supply ship at Christmas time; the stark contrast between these rough, slimy, smelly crewmen and the polished, uniform-clad, hair combed and slicked officers on the supply ship, was just phenomenal. To think that some men went through the war in hell like the submariners, while others basically lived like kings, is just too painful to really comprehend.The ending is very creative, very surprising, and emotionally devastating. After seeing Das Boot, I can't ever bring myself to watch any other submarine movie.I give it 9.5/10 stars; just barely on the edge of a perfect 10, but not quite."
ewanmackay1,"Sep 11, 2008",10/10,"There are very few moments that I have this feeling and I got that feeling when I watched this for the first time today. Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, 2001: A Space Odyssey and a few others I get that same feeling from. Being a Brit I never thought I would be willing the Germans on, but this film is so intense and gripping that it had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The music, the acting and the script are all done to my full satisfaction. Its made like no other submarine movie I have ever seen. I've never done a review for a film before but I thought this film deserved it. I put this on my top 10 of greatest films of all time, if not top 5. If you can, watch the directors cut."
ccody-181-941436,"Dec 9, 2014",10/10,"As a former USN anti-submarine warfare operator, I'm always attracted to submarine movies. I can't believe it took me so long to finally see this incredible film. Most sub movies leave me wanting a lot more reality injected into the movie, but not this one. I felt like a crewman on that boat with those sailors and could not turn away for the 3 plus hours it ran. I watched the directors cut, in German with the subtitles, and was so absorbed in the story that it didn't subtract from it one bit.It wasn't political at all and I found myself pulling for these men to make it, to survive. Don't get me wrong, I am as red white and blue as they come, but this movie takes you to the most basic, deepest levels of what it must have been like to serve in the most incredible of circumstances, and I imagine that every sub of that era went through the same things. I didn't see them as Nazi's or the enemy, the film did a magnificent job of just showing them as human beings.I loved everything about this epic and can't wait to watch it with my son, who just got out of the navy after serving 5 years on a fast attack sub. Outstanding job from everyone involved, especially the actor that played the captain, brilliant!"
charlie_bucket,"Jul 8, 2003",10/10,"Yep, seems like almost universal praise here, and there's little else to say, but Das Boot (director's cut) really is that good. Just some of the reasons:1. Jürgen Prochnow put forth an acting performance that qualifies as one of the best ever in any movie, and more than half of it could be found in his facial expressions and quietude alone. Of course, when he lets his emotions loose at certain pivotal moments in the film, the audience is spellbound, and Prochnow commands the scenes of the movie as surely as his character commands the ship and its crew. This character is intricate in the extreme, but almost never overtly so.2. The movie snowballs into one of the most intense and addicting film experiences I've ever come across. At three and 1/2+ hours, it manages to become more and more engaging. There are moments (especially towards the end) where the tempo of the movie is so fine-tuned that one is impelled to stare at the screen and become emotionally fused, as it were, with the plight of the characters.3. Related to #1, the casting for the film was such that personalities came forth in faces alone at times. Secondary characters with few lines are given the benefit of personality and even character development through their actions and faces, combined with the little scrapings of dialogue each of them gets. We almost empirically know what these people are like. Dialogue is very important in this movie, but the physical characteristics of the actors match ALL of the characters' personalities so well here that one suspects that these people aren't acting. And really, that's what it's all about, right? That we should not realize that this is just make-believe? We see funny people, serious people, tired people, uptight people...it all works perfectly well. Great, natural acting by all.4. The steady-cam claustrophobia betrays genuine craft in the direction of this movie. One gets the feeling of a cramped space throughout the film. Likewise, within this small space, there is still room for direction, and the composition of the shots are all superb. Another thing: the film quality is very clean for a movie that was made in 1983, and stands up to today's work well - this movie doesn't really date itself visually, which is a rare thing.5. The story line and dialogue were original and completely realistic. There are few words uttered and few moments in the movie that I wouldn't have believed. It steers clear of some of the gross exaggerations of certain Hollywood-style war films, both in heroic dialogue and also during person-to-person banter while characters are just hanging around off-duty.6. The representation of boredom is an interesting concept in this film, and one that Hollywood is usually uncomfortable with. Here, we see moments where the crew simply sits around doing nothing, and the film, for some of these moments, goes nowhere with them - stalling out in the middle of the ocean. Is this a bad thing? No. It's an objective construction of the boredom of NOT seeing constant action, and the director takes the time to do it right, without blatantly telling the audience, ""ok, the character is bored here. See that? Right. Next scene. Now we're going to make something interesting happen right away"". And you know what? The boredom of the crew is fascinating to behold.7. The set was a masterpiece. A near perfect recreation, and weathered and propped perfectly down to the last detail.8. The music was low-key enough that it didn't intrude on the organic drama going on in the picture. I'm not crazy about the score, but at least it wasn't hitting me over the head every twenty seconds. It is sparse, and incidental sound in general in the re-master was really impressive, and is the real sonic contributor much more so than the music.9. The subject matter is great - a very subjective thing, but aren't U-Boats and the Atlantic War just interesting? I think so. And I'm glad that U-571 isn't the only movie out there about them - because it did absolutely nothing as far as showing what LIVING was like inside of one. 'Das Boot' made this factor absolutely integral to the nature of the movie, and for that, it's unequaled by any war film save perhaps the Finnish movie 'Talvisota'.If you haven't seen it, please do. It's an important and excellent film."
byzantineiconoclast,"Jun 11, 2019",10/10,"Oh, boy, this review is overdue by 25 years or so...I remember watching ""Das Boot"" as a miniseries on TV, back in the beginning of the 80s. My father, a war movie buff, permitted me to watch it with him, even though I was about 8yrs old then- not exactly a suitable series for a young girl - or boy for that matter. Coming from a country which was on the Allied side in WWII, I believe this has to be the first and only film that made us not only cheer for the Germans (up to then our mortal enemies), but also portrayed the Germans as normal people and not as stupid, cardboard villains (a stupid cliche that continues to this day in most WWII films). It's true I didn't have the experience to understand or appreciate everything, but, two things stood out and I remembered them for many years to come. The intense, claustrophobic atmosphere was the first, and Jurgen Prochnow's magnetic blue eyes was the second. These blue eyes haunted me for many years, until finally in my teens, I rediscovered the film and watched it again and again, while at the same time I tried to learn as many things that I could about naval warfare in WWII, in order to have a context which would help me appreciate the story better. And what a story it is...Every soldier in every war goes through hell in various different ways, but I cannot think of a worse fate than slowly suffocating in the bottom of the ocean, inside an iron coffin, while being bombed from above. ""Das Boot"" manages to perfectly portray the terror, the angst, the despair, the triumph, the boredom- the incredible range of emotions which every submariner- most of them young boys in their teens - went through in the course of 1 mission. The foggy, smelly, cramped confines of the submarine become the canvas on which the increasingly pale, skeletal and exhausted sailors are being painted- and no matter how much we root for them (and we DO root for them), we can't help but feel the dread that is bound to follow. We cheer with the crew, we laugh and cry and despair with them, and finally for them. All the aspects of this movie are spectacular. The direction, acting, photography, sets etc. are all top notch. I would like to give special kudos to the soundtrack, which has been my second favorite OST of all times after the Blade Runner one. This movie doesn't glorify war- quite the opposite. I guarantee that after watching this movie, you will want to watch it again and again because it reaches in a deep place inside the human psyche and never lets go. For me, it is one of the very few life-changing movies I have had the privilege to watch. If I could give it more than 10/10, I would."
Blueghost,"Jan 9, 2011",N/A,"I'm jealous because this is probably the best sub film ever made. And I'm jealous that no American studio had the wherewithal to create such a human look at the undersea warriors and the lives they led.The shots are inspired. I don't know what it is, but there's something both commercial and artistically palpable about foreign feature films that beat American gloss hands down. ""Das Boot"" is no different. It differs in one regard from American films about the second World War, no demons are presented. There's a lot of demonization regarding ""the enemy"" in a lot of films depicting military conflict. There is no such effort here. Partly because we're looking at the second world war from the German viewpoint. But we're not seeing Nazi German soldiers fight for the ""Fatherland"". We're seeing people like you and me ordered to fight for a cause they're not all that sure about, but are duty bound to execute it to the best of their ability.There's no waving of flags in this film. None, other than that of the human spirit. The men involved are there to survive as they carry out their orders. The horrors of what the Nationalistic Socialist regime are doing to labeled undesirables in their home land is not on their minds. They either don't know or are focused on other matters.We see the lives of submariners. They happen to be German, but they are submariners none the less. The dangers of fire, pressure, power outages, smoke, gas, flooding, are all palpable in this film. So much that you're there sweating it out with them. You feel for them as they make a run for the sea or for home. They too feel for their victims. They steel their hearts, but you know they're more than uneasy about the task at hand, much less the ""cause"" for which they fight.The cinematography on board the sub is excellent. You feel the the non- spacious confines of their world of steel, valves, pipes and gauges. And when things go bad, you're there with them.Now, on the negative side, and I'm sorry to turn a somewhat serious and sombre review slightly comical, but there's one exterior SFX shot that bugs the hell out of me :-) It's a POV shot from the German U-boats bridge looking at another U-boat. The footage used for the background plate is recycled over and over again. To me this states that whoever was in charge didn't have the budget to get in contact with us here in California to sex up the visuals for that sequence. In terms of the drama it's functional, and the visuals don't collide too badly with that same drama. Yet there it is.The one draw-back is that it's awfully long. So much that you actually need to flip the DVD to see the rest of the film. In this regards it is a bit of a labor to watch.I don't care who you are, if you must see a submarine film, then see this one.Definitely not to be missed.Enjoy!"
Vartiainen,"Oct 29, 2018",6/10,"A German war film about a particular U-boat and its crew on yet another patrol mission as the Battle for Atlantic rages on. The movie has been praised for its historical accuracy, especially in building and designing the actual submarine. Thousands of photos and a couple actual U-boat captains were used to make the filming set as realistic as possible, down to the very last nut and bolt.And it shows. The inside shots within the boat are amazingly claustrophobic, especially the initial establishing scenes. The narrow hallways only allow a single man to move at a time, most of the bunk beds are shared, one of the bathrooms is filled to the ceiling with supplies, there's foodstuff hanging from every available hook and protrusion simply because there's no other room left to store it and so on.And this claustrophobia and tension extends to the rest of the movie as well. I was only able to lay my hands on the original theatrical cut, and that has some really slow and tension-filled scenes as well as the submarine creaks and groans under bombardment, but I believe that the proper way to enjoy this movie to its fullest is to find the TV mini series or the director's cut, which are both much longer and take their time with the atmosphere, the silence and the tension.The theatrical cut isn't bad either, if that's all you can find, but you can kind of see that it is not the full story and the plot is very bare bones."
Jackrum36,"Sep 3, 2005",10/10,"all i can say is..i love this film...this movie and others like Stalingrad, cross of iron and downfall, to name a few, are more entertaining and ""gritty"" than all the pro alliance Gung-ho for America movies that have been churned out since the end of the second world war. i say this not as a political point but as an honest opinion...how many times can you sit and watch America/england with America take the beaches etc... the Germans were in the war too... my granddad even said that a bridge too far wasn't realistic and he WAS THERE IN ARNHAM. all the political correctness seems to have overridden the basic truth in movies, if it is based on real events then make it real... Das Boot gave you the claustrophobic feeling of being in a 1940's Uboat in the north sea/Atlantic ocean, hunting whilst being hunted.the acting is suburb and the tension between the actors at times is brilliant. truly capturing what it might have been like in the sub.i would recommend this movie to anyone. regardless of their movie reference."
RonellSowes,"Feb 1, 2023",5/10,"There's a number of different cuts of this film floating around and it's hard to say which is best, especially if you haven't seen them all but the shortest is probably too little and the longest is certainly too much. What makes this a good film and yet a fairly boring movie are many of the same components. It strives to replicate the confined, gruelling monotony of being on one of these subs and it does so effectively but it also places the viewer in that unideal situation to share. However you're ultimately still watching a movie and probably most concerned about drama which despite the authenticity and compelling performances is still spare in Das Boot."
auff-1,"Mar 20, 2006",10/10,"I watched this movie for the first time on DVD, at home alone and with headphones on.I was gripping the edge of the chair during the tense underwater scenes, I felt I was aboard the U- boat . A sure sign of a great movie is when the viewer feels a part of it. The whole cast were believable, as were the characters they portrayed. A definite 10/10 movie. I preferred the sub titles to the dubbed voices concept,as the film is shown and heard as it was meant to be. Director Wolfgang Petersen takes us through a fantastic journey,giving us an insight into the fun, fears and general life aboard a German submarine during the second world war. The films ironic ending tops off the tragic reality of war,regardless of what side you were on."
heaven-heaven,"Feb 18, 2006",10/10,"(There may be some elements in this review which constitute plot-spoilers). I saw the full length ""Director's Cut"" and thank god it wasn't the dubbed version. This film has to be seen in its full length to be fully appreciated as a true masterpiece and dubbing only serves to take away some of the impact of the dialogue.The director handles matters from an entirely balanced view and shows the submariners aboard the u-boat as being both heroes and cowards as they swing from hunters to hunted. There is one scene where the captain views a convoy from a distance and almost leisurely takes aim and sinks boats with a callous and cold professionalism. One can't help feeling that the men in the u-boat are firing upon defenceless victims who have no chance of defending themselves, but moments later, the u-boat is under what seems like an immediate attack from a destroyer and suddenly the hunters become the prey. As the movie progresses it is hard not to feel sympathetic towards the crew of the u-boat and it is almost impossible not to see them as victims.The film ultimately stands as a bold and brilliantly crafted portrayal of the futility of war. There is one discussion between the captain and his second in command which I can remember quite vividly. The captain explains that the u-boat cannot be sunk by the sea which is an obvious expression of the fact that the boat is designed to dive and surface at will, but his comment from the captain also implies that although the sea cannot sink the submarine, everything that the enemy has at their disposal is designed to hunt down and destroy the u-boat.If you are a fan of submarine films and there are lots of them (Red October and Crimson Tide - to name but a few) then you should seriously consider watching Das Boot. It lacks the gloss and glamour of other films of this type and concentrates on the hardship of the crew and the almost squalid conditions in which they are forced to live.The end is one of the most powerful scenes in any war movie and points to the fact that in the end everything that men do in war is pointless and without any honour or heroism. At the end of the movie I thought ""what was the point in any of that"", and then it hit me that that was precisely the reaction the director was after.By the way, U-boat stands for: ""under sea boat"" and I don't know how true it is, but I heard that one of the full size models used in Das Boot was used again in Raiders Of The Lost Arc."
pv2b,"Jun 28, 2003",10/10,"I just watched this movie on television here, not having seen it, but having it on my list of movies I should see should I ever stumble over them.All I can say is... WOAH.An excellent war film portraying the horrors of war from the point of view of the real soldiers struggling to survive, not to triumph.Highly recommended. I'm going to have to buy this film on DVD and watch it again, unprofaned by any commercial breaks."
addicott,"Mar 8, 2008",10/10,"When movies are at their best, they can take the viewer completely into a different world. Watching this movie again, I felt very much transported.It seems unfair to call this a submarine movie because it is so much better rendered than any other offering from that genre. Das Boot transcends all the necessary clichés and tells an amazing story in an incredibly convincing way. In this rare instance, the writers understand that the truth is plenty fascinating, with no need for exaggerated action or melodrama.Technically, this film is a marvel. The camera work is astounding, most of it done hand-held in a real submarine environment where it's hard enough to move, let alone shoot a movie. What special effects there are blend in so seamlessly, it's hard to imagine how they could have made this picture without putting the cast in harm's way.It's a delight to see the director's cut which feels very natural in its pacing. There are long, slow sections which are not boring to watch, but they effectively illustrate what the crew has to endure as they wait weeks on end for some real action. When the action finally comes, the buildup is tremendous. Few movies match Das Boot's dynamic range.All the technical and dramatic devices are in perfect harmony with the human element. One quickly forgets how this crew is fighting for Hitler's Third Reich. They're really just a bunch of kids, lead by a jaded captain. Their ordeal becomes so severe, it's impossible not to have sympathy for them. Because of this, Das Boot should be ranked among the very best of all war films."
lee_eisenberg,"Mar 14, 2006",10/10,"Probably the main reason that ""Das Boot"" is so great is because it shows that the men in the submarine aren't really Nazis: they were just drafted. But once the submarine dives, then the suspense sets in. Capt. Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jurgen Prochnow) leads his men on a voyage of adventure and terror alike. As the viewer, you feel like you're in the submarine, getting attacked from all sides. Rarely do you see the kind of intensity that you see in this movie. Overall, it makes us question the idea of who's good and who's bad in wartime. It's widely agreed that the Axis Powers were the bad guys in WWII, but the men here don't hold Nazi ideology; we sympathize with them every step of the way. A great movie."
fendril,"Sep 25, 2000",N/A,"Das Boot is one of the best anti-war movies ever to have left the mind of any director. The chilly feeling of suspense along with the boredom felt with the men trapped in the cigar-like can, is the marking of this great movie. Sadly enough only the Director's Cut is available for us ""fanatics"". The original mini-series is nowhere to be found and that is a tragedy as it contains at least 10 - 20 minutes more material that only adds to the incredible depth of the characters. Jürgen Prochnow has never been seen better as the Captain, who commands the boat with a stern hand, and his not quite so well hidden distaste for ""Der Führer""."
darthevil3791,"Nov 2, 2006",10/10,"Ten out of ten does not describe this film, it is more like fifteen out of ten. If you haven't seen this movie, you must! I saw it a few years ago, and the whole thing completely blew me away. The film is about a German reporter who travels on board a Nazi U-Boat to live with the German crew for a few months. (Note: The Film was filmed in German; watch it in German with subtitles. Its so much better and more realistic.) The sub is cramped, and the crew endures multiple hardships and problems as they travel through the seas during WWII. You are brought in to see the war from their point of view, you're not seeing it from the English, not from the US, you see it as a Nazi, which is quite an accomplishment for a film because the Nazis are nowadays normally frowned upon and disliked. You become attached to the crew, and you can almost feel the poor conditions of the sub as you watch. And then there's the end, which you make you run out of your living room screaming. Yes, it's that good. And I'm surprised that this film isn't as talked about as much or receives as much attention as other big films do such as Titanic. And in my opinion, it's far better. Now go to your movie store, or your Blockbuster, and get it, and watch it. You won't be disappointed."
weirdquark,"Jul 4, 2022",6/10,"This could easily have been 9 stars. It gets knocked down to a 6 because it's just Way. Too. Repetitive.The long beginning is fine. It nicely sets up the world and the characters. The ending is also fine - there's a clear story progression with some nice buildups, tensions, problem-solving, and resolution. The problem is the excruciatingly long middle section where you're essentially watching the SAME DAMN SCENE over & over again for about 2 hours. Yes, it was an excellent, tense, nail-biting scene... the first time. Even the second time. But it kept repeating. Again. And Again.I'm always reminded of the dictum that there's a big difference between PORTRAYING boredom and BEING boring. In the same spirit, there's a difference between portraying the oppressive monotony of constant danger, and simply being oppressively monotonous.Storytelling and Real Life are two very different things and they follow very different rules. In storytelling, if you're gonna repeat something 5, 6, 7 times, you'd better have a real good reason for it. Being ""realistic"" does not, by itself, make a good film. Real Life is often excruciatingly repetitive and boring and seemingly pointless. Cinema should not be."
marcello-scattolini,"Nov 8, 2013",4/10,"If you are looking for great movie in any artistic aspect, forget this one! Das boot is tedious. Boring, boring, boring... It looks like the same scene was repeated over and over again. It's almost an eternal déjà vu. Bad taste, awful acting, couple of pseudo-mysterious ""visages"" filmed and poor storyline. Even if you consider its historic value is unbelievably flat and void. I've already seen thousands of documentaries much more interesting than this movie. Hope I save you the two hours I have wasted. Try something like Inglorious Bastards, Saving Private Ryan, or whatever, because this movie my dear readers, is unbearable. I would rather run endlessly instead of watching it again."
lutefisk,"Aug 24, 2000",10/10,"Quite simply the best war film ever made. Das Boot nearly got made in the United States, with Robert Redford (!) in the starring role as the submarine's captain. Thank goodness it didn't; instead it went to a German production company with the then largely unknown Wolfgang Petersen and Jurgen Prochnow directing and starring respectively.Petersen brings an obsessive level of detail to the screen, recreating the U-boat down to quite literally the last rivet and creating an extraordinary sense of claustrophobia - I've never experienced anything quite like it in the cinema. The effect is greatly enhanced by the sound, which is up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"" in terms of convincing you that you're in the middle of a battle. It really has to be experienced in a cinema, although you might get away with using a really good sound system at home (get the DVD Director's Cut version for this).Even more remarkable is the cast. Prochnow is the highlight, of course, as the quietly heroic captain of the boat. But the rest of the cast - largely stage actors appearing on screen for the first time, or complete unknowns - are equally remarkable: Erwin Leder (in his first appearance on screen) is a standout as the veteran Chief Engineer, Johann, who faces a crisis of courage when the boat comes under attack. There really isn't a single performance that you can fault.So is there anything actually *wrong* with Das Boot? Some of the external shots are distinctly unconvincing, quite obviously being of model ships and projected backdrops. (Blame that on film technology circa 1981). The film does have a tendency to drag a bit in a few places - the section where the crew go ashore in Vigo is a case in point. Above all, steer well clear of the dubbed version, even though the dubbing into English is done by many of the original cast - this is a film which absolutely must be seen in the original German (with subtitles).However, these are minor quibbles when the rest of the film is so good. There are very few films that I would instantly rate a 10, but this is one of them."
Sgt_Pepper1102,"Feb 22, 2006",10/10,"It is an excellent film.I saw it the first time in Germany and I've seen it a lot of more times,even though it is a very long film. This kind of films prove that movies can also be made outside of Hollywood. It is a piece of art , more than a commercial movie,and that is what makes Petersen such a good director in this film.I felt I was at that submarine together with those heroic sailors. It's true that they were fighting for the wrong side,but that was the real war.Those men were human beings trying to survive in a war they couldn't understand,but they fought for their country,families and honor. I never saw such a realistic war film.The closest was Saving Private Ryan.Also Prochnow was great and the rest of the cast,too. Congratulations to Wolfgang Petersen!!!!"
aherdofbeautifulwildponies,"Feb 2, 2021",10/10,"I suspect that, prior to Das Boot (1981), I had only seen a single West German film: the magical fantasy The NeverEnding Story (1984). Very different in their nature, the two productions nevertheless have the same writer and director, Wolfgang Petersen.Das Boot is an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Lothar-Günther Buchheim, who served on a German submarine as a military correspondent in late 1941. Upon its publication in 1973, the book was a bestseller, becoming the most popular World War II account in the country. The engrossing fictionalised memoir was destined for a cinematic adaptation, but it would take two failed Hollywood attempts until production finally began in Munich in 1979, led by Petersen.While we did not get Robert Redford or Paul Newman as the Captain of U-96 (both had been considered for the part), moving the project from America to Germany provided the authenticity that would be the film's signature trait. Das Boot can be used as a direct historical reference - such was the painstaking precision of its design. The film was shot over a course of a year, with the actors gradually growing their beards, not seeing the sun, and living in conditions much like those inhabited by their characters. The sets were faithfully constructed with the use of Buchheim's photographs, and verisimilitude was sought anywhere you could find it.Das Boot owes no small part of its reputation to the credibility of its visuals, but there is much more to it. The acting - especially by Jürgen Prochnow, Herbert Grönemeyer, and Klaus Wennemann in what is, arguably, the three main parts. The ever-mounting, unbearable tension; the bravoure of the hunter; the silence kept by the prey. The claustrophobic nature of the environment and the comraderie, both forced and genuine, play their parts. As Leutnant Werner (Wennemann) gets more used to the boat and the crew, so do we. By the end of the film, there is enough shared history that emotions are stirred regardless of which side you are on.Buchheim criticised the film adaptation of his novel for its lack of anti-war sentiment. I have not read the book, so this opinion is not born out of comparison - but you cannot reach the finale of Das Boot without feeling that war is evil, despair, and meaningless cruelty.The director's cut of Das Boot, its preferred version, is 208 minutes long; and much like with Apocalypse Now (1979), the picture's duration contributes to its emotional impact. Exhaustion on screen is felt by the audience, and there is a sense of loss when it's over."
AdamKey,"Jun 11, 2003",10/10,"As a former US Navy STS3 (third class submarine sonar tech) I remain convinced (along with the other ""bubbleheads"" who have posted here) that ""Das Boot"" is to date, far and away the best ""submarine film"" ever. Unlike this one, most films of this genre are not true ""submarine films,"" but either dramas, comedies or political thrillers where the submarine is a mere prop, a backdrop.In ""Das Boot,"" the characters are well developed and subtly varied, and the camaraderie among is not forced or self-conscious, but is simple and straightforward and flows from the shared experiences of being underway and in close quarters. The submarine itself is the main character, the entire crew ""becomes"" the sub and all action and meaning follows from that. Moreover, the differences between the captain and the ""Number 1"" (executive officer) character are quite believable, #1 almost satirically but perfectly reflected as the-insufferably-ambitious-jerk-who-is-already-planning-his-post -military-political-campaign.Juergen Prochnow's character as the captain is quite compelling. His moody and long stares, economy of words and the pensive air surrounding him him coexist well within his firm and able but low-key leadership style. The sea and its awesome power and wonder mean more to him than anything and his humility (and his humanity) seems in large part drawn from his seafaring experience which long predates the war.The air of pervasive fatalism that surrounds the U96 no matter what happens touches well upon a little recognized fact that the German Kriegsmarine (Navy) was, in contrast to the other branches of the German military in WWII, all but ignored; this disdain stemming largely from Hitler's utter lack of serious knowledge or interest in the role of sea power in warfare.Hence, the U96's enemy is not really the Royal Navy's destroyers or patrol planes, rather it is its own command in Berlin under whose orders it ostensibly operates, and, at a deeper level, the power of an unforgiving sea and each sailor's own fears. The captain's anger over not receiving any orders, his vocal ridicule of Hermann Goering and his blank, almost contemptuous stares at the small photo of Admiral Karl Doenitz are thus all quite in character. The U96 and the other boats have been, for all practical purposes, mere pesky details the Fuehrer has already written off and so the physical isolation of the U96 crew is thus compounded with a very real sense of abandonment, not even allowed the simple victory of mere survival, which makes the sailors' tragic fate that much more poignant.Although I am no film critic, I get the impression that the director (Wolfgang Petersen) had a great appreciation and knowledge of the cinematic techniques of Akira Kurosawa as well as of Russian filmmakers like Andrei Tarkovsky and of great familiarity with classic English war dramas like ""Sink the Bismarck."" His Kurosawa-like portrayal of the often baffling nature of human behavior in various situations, the Russian literary theme of the individual facing the colossal power of nature (in this case, the sea) and the meticulous attention to detail, continuity and realistic characterization representing the best of British cinema are all apparent here."
richardokagbue,"Jul 17, 2001",10/10,"Writer-Director Wolfgang Peterson proves that he knows how to do his stuff. Forget Saving Private Ryan. This, along with Platoon and Apocalypse Now, are the ultimate war movies of all time. Superb direction from Peterson, almost impossible cinematography, great editing and sound design make this movie awesome. Made on a small budget of just $15m, Peterson insisted that he would film entirely inside a U-boat so that the entire cast and crew would get the real feeling of living in a U-boat. The results - the best war movie ever made. 11 out of 10!"
latinmelkor,"Mar 14, 2021",6/10,"I have little to say about Das Boot. It is an incredibly acted film, with a simple but empathetic and touching story. The ending is brutal and apotheosic. The effects are stylish and elegant, even to this day the film looks very well done: the submarine, the exteriors, the explosions, the floods, absolutely everything looks real. The only problem for me was that the version I watched is too long: more than three and a half hours. That's too much for a movie in which not much happens, not much dialogue revolves around a plot, and it happens in nearly one location. Maybe if I had watched the two and a half hour version it would have been easier to enjoy, but even though I'm used to movies that run longer than 160 minutes, this one didn't suit the length. I got bored and even felt drowsy. Nevertheless, it is a very good movie and one of a kind."
thinker1691,"May 24, 2007",9/10,"Wolfgang Peterson, wrote and directed this superb film of submarine life during World War II. When first seen by an American audience, reactions were mixed. Halfway into the film, the German crew begins to exhibit some universal traits which touch the heart of anyone fighting for a cause. Gone is the reason why the seamen are fighting often-times an unseen enemy. The reasons are replaced by a plethora of dangerous and certainly dramatic events which allow an audience to see the life and death struggle of all veterans. The visual heart of this unusual movie, is that of an experienced German Captain (Jürgen Prochnow) who sails the Atlantic, meeting both friend and foe alike. With him are his aids, Lt. Henrich (Lehmann-Willenbrock), Herbert Grönemeyer as Lt. Werner and Klaus Wennemann who is superior as Chief Engineer. When they realize the war is nearly over, they head for home. Unfortunately they are spotted, targeted and attacked by the English navy. Now comes some heart-pounding action as most of the crew expect to die before reaching home. Seen from the perspective of an American audience, one expects the inevitable. Yet, from the audience point of view, one can not help but sympathize for the Captain and his valiant crew. A Great film indeed. ****"
JuguAbraham,"Aug 23, 2001",7/10,"I was amused that many found this a brilliant film. It is at best an above-average film.As an anti-war film, this one pales in comparison to The Thin Red Line.I am a great admirer of Wolfgang Petersen, the director. His previous German films ""Black and White like Days and Night"" and ""the Consequence"" are far superior both in content and treatment to this film, especially the former on a chessplayer. Petersen has never been able to surpass his achievements in these early German films.In the domain of acting, was this Jurgen Prochnow's best film? Certainly not, if you compare it to his work in Hauff's ""Brutalization of Franz Blum"" and Petersen's ""The consequence.""What else is so exceptional about this film? The realism? Most East European movies had portrayed better realism than ""Das Boot"" in the Seventies and Eighties. Of course, it stands tall when you compare its realism with most Hollywood war movies of the Eighties and Seventies...I do not for a moment infer that the effort of the filmmakers was not laudable. It was. But the product is definitely not a masterpiece."
hmpulham,"Jan 18, 2005",4/10,"""Das Boot"" or ""Das Boat"" is a gritty saga about a German submarine during World War II. The director strives to show the claustrophobic conditions that the crew had to endure -- crammed as they were, into what one feels is basically a floating coffin. There is no doubt that care went into to the making of this film. The weakest part, however, is the script. One never feels that the writing rises to much more than going through the motions. This is certainly not a bad film, but I didn't like the directors ""fetish for footage"" (the shooting length) while the constant repetition of similar scenes begins to ware thin over time. Another criticism I would make, isthe film's finality is pretty well telegraphed -- you kind of know how it will end. On a positive note, one is left with no illusions that war is glamorous. I would say a superior i.e, more entertaining war film about a German U-boat is ""The Enemy Below."" Check that out!"
Stibbert,"Dec 28, 2005",10/10,"I watched the 216 minutes Director's Cut and I must say that even if it lasted for over 3 hours it was not boring.Das Boot takes place on a German sub during World War 2. It follows the crew of 43 young men who sets sail in fall, 1941. A war correspondent is among them. He is to go with them and write a newspaper article about the life on a sub. A life he soon discover, along with the rest of the crew, is nothing like portrayed by Nazi propaganda.This film tells a good, strong and emotional story. It does not tell the tale oft a sub, but it tells the tale of the people aboard that sub. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. It is a strong and well written story and it makes a strong film.The acting is good. I watched the English version so I got the German accent, but that didn't bother me. Not as long as the acting in it self is as good as it is.The film-makers have done a great job when it comes to creating a mood in this film. Excellent lightning, great sound-editing and good production design should be given credit for that. The narrow, claustrophobic set along with the lightning creates a really tense and dramatic setting. The use of sound and score reinforce this. They know when to use music and when to use silence. The active use of the ""biping"" noise is excellent.In other words great cinematography and sound work. The score is also very nice. It has a couple of themes. The music in it self is good and they make good use of them.To me Das Boot is a must see classic. It's definitely one of the best war movies. It has humanity, sympathy and realism all over it. It's long, but don't let that scare you. It's definitely worth your time!"
perica-43151,"Jul 20, 2018",10/10,"This anti war movie comes from Germany, that has had to learn the anti war lesson well, though they seem to be forgetting it recently. But this is a powerful movie, true classic and a must see movie."
dr_foreman,"May 24, 2007",9/10,"""Das Boot"" is an excellent drama...and it's also more terrifying than virtually every horror film I've ever seen. The dark, dirty, claustrophobic environment of the submarine is something out of a nightmare. Even the sound effects are scary - the boom of the depth charges, the groaning of the hull under pressure, the ""ping!"" of bursting bolts, etc. etc. The images, the sounds, and the charged performances of the actors work together beautifully to create the illusion that fifty men are fighting for their lives in an amazing but fragile piece of machinery.But the film is more than just an intense sensory experience - it's also an unusually well-written, antiwar character piece. While some of the sub's crew members are inevitably underdeveloped (in the director's cut version, anyway), most of them are interesting and memorable. Actor Jurgen Prochnow is fantastic as the cynical captain, who still fights hard even though he's clearly lost his faith in the Nazi regime. Herbert Grönemeyer is pretty good as the war correspondent, who starts as an outsider but gradually blends in with the veteran crew. The other standout character, for me, is Johann (Erwin Leder), who has one of the most gaunt and frightening faces in movie history.Speaking of the crew, some critics have complained that the film is far too sympathetic to them, since the Germans were the universally recognized bad guys of World War II. But, while I believe that Nazi Germany was the most despicable state in human history, I don't necessarily feel that every German who served in its armed forces was despicable. In other words, I simply have no problem sympathizing with the German characters in this movie. They're common fighters, not policy-makers; you can't blame them for Hitler's doings any more than you can blame the average contemporary American for George W. Bush's Middle East policies.The other common criticism of the film is that it's a little too long, too slow, too repetitive, whatever. I can understand why some people might be bored by ""Das Boot,"" but of course director Peterson actively tried to make parts of the film slow in order to simulate the tedium of daily life on a submarine. (Similarly, ""The French Connection"" depicts surveillance as a tedious and time-consuming business, and risks becoming tedious itself). Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, if you're mentally prepared for a long and tough viewing experience, then these aspects of ""Das Boot"" should not annoy you. If you want an action submarine movie, then by all means rent something cute and inoffensive like ""Crimson Tide""!Perhaps the one real weakness of ""Das Boot"" is that it utilizes dated model effects. The models draw you out of the realism a bit - you may find yourself wondering who turned off ""Das Boot"" and put on ""Godzilla"" instead - but, for the time, they look fine (I could point to several equivalently lame model shots in ""Star Wars,"" for instance, but that would be blasphemy.) Anyway, the effects are certainly respectable enough to earn our (slight) indulgence.There are really no problems with this movie, then - it's one of those ""just about perfect"" films. It's not pleasant to watch, and in fact I put off seeing it for years because I knew it would be really intense. But, if you're in the mood, ""Das Boot"" is a rare visceral and intellectual treat. War movies really don't get any better."
CinemaClown,"Mar 23, 2018",N/A,"A sheer masterpiece of unrelenting terror that makes impeccable use of its claustrophobic atmosphere, nerve-wracking tension & nail-biting suspense to deliver a World War II epic that's still unsurpassed in the authenticity of its tension & realism, Das Boot is a naval adventure unlike anything seen on film before or since. A masterwork of pristine craftsmanship that's as refined in the storytelling department as it is flawless in its technical execution, this quintessential submarine film isn't just one of the greatest films ever made but is arguably the very pinnacle of German cinema."
FRANKDRAFTING,"Dec 4, 2006",10/10,"I find the most intriguing aspect of this movie is the way, no matter where you are from, you end up pulling for these guys and hope they make it. I am not a veteran of any war, and not old enough for WW2, but my dad fought against the Axis and they were his mortal enemies, but this movie shows how young boys are just the cannon fodder of wars, while the men who started it were the real enemy, the real evil. These were kids that just wanted a lady at their side and a bottle of booze with them, as were all soldiers from any army. We, America, Great Britain, France etc., fought the Nazis, not Germany, not the people, certainly not the kids. I actually was saddened by the British raid at the end of the movie, even though Britain was an ally and to this day one of my country's closest friends. A great many of the soldiers and seamen, on both sides, weren't good guys or bad guys, just brave kids who did what they were told to do. One day maybe the men who start these things will end up in a cramped, stinking U-boat, and see first hand what their actions lead to. Anyway, I can't believe how much I pulled for ""the enemy""."

egelhof,"May 20, 2001",10/10,"From the director who brought us Air Force One, In the Line of Fire, and the Perfect Storm; this is definitely his best work of all.  Hands down. Carried by the performance of Jürgen Prochnow. This is perhaps the best war movie ever made.  I recommend the German version- even if you do not like subtitles it is worth it.  While the dubbed version is very well done, you still lose something when you take out the live German voices. A true masterpiece.  I showed this movie to an American WWII Navy Veteran, and he said that it was the most realistic portrayal of submarine warfare he had ever seen.  This from a man who was on a PT Boat in the same area part of the movie takes place.  This is a must see for anyone.  It shows the war from an entirely different perspective and it is very effective."
johnatyim,"Jul 14, 2006",10/10,"Hey,This film here is incredible for it's time to say the least. I own the director's cut DVD-9 and what an upgrade compared to the VHS with all the extras. Jurgen always does a fine job as a lead actor, most of the crew on aboard the U-boat are relative unknown German actors at that time in '81, I must say they really did a fine job on making the suspense and the overall feeling really real. I mean, if you have a 5.1 surround sound stereo in your house, you feel the adrenaline, the sound of depth charges hitting the water, the stress and anxiety of the crew. In a word, awesome ! This movie isn't just for WWII war fanatics alone. It a good movie about people working together under an unbelievable amount of stress."
Hitchcoc,"Mar 30, 2006",9/10,"In this superb drama, we get into the lives of the crew of a German submarine. It is a small submarine, and their individual lives are melded into the claustrophobic constricted world in which they live. Every action has a reaction. Everything is done with the knowledge that a single slip up will lead to their destruction. They face a series of death defying maneuvers and escapes, losing a little of themselves whenever they survive. The war is the enemy, and these men would have meant nothing to those in power. As with most wars, we redefine the value of human life and put others ahead of the common man. The terror of each moment, each challenge, is magnified. They probably don't know what it is for except someone has told them it is important.I will not spoil the conclusion, but I will say that it is apt and arbitrary, just as their lives have been. This is a really effective film because it doesn't allow the audience to relax for even a moment. When it's over, we want out as much as the guys on the boat."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Sep 20, 2023",10/10,"A journalist accompanies a German U-boat team, who are engaged in The Battle of The Atlantic. The Submarine is ordered to venture into the waters of Gibraltar, and discover the strength of The British fleet.When I think of the greatest films from the 1980's, I can think of so many, but up there as one of the best, is Das Boot, even if you're not a great lover of war films, you will probably love it, almost fifty years on, it is still a captivating watch.I just finished watching The Director's cut, which ran for approximately three and a half hours, all I can say, is that every single minute of it had me totally entertained. I found it easier to watch it dubbed into English, but there's is no denying that this film is better in its original German language.One thing this film has in abundance, is atmosphere, you get a true sense of claustrophobic, you can almost feel the staleness of the air, and smell the dank atmosphere, it truly looks and feels realistic. Hard to imagine what life must have been like on board a submarine, crabs, mouldy bread and sweaty socks, it must have been diabolical.What I have always found so incredible about this film, is the consideration of who's side am I on, we're seeing the story from a Nazi point of view, but we get to learn that these were ordinary men, with an ordinary Captain, it really is interesting to question who you're rooting for.The camera work is incredible, it almost has a real time feel about it, all I can say is that the cameraman must have been fit. There are some stunning shots throughout, it is a glorious looking film. The shots set against the horizon look amazing.The acting is first class, I can't pick out a single performance, as I think the collective cast are impeccable.It remains, and will forever be a tremendous film.10/10."
damianphelps,"Feb 14, 2021",8/10,Das Boot has a mighty reputation and it was nearly 40 years after its release date that I finally watched the movie.I was amazed at the fact that not only did it live up to expectations but it also didn't suffer from aging elements.This is a great story about being human under incredibly trying conditions. Filled with engrossing characters and full to the brim of tension you can really feel any empathy for those in the water.You don't need to be a war movie fan (although it helps) to enjoy Das Boot :)
ScanlonPJ,"Dec 31, 2008",10/10,"I find it difficult to put into words just how good this film is. I really don't think there is any part that lets it down. Sound, acting, direction, script  it's all right up there with the best.Put aside an evening, telephone on answering machine, tell your friends not to call that night  it is a film that deserves to be watched, not talked through. Get the directors cut version, set to German with subtitles (I really don't think it is as good in English). And just watch it!And the quote that sums the film up, actors, film crew, them all ""You have to have good men. Good men, all of them."""
Wuchakk,"Sep 17, 2020",7/10,"During WW2, the German submarine U-96 (with Jürgen Prochnow as the captain) leaves the French harbor of La Rochelle for war adventures & misfortunes in the North Atlantic when they're eventually commissioned to go through the Strait of Gibraltar. The men experience the challenging claustrophobic life of serving on a U-boat with its highs and lows. Who will make it back alive?""Das Boot"" (1981) is a well done accounting of what it was like to live on a U-boat in WW2 - the claustrophobic living conditions, boredom, filth, sheer terror and... no women. One great scene is when the submarine surfaces after torpedoing a couple ships in a British convoy; it's like hell came to Earth.The flick focuses on the Germans in the restricted spaces of the U-boat and it's amazing that a compelling film can be made from that limited dramatic angle. While this is a war picture, it doesn't glorify war. It's ""anti-war"" simply by showing the way it was for sub-mariners.The film runs 2 hours, 29 minutes, and was shot in North Sea near Heligoland; the Atlantic Ocean; La Rochelle, France; and Bavaria, Germany.GRADE: B"
marc_daniels,"Feb 26, 2015",10/10,"This is one of the few. One of the very few war films that actually capture the essence of what it is like being a man involved in conflict.Few war films today actually show us true human beings. These new age war films are too busy trying to be flashy with explosions and guns going off everywhere. Not to mention the use of practical effects is a lost art. Most films are just digitizing elements in. You lose feeling and perspective. Most war films today do not take the time to show us character development, or give us a chance to relate to the people we are about to embark on a great journey with.DAS BOOT is not one of those films. Possibly one of the greatest films ever made. Make sure you watch the extended directors cut. It is a sad reflection on what some of the U boat crews had to endure out in the Atlantic ocean, fighting a war they were losing support for. A chilling film that I have watched time and time again, and I always enjoy.There should be more films like this. Sadly, it is not a commercial film and the masses of today would find it slow and boring.If your attention span is that of a 5 year old on a sugar high, skip this film, it's intelligence and brilliance will be lost on you. But if you are one for character development and seeing what emotional stresses and obstacles real human characters face during war, this is for you."
idontknowiknowthatidontknow,"Sep 10, 2010",1/10,"I had to watch this film along with U-571 for a world history class report back in 2001. I checked out this film at my local library. It was three VHS tapes. I don't remember much about the film. I do remember it was very boring and trite. I remember it went into detail about the submariners' lives during the war and many dark shots of the submarine during the night. Other than that, I don't remember anything else. I didn't just rate this film a low score because it was meticulous and long. Many films of the kind can be good if they provide an interesting plot, story or something that makes the picture stand out in one's mind other than tedious boredom. For example I thought the movie Heat was boring for the most part, but there was a major scene in the movie that saved it completely: the bank robbery scene. That scene was probably one of the most intense and expertly executed action sequences I have ever seen. Another example is The American. It was another pretty boring movie except for a scene in the middle and its devastating ending. Those two scenes, and especially the ending, not only salvaged the movie, but took it to a completely new height. However this movie in my memory had just a documentary type bore throughout. I have to say I'm not sure if I paid attention throughout the whole movie, and I probably have to watch it again just to make sure about my opinion. Anyways, I remember watching U-571, another submarine movie, and it was a lot better. Not just because of the action sequences but because it was actually a thrilling ride. I felt as if I was one of the crew members on board. I don't understand why so many people have such a high opinion of this movie, but I will be sure to review the movie again just to make sure.0/5"
larajac,"Sep 19, 2012",10/10,"I saw this film in a theater when it was a recent release, 1982. Was so impressed by the realism that afterward I wrote to a friend: ""It makes Star Wars look like a Porky Pig cartoon!"" But seriously, the U-boats were a major danger to allied shipping, and American and British sailors cursed at them. Das Boot shows the German side of the story with the crewmen cursing in German (with English subtitles) at the destroyers overhead. The German sailors were shown as regular people bravely doing their best in very difficult situations, not as mindless, fanatical Nazis like a cheesy American film might portray them. The cinematography was excellent, really made me feel like was in sub with them. Thankfully it wasn't in smellovision."
AllNewSux,"Jun 8, 2015",10/10,"First of all let me say watch the 209 minute ""Director's Cut"" and watch it in German with subtitles or it won't have the same impact. This film will challenge how much tension you can take. You will endlessly think ""when will the depth charges stop"", ""when will they stop sinking"", ""when will the boat stop leaking"". I swear that the claustrophobic nature of the film will make you feel like you are actually in the submarine. You can smell the stink of unwashed men and rotting fruit. You will feel the sweat and the salt water all over. This film is so amazing that it is interactive. You don't just watch the film, you become part of it. All of the exciting parts seem endless and Wolfgang Petersen uses the slower parts so you can get to know the characters. You see their fear, their excitement, their pride and their insanity. He does this so you actually side with the enemy. You realize these boys have no ideologies driving them to war. They don't have any love for Adolf Hitler. They are just doing what they are told to do because they are good soldiers who love their homeland. The ending is unsatisfying no matter who you side with. The reason this is done is because Petersen wants to show us that in war there are no winners...only losers."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Sep 16, 2009",10/10,"I haven't read the novel, so I base this upon the Director's Cut, which is the only release I have watched. Yes, it's three hours and fifteen minutes long. And let me tell you, it is completely worth it. The development of character and build-up of atmosphere and mood are among the best ever seen in this medium. You care about the entire crew, and they have varied personalities and every last one of them is credible. Including a reporter lets them occasionally explain something the audience needs to understand without it standing out, and apart from that, he is also someone you feel for. There are no good or bad guys in this, there are only *people*. Human beings. And you experience the terror that actual submarine crews did, as well as the filth and the claustrophobia. All without any of it getting excessive. This is intense and extremely well-paced. It manages to not overwhelm the audience to the point of over-stimulation. You don't merely witness how little room they have to move around, how two men cannot pass each other at certain parts lest they both squeeze up against the wall and move sideways, you *experience* it. If you are not OK with closed spaces, you may not want to take your chances with a viewing of this. It's exceptionally well-shot, from start to finish. The authenticity is astonishing. I understand that this really happened, and is a combination of two true stories. Exposition is delivered smoothly, and this is well-told all the way. There is occasional humor, to lighten the tension slightly. I don't want to risk giving too much plot away, so this is all I will reveal: This follows a group of young men, inexperienced rookies, on their first mission on a sub, under a veteran captain. This is well-made all the way, and it was the perfect decision to do it almost completely in sequence. The sound design is amazing, in a class of its own. Every acting performance is flawless, and it's no wonder that Prochnow got several American roles after this came out. The DVD offers a dub in English(by the same cast, I understand), though I chose to hear the original German. It also contains a trailer, a six minute featurette of sorts, about the DC edition, and a subtitled, highly informational and also fun commentary track with Wolfgang, Jürgen and Ortwin Freyermuth who produced this version of the film. This has relatively infrequent strong language and is disturbing, sometimes violent and bloody, and most definitely not for the faint of heart. I recommend this to anyone who likes anti-war movies. Unquestionably Petersen's greatest achievement. 10/10"
Faisal_Flamingo,"Nov 15, 2006",10/10,"This movie is a breaking point at Wolfgang Peterson's career .. it gave him a guaranteed 1st class ticket to Hollywood.whatever I say will never do this movie justice but I'll give it a try anyway.The acting was wonderful . especially by Jürgen Prochnow ..Watching this timeless masterpiece .. bringing WW2 to life is amazing .. how realistic can movies be? This movie captures even the spirit of WW2 .. Hitler .. The Third Reich .. everything.Germans built the best submarines in the world .. so, no wonder that they made the best submarine movie.This movie is lengthy but enjoyable & exciting.The music is wonderful.What else can I say? .. it is a masterpiece! .. two thumbs up! ..Just watch it .. you wont regret it."
cleansweep1sc,"Feb 17, 2005",10/10,"When I heard that a German WW2 story was being filmed I wondered how they would portray themselves....This was one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen...you feel as if YOU are part of the crew, you will live or die in a small steel cylinder around 100 feet long. This movie takes the books antiwar bend and uses it to probe the heart and soul of each of us who see this film.... As many of us no know first hand there are no real hero's on any side just men doing what has been asked of them... In this movie these ""nasty vile Natzis"" turn out to be mostly just human beings trying to survive as we were back then. WAR IS HELL.......a living breathing hell that you shall carry along with you the rest of your days on earth. This film pulls no punches it speaks right to you....""We are humans to we have the right to survive and live a life"" Both myself and most all I know were deeply moored by this film see it in German first ( English subtitles) then try the English version.... This is a war action story that is as great a anti-war story as was All Quiet on the Western Front! May GOD someday bless us all with a time without war and bloody conflict."
costashuber,"Jan 9, 2015",10/10,"This is a magnificent film. There are no words to describe the feelings you have after the end. I was astonished, shocked and left with a bitter taste of what the War really was. A waste of souls and lives of too many young people. These people had dreams, ambitions, hopes that are gloriously reflected in this film. All those virtues are shattered under the burden of the job they do. It does not matter that the story is narrated from the side of Germany. The same is true for the troops of every side.Everything, direction, acting, sound effects and editing, musicis perfect and in tune in this movie. There are no loose ends here. The viewer immediately gets in the shoes of the Captain. The most enigmatic and dramatic figure of the film greatly acted by Jurgen Prochnow. He is a soldier and always knows what his job is, but inside him he also knows that this job is, at times, a dirty, risky and non-righteous one.All in all, the best (anti) War movie ever. Highly recommended."
TERMINATOR180,"Dec 20, 2001",6/10,"This movie makes you feel like you are one with the actors, like you are going through the same ordeals. The sound really puts you in the middle of the action, and the great acting makes you feel for the characters.***/***** Stars"
johnnymonsarrat,"Mar 31, 2002",3/10,"I'm an action movie guy. I'm not into drama, so I rented Das Boot for the joy ride.I believe that a movie should be rated for its current impact, and I think many reviewers are reaching into their memories of the past. I've seen it recently. It was disappointing.Was ""Das Boot"" the original submarine action flick? Well, since 1981 action movie standards have grown a lot. What once may have been original (submarine goes up, down, dodging missiles, fixing leaks) has now been overshadowed by ""Crimson Tide"", ""The Hunt for Red October"", and others. It reminded me of ""The Poseidon Adventure"", which is also now too old to enjoy.As a straight action movie, I would have given it a ""6"". But there's more.Drama lovers and arty types have the refinement and film school talent of separating the film into its component parts. They can, for example, love the choreography and costuming even if the story is awful and the characters loathsome. I don't have that fine an appreciation.For a regular guy like me, I just can't root for the Nazis. The film is about the German military in World War II and while the film portrays them as ""regular guys, decent and fighting against the ocean depths"", I just cannot separate that from a sense of right and wrong that these folks (however trapped) are fighting for ideals which (even though some characters in the film say it's all baloney) ultimately they support.So I'm forced to give this film a 3 out of 10. Try watching this right after ""Schindler's List"" and see if you disagree.Who should see this film:-- Arty / drama types who can get around my unsophisticated viewpoint-- Action movie lovers with nothing better to do on a rainy day, who can get around my unsophisticated viewpoint. There are two ways to do it -- by being overly highbrow or overly lowbrow! :)"
linde-karl,"Sep 9, 2009",10/10,"I remember when I was 15 years old and my father wanted me to see this film from 1981 claiming it was one of the best ever made. Of course I did not believe him and it took another 8 years before I went saw this masterpiece on a cold September evening. Take my advice for it, listen to your fathers!I very rarely review films, this is probably my 2nd or 3rd at most and I have been hanging around here for years. This film is something else, it grabs hold of you and sucks you in and it makes you feel like you are actually there in a German WW2 submarine with the comfort of a unit of canned tuna. The characters are believable and you turn to care deeply for them all even tho they were on the ""evil side"".I can not recommend this film enough, do yourself a favor today and go watch this."
the_oak,"Apr 2, 2018",10/10,"If you think war is about glory and medals and patriotism and an evil enemy, think again. War is protrayed here to be very real, very gritty, with not much glory in the end. In stead of forcing the melodrama upon us, in stead of painting the enemy as monsters, we see ordinary men caught up in the reality of it all.
This is, as the other reviewers have pointed out, a legendary movie."
rickrk-rk,"May 3, 2020",9/10,"One of the best war movies ever produced in part due to its authenticity. The sign of any good movie is when you actually care about the characters. Such is the case here. It has nothing to do with who was the enemy, or who was right or wrong, it deals with every man's struggle and will to survive. Hard to believe that I, as a Jew, found myself routing for the German crew. If that isn't the sign of a good movie, what is?"
ma-cortes,"Jun 23, 2015",8/10,"This is an excellent 15 million dollars German movie chronicling the strong conditions of forty three men assigned to a U-Boot in 1941 . This exciting film contains nail-biting action , drama , suspense in a claustrophobic atmosphere . During WWII forty thousand young German served aboard Nazi subs , only ten thousand survived . This is the story of 43 raw recruits caught up in a war they didn't understand, and the Captain who must lead them in their struggle to survive .The claustrophobic as well as realistic world of a WWII German U-boat was meticulously mounted ; retelling boredom , filth , and sheer terror . It recreates faithfully the tension , hardship and claustrophobic conditions of the young seamen . The bulk of the film's $15 million budget was spent on constructing U-boats , the plans were taken to the original builder of the subs, who was commissioned to build a full-sized , sea-going replica , their first such assignment since the war ended ; second full-sized model was built for interior filming . A miniature submarine was used for scenes in which we see the submarine from outside , the model was steered from the inside by a diver . While shooting scale models in the Northern Sea, filming was disturbed by doves landing on the submarine . The submarine models built for Das Boot were also the ones used in Raiders of the lost ark (1981). In addition , it arranges to embrace an anti-war message concerning thought-provoking and brooding issues . Originally a five hour German TV miniseries , later released in a 217 minutes filmmaker's cut . Interesting screenplay by the same filmmaker Wolfgang Petersen based on Lothar G. Buchheim's autobiographical novel . Perfectly played by Jurgen Prochnow as commander and a solid support cast as Herbert Grönemeyer , Jan Fedder , Otto Sander and Uwe Ochsenknecht . To help his actors convey the claustrophobic conditions found on a real U-boat, director Wolfgang Petersen insisted on filming within the actual confines of the ship , scarcely wider than a man's outstretched arms , rather than removing the model's outer Wall . Thrilling and enjoyable musical score by Klaus Doldinger . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Jost Vacano . In order to get the fast tracking shots through the U-boat without a shaky image , director of photography created a system of heavy gyroscopes that kept the camera steady as he ran through the hallways . The motion picture was lavishly produced by Mark Damon , John Hyde , Edward R. Pressman , being compellingly directed by the great filmmaker/writer Wolfgang Petersen . The film was nominated for six Academy Awards which was at the time the highest number of Oscar nominations ever received by a foreign language film .The movie provides a realistic detailing of life aboard and a portrait about the crews subjected to stressful and psychological tensions . In fact the sailors had sleep in shifts . For months they were lodged in close quarters because every inch the space was needed for machinery , supplies and torpedoes . The air was heavy with odors from bilges,diesel oil and unwashed bodies . The men faced sudden death from depth charges ,aerial bombing attacks or the sharp bow of a swift destroyer as happen in this film . The picture is based on historic deeds , thus the construction of new U-boats continued at a record -breaking during WWII . In 1942-43 Hitler raised enormously his U-boat strength , the German submarines sank numerous ships, in early 1943 the called ¨Wolf packs¨ sank 90 ships in 20 days.Then,suddenly , between March and June 1943 , an exceptional change took place . The Allies began to win the war against Hitler's underwater in the Battle of the Atlantic . By this time the technique of submarines warfare had advanced far beyond that used in the beginning the war . The Allies pitted thousands of boats , seamen , destroyers , cruisers ,subs , cannons and billion of dollars against the undersea craft . As early as December 1943 Karl Doeniz , the architect and designer of U-boat campaign, admitted the grave turn in events . The cost was great on both sides . In the six years of war , the Germans , by their own statistics , destroyed more than 2000 British , Allied ships in the sea . Hitler had built 1162 subs , of which 783 were lost . Of the 41000 men recruited into the underwater service , between 28000 and 32000 lost their lives and 500 were taken prisoners ."
typxxi,"Oct 8, 2006",10/10,"The most realistic u-boat/submarine film full with all the details of the contemporary sub VIIc. The commands are quite correct for that time, some scenes are too spectacular & unreal as my grandfather told me but the rest is so real that I could see the fear in the eyes of my grandfather after the first 30 minutes (beyond the inside lightning which wasn't neither red or blue). He survived several similar airraids and depth charges more than once on every mission and fortunately his boat lost no crewmember. The 6 hours TV version is the best regarding story & feeling, the directors cut is 197min and with new sound effects (so somewhat better than the older TV version)"
bassjim,"Dec 23, 2002",10/10,"I was fourteen when this film was released, and even then, I remember hearing how wonderful it was.  Watching a foreign film at that age was out of the question, though!  Now, twenty-one years and several foreign films later, I finally saw this film.  To say that it did not disappoint in the least is a grossly unfair understatement..I watched the director's cut DVD, and I can't imagine shaving anything from this version without the impact being felt, so my advice is to watch this version if possible.  Another benefit of this version is the remastered sound; while I usually wince when a movie's sound is listed as one of its chief merits (I would hope that, oh, PLOT might be more important!), sound is absolutely vital to the enormous impact this movie gives the viewer. Whether it's the thunderous explosion of enemy depth charges bombarding the sub or the nail-biting silence of the crew as they try to determine the whereabouts of their enemy, sound is of paramount importance to this story. Those of you with Dolby digital systems will not be disappointed.So, what about character development and plot?  No film is worth watching without those elements, and Wolfgang Peterson and his team fully grasped this.  There must be at least twenty minutes of film before the crew even steps aboard the sub, and during this time, we are being introduced to the captain and his crew.  The crew are predominantly men in name only.  They are, for all intents and purposes, boys, and that fact is a major theme throughout the film, as we watch their gleeful boyhood faces turn to those of terrified older men as they see what war really is.  By the end of the movie, you know and care about these people, despite the fact that they are (let's face it) our enemies from a war most of us never lived.  We never see them as Nazis, or even Germans for that matter; had Peterson delved right into the sub without giving these characters the depth (no pun intended) they deserve, we wouldn't feel the tensions that they feel during the story.and make no mistake, you will feel them.  The plot?  The less I say, the better the movie will be for you.  Suffice to say, being on a U-boat must be like the phrase I heard describing what it is like being an anesthesiologist: 99% boredom combined with 1% sheer terror.  The percentages are altered in this movie for obvious reasons, but you get to experience both.  What's amazing is that even the slow points of the film are nothing less than riveting.At three and a half hours and with its being subtitled, most people wouldn't touch this movie with a stick.  What a shame.  At the time of my writing, this is number 37 on imdb's lit of all time films.  That should be enough to convince anyone to see this.  Enjoy!"
mentalcritic,"Nov 5, 2000",N/A,"Having read a previous comment that describes how people of certain walks of life or professions like to shy away from (or laugh their butt off at) films that try to portray them, I can see some of the validity in that. As a mental patient, I cannot stop laughing at films such as A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 or The Dream Team (or being offended by Me, Myself, And Irene to the point where I have solemnly vowed to punch Jim Crappy's head in). However, I have nothing but praise for the way in which the subject matter is handled in such films as Girl, Interrupted. Das Boot is the war movie equivalent of Girl, Interrupted. Where other war films either make laughable guesses as to their details, or even consist of outright lies as is the case in U571, Das Boot portrays a tense and disturbing situation as it really was. The German submariners of WWII didn't put on nationalistic music because they gave a rat's about their government's policies or intentions. They did it so they could be distracted from the fact that every time they sailed, they had a seventy-five percent chance of not coming back.If there is one weakness in this film, its that it seems a little overlong on repeat viewings. Much of the film consists of idle business where the crew sit and argue, play games, or wait for something to do. This is all well and good on a short documentary, but in a feature film, it would have been a little wiser to only use the bare minimum necessary for plot movement. Thankfully, the pace is picked up in the sequences where the submariners barely avoid death, and in a frightening and savage ending that gives you a real sense of how your hopes can be dashed faster than you realise in a combat situation. I really count my lucky stars that I am unfit for military service, because films like this make me realise it just isn't worth the risk.Das Boot is a great classic of modern cinema that has to be seen at least once. It is so grounded in reality that it will set your adrenal glands in motion, as opposed to the obvious fiction of The Hunt For Red October or the outright bulldust of U571. It is truly a pity that Prochnow hasn't appeared in such a great film since, as his portrayal of the captain is what keeps the film in motion a lot of the time. Hell, by the time the seamen decide to put on a record and have a sing-along, you'll want to sing along as well, if only to release the tension added by the rest of the film. Ten stars."
angryman_45,"Mar 13, 2004",10/10,"This is, perhaps, the best war film ever made. This may seem to be a little over the top, considering its opposition, but I feel that what this film lacks in special effects is more than made up for by the depth of its characters and the sheer claustrophobic suspense of the final hour. Das Boot is a very faithful adaptation of the original book (which is fantastic as well), and is best viewed in its original German, but with English subtitles (assuming you are not German!). As a proud resident of Great Britain, you can understand how easy it is to hate the members of the U-boat fleet for what they did to so many crews in our Merchant Navy. Despite this, it is easy to contemplate how terrible an experience life in a U-boat was. After having watched this masterpiece, I felt (and still do feel) that the sheer boredom and terror of U-boat life was far worse than that experienced by allied surface crews.  This is not meant to disrespect anyone, but is meant to provide an accurate comparison.Other War films about the Battle of the Atlantic (e.g. ""The Cruel Sea"", ""In Which We Serve"" & ""Sink the Bismark') are based almost entirely from the Allied perspective, and almost all Germans are portrayed as cold-blooded murderers. Das Boot is unique among movies of its genre in that it is based entirely around the Germans, but also that it does not portray any side to be morally superior. Das Boot's main theme seems to be the futility of war itself. The acting throughout is superb, and the set is highly effective at communicating the claustrophobia, cold and stench of the inside of a submarine. The soundtrack is uniquely chilling and thrilling, and simply adds to the rich feeling and accuracy of the plot. There have been far too few films made about the U-boat crews during the Second World War, but since Das Boot, it seems as though no others are necessary. This film is absolutely fantastic, and richly deserves its rating of 10 out of 10!!!"
paulclaassen,"Apr 10, 2024",6/10,"One thing you have to know going into 'Das Boot' is that it is more of a character study drama than an action movie. The film revolves around 50 men in the confines of a submarine. Hitler is sending U-boats (submarines) hoping to blockade and starve out Britain. Despite the fact battle for control of the Atlantic is turning against Germany, more U-boats are sent.With the men bored waiting for action, so is the viewer - or me, at least. Although it wasn't entirely boring and we got to know the crew, I did find the film far too slow paced (from an entertainment perspective). The action only really starts at the 50-minute mark. Only, torpedoes are fired and we hear explosions, but nothing is shown on screen. This is going to be a major issue for the new generation audience who would definitely prefer to see the action, and not envision it. (The current generation already have a short attention span as it is, so with the film being so long and slow I doubt it will appeal to future generations).It's a fact, 'Das Boot' is probably one of the best and most realistic submarine movies ever made. I know I'm in the minority here and crucify me if you will, but this movie does not rate among my favourites. I found this to be a fairly boring movie with a few good action and tense scenes scattered throughout. The best moments by far were the third act when the crew found themselves in a desperate situation fighting for their lives. Here, Chief Engineer Fritz Grade (Klaus Wennemann) rose to the occasion by becoming the film's hero (and not our main protagonist Capt. Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jürgen Prochnow).Interestingly, all hell broke loose during the film's final 10 minutes - when I thought it was all over - with an event I wasn't expecting. This was a really awesome scene! If the film was a bit shorter, it would have been faster paced and I would have enjoyed it more. This is nevertheless a very well made film and no doubt submarine enthusiasts will love it."

ewarn-1,"May 29, 2007",10/10,"Submarine films are usually good, even if they're bad, and this is the best, and it's not bad at all. Few films have such great art direction that you can feel the temperature actually depicted in the scene, and smell the setting as well. Here you can smell diesel fuel, fifty men and hot metal. The sound effects are fantastic, no other film has ever shown depth charges like this one, and has captured the terror of what it must have been like to ride one out.Another example of perfect casting, the faces of the crewmen are unforgettable, so you don't get them all mixed up, which is a problem in war films depicting a lot of men in one place. This is very different from today's movies where everyone has that 24 year old bland overfed and overexercised southern California look. The guys in the sub here look pale and exhausted, stressed out and sick after weeks at sea. Still, they come across as very likable, which helps to identify with them as they face such danger from the enemy and the elements.I saw this film in 1982, but I think it was a shorter version, it was released at a time when there was very little interest in warfare so it was rare to see something so compelling. I saw the 200 minute version recently and was amazed at the length, to me I thought I had just watched maybe a 90 minute movie. That's a sign of how intense the story is. I also preferred the German language version."
donovan74,"Sep 20, 2007",10/10,"INTRO It's 1941,World War ll and the battle for the Atlantic is turning against the Germans. Nevertheless the German high Command orders more and more U-boats (submarines) into battle from their ports in occupied France.40,000 German sailors served on U-boats during World War ll.30,000 never returned.DAS BOOT (THE BOAT) This Film was first broadcast back in 1981 on German television as a mini series which became so popular that it has now been viewed all over the world. This mini series was cut down by almost half, to be made into a feature film (plently long at 200mins). Das Boot, The Director's cut takes you onboard a claustrophobic submarine during the mayhem of 1941 when British destroyers (ships) were getting much more sophisticated with radar and sonar thus being able to detect deeper into the sea. The atmosphere on the U-96,one of the famed German U-boats known as The Grey Wolves is captivating and as the film proceeds you will begin to enjoy the entrancing ride of these sailors as they launch torpedos and endure heavy depth charges in retaliation (make sure you've got the volume up). All the German crew and especially the Capt-Lt Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jurgen Prochnow) give truly enthralling performances. This film really does take you on a journey with many edgy moments including an emotional trip to the sea bed when they are hit by a depth charge.THE DIRECTING The director Wolfgang Petersen does an outstanding job to keep you inches from the action inside the submarine,all the cameras are in the right places at the right time. The panning shots that follow the crew running from one end of the submarine to the other are breathtaking. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't pick up an Oscar for best director as in my books the direction is unparalleled, it however was nominated for best Director, best Cinematography.THE MUSIC The music is second to none,absolutely spot on with the help from Klaus Doldinger. when I hear the opening music to Das Boot it always gives me goose pimples (very stimulating). .To me the music from Das Boot is as absorbing, if not more, than the famous music in Jaws the film.LANGUAGES Das Boot was filmed in German and for me that's the best format (watching with subtitles) although if you're feeling lazy you can opt for dubbed English which is done very well.DAS BOOT (SUPERBIT) I had the pleasure to watch this film at my relatives,who has an HD television and a superbit DVD player.and I cannot stress how much better it is. The picture and sound are stunning, razor sharp and its hard to believe that what your watching is not live in your room.

SunnyMars,"Dec 14, 2006",9/10,"I'm happy about the fact that this movie gets still this big attention. Even if it is already 25 years ago when it came to the theaters worldwide I'm surprised and happy, that the movie made such a huge impression to a lot of people everywhere. This is not usual for a German movie and less usual for a German WW2 movie. I've seen ""Das Boot"" a lot of times over the years and I'm still impressed by the pure and realistic atmosphere in it. The actors are brilliant and for a lot of them ""Das Boot"" was the start of a big career in the European or German cinema or TV. One of them - Herbert Gronemeyer - was already a pop star at the beginning of his career in Germany 25 years ago. Today he is one of the most successful stars in the German music scene... he makes good music but unfortunately only music. His character was, except of Prochnows role, my favorite one, but unfortunately we'll never see more of his acting talent. Here in Munich you can visit the Bavaria Studios where they've filmed the movie. And you can still make a walk through the submarine.... claustrophobic feelings included, because it's very narrow inside. At the latest then you realize how complicated it must have been to film the movie.To cut a long story short: One of my all time favorite movies!"
xNecRosex,"Dec 26, 2020",9/10,"Yes yes yes, this definitely is the best German movie alongside The Lives of Others and Downfall...The realism, the horrors of life in the U-Boat, the terrifying anxiety and clastrophobic feeling you get as the camera captures the tight spaces.Amazing."
MindyF,"May 21, 2000",N/A,"This movie really kicked my a**.I saw U-571 recently and read the reviews there to check this movie out. I did and it was SUPERB! I have not participated in a war and will never be in a war but Das Boot sure let me FEEL what it would be like. We're going to die . . . we're not going to die . . . we're watching people die  . . . etc. . . etc. with tears were flowing freely throughout and after. Forever changed. Deeply moving, stunning, terrifying and all I can ask is . . . why"

Years later, I've finally gotten around to seeing it, now that I've become very well researched in WW2 and the military in general.This movie was SO accurate, down to the smallest details. Whoever produced this is admirable, as are the writers, director, cast, crew, etc.Also, real submariners verify it's authenticity, and it's incredibly well made!"
JimS-10,"Jun 21, 1999",6/10,"This movie was a great movie for depicting the terror, compactness, and boredom of living in a German submarine during World War II.  I viewed the complete version of it.  (Director's Cut) I thought there was too much unneeded scenes in the movie that will make the movie very boring.  These unnecessary scenes seemed to give the movie a summary of, for lack of better terms, ""boat goes up, boat goes down,"" as in the surfacing and submerging of the submarine. It is not an action packed movie, but however, it is a psychological twister which depicts the wild emotions of the crew during submarine warfare."
keiljd,"Mar 23, 2002",5/10,"Interesting in that it looks at things from the German side, as well it should. A good movie that would've been better had not Hollywood made so many fine films on the same subject in the 40 or so years preceding Das Boot. The German film comes up short in comparison to some of these, none of which needed 150 minutes to tell their story. I'm particularly reminded of THE ENEMY BELOW (1957), a superb drama on some of the same subject matter. Far superior to DAS BOOT, it seems to have been an inspiration to Peterson and crew, since several scenes in his film have been lifted directly from the Dick Powell original, made for Fox in the CinemaScope era."
RubenMovies,"Jan 31, 2021",9/10,"Everything in this movie is done well. Acting, ambience, realistic characters.
What a beautiful movie!"
filmbuff-05706,"Jul 6, 2021",10/10,"I owe my deepest thanks to my 3 main favorite film critics for bringing Das Boot to my attention. That goes to Roger Ebert, Gene Siskel, and especially James Berardinelli, who has this film in his top 100 favorite movies. (As I do now, even higher, in fact.)Das Boot(German for ""The Boat"") is the story of German U-boat soldiers and their struggles of fighting WWII inside of a cramped submarine. Before the war starts, the men see their duty as exciting, but then they get a true glimpse of the real hell of war, particularly inside of a submarine.Simply put, Das Boot is one of the finest war movies ever made, and one of the best movies I have ever seen in any genre. Director Wolfgang Peterson, who would later direct such movies as Air Force One and Troy, truly showed his gift as a director very early in his career.One bit of realism put in Das Boot is the language. Instead of being in English, the entire movie is spoken in German, except for maybe a line or two. While the subtitles occasionally run too fast(not anyone's fault of course), they help put us into this world, reminding us that Germans would in fact speak...German, not English, as often portrayed in war movies.The camerawork is something to be praised about the film. Peterson directs the camera in such a way that it appears that we too are in the submarine with these Germans. We become part of their claustrophobic world- feeling tight in their limited space.In shots where the camera tours the submarine, it appears like we are walking behind, but unfortunately when they are in danger, we are forced to do nothing but watch. Even so, when they lose air, it seems that we lose air, and when they get wet, we can imagine the feeling.We learn early into their mission that the 50 men have to share a toilet, which is just a hole, not a physical toilet, making us dread for them the stench that they must endure. Set aside the fact that the soldiers also urinate in bottles and appear to go weeks without bathing.Characterization is another strength of Das Boot. The WWII film does focus on Germans, some of which are Nazi supporters, but we are forced to sympathize with them. As many great movies do, we are reminded that even though these were enemies in this time period, they are still human and worthy of sympathy.We see one character who writes to his non-German fiancée, who is pregnant. He knows that they must confess their love eventually, but he fears the reaction of their families.In another scene, Johann, one of the soldiers, has a nervous breakdown and leaves his post, shaking before the Captain. He orders him to return to his post, and he delays in obeying the command. Johann later apologizes to the Captain, pleading forgiveness and promising to never do that again. The Captain accepts and agrees to not court martial him. I found this to be the best and most powerful scene.I viewed the Director's Cut of the film, which runs for 3.5 hours, about an hour longer than the original cut. I have not seen the shorter cut, but even so, I highly recommend seeking the Director's Cut. The runtime is why I put off seeing it(that and the film being in German on top of that), but I started it at 9pm last night and, with breaks, I managed to complete it at nearly 1:30 this morning.That's because, despite being so long, the movie moved at a steady pace, and while it is long, it feels quicker than 210 minutes. Therefore, while I warn you against the run time, it should also be noted that for me it was hardly an issue.Das Boot is a masterpiece of a war movie. There are few movies, war or otherwise, that I can recommend higher. It is more than a movie; it is an engaging experience. It truly is one of the finest war movies ever made."
HIWATTSteve-88565,"Dec 16, 2022",10/10,"My father, a 10 year sub vet brought the family to the theater to see this masterpiece in late 81/82. The depth charge scenes almost blew you into the back of the theater. When the film was over I felt beat up, both mentally, from the films ""isolation"" and physically, the PTSD from the depth chargers. No other film has ever had the same effect on me. Where you think about it, it's characters that stay ""with you"" for a period. I actually lost sleep after seeing it for the first time. It sadly looses a tremendous amount of it's power, even on the biggest of home TV's and sound systems. The audience the sound system and screen make the movies ""gut punch."" In the theater you also feel like you become part of The Boat's crew. I can only wish that this be restored to IMAX and shown today in that medium."
evanston_dad,"Jan 28, 2008",9/10,"""Das Boot"" is one of those movies you think there's no way you could actually enjoy, and then find yourself totally engrossed in. A three-and-a-half hour film in German set almost completely on a submarine would not seem to have the makings of a gripping film, but gripping this film certainly is.Wolfgang Petersen and his cameraman make tremendous use of their limited space, and this film is more visually dynamic than many films that have much more room to play with. The claustrophobia is intense, and the small details about life on a submarine endlessly fascinating. And it's a tremendously humanist film as well; by the end, we don't really care that these men are fighting for the Nazi cause, we simply care about them as men.Grade: A"
the_Forcer,"Nov 16, 2012",10/10,"It isn't. It simply isn't. And that is what makes it such a masterpiece. Halfway through the film you forget that the characters are German sailors, you forget about the Nazi ideology, you forget that the story is set in 1941 or even set on planet Earth. Wolfgang Petersen takes you to an alternate dimension, far away from anything we consider human, where there is no right or wrong and your only option is to kill or be killed. And the sensation of death draws ever closer, its certainty slowly driving every single man to insanity. The film is as much a world war 2 movie as ""Apocalypse Now"" is a movie about Vietnam. It's a psychological ride that makes you think about the nature of humanity and war in general. It's a long movie so get ready and submerge into an painful, terrifying nightmare."
mehdimarechal,"Mar 30, 2007",N/A,"Forget about ""Crimson tide"", ""The hunt for red October"" or ""U 571""! This is the mother of all submarine-movies, a compelling, claustrophobic and intense journey into the heart of madness! View this film on a big screen and with Dolby surround! The experience will be so intense that afterwards you keep hearing the Sonar for days...Never have I seen a film that depicted the life (and death) of those inside these iron coffins in such a realistic and gripping way. The acting is outstanding, the camera-work is good and the story captivating. But, the best about this film is undoubtedly the atmosphere: the sounds, the silences,...at some points during the film you find yourself in the inability to breathe. Great, simply Great!"
frankwhat,"Oct 6, 2004",7/10,"This was the best submarine movie I have ever seen. To get to know how I felt about other ones...I did like ""K-19"", the ""Hunt for Red October"" was alright, and I thought ""U-571"" and ""Crimson Tide"" were almost garbage. In most of these movies it makes living on a submarine seem close to paradise except for the battles when ""Das Boot"" shows you that it's a lot like being in jail in one retrospect. The smells are horrible, the food is worse, and there's no privacy whatsoever let alone places to move around to and fro. It shows you how hardy some of these enlisted men are that get stuck into this needed duty and how they can be heroic for putting up with these untidy conditions. I also couldn't believe this movie was made in 1981, it didn't seem outdated at all like a lot of movies from that time period are and I surely would've said the early 90's if I had to guess without any prior knowledge. If you watch the director's cut it can be strenuous at times to sit through since it is well over 3 hours and some parts are rather slow...but by all means it is still worth it to stay through the end. The acting is sensational and the pure raw energy that is exerted through some of the actors' facial expressions is enough to leave anyone speechless. I can absolutely see why this put Wolfgang Petersen on the map!Final Appraisal:Movies: Yes, but the director's cut would be very taxing to sit through without any breaks.DVD Purchase: No, but it is tempting, believe me.Rental: Can't go wrong!"
blanche-2,"Jul 4, 2009",10/10,"Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"" from 1981 is one of the greatest films ever made.Claustrophobic, sweaty, wet, rocky, tense, frightening - Das Boot shows young Germans during World War II in a submarine, headed up by an old man, played by handsome Jurgen Prochnow, whom I believe was supposed to be 30 - actually the actor was older, but the point is that this crew is a bunch of kids. And as the war went along, they got younger and younger.At the end, Hitler was sending in the 14-year-olds. He had absolutely no regard for the German people. He took their pots and pans, they had no food, he took their sons.When it was obvious Germany was going to lose, he blamed the German people. On the sub, there was only one fan of Hitler's; this is actually pretty accurate.I saw the Director's Cut in German, and I highly recommend it. The brilliance of the film lies in its capture of submarine life, the futility of the war, and the connection we who were on the other side of the fight as we watch this film are able to make with what was our enemy.It reminded me, in that respect, of a film called ""A Foreign Field"" with Alec Guinness, Edward Hermann, Jeanne Moreau, and Lauren Bacall. The enemy may be the government, but there's nothing terribly different about the people.The only criticism men who actually were on submarines make is that the crew was too loud during the patrols. It's considered much more accurate in its depiction than anything put out by Hollywood, including Saving Private Ryan.Fantastic acting, led by the brilliant and charismatic Prochnow, Das Boot is an incredibly intense experience - exciting, suspenseful, and heartbreaking. A triumph for Petersen."
Patrik16,"Dec 16, 2002",6/10,"Not only the British and the French was taking pain of war. This movie shows the terror of being trapped under sea in a submarine that easily will drown them slowly, and that the Germans had feelings too. All very new warfilms about the WWII is very one-sided and only cares about ""the poor Americans"". Well the Germans had choosed Hitler, and Hitler choosed War. Of course, those bloody Nazis was misslead by one of the worst and greatest dictators (and tyrant) ever encountered in history, so an interesting subject is taken in this wonderful movie. Who is evil? Is it the countrymen (the real Patriots, not always the soldiers), the Country or the man leading it. Well, thank god communism was gone forever in Germany after this, but the question is what is worst. Hitler or Communism... But by playing with the feelings of the soldiers, this movie is in its rightful place. Belonging at the top 100! But, it has a hard time too show the pain of the British soldiers and keep telling that the high leaders are the crooks. No, no, no. It is man that is the crook! 8/10"
DareDevilKid,"Feb 13, 2011",5/10,"I'm not trying to be intelligent, I just try to speak from my heart & my claims are certainly not spurious.Firstly, I know that many film academies & critics might have this film on their top 10 list. While film academies are only a minor testimonial, we all know that critics are mostly smug, obnoxious wannabe filmmakers with high-handed viewpoints.Secondly,I personally agree that its director 'Mr. Wolfgang Pieterson' is supremely talented. Two of his movies: 'Air Force One' & 'In The Line Of Fire' are among my all time favourites.But sadly in this movie, his direction is not up to the mark. If I view a movie and then proceed to dedicate multiple viewings to it, then that movie has great direction. If I'll view it only once or twice more, then it has good direction. If I'll view it only once albeit satisfactorily, then the direction is okay. If I'll stop viewing it midway, then its a bad movie with bad direction. But if I view it to its finale with the anticipation of a good climax owing to a good storyline & not due to the relentless entrapment of my mind by its well crafted scenes, dialogues & background score, then that , to me is a definitive: ""LACK OF DIRECTION AND TEDIOUS PACING WITH BELOW PAR EDITING(PRIME EG:- 'DAS BOOT')."" Among other contemporary directors, perhaps, 'Martin Scorsese', 'Quentin Tarantino', 'Joel Coen', or 'Anurag Kashyap' might have done a better job at directing this great story.And finally, with all due respect, I being an avid film buff & part-time short filmmaker myself, needn't be reminded of the many awards this film won & other Oscar nominations along with many more prestigious nominations which it garnered. But awards alone can never be a testimonial to a film's greatness. And this is not just what I say, but one of cinema'a all time greatest directors, 'Mr. Quentin Tarantino' himself said this & I quote: ""I don't care how many awards a film has won, even the Oscars. If I want to watch a movie again & again, then that to me is a truly great movie."" Can anybody please tell me how many people have watched 'Das Boot' more than once. And I'm just talking about true fans of cinema & not film academies, film students, or even critics for that matter. And when I say 'true fans of cinema', I most certainly don't mean teenyboppers looking for overblown CGI FX or beleaguered office goers & spoilt, rich, neglected housewives looking for some popcorn entertainment & eye-candy.I'm just talking about people like you & me. We might delve into all the technical aspects of filmmaking & view them academically, but ultimately, we are also just 'true fans of cinema'. That's the reason we began pursuing movies more deeply & I implore you to never forget that.I've been in forums where there were Navy submariners present. According to them, it's almost universally accepted that Das Boot is the most realistic, best submarine movie ever made."" Now come on, if we make a movie about the medicinal ideologies irrespective of how boring it is, the medical fraternity is always going to root for it, but will other fans share the same enthusiasm. But this just further reasserts my analysis that ""this movie had a great storyline but was badly executed"".And as for a prime example, here goes. Ever heard of the movie 'The Good The Bad And The Ugly'. It never won any Oscars & was lambasted by most critics upon its release. But today after 45 yrs. (forget 30 yrs.), its loved by one & all, including fans, film academics & students, or even regular multiplex goers. Unlike 'Das Boot' which is only known among the major cities of Europe & America, this movie is a global phenomenon & popular even in the most remotest villages of even third world nations. Even in my Motherland, where foreign movies are not very popular (I mean non Hollywood movies), this film was re-released two years ago, & even ran to 60 to 70% filled houses for about two weeks, which is more than many new releases can boast of. And compared to this film, 'Das Boot' had a superlative story. 'Good BAd & Ugly' had hardly any story. It was basically a collage of one top-notch scene after another interwoven with great dialogues, music & camera angles by the master, legendary director, 'Mr. Sergio Leone' (once again, one of cinema's greatest directors).Even today, there are several fan-clubs organizing special screenings & discussions of this film along with other classics like 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', 'Psycho', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Seven Samurai', 'Indiana Jones', 'Dirty Harry', 'Yojimbo', 'Alien', 'The Bicycle Thief' & others. Everybody, young, middle aged & old alike will stop & watch at least a few scenes of these movies while surfing through channels. I myself never get weary of viewing these films. I always end up learning something from them again, while being entertained once again. Hence, to me, these movies among others are the true classics of cinema."
stone69126,"Jan 15, 2006",9/10,"This film is really a masterpiece in history of the German film industry. Although it is quite long with over 3 hours, it is worth seeing it and by the way, one never gets bored. Instead, tension is built up throughout the entire film with outstanding acting of Jürgen Prochnow first of all and Herbert Grönemeyer and rest of the ""crew""!!! It is really a must see film. I am not only saying it because I am half German myself, but because it is a second world war movie that doesn't focus on who are the good and who the bad. Its all about the people in the submarine trying to survive, far away from political attitudes. The ending could not be better, its simply a film of my taste. Its just so disappointing that current German film industry can't manage to do such great work again, except of last year's ""Der Untergang""!!!!!"
wm-girvan,"Jun 21, 2012",10/10,"A lot of war films are heavy on patriotism. This one isn't, and that's what makes it special. Set in 1941, the film follows a German U Boat Captain and his crew in their mission to seek and destroy Allied forces convoys in the Atlantic. The Captain we learn, despises his political masters but as a career sub-mariner he ruthlessly adheres to the chain of command. The captain may view the crew as cogs in his machine but we get to know them as they spend their time cooped up together. The film really focuses on how various crew members cope with the extreme pressure situations that arise out of the captains' decision making. It is this human element that gives the film a timeless quality, it never feels dated and it also enables the viewer to really connect with the emotions that the captain and his crew are experiencing. In fact, it feels so real that you can almost feel the salt spray on your face as the boat races through the waves at full speed. Watch this one, you won't forget it."
LuboLarsson,"Jul 4, 2002",10/10,"I love War films, so why did I wait so long to see this amazing film? I don't know, but last week i picked it up in my local supermarket for a measly £5!. It was a wonderful, heartbreaking film. I never thought I'd be rooting for the Germans in a WWII film but I certainly was here, actually I was either on the edge of my seat or biting my nails through the whole 3hrs 20 minutes running time of my directors cut version . It was dubbed, but it was very well done. I hope there is or will be a special DVD version released with the original German speaking version with subtitles. I must also add the acting in this film was of the highest quality. I just found a film to add to my all time favourite movie list, its called DAS BOOT. 10/10"
FWeger51065,"Feb 14, 2007",10/10,"well actually as a German, i liked watching this movie several times...it is, IMHO, as was stated before a good description of the folks who were drawn into war 70y ago...there are no real bad guys and no good guys...and thats who it is..we all are no bad or good guys..we are drawn to the reality we live in... I personally think that Das Boot is a brilliant movie, esp. as there are many more ""anti Nazis"" phrases in the original version, the translation makes some sound really humble, i think it is a great movie, which BTW led the way to many todays German TV and movie actors, the casting list of dads boot reads like a who is who of current serious German actors"
mistersnail,"Sep 15, 2006",10/10,"I have to admit that the film was historically quite accurate as I have studied the submarine warfare and, quite obviously, have realised there must be another side to the story: i.e. that German U-boat crews were not necessarily evil and / or sarcastic and ultimately successful as usually portrayed. There must have been a human side to the crews, which went unexplored, and even the several attempts were all British/American and did not make a sufficient point. This film, on the other hand, shows people actually stuck in between 'saving' their country and common sense and the desire to live.Moreover, good and to-the-point screenplay & acting all combine to make a good film. What makes it better still is that it is, after all German made: this not only gives the chosen perspective a certain validity, but may just as well highlight a general German view of the war (of the 80s period at least), which must not be dismissed.The film shows the Battle of the Atlantic in a different light from the usual history books. Since there are few films that actually portray the scene from the 'other' perspective, and even fewer that manage to do it so well, it is definitely worth giving it a high mark."
Kaleun1,"Jun 13, 2020",10/10,"I learned German in the 1970s, and lived with a family for a semester in Cologne.
I feel pretty familiar with German culture of wartime as I became acquainted (non-judgmentally) with 2 former SS officers, a former Luftwaffe Flak overseer, a Wehrmacht captain. I tried to learn as much as I could, also with several trips to Berlin.The U-Boot Waffe (Submarine Service) always interested me, my dad worked in U.S. Naval Ordnance during the war and I studied a great deal about it. The DVD is a short version of a 6 part German TV mini-series--Peterson, now a well-known director, started out in German TV.I have seen all versions--this cut is as good as any. In the submarine ""genre"" it is by far the best and most realistic. The way this was accomplished is detailed in a companion book to the film. One thing I recall, in casting, they were looking for ""ordinary-looking Germans not stars (for comparison, Bruno Ganz, who played Adolf in ""Der Untergang"" was a well-regarded stage actor).The realism in this film is astounding. We follow the highs and lows of a U-Boot crew (U-96) through several war patrols, from the Baltic to the Mediterranean.
It is an exciting action movie--although you will probably be watching it in German with subtitles. Watch it again and pay attention to the details of the sets. This was accomplished in a tank, mostly in Bavaria Studios, with excellent screenplay from the book. I can't say much more without encountering spoilers, so I will leave it at that. I did not see many movies during the 1980s when I was a graduate student, and this one left a lasting impression, motivating me to go back to Germany several times after 2002, when I learned a great deal more. I oppose war and its usual goals--and notice often they happen by accident, but it doesn't change a great film."
rclusso,"Jul 7, 2003",N/A,"Having read many of the other posts, there is little I can add to the laudatory comments that have preceded mine.  ""Das Boot"" is a great film and I use the word ""great"" in its truest sense.  Without being preachy for one minute, the horror and futility of war is evident in nearly every scene.The only thing I would add is to emphasize the greatness (and importance to the story) of the soundtrack.  If you have surround sound or can even hook some audio cables from your TV to your stereo, it will be worth the effort. The depth charges exploding, the creaking of distant breaking bulkheads, and even the terrifying sonar ""ping"" accent the blind, claustrophobia of the crew's existence on board the submarine.And the ending...No spoilers here other than to ask,""What was it all for?"" Indeed, that question ties into the film's theme quite well.Not only is it fair to state that this film must be seen to be believed, it is equally fair to state that it must be heard to be believed.Ten out Ten.  One of the best ever!"
briancham1994,"Aug 19, 2021",6/10,"I watched the three hour version of this film but it felt like six hours. The tedium is part of the realistic portrayal of the U-Boat life but this was taken too far. To be sure, this stylistic choice was the right way to go, eschewing the overt excitement and action of other similar films. There are several things this film should be commended for: 1) the realistic submarine lifestyle portrayal, 2) the acting behind the distinct characters, 3) the claustrophobic tension and 4) the special effects. These all tie into each other to create a very immersive film that really shows what it was like to be in such an old submarine during World War II. All waiting, no glory. However, this style only paid off during some key scenes. Outside this, it was just an exercise in tedium."
RatedVforVinny,"Nov 4, 2018",10/10,"Whatever version you see, it's a strong candidate for the greatest fil of all time! There has always been a deep interest (even by British Historians) with the German Kreigsmarine and my own fascination stems directly from this incredible movie. For once it's not about the Americans, the British or even about the Germans, but possibly the only war film (ever) to deal with real people and their struggle (in a tense cat and mouse game) for survival. Although there has been highly brave sub-mariners from many nations, they have largely been forgotten: as the chief focus has always been on the most-feared 'Wolf Packs'. Us British were top masters in espionage, as well as inventions such as Radar and Sonar. Active sonar could detect a pen dropping on a desk (within a U-Boat) and once located with passive sonar, it was almost game over! 3 out of 4 Boats never came back home. Nominated for six academy awards, it shamefully won nothing; losing out to 'tootsie'. Go figure that stupidity. 'Das Boot' is quite simply a life changing, true masterpiece of a movie."
JakeBrinkman,"Nov 10, 2019",6/10,"Note: I have only watched the theatrical cut, and my rating is based on that version, but I recommend you watch the director's cut instead.This movie was slightly contradictory with the gritty life on a sub presented so incredibly well, but still awkwardly cutting scenes that had any emotion other than dread. Life on a submarine must have been in a constant state of either boredom or fear, and the film presents that in a way to make the audience feel like they are experiencing those emotions right along with the crew. In dire times, each crew member desperately and doggedly performs their own task, never getting the full picture of what is happening to the sub, hanging on to a thread of hope that somehow their task will keep the sub afloat. The captain gets full knowledge of the sub's condition, but that same knowledge the crew members are desperate for is actually a curse as the captain must make some extremely difficult decisions.The sub's dire moments were nearly the entirety of the screentime, which was both enlightening and frustrating. I wanted a deeper connection with the crew members to give at least a few of them more than one dimension of emotional depth. However, the lengthy runtime didn't allow that deeper emotional level for a theater screen. From what I've read, it sounds like the director's cut contains many more scenes of daily life on the sub that do give deeper connections between the crew members. After reading that, I truly regret watching the theatrical version instead of the DC, and I am very confident the DC deserves a higher rating than the theatrical version."
niemandus-67243,"Oct 27, 2024",4/10,"I just watched the 4h 40min long version of this old film.It was interminably tedious and to me really extremely overrated. Basically a movie about being in a boat for 4 hours. It may be a movie for people who have been in a submarine themselves. It is realistic as far as i am able to say this and i think that is the only reason i can see some people rating this movie so high.Should actually rate it 1 star to even out the overall rating a bit, cause i dont think many (at least younger) people today give it a high rating, but i am normally against such actions so i am giving it a really really fair 4/10 !"
807,"Feb 7, 2010",10/10,"One of the best war movies ever made, Das Boot tells the story of a group of submariners aboard the German U-boot in late 1941.The realism of the images is striking: one can almost smell the putrid scent of those small, confined spaces. The movie strongly resembles ""Black Hawk Down"": the soldiers do not talk about politics, they do not care if they are doing the right thing or the wrong one. They are the professionals, they have to follow their orders. And they do.Had the pleasure to watch the full 208-minute long version, which is probably the definitive one: the 5-hour miniseries, for me, was too long and lost some of the dramaturgy in process."
ccthemovieman-1,"May 6, 2006",8/10,"This 1985 effort was re-issued with a longer VHS version in 1997 with surround sound and 60 minutes added to the original video, then put on DVD with 5.1 surround sound. All these improvements made a good movie even better.Considering most of this 209 minute film is done inside a U-boat, a submarine, it's very nicely filmed. Jurgen Prochnow, who plays the lead character - the captain of the boat - is a manly, rough-looking but compassionate human being who's always attention-getting. Just as interesting as him are the sounds as the noises from the boat echo through all the surround speakers.There are several tense, long drawn-out scenes, sometimes drawn out too long. In that respect, this movie might have been better had it been shorter and tighter. The language is ""crude"" in here in spots, so beware of that.I would recommend going with the German language track with English subtitles. The dubbed version has English spoken with a German accent and isn't easy to understand, anyway.....so stick with the way it was made and go with the subtitles if you don't understand German.In summary: a little long but generally moves at a decent pace and features a good ending to all of it. Recommended."
hdooman,"Jul 2, 2004",10/10,"This is quite possibly the greatest depiction of any period piece. You are immediately taken into the lives of those young men serving on this submarine and you live their lives, literally.How can anyone who gave 'Titanic' a big score possibly rate that abhorrence higher than this masterpiece?Yes, the ending is truly poignant. Yes, the recreation of a World War II submarine is amazing. Watch the Director's Cut with surround sound and you will really believe you are on that sub.Peter Jackson might have taken us slightly into Middle Earth, but Wolfgang Petersen totally immerses us into submarine warfare of the past.As has already been said, this film is a perfect 10."
Boba_Fett1138,"Jun 3, 2003",10/10,"This is easily the best submarine movie ever made! And even better, it's the best European movie of all time and maybe even one of the best war films.This is one of the only movies that shows the story from the ""other side"". You can actually feel along with the Germans and you have sympathy for them. This is because it shows the characters as individual soldiers fighting for their own cost instead as cruel heartless Nazi's. There are even lot's of anti-Nazi feeling expressed by the characters throughout the movie. After 5 minutes you've even forgotten that you're watching a German spoken movie.The characters are all very likable and realistic but the main character of the movie is the submarine itself!The movie is probably the most claustrophobic one ever made. The claustrophobic feeling is created by the excellent camera work that makes you feel that you're really aboard the submarine and you're one of it's crew members. Further more the atmosphere is very gritty and depressing which does good to the movie.The film is actually really tense and can bring you to the edge of your seat. This is mainly because the story avoids every possible cliché and the ending is one of the most surprising endings of all time. The long scene's were nothing really happens are never boring and are a great addition to the movie because it shows the emotions and the feeling of the crew members really well.Truly amazing!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
hostyman,"Nov 14, 2005",10/10,"Being a WW2 buff and having an extensive collection of movies and memorabilia from that era, I feel qualified to state this is one of the better if not the best war movie ever produced.Excellent direction makes it highly believable, almost putting you on the boat with the personnel. It is best watched uninteruppted. Forgo the popcorn until the end.Even though you know many of the boat at sea scenes are not actual, it does not fail to give you the impression that they are on the rough seas. I could almost feel the salt spray envelope me.Don't hesitate to put this one in your collection. You will watch it again and again."
jcanettis,"Apr 20, 2009",10/10,"There are some films that have defined a new genre in cinematography. Wolfgang Petersen's epic ""Das Boot"" is one of them, as it has introduced the ""submarine war film"", a genre that later included hits such as ""The Hunt for the Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"", etc. However, although several fascinating films located in submarines have been produced to date, none can be compared to Petersen's masterpiece. ""Das Boot"", although nearly four hours long and set in basically the same location throughout its duration, is a breath-taking experience during which you are hooked to it from the first moment until the last.""Das Boot"" is the story of U-Boot captain Kapitanleutnant Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Prochnow) a.k.a. ""Der Alte"", and his crew, while they carry out a mission in the Atlantic. The story is viewed through the eyes of war correspondent Lt. Werner (Gronemeyer), who is accompanying the crew in this mission; Werner is standing out as a total stranger in the beginning, but throughout the ordeal he eventually blends completely with the team and becomes an inseparable part of the whole. There are also other theoretically major characters in the film, such as Leitende Fritz Grade, the 1st and 2nd WO, etc., but in the end it boils down that in fact there is NO major character: The major character of the film is actually the U-Boot itself, and all the people inside it are simply parts of this ""character"".Petersen delivers an amazingly claustrophobic atmosphere inside the U-Boot which looks like a human trap. (An example of the unbelievably cramped space is that when the officers are dining, the occasional sailor who needs to pass through asks for ""permission to pass"", and someone has to stand up to make room for him!). More importantly, he is studying exquisitely the personalities inside the U-Boot and their interactions. Several minor sub-plots develop throughout the film, but they simply serve to enhance the major plot, which is none other than the story of the submarine's mission, portrayed from beginning to end.The movie graphically portrays the agony and terror of the crew as they go through their ordeal, as well as their gradual transformation from frightened kids to battle-hardened comrades-in-arms. You cannot escape from empathizing with them: When they almost asphyxiate due to insufficient oxygen, the viewer himself feels that he also needs to gasp for air...When ""Das Boot"" came out in 1981, it became a big hit, and understandably so. But its biggest success has been that it has managed to establish itself as an iconic film, and after nearly 30 years it still the best of the genre it itself has created. 10/10."
SwollenThumb,"Jun 12, 2020",N/A,"One of those rare movies that makes you feel alive while you're watching it. A combination of Melville and Tolstoy in characterisation and story. The three leads are phenomenal. I loved the sense of peace watching the sub gliding along underwater knowing that inside it was sheer bedlam. Technically, still knocks your socks off!"
Samiam3,"Dec 25, 2009",7/10,"Memorable scenes, memorable photography, sights, sound, and suspense. After Titanic Das Boot would be the most perilous thrilling Disaster movie at sea (or under it), unfortunately Titanic's Victory over this is not a small one, but a rather large one. Das Boot, is definitely a white-knuckle and should be watched on as big a screen as possible with the volume up. you'll find more potency in this picture than anything Hollywood throws these days, Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay are no Match for Das Boot. Unfortunately the film needs more.Das Boot is a conundrum. The protagonists are Nazis, meaning you have to ask yourself whether it is best to root for or against them. Das Boot tries to direct your empathy toward its handful of German sailors by presenting human qualities about them, but in the end you don't really care enough. Like Titanic, Das Boot turns into a tragedy, but this is not a movie that will leave you tear stricken. I will say this for Das Boot, it represents the biggest German production that I have seen to this day, and also the longest. Some scenes contain feeble uninteresting dialogue but you forget about them the moment, Das Boot shows its teeth.A combination of skilled editing, camera-work, directing, and clever use of sound effects, make das Boot a sensational thriller. A good part of it has to do with the claustrophobia on board. The movie wouldn't have worked if it were any shorter than three hours, which is why the director's cut is the way to go.As so many films do, Das Boot carries the following message ""war is not glorious"". Young men board a U-boat with expectations of glory and heroism to come, and when they return they are bruised, shaken, confused and disturbed. I've seen the message delivered more potently in other war films like All Quiet on the Western Front, but few War films give you a punch to the gut like Das Boot.I am impressed, but not overwhelmed"
Sylviastel,"Feb 24, 2007",10/10,"Let's face Germany has a dangerous past. This story is about men aboard a submarine during World War II. I saw it dubbed in English. I would have preferred subtitles and listened to the original German language being spoken. This film is completely German made with German actors. Of course, the story is not lost in translation. These men have to fight for their country regardless of whether they support their government. It's really about young men who could be any one of us in their position. You have to ask yourself what are you to do if you have no choice. I was a little disturbed when one of them stated that he was molested by six of the other guys like a ritual hazing ceremony to another officer. It was as if an unofficial initiation ceremony and disturbing as well. In war, you could see young men killing and dying and you wonder what it was all for anyway. It's still Germany's best film to date."
valipopa28,"Jun 1, 2020",6/10,"Even now, looking at it's length, you can feel that it was once something. Yes, there is a claustrophobic nightmare in a submarine. Like rats in a psycho laboratory. But it's too old looking, snail rhythm, sleepy. I died on that Boot long before the ending."
Falko_h1,"Jul 11, 2024",5/10,"""Das Boot,"" directed by Wolfgang Petersen, is an ambitious war film that immerses viewers in the claustrophobic world of a German U-boat during World War II. I watched the director's cut version, which, at over three and a half hours, certainly aims for an in-depth portrayal of life aboard the submarine.While the film's authenticity and attention to detail are commendable, the extended runtime introduces several unnecessary and boring parts that detract from the overall experience. The narrative often slows to a crawl, making it challenging to stay engaged throughout. The crew's daily routines, while initially interesting, become repetitive and drawn-out, testing the viewer's patience.The performances are strong, with Jürgen Prochnow standing out as the submarine's captain, effectively conveying the tension and despair of the crew's situation. The film's technical aspects, such as the sound design and cinematography, are impressive and contribute to the immersive atmosphere.However, the director's cut version's excessive length and pacing issues prevent ""Das Boot"" from being the gripping war drama it could have been. The film's potential is overshadowed by its inability to maintain momentum, making it a mixed viewing experience."
SargeAD,"Jan 13, 2002",10/10,"This movie is absolutely fantastic.  Brilliant acting, haunting soundtrack, and a fantastic, unexpected ending.  Brilliant use of suspense not used in Tripe like U-571, sound effects produce a truly unnerving viewing experience.  Overall effect is like being stuck inside the fetid, stinking can with the sweaty, terrified crew.  Simply yet effectively shows the sad futility of war, and is an excellent epitaph to the 30,000 U-boat men who died in WW2.  A must see."
truemythmedia,"Jun 26, 2019",10/10,"Simply stated: ""Das Boot"" is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of submarine war movies. Other films like ""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""Crimson Tide"" barely hold a candle to the nail-biting, claustrophobic world of Petersen's ""Das Boot"". Where other submarine war movies try to excite you with action and excitement, this film tries to instill in you the fear of war that these men would've faced, tries to give you a glimpse of the boredom they would've felt before their missions, and it helps you to understand the way of life on a submarine during wartime. There are scenes that make the viewer feel like we're right there in the darkened passages of that German U-boat with the men, waiting on baited breath to see if the submarine will ever surface again. It's intense, invigorating, and exhausting, but it's also and unforgettable journey, one that I will be happy to revisit again and again.

Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,"Jun 18, 2008",10/10,"This is the restored, 209-minute director's cut of Wolfgang Petersen's harrowing and claustrophobic U-boat thriller, which was theatrically re released in 1997. Originally made as a five-hour miniseries, this version devotes more time to getting to know the crew before they and their stoic captain (Jürgen Prochnow) get aboard their U-boat and find themselves stranded at the bottom of the sea. Das Boot puts you inside that submerged vessel and explores the physical and emotional tensions of the situation with a vivid, terrifying realism that few movies can match. As Petersen tightens the screws and the submerged ship blows bolts, the pressure builds to such unbearable levels that you may be tempted to escape for a nice walk on solid land in the great outdoors--only you wouldn't dream of looking away from the screen."

sffres,"Oct 7, 2020",10/10,"My suggestion is to watch directors cut, then rewatch it again with commentary.
Amazing attention to details, authentic german dialogues, authentic uboot recreation, equipment & crew. I cannot believe this is an 80s movie."
colonel-13070,"Aug 30, 2021",10/10,"Absolutely one of the best war films ever made. And incredibly accurate portrayal of submarine life during World War II. The visual effects, claustrophobic atmosphere, the filth and the constant fear and struggle for survival was incredibly depicted. I am 100% American all the Way, but this was a great portrayal of submarine life from the German perspective and should be in your library of military war films. Well done."
cannibalchuck,"Aug 6, 2004",N/A,"The early 80's seemed too soon for a movie like ""Das Boot."" The few old men who fought there that live today were more plentiful then, and there was a feeling when I saw the marquee that this would open old wounds. By gleaning actual events from the journals of the men who served on these boats, Peterson caught the attention of the world by setting their stories on one ship. From the bad-luck sinking of a vessel under sail to the suicide of one captain, Peterson showed us an eerie slice of life as it was on a submarine, regardless of which side you were on. The ever-present filth was almost palpable, as was the stark contrast of rations between submariners and regular ships. The ending was necessarily tragic. Though the subtitles can be difficult, it is well worth seeing the director's cut. Perhaps ""Das Boot"" will disprove the axiom about how history is always written by the victor. -Chuck"
view_and_review,"Dec 17, 2019",7/10,"I'm a firm believer that no movie should be over three hours. Once you reach the three hour mark you need to be a mini-series. Das Boot is no exception, but with the wonders of modern technology it wasn't too hard to watch it in phases.This movie is a strange concept. It's a sympathetic view of a German U-Boat crew during WWII. The beating hearts in all of us saw a crew of men dealing with the claustrophobic and coffin-like conditions of a submarine constantly bombarded with ""enemy"" fire. Then our brain said, ""You know this is the enemy right? We should be rooting for their demise."" And it's true--we should be rooting for their failure because their success was a win for Hitler.This is the first movie I've ever seen about the Nazis in which they weren't these well-dressed, ice cold machines. This is the most human I've ever seen them portrayed. I suppose it's easier to hate a people that lack human qualities, hence the inhuman portrayal (and for good reason). As I was watching Das Boot I found myself not thoroughly hating them even though I knew they had to lose. Whether their losing meant dying or not was something I was leaving to the film creators, but losing was a must."
kairingler,"Jul 10, 2013",10/10,"how can someone not give this a perfect 10, first off this is the only authentic submarine movie ever made. yeah I liked u-571, but this is way more realistic,, I love all of the German U-boats running around in the water. i'm German so I have a love of all things German, Juergen pruchnow deserves 2 Oscars for his performance,, his best acting to date as far as i'm concerned,, Das Boot is a journey into madness, to see all of the men's heart's breaking with each ""ping"" , I love all of the camera angels used, where you get up close and personal feeling of being right there in the little U-boat.. the War terminology was realistic,, all of the sea lanes and plotting,, navigation tools.. even the rare parts of the movie that are not filmed in or around water were very good,, if you can get the director's cut,, the special features are a must watch.. I would recommend to any film buff that this is one movie that you must watch,, because of how riveting and bold this is,, also very sad and you feel for all involves,, I also felt very bad for the German captain"
bbird-29353,"May 21, 2017",3/10,"Applauded by many for how realistic it is for submarine life. But I was surprised at how sloppy obvious details were overlooked. I lost track of how often the sub was in 10 - 15 foot seas and the next scene (elapsed time < 5 minutes), the water was totally flat. Or, vice-versa. In one scene the captain is tracking a destroyer in heavy seas. His periscope is constantly awash in waves, obscuring his view. Instead of ordering the sub to rise a meter or two, he maintains depth. Of course, the destroyer almost rams him. Would a real seasoned captain have made this mistake? Elsewhere in the movie, the sub receives several radiograms on the activity of other subs. Yet, he almost collides with another sub far out into the Atlantic. No radio communication between the two? In the final scene, two fighters attack the port with machine guns. Multiple bomb explosions occur (too many for two one-bomb fighters) *before* the planes arrive where the explosions are occurring. Yes, it's a movie of human interaction and survival, but where were the technical consultants tasked to ensure these kinds of mistakes didn't occur?"

phil-83737,"Jun 27, 2020",10/10,"I've seen this film many many times and also the full mini series. It follows the story of a German U boat crew during WW2 and their fight for survival. There are no stereotypical cliches just plenty of gripping drama and action. Its gripping and explains the full horror of what U boat crews endured. The most haunting piece is at the start, the message simply reads in WW2 40,000 men went to sea on U boats, 30,000 never returned. It's a must watch."
dongeorge-314-933,"Mar 14, 2012",9/10,"The underwater battles somewhat remind me of Sergio Leone in that Wolfgang Peterson takes forever and a day to get the fights started. Unlike Leone, once the torpedos are launched and the depth charges dropped, the cat-and-mouse game is ongoing and relentless, but never boring.And despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine, Das Boot is never boring to look at; in fact, it's a visually spectacular film (given the dated special effects, who hold up reasonably well and add to the old-school charm). And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters -- particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war -- it is both haunting and beautiful.Jurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I've ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he's forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.The rest of the cast also delivers amazingly believable performances, and trust me, I could write an entire review on the film's characters and their portrayals. It's both disappointing and satisfying that I'm not given enough space to do so (I wish I could state that about a tenth of the films I've reviewed here on IMDb.) I liked the entire crew of this U-boat, the war correspondent and his character arc as he realizes the truth behind these ""heroes"", the chief and his longing to return to his wife, Johann and the story of his redemption--all well cast, well acted, and believable.Another aspect I adored about Das Boot - the controversial scenes simply rolled by with no more or less emphasis than any other statement the film makes. In fact, I saw the film before really reading anything or researching it and found myself somewhat shocked to hear about these ""talked about"" scenes. Granted, the film does pose some moral questions, but I felt the film handled it with grace and great subtlety, showing what it needs to get the point across and not a step further . . . unlike typical Hollywood where controversy gets bold print, italics, and a highlighter. Maybe I should move to Germany."
PartialMovieViewer,"May 29, 2012",10/10,"I would like to start off by criticizing this movie – alas - I could not find anything bad to say about it. Conversely I could mention the good things in this movie, but that would be a put-down. This flick was awesome in all respects. The filming was so remarkableI got so involved. I felt so claustrophobic even in my living room. I could almost sense the pressure closing in on me when the boat went below crush-depth - at one point I went out to my garage to make sure I had plenty of wood for shoring. And then when the boat started rocking and rolling in seas-state-oh-my-God, I broke out my puke-bag in order to join the crew in their vomit-orchestra. I sat glued to this movie for over 2 hours and ended up wanting two more hours – and then two more on top of them. The filming was excellent, or as they would say, 'amazing in Germany' – ahhhh - oh yeah - 'amazing in Germany'. I have been on US subs a number of times and these U-boats were tiny compared to the boats now-a-days. If you need an idea as to how small these guys are, check out the U-505 in Chicago. I don't like to do this too much because it does take away from another's work, but comparing the perceived size of the sub in U-571 and this u-boat – U-571 would be a tractor-trailer and this boat would be a 'Smart Car'. Anyways, the cast was superb. I do not speak German, but with this kind of acting – well I knew. I mean I really, really knew when it was time to dive, and I knew when we – oops – I mean they were in serious doo-doo (trouble), and mostly, I knew that the bread would really suck if someone didn't shave off the mold. You see - I knew. And that was due to the superb acting. OH, and I did get a little translation help form the English dubbed version I own. No-no-no I would have still known. I wish I had written this when I first saw this flick in a cinema – but I waited and forgot about it until I popper it in the DVD player last night. I do hope to see more like this."

Truer words have never been printed.This was probably the most intense & claustrophobic 3 and a half hours of movie I have ever experienced.  It makes other submarine movies seem tame.It was interesting to see that even the much demonised Nazi war machine were in many ways as human as the rest of us.

Dragonsouls,"Feb 5, 2002",N/A,"This movie was simply outstanding. The sense of tension and realism i felt was so real, that i actually broke a sweat sitting still on my couch while listening for sounds of depth charges!! You almost feel as if you are on the submarine with these guys. I sure would hate being trapped in a narrow tin-can which is in fact a weapon, and is not made to provide comfort. Simply Remarkable filmaking, and definatly one of the best war movies of all time. If you enjoyed U-571, and you haven't experienced Das Boot, then go out right now and buy the director's cut. The movie is over 3 hours long, but i stood glued to the tube the whole time, never once did I become bored with this movie. The acting was just top-notch and you must watch it with the english subtitles for the realistic affect. Through the whole movie you never even see a Nazi symbol, or flag. These Germans were just young soldiers misled and forced to battle. Even as they destroyed a British ship, they cried. They were young, and you could't help but feel for them. I liked U-571, I thought it was very good, but Das Boot is on another level. I rate this movie a 10 out of 10 and **** 4 stars."
donut_whistle_blower,"Feb 8, 2005",9/10,"Actually it does not do the movie justice to call it a war movie. The war movie genre doesn't lend itself to many classics. For me the movie is about male camaraderie in the face of grim, overwhelming circumstances. The stoic captain maintains discipline below the waves despite everything. He is perfectly cast. It is one of those few movies that actually improves with each viewing. Apart from the above, the movie is also interesting in that it is from the German viewpoint (and made by Germans). The acting is superb and the scenes realistic. As with most foreign language movies, it should be watched subtitled. (Although the movie makes we want to go out and learn German, just to experience the movie more fully)"
FlickJunkie-2,"Apr 15, 2000",10/10,"I don't think there are enough superlatives in the English language to adequately describe this film.   It succeeds in every possible way.  This is not only one of the best war movies ever, but among the very best films period.  The story is based on a true story of a German Submarine and its crew during WWII.  The plot is simple.  A bunch of ordinary young guys are crammed into a little tin can and go out and do their duty while trying to avoid getting killed.  This slice of life film gives a chillingly detailed look at the rigors of war in a U-boat.We are treated to the stark reality of submarine warfare; the hours of boredom; the camaraderie and simultaneous aggravation that comes with living in such close quarters, the exultation of victory when a torpedo hits, the stark terror of the sound of a destroyer's propeller just above or the insane fear of the boat being crushed by the water pressure as you go too deep.This film is unique in that it is done from the German perspective.  Most films about WWII are from the Allied perspective since they were produced in Hollywood or England.  What is striking about this film is how it depicts war as a human event rather than a nationalistic conflict.  It makes us realize that for the foot soldier and sailor on the battle lines, no matter what side, war is the same.  It is more a matter of survival than glory.Director Wolfgang Peterson did a brilliant job on this film.  The set and props were authentic in minute detail and the work in tight quarters was truly remarkable.  You get a real sense of the cramped quarters and how nimble the men had to be scrambling from compartment to compartment. Peterson spares us none of the unpleasantness of submarine life.  The stark reality of it is startling.By far Peterson's greatest accomplishment is the spine tingling suspense. The effect is so terrifying you feel like you are part of the crew.  His use of angles, lighting, actor's reactions and most especially sound makes this film far more frightening and suspenseful than anything the horror genre has ever produced.   I viewed this on DVD (Director's Cut) and the sound was probably the best I've ever experienced.  You hear water dripping behind you, bolts explode and go screaming diagonally across the room to clank on the other side, the sound of the destroyer's propeller escalates from a fly buzz to a roar as the ping from the sonar gets ever louder.  You find every muscle in your body tensing as you hear them drop the depth charges.The ending is superb.  It is triumphant, poignant and ironic; unexpected and yet not surprising.  It is neither what the viewer is apt to want nor expect, and yet it is not disappointing.I can't think of any negative criticism I would give this film.  It was nominated for six Academy Awards and won none.  That speaks volumes about the dubious nature of the Academy.  Even if you don't normally enjoy war movies, you should see this film.  It is ultra excellent drama, entertainment and filmmaking.  A perfect 10."
kristensen-1,"Mar 13, 2005",10/10,"Jürgen Prochnow plays his part superbly, and if I'm not mistaken it was this part which propelled him on to Hollywood. Appreciate a WWII-movie with actual Germans playing the parts of the Germans - When the movie was dubbed into English for USA and UK distribution, all of the principal actors actually dubbed their own voices into English.Bear in mind that German submarines had the highest rate of casualties all through the war. We all despite submariners due to their predatory stalking attacks, as well as none of us envy them their deaths below the surface when the hull breaks and the ship implodes, drowning the men in the cold dark sea ...A testimony to the very special men that served and still serves in these ships, no matter what flag they carry."
andrews-m-i,"Oct 25, 2006",10/10,"Hi people. Iam the person who asked the question,do other women like jurgen prochnow. I now feel that my simple posting was perhaps not clever or detailed enough.I now feel very silly so, to prove i can talk about das boot in a more intellectual way, please indulge my hurt pride and read on. I honestly don't enjoy das boot for the captain alone. I have loved this film for a number of years now, i have loved it for many different reasons. Give me a chance to explain them. Please keep reading even if i do not express myself very well. I mentioned how in charge the captain seems to be and how this gives him sex appeal. However it is far deeper than that. Das boot is almost unique in that it is a totally male dominated film. I love how the men talk freely to each other about anything and everything without a woman to interrupt them. I like the way they interact with each other, or not as the case may be. Outwardly das boot is cold and stark and cruel. All those people locked together, forever in each others way. Inwardly the film has a soft and gentle side. One of great emotions. Fear and loneliness. It even has a spiritual side, or at least i think so. The man who has command of a situation like this has a special appeal. I get so involved that i want to mother some of the crew, befriend some of them and be the lover of others. The whole thing would be ruined if a woman came on board. Iam a woman and its like listening and viewing out of bounds territory. But the captain is hot, i want him to kiss me all over and then kiss him back, oh no, now i sound silly again so i will stop."

gavin6942,"May 7, 2010",8/10,"What makes ""Das Boot"" such a fine film, beyond the artistic merits, is its portrayal of Nazi soldiers as real people. Most, if not all, American films tend to have Nazis as inhuman monsters who want nothing more than to kill everyone and take over the world. I think the reality is a bit less dramatic.Here, some of the men doubt Hitler's greatness and are merely doing a job they had to do. Weeks, months under the sea eating questionable food in tight quarters. In many ways, they are no different from American (or any other) military men. Their propaganda films move them to new levels not much differently than our films did and do.Beyond that, again, there are technical and artistic merits to be had. The claustrophobic nature of the film was masterfully shot, and we could not have fully sympathized with these men without the aid of the lighting, camera and sound. Truly a modern masterpiece."
CinemaClown,"Oct 15, 2013",N/A,"Awesome. AWEsome. AWESOME Cinema. Das Boot is one of the finest war films I have ever seen and arguably the best to come out from Germany. In spite of the film showing the plight of German's navy in the Second World War, the drama & every filmmaking aspect is so carefully handled that we can't help but root for the lives of the German soldiers trapped in the submarine. Highly gripping in spite of its long runtime, very well directed by Wolfgang Peterson, superbly acted by all its cast, in addition to its insane realism, nail-biting suspense, stunning use of sound, wonderful cinematography, classic music & an unrelenting claustrophobic atmosphere, Das Boot is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the greatest motion pictures of all time & certainly the best submarine film ever made."
SpelingError,"Jul 15, 2022",7/10,"This is a really good film which flies by surprisingly quickly, in spite of its nearly 3.5 hour runtime. I must confess though that it leaves me somewhat cold since it falls in the 'characters feel like props amidst the action/suspense set pieces' category. With the exception of the Captain and (to a smaller extent) Johann, most of the other characters (the Chief Engineer, the 2nd Watch Officer, and Ullmann) are given only one character trait to stand out, and the movie doesn't even do much with that character trait to begin with. Also, Werner, who I think is intended to be the main character, is easily the blandest of the bunch. In spite of this, I do enjoy the movie quite a bit as, judging the film through the lens of the suspense and claustrophobia it creates, it's pretty fantastic. The sounds and visuals (the radar showing the ship's depth, the ship creaking from water pressure, the darkness of the cabin) work in harmony to make the film technically outstanding. The highlight of the film is when their ship faces a British fleet and are forced to dive well below the sub's test depth. The various large and small scale set pieces within that sequence are highly memorable and the conclusion clinches it as one of the greatest stretches of cinema I've ever seen. I also like how you never get the sense that the U-boat is at an advantage against the enemy ships. After all, the opening text says all that's needed to be said about how the crew was basically sent on a suicide mission. From what we see, their boat seems rather flimsy given how often they have to take shelter and only by carefully sneaking up to an enemy ship will they have a chance of sinking it. Overall, I have a ton of respect for this film's technical craft. I just wish it would grab me more on an emotional level. I might watch the mini series someday though as it may do a better job with that."
Michael-11,"Mar 7, 2000",10/10,"It would be too easy to stumble over superlatives while writing about this movie.  I'll try to avoid this trap.Never before has a war movie so moved me as did Das Boot.  No WWII-era film before it has.  None of the ""Oh My God I'm A Monster"" Vietnam-era films has. Watching this movie has made me feel sympathy for a class of soldier I had hitherto considered contemptible.Nothing more needs to be said."
alifragis,"Oct 16, 2021",6/10,"The movie is 2,5 hours close facial views of the untalented actor that plays the captain. However, the simulation of action and underwater environment is definitely impressive for its time.Brilliant work from director , not from most actors though..."
The_Real_Review,"Sep 14, 2023",5/10,"Being a big fan of war movies I was hoping this to be much better than it turned out. Watching the Director's cut at 3 hours and 28 minutes was an ordeal I did over two days since I kept falling asleep. This film is far too long for no real reason and includes tons of meaningless scenes.The limited action scenes involve them diving ever deeper to escape attack only for the Allied depth charges to detonate exactly next to their hull every time no matter their depth. The chase scenes are set to a crappy Mannheim Steamroller sounding music score composed by the German jazz musician Klaus Doldinger that does not hold up at all.While the U-boat set is excellent and historically accurate, the scenes of them running on the surface unfortunately look fake as if the production crew is throwing buckets of water at them. They make no use of their deck gun throughout the film even though that was their preferred way to attack ships, saving their torpedoes for bigger targets.The best part of the film are the logistics, operation and repairs of their U-boat. So much could have been done with this film to make it so much better and still retained its historical accuracy. The far superior film Greyhound (2020) did more justice to the U-boat crews than unfortunately this did. This story needs to be told but this is not the film to tell it."
grantss,"Apr 25, 2016",10/10,"Brilliant, intense, realistic, gritty WW2 drama.1941 and the Battle of the Atlantic - German U-boats versus freighters supplying Britain - is underway. We see this struggle from the side of a German U-boat crew, U-96. We see them relaxing and having fun in port, the boredom of patrol, the tension of stalking a convoy and the sheer terror when they become the hunted.Superb military drama. Probably the most accurate depiction of wartime submarine life you'll ever see, and surely one of the most realistic war dramas ever made. Incredibly tense at times and extremely enthralling.Quite novel for its time in that it is a WW2 story told from the German perspective.Superb plot, great action scenes, especially for its time, and solid performances. Hard to find a fault with this. A masterpiece."

n-bogdanovic,"May 5, 2006",10/10,"For me the atmosphere of a film is the most important thing. Pictures go directly to the brain. They create the atmosphere. In a lucky chance it goes hand in hand with the story, the actors, technique and last not least the music that approximate this. As a child I watched Star Wars in cinema (though I wasn't allowed to, I went in there with my father) and in a blink of a second I was sure that it was the best film of the universe. I don't know if I kept my mouth shut even for a second. Today it relativized a little bit, but a film that touches me at best for most of the term is outstanding in my view. I think I can only say something to the atmosphere of this film when I made my military service. Now I got a slight idea of what those poor men went through. All they said and thought seems so realistic. Heroic behavior occurred maybe at the beginning but that was kept them out of mischief during the turn and as far the submarine sank we came to see the characters of humans in extreme situations. On the other hand there was an inhuman and megalomaniac system that was far away, though, but reached with it's cold fingers into the last corner of the boat and the soldiers had to face the music the Nazis engaged. The outer circumstances that describe the time remind me of the master work Tin Drum and I just believe that the description is well. The music is congenial. All in all it is an intense warning. A warning I can't forget."
Sergeant_Tibbs,"Oct 17, 2007",9/10,"Calling Das Boot a masterpiece is an understatement. Words cannot express my sheer love for this film. With an extraordinary length, its a non-stop excitement rush. (Like only La Haine and Magnolia before); it goes above and beyond perfection. Not sure of any subtle depth it may or may not have, but on film-making terms it tops the list. A rewarding adventure and an unforgettable experience. Recommended to anyone and everyone who likes a great film.It begins by stating a simple fact of the war (40,000 soldiers went to war but only 10,000 came back) in an effort to gain some pre-sympathy for the men we are about to watch; which I think is highly effective for the end result. From start to finish our eyes never leave either the captain of the boat or the journalist writing an article from a soldier of a submarine's point of view. This means the film never strays from the point and becomes extremely easy to follow; also shown by the fact they're only off the boat for about half an hour in the entire running time. Its dark yet vibrant colour keeps your attention; that of course is not the only aspect keeping attention. To sum up the film entirely I would say its about how much pressure the submarine can take which relies on how much pressure the men can take.A brilliant direction and extremely detailed from Petersen, giving the perfect claustrophobic atmosphere by filming it inside the boat instead of from a side view (so little space there wasn't enough room to shoot it with sound – making that aspect even more outstanding). Several long takes throughout gives us a better feel for the atmosphere; almost feels like its point of view from someone, therefore making it a more personal experience. Dangerous realism ensues, with close encounters to water, fire and other explosions, so much so that I wasn't sure whether it was genuine fear or not. All of these aspects and their intensity make the tension almost unbearable. It keeps the tension by simply waiting for a reaction from something or anything. Even though the films simple structure means you know they aren't going to die now. It's triumphant score is underused yet doesn't need to be overdone. He offers subplots to avoid the film from being empty.All the actors were completely immersed in their roles, its hard to believe they ever really did leave the boat. Their emotions of fear, happiness, uncertainty and sadness transfers straight from the screen to the viewer. The endless conflict is understandable and entertaining. Perfect deliveries throughout, which the subtitles do no justice to, unfortunately. Strong characters, especially the captain, who's ever contemplating with always something interesting to say. Powerful and explosive. Quiet and subtle. The huge range. The film gets its length from the extraordinary amount of detail it puts it. Yet it never gets boring. They all become ""heroes"" just for being there whether they deserved it or not. Propaganda of the sort, in an effort of encouragement I guess. But the experience does thrash all the emotion out of them, leaving them only with fear.The film shows the only symbol of man being a beard, with all the men, bar one man who acts like a child under the pressure. They are left with only simple pleasures, like music. The boat could be more of an escape from the war than heading towards it, as no casualties happen until the final 10 minutes once they are off the submarine. Even though some of the men were looking forward to getting into battle. It does not ignore the fact the soldiers would be suffering from such things as homesickness, sexual frustration, claustrophobia and of course nits (particularly in the pubic area); taking time to present them all. There is not a moment in the film that is not perfect. It would get a bit tiring after a while if it ever took its time for the next important sequence.Das Boot fits perfectly and equally into all its genres (war, drama and thriller) making one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever had. Top 15 easily.10/10"
saytosandeep,"Dec 30, 2013",8/10,"Das Boot. The claustrophobic world of a WWII German U-boat; boredom, filth, and sheer terror. It is not an easy movie to watch because it needs your patience and attention throughout its long duration but if you are ready to endure, it is quite an engaging, emotionally moving, technically perfect and equipped with amazing performances. Half an hour into the movie and you will be right in the middle of the life of people of the boat and living every moment be it joy, sorrow, boredom or fear. Actually Das Boot is one of those movies where you feel that you are running short of right words to describe what did you feel while watching this epic battle of those soldiers. The climax scene might leave you empty, devastated but most of the running time it is the story of hope even when there is no hope. All I can say, if you feel movies are great medium to understand the lives of others then you gotta see this one."
roarshock,"Aug 10, 2000",N/A,"You know, I can hardly remember Private Ryan, but it's going on twenty years since I've seen Das Boot and I can still call up a multitude of scenes in my mind.  And not only the scenes but the emotions of the characters.  This is a rare and superlative film."
frankde-jong,"Nov 18, 2022",7/10,"The functions of the U boats in the Second World War was to prevent the trade across the Atlantic Ocean between the United States and allied Europe. In the beginning of the war they were quite successful. In 1942 (the year in which the film is situated) the advancement of the sonar technology and the breaking of the enigma code (""The imitation game"" , 2014, Morten Tyldum) had greatly reduced their effectivenes.In 1942 75% of the crew of a U boat didn't return alive from a mission. This explains the opening scene in which the crew is having an extensive orgy before departure. The scene vaguely reminded me of the orgy scene in ""The damned"" (1969, Luchino Visconti).After departure the film alternates between action scenes and waiting scenes. The waiting scenes are dominating in the longer directors cut.The tension of the action scenes derives from the choice the crew has to make between evading the deep water bombs and not letting the water pressure of the deap sea getting too high. The soundtrack with water noises adds much to this tension.More impressive however are the waiting scenes, illustrating the effects of claustrophobia, boredom and loneliness on the crew. There are no women on board, but many boys do have a girlfriend. They kill their spare time writing letters to these girls, hoping they can post these letters in the next docking city.The film is about German soldiers, but they are certainly not the bad guys. They aren't heroes either, as is illustrated by the scene in which they refuse to save the drowning people of a ship they just sunk. Most of all they are ordinary young guys, victims of history. See for example how one of the boys worries a lot about the fate of his pregnant French girlfriend and his child (once born). How will they be treated by the locals after te war? From these scene it can be deduced that the boys are very aware of the fact that in the end Germany will lose the war (and of the fact that there is a big chance they will die, as indicated earlier).Horror movies often need a secluded environment from which no escape is possible. Submarines evidently meet this criterium. Nevertheless submarines are almost exclusively the setting of war like movies (see also ""The hunt for the Red October"" (1990, John MvTiernan)). This unlike for example space ships (see for example ""Aliens"" (1986, James Cameron))."

SAMTHEBESTEST,"May 25, 2020",8/10,"Das Boot (1981) :
Brief Review -A Classic German Submarine Film shines even Brighter in extended Director's Cut. I have not seen any german film till date and neither i have seen any submarine film except one ordinary attempt in Bollywood (The Ghazi Attack), but if German films are like this then i want to see more and more. Das Boot has just generated the respect for German Cinema in my heart. The storyline is nothing less than an inspirating tale as it travels from extreme worst death situations to the sunshine of life. This emerging writing makes Das Boot an unforgettable adventure as well as an inspiration for lifetime. Besides, it is a great cinematic achievement for German Cinema and to be more precise even bigger than Hollywood at the time of it's release. The narrative completely choked me in it from the beginning and i started feeling being the one from the crew members of the Boat. Apparently, that made me gasp, shiver and rack my nerves for that filth and scare. I watched the 209 minutes version, that Director's cut of the film just to see if it bores me but it didn't. Holding the narrative for 209 minutes is a tough job you know and the entire crew of Das Boot deserves kudos for it. I always say a War film has to be atmospheric and Wolfgang Petersen knew it before me saying it i guess. The tension is built because of atmosphere around or else it would have never given me any chills. Thank you Mr. Petersen for this shivering and gasping adventure and drama. I should be giving it a repeat watch again and again for sure.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest"
Bob_647,"Jun 14, 2020",9/10,"The film is like a documentary in its impact. Although we become familiar with several of the characters, it is not their story, really, but the story of a single U-boat mission, from beginning to end. There is a brief opening sequence in which the boat puts out to sea from a French base, and a refueling sequence near the end, but all the other scenes are shot inside the cramped sub, or on the bridge.Part of the ""power"" of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction. So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over acting, and over blown images. Too much. These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level. Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen. Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital ""W"". It is reality, not a grand concept. The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.And it's not shot in tidy setups, either; the cinematographer, Jost Vacano, hurtles his camera through the boat from one end to the other, plunging through cramped openings, hurdling obstacles on the deck, ducking under hammocks and swinging light fixtures. There are long sequences here--especially when the boat is sinking out of control--when we feel trapped in the same time and space as the desperate crew.And despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine, Das Boot is never boring to look at; in fact, it's a visually spectacular film (given the dated special effects, who hold up reasonably well and add to the old-school charm). And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters. Particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war. It is both haunting and beautiful.Das Boot gives us plenty of time to know these characters, discover how they kill time while waiting for orders, how they feel about their job and each other. Then when the action finally starts: how they deal with the possibility of dying deep underwater, how they react to the sounds of a sub going deeper than it should, the look on their faces as a destroyer is heard pinging them, and dozens of little personality quirks--subtle details that bring the crew to life. It truly does feel like an epic about a submarine crew, and I'm interested in some day viewing the 6 hour TV version.Jurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I've ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he's forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.I can go on for a long while: over three hours of wonderful visuals and strong performances, a sparse but great score (this film's lack of music is quite appropriate, making the presence of music much more impact in its key places). Realistic writing from people who lived the experience first hand. As I said, I can go on for awhile but I'll sum it up and end this review with one statement: Das Boot is the definitive submarine movie."
murphyt83,"Jul 19, 2009",10/10,"this film is epic and quite accurate from start to finish...the acting not only from the main cast but from the extras was superb, the facial expressions showed the true emotion of what a real navy crew of submariners would have experienced in these situations and the sly glances that the crew give each other at certain times are brilliant!im not going to go into detail of what its about because im sure you might have guess that already !a true masterpiece...p.s its a pity the main character (Jürgen Prochnow) went to Hollywood after this because it seemed to have ruined his talent for truly great acting..."
Joshua_Copeland,"Apr 10, 2015",9/10,"Words cannot describe this film. In fact words would not do this film justice in any way, shape or form. However ,against my better judgment, I'm going to attempt it ...Rarely do I award films in my native tongue 9 stars let alone foreign films. Das Boot is the exception in every sense of the word! It's foreign it has absolutely no subtitles yet I couldn't get enough.In fact I was so enthralled with this film interpreting every move, nuance and facial expression that this ended up being one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my entire life.This is the film that changed cinema for me. It opened doors that had never been opened previously.This is not a film for everyone. In fact the subject matter would turn many off I'd imagine. This is intense, dark, and moody film. With small doses of humor mixed in for good measure.You must enjoy intensity, embrace the full gamut of human emotion and appreciate artistic expression.Quite a bit of depth here.Not for the shallow, impatient or lighthearted. Probably a sleep inducing film for some.However this is just what the doctor ordered in my case.Enjoy!"
jfkvanover,"Jul 2, 2001",N/A,"If you skip over this movie, you will have missed an important work, and the opportunity to observe WWII from the 'other' side.As a tanker who went to Desert Storm, I have to point at ""Kelly's Heroes"", or maybe ""Patton"", as the movie that shows how it was to do what I did... I have to say that these movies MUST pale in comparison to the accurate description of the horrors and honor of serving one's country on a Submarine during WW2.This movie affects the viewer, deeply.  Once the sub puts to sea, the viewer is part of the crew.  The characters are well-rounded and believable... human enough to bring emotional responses to what happens to them.I've seen this movie many times... if you haven't, then you should treat yourself to the sub-titled version... the raw emotion and power of this German view of war is amazing, and causes me to reconsider the opinion of 'the enemy' of my grandfather.This movie is by far the best naval movie that I know of... a must for any Military Movie DVD collection.Jim"
adamjohns-42575,"Oct 25, 2022",7/10,"Das Boot (1981) -I was glad that the version I saw wasn't dubbed, because I prefer it with the subtitles. It feels more authentic that way and nothing gets lost with regards to temperament and intonation.It was hard to listen to though, because the German language constantly shouted was quite a tough sound on my ears. It was like Frau Farbissina from 'Austin Powers' (1997-2002) had trained a whole crew to be just like her. Combined with the explosions and ocean sounds it was a real cacophony.I felt claustrophobic just watching the crew walk through the corridors of the sub within the first few minutes and was glad that it wasn't an interactive experience, because I would have actually died.I will also never understand why they insisted on wearing so many layers and jumpers in what was clearly a very hot vehicle. There must have been puddles of sweat filling the sub, more than any leaks ever would.I personally love a big hard tube full of sweaty sexy semen, but sadly the version that I watched seemed to have cut the two scenes where some of them get their buns out, which was disappointing, because the crew were mostly quite handsome.It was odd that, even though most films would normally have me wanting the crew to succeed in their mission, I found that there was some sort of programming in me that couldn't want the Germans to win. I would hope that it was because the story was a moment within an historic event, in which both of my Grandfathers fought in the navy and not some imbedded prejudice still felt towards the people of Germany.However, I also didn't want to see any of the characters hurt or killed, so I'm assuming that must mean that I'm not a complete racist monster.I wanted all of these men to get home safely to their families, but I didn't want them to blow up any British ships, because it felt unfaithful to my Grandads, like wishing they had been blown up instead of surviving.Maybe I have been indoctrinated to support the home team first, but I would rather see the world united as one to then face the great unknown of the Galaxy, like in 'Star Trek'. I don't even think the Olympics should be country versus country, because it promotes difference, so like I said at the beginning of this ramble, it was odd.Long and hard and not always that enjoyable, it could also be quite dull at times, but I assumed that was intentional to show the boredom of the crew and their frustrations at having no directives.Strangely though, I could see the appeal of the film as a whole. It was well put together, acted, edited and directed as far as I could tell. There were some that presented themselves better than others, but generally I could feel the tension, the passions and the panic. I could definitely feel the cabin fever too.I'd say that it was worth a watch for any fan of war films or those that enjoy naval vehicles.741.65/1000."
playbobbie13,"Jan 17, 2015",10/10,"This movie moved me and kept me riveted to the end. I watched with English subtitles which, to me, gave me the best viewing! I was not sure how I would feel watching a movie about a WW2 Axis U-Boat crew but I'll admit, I really liked these characters!!! It was presented so authentically! I felt claustrophobic watching it as I felt I was in the sub! The dull, dragging, moments most crews must have experienced was telegraphed realistically as were the moments of sheer terror. Overall, it appears that a great deal of research was done to deliver a true look into the lives, and deaths, of a U-Boat crew in the Atlantic war. I rarely give a 10 rating to any movie but this one richly deserves it!!!"
sol-,"Sep 29, 2017",7/10,"A young reporter finds himself in over his head when he joins the crew of a Nazi U-boat to document their experiences in this World War II thriller from Wolfgang Petersen. With the vast majority of action confined to the submarine, 'Das Boot' has many intense moments with the claustrophobic nature of the surroundings heavily emphasised. There are several marvelous tracking shots that run up and down the submarine interiors and the constant sharp sounds of the watercraft provide an eerie reminder of just how far removed the crew are from land. Clocking in at over three hours long though, there are invariably lulls in the action and overall, the film feels like more of an episodic collection of melodramatic underwater events than an airtight narrative. Jürgen Prochnow's captain is also the only character we come to really know in any depth. What the film does very well though is paint its young Nazi characters as very human with all the love anxieties, fears and worries that young people have. Especially interesting is the way they are able to quickly switch from partying in their time off to being at attention during emergencies. The film is also topped off with a surefire memorable ending. 'Das Boot' might not offer the strongest narrative or characters out there, but it provides an experience like few other motion pictures with its graphic portrait of submarine life."
pilot1009,"Jan 24, 2020",5/10,"Full marks for historical accuracy in the depiction of the boat but the story is really long winded and at times quite boring (as I am sure much of the time on board would have been. Nothing really happens too much in the first half of the mivie (1.5 hours) and a few things do in the latter half but overall as entertainment not great, as a depiction of the sub war (on either side I am guessing) it is probably very realistic."
lmonandlim,"Apr 30, 2020",10/10,One may complain about the extraneous run time of this movie but i have to say that it is Wolfgang's greater movie and in matter of fact possibly the best war movie i've ever seen; and i've seen a great deal. You'll find yourself so immersed in the story that you'll feel like you are in the U-boat with them. This is an incredible movie and deserves more praise; the action is so suspenseful and nothing can prepare you for the ending. It will leave you biting your nails as you hear the sonar get close and closer to the hopless Germans inside their submarine. This is a must watch and should't be unnoticed. Its not heroic like Saving Private Ryan it is almost a patient film and if you give it a chance you'll have a movie experience like no other. Absolute masterpiece.
antec-39254,"Apr 28, 2019",10/10,"A monumental war movie, brilliant acting, directing and camera. The mini series of this feature movie is even better. Anyone who likes war movies, thrillers, submarine movies and dramas, go for it. This is the mother of all submarine movies ever made."
Mechamensh,"Aug 11, 2019",9/10,"Because I just did, that's how good this movie is. The movie just let's you forget about all WWII and focus only on the war of a submarine captain and his crew, gets you attached to them, live their claustrophobic life in their weaponized tin can. You wouldn't thing Allies or Axis, only that U-96 and its crew.And whether you're watching this movie this year or even at 2100, it will still wreck your nerves. Totally recommend"
Autonome,"Jun 20, 2002",9/10,"Such a tale of woe on the high seas is only rarely portrayed on film. To me, the film goes beyond the actors and the film making. It seems to have taken on an inexplicable life of it's own- straight to some mechanized Nazi oblivion at the bottom of the north sea.The tragedy builds to a mythical, nightmarish scale. The film seems to inadvertently portray some accursed modern archetype of war. Perhaps the sea and the boat itself are the true, silent commanders of the crew, who are merely the pathetic pawns of fate. The kapitan, who's life at sea depended entirely on the boat- you could almost see his soul fall away as he watched it finally go down. This film seems to cut right to the seductive myth and horrible reality of war.The film is long. Relentlessly long. Torpedoes travel in real time. The sets are dark and gritty probably beyond the reality of the day. It's over three hours long. I cannot explain why I had to watch it twice. In the second viewing, you may start to see glimpses of your own face among the crew. The film is so haunting, it leaves me so incredulous and begging for any type of resolution, some kind of explanation, conclusion or the slightest psychological comfort offered to address the merciless, hopeless abyss which is the end...    it is never offered."
neilwalmsley,"Mar 26, 2002",10/10,"I have just watched the DVD of this brilliant, truly brilliant film, in the original German with English subtitles, and I remembered how good it was. I saw the miniseries (the film cut into a few 1 hour episodes) when I was about 9 or 10, and I thought it was excellent then. now that I'm a bit older I can appreciate it even more.To be honest, hollywood really angers me at times with jingoistic potrayals of Germans as evil, murdering rabid scum, so thank god that this film got made, and showed what the Germans were really like : you or me. People (young men/boys) who got called up by their country, often thinking they were going to become heroes, and ended up in a living hell of terror and violence. The film perfectly captures what life was like inside a small ""iron coffin"", a stinking, grimy, filthy, hot, dark box, with no escape from your comrades, and corvettes and destroyers circling overhead like vultures. One small mistake, and a few seconds later depth charges will start exploding around you.This film is not political, it doesn't show either side to be the goodies or baddies, it only shows that people were doing their jobs, no matter how unpleasant. Thats all that I can think of saying at the moment, because if I write anything more, it will spoilt the film, which would be a crime."
debbieesther,"Jul 13, 2001",N/A,"This movie left me reeling, the style of the filming, the direction, the acting which is stupendous and more than anything, the absurdist irony at the end. One of the typical scenes from this picture, when Jurgen Prochnow and his men torpedo the enemy, you would expect a triumphant cheering all around but after the intitial seconds the men see themselves as their present victims, and with nothing to cling to but a shread of hope in the confines of their underwater hell.  The viewer is gathered into this hell to witness that the countless tragedies of this ""last good war"" each had his own private nightmare. What moved  me was to think of what the Russians in last October's tragedy lived through and how they died. If you find it hard to really empathize with such matters see a film like ""Das Boot"". You'll never think even of a submarine in the same light as before. Let alone what goes through a young man's mind and heart during war."
Seraphion,"Sep 25, 2014",7/10,"The story opens up interestingly, with one of the dialog line stating the obvious about the soldiers doing such things due to fears of having have to face death again on their next mission. The story builds really well showing the Captain as always being the wise man and the calm strategist. It sure also has all those risk takings any great military leaders have to endure. Watching the director's cut version, I see this movie completes itself by also depicting all the contrasting experiences such as the 'collision games' and the supply vessel. The acting feels just enough. Here I see how Juergen Prochnw establishes his acting prowess. One thing about the acting is that most of the actors have quite the same expressions in almost all kinds of situation."
dakwamyth,"Jul 14, 2017",9/10,"This has to be one of the best, if not the best psychological studies of war in a movie. The tension, tedium, and coarseness all work so well together that you can actually feel for the crew. The viewer get a close and personal feel for what these crews went through, how they felt, and what they had to go through to serve their insane Government. Wolfgang Peterson did a fantastic job directing this movie, and the cast was top notch to carry this out the way it needed to be. Do not expect a high action movie, it has its action, but that is not what this movie is. Be ready for a movie that is long, drawn out, and sometimes tedious to watch, it is well worth every minute of it. Be ready for a no thrills movie that shows you what hell was like in submarine warfare, in WWII. I wish we had something like this for the American Submariners in WWII."
juancduran54,"Nov 18, 2000",10/10,"This masterpiece is, with ""Stalingrad"",the only film ever made that shows the brutal reality of the war.In this film you don't see the  superheroes typical in all the american war movies.If you think the war was like american war film shows, you are absolutely wrong; in a real war there isn't heroes, in a real war there are only people suffering , people that don't want to be there , people that wish to return home and make love to his wife ...In a real war nobody enjoys killing people...In a real war everybody wishes to escape from it...that is what this film shows ;the absolute reality of the war ; the horror of the war."
mpsgs710,"Aug 15, 2006",9/10,"I believe that every one has his/her own taste of cinema, So do I. Well honestly, I am that kind of person who is likely to be pulled off by war-related movies and those which over 3 hours.With a strong recommendation from my friend, I gave it a try. And now I find out this movie is so compelling and astounding, and I have to say IT AMAZES me so much!I only watched the director's cut version, but I think this version is just perfect. It is the first war film I've ever watched, maybe it is the last. I think if one has only one chance to watch a war film, this is the greatest choice. Or I should say, it has nothing to do whether you like war movies or not, It is a good movie for all movie-lovers.Watch this, I believe that you will have no regret."
Snoopy1,"Jul 7, 2002",10/10,"Very few movies have a huge impact on me.  This one did.  Being a pacifist during a wartime, this movie fueled my hatred of war.  As the director said about this movie, they wanted the viewers to see the soldiers as PEOPLE...not as Germans, or Nazis.  And you wind up caring deeply about them.  The cinematography was also amazing.  I can't believe it was really filmed on a submarine!Also, if you haven't seen this movie, get the director's cut.  It's long, but worth it.  I watched it in two parts, because I have a bad attention span.  Also, they redid the sound, and if you have surround sound it sounds INCREDIBLE."
bsinc,"Feb 1, 2002",10/10,"I have never said this before, but this IS the best submarine movie, and anyone claiming otherwise just doesn't know what he's talking about. I won't bother convincing you why, because even if I spilled my guts to you (I hope I used the right expression)and tell you what this movie is all about I would still be doing it injustice and if you saw it you should know exactly what I mean. One of the best movie of all time.   10+/10"
Madside,"Jan 6, 2002",10/10,"Imagine being carried away by a 3-hour war movie that takes places below sea level for the entire 3 hours (almost). And imagine feeling sympathy for German warriors bombing away innocent sailors in the Atlantic. Well, you do. And that's the amazing thing about Das Boot. It's not really like any other war movie you've ever seen. It's more like a play... movie meets play actually. It's a killer..."
D_Ogusa,"Apr 18, 2017",9/10,Wolfgang Petersen did something I felt was impossible... I actually found myself kind of rooting for the Germans in this WWII set film. Great performances from all of the cast and it is good to see that even the enemy is just doing what they also think is right. A must see. Must. Must. Must. Must. Must.
Lily_91_moss,"Apr 28, 2025",N/A,"Das Boot is just incredible. Even if you're not into war movies, this one pulls you in. It's super intense and claustrophobic - you really feel like you're stuck on that submarine with the crew. The acting is great, the atmosphere is so real, and the tension never lets up. It's not about big battles, it's about survival, fear, and boredom turning into panic. The way its shot makes everything feel authentic, and the soundtrack is iconic. It's long, but it earns every minute. Honestly, one of the best war films ever made. If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out. I probably have watched it four or five times now."
mfatihaydogdu,"Apr 15, 2009",10/10,"Most of the films are remembered because of their special achievements in categories like impressiveness, realism or amazement. I remember Das Boot with its perfect realism in its story, editing and acting. The film reflects the life in a German submarine in WWII without including any synthetic love stories and heroes capable of doing everything. The life in the film is as fast as it must be in a real submarine with some critical routines, lots of time to think and thrilling false alarms. The film must be watched with a high quality sound system in a dark place in order to feel the atmosphere completely. If you don't satisfy these requirements do not spend the special moments that you will live while watching the film. Wait for the most suitable time and place to watch it.As a person having interest especially in WWII films, this was more realistic than Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Das Leben Der Anderen, Hitler: The Rise of Evil, The Pianist and Der Untergang despite the technical impossibilities in filming in that time with respect to others. Without any doubt, it is highly recommended for everyone and specially for the ones that like reality."
t.franco,"Aug 30, 2002",10/10,"I have seen this movie many times and every time I seem to enjoy it more. Very intense and realistic scenes and excellent actors. Definitely the best submarine movie ever made. I could tell that it was not a Hollywood movie, otherwise I would have seen a coke machine inside the submarine, a love story developing between the U-boat commander and the war correspondent, and very likely the crew members listening to Elvis's songs and smoking pot.  I really love this movie, the best ever made,"
FredCDobbs,"May 21, 2001",10/10,"I cannot say enough good things about this movie. If you have never seen it, then there is something missing from your life - go see it now! I have now seen it many times (in the three formats - original cut, director's cut and mini-series) and have never tired of watching it. Everything in this movie is just perfect, from the acting, to the superb direction and incredible claustrophobic set design. One piece of advice - don't watch the dubbed version - do yourself a favour and get your hands on the subtitled version."
Antagonisten,"Mar 9, 2005",8/10,"I hate movies about submarines. Seriously it has to be one of the most overrated genres ever. Why? Simply because usually there is not plot enough to fill half a sub and there is almost NO variation to the themes presented. But there is always exceptions, and most of the time it's these exceptions that highlight just how awful the genre in general is. This is that exception.The story here is nothing revolutionary. It's just the tale of a German submarine during WW2. Their operations, the life on board and the ever-present fear of being stuck inside a bubble of air in a broken submarine at the bottom of the sea. And i must say that this is the only submarine-movie to truly capture the fear, the claustrophobic intensity of the situation. And that makes this movie fantastic.This is not first and foremost a war-film. Although the theme is World War 2 and the men portrayed are soldiers, this is more a psychological journey telling the tale of people on the edge. The acting is in most parts excellent, with Jürgen Prochnow excelling as the tightly-wound captain. What astounds me here is also the way that the film-makers do so much with so little. There is not many special effects needed, nor any of the CGI that is standard today, to create a suspense that far supersedes most of what is released today.This is the only submarine-movie you will ever need. See it for the suspense, as well as for the lesson in the futility of war. I rate this 8/10."
olethrosdc,"Aug 2, 2004",10/10,"If you are prepared to sit through three hours of film and are not feeling uncomfortable with world war two-era Germans being portrayed as 'heroes', then you should watch this movie.The story is simple. A german submarine crew undertakes a routine patrol mission at a time that the tide of war is turning against the Germans. You will have plenty of time to empathise with the men, get to know them, be bored with them - scared with them - rejoice with them - feel guilt with them.The movie portrays quite simple and yet, tragic, events. This is a movie that does not need to show blood and cut limbs in order to provoke sympathy and passion. All the casts act superbly well and the claustrophobic camera angles and beautiful sound add to the atmosphere. What is life in a submarine all about? Long stretches of silence, broken by intense sequences of stressful anxiety. Thinking about the war, about loved ones. Unlike other movies (Cold Mountain comes to mind), you really do feel there is a chemistry between the wretched sailors in the U-boat and their unseen sweethearts, even if no looks or words are exchanged between them.Das Boot is tragic in many levels more than 'simple' love. The ambivalence of feelings towards one's country and the enemy is examined.The simultaneous desire to defeat the enemy, the joy of winning - juxtaposed to the fear - the guilt - the pain - the distrust.. and the feeling that you and everybody around you are becoming crazy. All characters in this movie have a distinct personality and distinct moral values. They are all so uncommonly seen in recent movies, yet they are no caricatures of human nature. (Their depth is amazing. I can't believe that the director of this film also directed 'Troy', but then again, Troy depicted events hapenning over an extended time period and represented a harder endeavour. In the isolated sub environment, time has no meaning. It might as well not pass at all.)Furthermore, do yourself a favour and do not watch the movie dubbed, as the US dubbers made a really bad job out of this movie. There are not many lines for you to read anyhow."
pagblonk,"Apr 1, 2008",9/10,"Frightening. That was the first thing that came to my mind. A submarine had always been a floating coffin in my mind. When I saw the film for the first time, this image was confirmed. One can hardly imagine anything more frightening than being on a submarine when it is being attacked. There are at least two film versions and 2 TV series. I prefer the director's cut film, which lasts about 3.5 hours. The cast show us exactly what life on a submarine meant. The boredom at sea when they can't find enemy ships and the terrifying attacks when faced with depth charges. The film is based on true experiences on submarine U-96 and a book, written by Lothar-Günther Bluchheim. He later criticized the film for not being totally true to the book. Well, so be it. The film is what it's all about and if you're really interested in life on a sub, you will just have to see it. If you suffer from claustrophobia, this film will undoubtedly make it worse. If you're interested in good acting and portraying life as it really was, this is your film."
imseeg,"Nov 17, 2018",10/10,"Beware: dont choose the 2018 version! And dont choose the tv series from 1985 either.The original classic ""Das Boot"" stems from the year 1981 and this movie has become the mold for all submarine movies. I have seen ALL the war movies during the last decades and this one truly stands out as one of the best. Not suited though for those who dont have patience. Why? Because the director's cut of this movie lasts 3 and a half hour! The theatrical version lasts one hour less. And although it aint never boring, this movie sure takes it's time to learn to know this german submarine crew. It's slowburning start might give some reason to think this might be a longwinding boring movie, but dont be mistaken.If you have watched the opening half hour and enjoyed the acting performances you will be in for a ride later on, because this story has got one heck of crescendo in suspense and action, meaning that it starts out slowly and calm, but it will end with shattering suspenseful action packed plot turns. If you are really of the impatient kind, skip the first hour and you will fall smack in the middle of the first action sequences. Because of it's length it is advisable to watch it with a pause in the middle.What's so great about ""Das Boot""? The acting performances are truly terrific. Only germans will recognise these actors, because internationally they are unknown. But that doesnt spoil the fun, because these perrformances are up there with the very best internationally. Highly recommended to watch in original german language with subtitles.""Das Boot"" made the mold for ALL submarine movies and it is truly a classic war movie, because like no other war movie it portrays in psychological detail the destruction of individuals during war fare. And it's setting is confined to just 1 claustrophobic submarine. That's all the movie audience gets to see for 3 and a half hour long! To be able to impress audiences with such a suspenseful story inside such a small space is truly astonishing. Classic war movie!"
RagnarStalheim,"Apr 6, 2022",N/A,"Production values seemed very authentic. Much tension and sympathetic characters, a break from the thoughtless stereotypical Nazi bad guys. Probably the best submarine film I've ever seen."
Quinoa1984,"Apr 12, 2000",10/10,"For lack of a better comparison, and I hope it doesn't come off as hacky, but in a way Das Boot basically did for the war film - and that small sub-genre of WW2 submarine pictures - what Alien did for science fiction space movies: it looks and feels dirty in this environment, and the people who work on these vessels are hard-bitten and look filthy and are more like blue-collar workers than what one would normally picture them being in. In Das Boot (or, you guessed it, 'The Boat'), Wolfgang Peterson adapts Bucheim's journalistic novel about a U-boat in late 1941 who are tasked to go into the North Atlantic and take on the enemy, primarily British convoys and other boats of the like. It's a grim, relentless, sometimes depressing but often invigorating story.One might also be thwarted, as I was for some years, about the idea of 'Huh, the Germans as the heroes of this story, get outta here.' But it's more complex than that, or rather it's not as simple as 'They're Nazis' in that way. Actually most of these officers and naval-men on this U-Boat, run by Jurgen Prochnow's character, have no real firm affiliation, and when they meet other officers when they pull for a brief stop in Spain, they don't even 'Sieg Heil' the other officers. Why this works for an international audience, why it didn't just stay a German-based sort of entity with minimal interest for outsiders who might still have grudges, is that Peterson and company a) don't have any real interest in the politics of anything, it's ALL about the sub and what the missions are, and b) the depth given to the characters (certainly in the director's cut, if not the even longer version) makes these people stand out as people first and foremost.Are they all super complex? Maybe not. Some come close to being clichés and stereotypes, though other times, wisely, before s*** hits the fan, there are some scenes given to showing the men just talking like men, about sex stuff, goofing on each other in that Tough sort of manner. Probably my favorite supporting character, aside from the Correspondent Lt. Werner, the sort of audience surrogate (rather, the guy who other people can explain stuff to so we know), is Johann. He has not a ton of scenes, but he has enough to have a clear, interesting arc where he works in the engine room, and during the big centerpiece of the film where the U-Boat is under attack from the Convoy and they're losing ground, he abandons his post and loses his mind for a few minutes. He apologizes, but can he really redeem himself? Certainly among this cast he has one of the most expressive faces and eyes.This was a fascinating watch for me in a number of ways - the fact that the filmmakers were able to hold attention for long stretches where, frankly, not a lot is ""happening"" action-wise, and we're made to just sit with these people and see what happens when they don't have enemies to attach or problems to solve, was one thing. And Pruchnow is a good actor who, frankly, is most effective in scenes involving eye contact (he has good, steely-blue type of leading man eyes), and when there's danger and he has to raise his voice. Otherwise, he has to be the Rock for these men, and does a good job. Other performances range from very good to just decent, but no one is bad at all here.But most of all, what made this raise from being a very good cinematic experience to a great one, was the ending. I wouldn't dare reveal what happens even with a 'Spoiler' warning, but suffice to say it's one of those moments where I practically had to laugh in astonishment. For a film this unrelentingly harrowing and bleak, the ending throws the kind of ""twist"" that is far from something unbelievable or out of this world. On the contrary, it's so logical and spot-on as a dramatic moment that it made everything else coming before it matter more - or at least have an ironic light to it. Das Boot is one of those very long ""guy"" movies that goes past how we usually view war films; the action happens and is any-number-of-ways-to-say-intense, but the time spent with the characters, observing them, seeing how long they're in this environment before things start to happen, gives the experience the texture of a long novel."
onewire-1,"Jan 15, 2002",10/10,"As an ex-submariner from those days, I can attest to the Rotten Conditions we lived in during the 40-43 era.Hot, Humid, and Stale!!!Not much chance to do anything else than man stations for several weeks at a time."
UnpretentiousNormie,"Sep 9, 2024",10/10,"I saw this film a long time ago, when it came out. The movie has stayed seared in my heart for years. The first is the role reversal in making the viewer sympathetic to the traditional ""bad guy"" in war - and seeing that they are men with a crazed national leader, just doing the jobs they are mandated to do, trying to survive. In the US, war and the military is often glorified, and if Hawks had their way, we would be continually bombing and fighting. The reality and irony is those who have actually been in the thick of it and fought these horrific battles wouldn't wish it on their worst enemy. The beauty and tragedy of this movie is the fact that all war is ugly, people's lives are frequently lost over land or resource grabs by uncaring leaders, and it is often done for no good, being in the end a complete waste of everything, with family lines developing gaping holes in their lineages and relatives and children losing what is more precious to them than land or resources.The actors convey the terror of war, confinement in the depths of an uncaring ocean that could crush them in an instant, facing the wrenching human pleadings from the enemy that did not die, and the temporary relief when the sub crew makes land. Every underwater scene tightens your gut in anticipation of disaster, and some scenes kick the very breath out of you.The actors are superb, the plotline is gripping and has a good pace, the submarine induces claustrophobia, and the overall work has true meaning that could literally change the world if the right people heeded its warnings. I plan on only giving the best of the best movies a 10 star rating, and this is one of those few I wholeheartedly believe deserves it - not just for the fact that it is an amazing work, but the reason it is an amazing work is it is unforgettable, making you sadder, wiser, and carving itself into your conscience.Others have explained the plot in more depth, so I will leave you with this thought: If all politicians were forced to watch this movie before starting a war to grab land or resources, I truly believe the ones that are still in possession of a human heart would immediately abort the mission.See this film when you are strong enough to bear its message."
GianfrancoSpada,"Mar 3, 2025",10/10,"Few war films manage to encapsulate the relentless tension, claustrophobic dread, and psychological toll of battle as effectively as this one. From the opening frames, the film plunges the audience into an oppressive atmosphere where the specter of death lurks around every corner, capturing the raw experience of naval warfare with an almost documentary-like precision. Unlike many of its contemporaries, which often succumb to the temptation of grandiose spectacle, this film is deeply committed to realism, placing the viewer within the confines of a steel tomb beneath the ocean's surface.The cinematography plays a crucial role in immersing the audience in this unforgiving environment. The camera work is intimate and restless, navigating through narrow corridors with an almost invasive presence. This technique not only enhances the sense of confinement but also amplifies the tension during battle sequences. The lighting, or at times the lack thereof, further contributes to the film's visual authenticity. The dim, flickering lights create a haunting chiaroscuro effect, reinforcing the vulnerability of the crew as they wait in agonizing anticipation for the next depth charge to hit.Sound design is another standout element. The creaking of the hull under pressure, the distant hum of enemy sonar, and the sudden, deafening explosions are all meticulously crafted to draw the audience deeper into the experience. Unlike films that rely on an overpowering orchestral score to dictate emotions, this one often allows silence and ambient noise to carry the weight of the moment. When the score does appear, it is measured and evocative, heightening the drama without overshadowing the grim reality unfolding on screen.The performances are uniformly exceptional, with each actor delivering a portrayal that feels utterly lived-in. The crew's gradual descent into exhaustion and despair is portrayed with remarkable subtlety. Expressions of fear, hope, and resignation play out in quiet moments rather than through theatrical outbursts, making the emotional impact all the more profound. The film does not romanticize heroism but instead focuses on survival, camaraderie, and the psychological disintegration that comes with prolonged exposure to danger.What sets this film apart from many other World War II submarine dramas of its era is its unwavering commitment to perspective. Unlike more traditional war films that frame their protagonists within a clear moral binary, this one presents them as men bound by duty rather than ideology. While other films, such as ""U-571,"" may focus on large-scale naval battles with an emphasis on strategic maneuvers, this one is deeply personal, often forcing the audience to confront the harrowing monotony punctuated by sudden moments of sheer terror.That is not to say the film is without flaws. At times, its commitment to realism results in pacing that some might find arduous. There are moments where the tension seems to plateau rather than escalate, which could test the patience of viewers accustomed to more conventional war film rhythms. Additionally, while the technical aspects of submarine warfare are meticulously depicted, there are instances where the film assumes a level of familiarity with naval operations that might leave some audience members struggling to grasp the full weight of certain decisions made by the crew.Despite these minor drawbacks, the film remains an unrelenting, visceral experience that stands among the finest in its genre. Its ability to sustain tension over an extended runtime, coupled with its refusal to offer easy resolutions, cements its place as a definitive portrayal of submarine warfare. It is a masterclass in atmosphere, character study, and technical precision-a harrowing journey that lingers long after the screen fades to black."
Dragofan,"Jun 14, 2002",N/A,"Being in the military for several years myself, I have to say that this is the most accurate depiction of what life as a soldier can be like. At times it kills you with sheer terror, at other times it can kill you with sheer unrest and boredom. Some people think that movies like The Rock and Sum of All Fears are supposed to be realistic war/combat movies. This is all a bunch of crap. Das Boot is the best submarine movie ever (and can never be topped), and show what kind of hell being a grunt is really like. The men on U-96, as well as other German subs, were all honorable warriors. They didn't fight for their cause as much as they fought for their survival. This is depicted accurately in the movie as well. The only way this movie could have been better would have been to cast Billy Drago as the captain. His icy demeanor could have added just a touch of spice to the film. A solid 10 out of 10."
cadpietre,"Feb 4, 2025",5/10,"A good movie ruined in the last 10 minutes. Might as well skip the ending. I don't l know if this is accurate or the director just had to follow protocol but the ending is a total dissapointment, for me at least. I don't know what else to say to add up to the silly minimum characters. Just go ahead and watch the movie. The duration is not 149 minutes but rather cose to 208 minutes.. so 3 and 1/2 hours
it was a nice watch... kept me on the edge the entire time.. but.. as i said the ending was a exagerated.. how should i put it... too american.. i would have rated it 10/10 if it wasn't for the stupid ending."
davidca-21589,"Jun 8, 2025",10/10,"Even as only a casual enthusiast of war films, ""Das Boot"" kept me rapt for the entire three hours and thirty minute runtime. I found myself wondering if the author of the book and/or the screenplay writers and director might have seen the Italian wartime submarine films ""Uomini sul fondo"" and ""Alfa Tau!"" It's not difficult to imagine that the creators of ""Das Boot"" came up with the concept of a submarine getting stuck on the seabed and resurfacing entirely independently, but there are similarities with ""Uomini sul fondo"" in particular that make me wonder if in certain scenes and elements there might have been a nod to the former film.The only complaint I have about ""Das Boot"" is that the subtitles - both German and English - are absolutely terrible. Half the dialogue isn't even transcribed, and when it is, in English and, even more irritatingly, German, the transcription is very ""free."" The English subtitles, to name one amusingly egregious example, translate ""Schnapps"" - a word with which the average English speaker will be familiar - as ""alcohol."" The English subtitles regularly ""translate"" phrases as ""SPEAKING IN GERMAN."" They're speaking German? In a movie where everyone speaks German? After we picked ""German"" as the audio language? But you can't tell me what they're saying in German? What, I ask, is the point of this?And this ""technique"" isn't used for unintelligible dialogue where men are speaking over each other. Important terms and phrases the viewer will hear frequently, i.e. ""Herr Kaleu"" and ""Tanks fluten!"" are repeatedly rendered in English as ""MAN SPEAKING GERMAN"" for reasons I can't begin to understand. As for the German subtitles, it's just as hard to comprehend why they render the dialogue so unfaithfully.It would've been great if they could have written new subtitle tracks for the Blu-Ray release, but that, alas, was not done. The movie gets a 10/10, the subtitles get a zero."
searchanddestroy-1,"May 13, 2022",10/10,"Awesome, gruesome, terrific, outstanding, no matter what will be made after this absolute masterpiece. No movie at all has been made in such an accurate and realistic way. Plus it talks about the German U Boats; that changes from the usual ""good"" Americans submarines. Directing, acting, technical skilles are obvious in this movie where the technical and actors crew worked so hard, gave so much of themselves to make the result an absolute and definite unforgettable piece of work. Scenes that will remain in your mind forever and which you will never get tired of. Watch out for those sequences when the U Boat is attacked in the bottom of the sea by the sub grenades. Even at home, in the deep of your sofa, you feel squeezed, crushed, litteraly smashed by the bombs, you feel promiscuity, claustrophobia, scare. I am also jaw dropped by the characters depiction. Though those men are German and fight for the Nazis, you are totally with them, you fight, breathe with them, fight with them to survive, you wish them to finally make it. I can't even imagine that any audience can deny such a masterpiece, such a jewel. Most terrific ending ever made for such a war film."

kvarnerinfo,"Aug 19, 2025",10/10,"Where to begin?! This movie made me feel as if I am a crew member of that U - boot.This movie is realism converted to movie.Normal version is not enough to me, I have director's cut version and it's over 3 hours and 15 minutes long.I don't need to temsay atmosphere is, well realistic, everything is absolutely realistic - dialogues, scenes, acting, story and there is no propaganda at all, just realism of ww2 submarine warfare.Germans know how to make good war movie, with 0 bias, and that's what Hollywood lacks.I would reccomend another German war movie if you loved this one: Stalingrad (1993)."
orygunduck,"May 2, 2000",N/A,"My wife and I went to see this movie when the Director's cut was first released...and I noticed something while waiting in a line that was a block long....there were only 3 women!!This movie is intriguing and spell-binding to most men. We are fascinated and drawn to the idea of being cooped up with our bretheren in a tight area on a common cause for an extended period. I have no idea why...but we are. Maybe we all wonder if we'd hold up...that we would prove our manhood to ourselves. The problem with a submarine is like the problem with being in prison, you can't decide you've had enough of this crap and walk away. But the better part of the submarine over prison is the guys are easier to get along with.But to the movie....This movie excels at giving the flavor and texture to tight/close living. Most submarine movies give the sense that yes, its smaller than our normal day-to-day environs....but you quickly overlook that. Das Boot won't let you overlook it! And this movie seems to say to me that being in a depth-charged submarine is like being in a jet when the engines shut off....you've got a pretty good idea your not going to make it and the end, when it comes, will have a distinct unpleasantness about it...but you don't know what you're going to do until then.A definite 10."
AbrekD,"Aug 30, 2025",10/10,"I don't believe a perfect movie exists, but this comes the closest. The dialogues, details, characters, and especially the songs are outstanding. The Gibraltar scenes, claustrophobic tensions, hunting British convoys, the friends unexpectedly running into each other in the middle of the vast ocean... The movie conveys the feeling of confinement inside the submarine brilliantly. Definitely Recommended."
johnharapa,"Jun 23, 2021",9/10,"The directors cut for this movie adds a whopping
1 hour to this 40 year old classic.I first watched this original 2:30 epic movie almost 20 years ago and the suspense was very palpable..
I enjoyed this German masterpiece very much.No CGI, no green screens, no computer generated anything, subtitles unfortunately was never something I enjoyed and hoped that 40 years on with a new directors cut maybe 'finally' dubbed - still no luck.....But GUESS WHAT ???? I LOVED THIS NEW FINAL CUT.The extra hour adds to the suspense, not detract.I was a little less patient the first time I watched this.I was fixated on where in God's name will they add a whole hour to this movie? Will it be seamless, will director Wolfgang Peter Sen handle this with the same aplomb that he did so masterfully 40 years ago - or is this an egocentric / cash drive to revive an aging masterpiece ?The extra hour only intensified the experience, subtitles added to the drama in this epic WorldWarII cat and mouse archetypal war movie.A RESOUNDING YES!!! I absolutely recommend this movie despite the new versions' 3:30 length and the persistence with subtitles adds, moreover in no way does this additional hour detract from this masterful story.Whodathunk I'd grow up these last last 20yrs..... ;)WATCH THIS VERSION!!"
NewInMunich,"Jun 19, 2007",9/10,"The submarine movie as a sub species of the war movie is certainly something special as a category, for the exception of ""Torpedo Run"" i can not recall real bad movies of this kind. Das Boot is certainly the #1 in the race, with ""Run Silent, run deep"" and ""The enemy below"" following with some distance. Why is that ? Realism, Realism, Realism. The guys are really young, as they were in WW II. People would be wrecks mentally as well as physically after some time and having veterans like Clark Gable or Curd Jürgens on board was simply not possible. And the subs in other movies, like the 2 before mentioned were so relatively clean and nice as they never were. The simple effect of permanent water flow and the closed room situation took care of that. All in all, an overwhelming movie, much helped by the fact, that the actors were kept in and close during filming, that they would like the ghosts they would be after weeks on Sea."
tayloralanj,"Feb 13, 2010",10/10,"This is a must see for war buffs, WWII buffs and definitely uboat warfare buffs. I kind of remember seeing this with my dad back in the 80s when it first came out; I saw the German language with English subtitles version. I just watched the English dubbed version. I'm not sure it matters which one you watch but in the end, you will feel a little something for this German crew that has given their all...some so young,,,some not so young,,,all there to do their duty to their country (not necessarily their Fuhrer) and definitely to do their duty to their mates. Remarkable. A true testament to ALL submarine crews at any point in the history of their service, they share a remarkable code of honor and bravery that I personally know I could never hack. Fair winds and following seas (and no depth charges to ya mate!)."
h-breckmann,"Mar 23, 2009",10/10,"I think Das Boot is a realistic movie about the crew of a German U-Boot (Unterseeboot = under sea boat) without heroism. The crew: not clean men with beards, of course are afraid to be killed by destroyers and planes. HQ is so demanding which causes them to become cynics. They are doing their job, being soldiers, but do not really trust the chaotic orders they get.German U-boats like Germans panzer's (PzKw-Tiger) were feared by the allies, and had to be destroyed, but this movie shows there are two sides of a war.A war also can become bizarre: suddenly these dirty men are invited for an expensive dinner and appear well dressed and clean, probably still smelling to diesel.European movies not always have happy ends and/of love stories in them as real life often has not either: Ladri di Biciclette, The Wicker Man (1973). Das Boot is one of them. You will not see the Hollywood explosions with too much fire that are not realistic. Great movie, but not for those who suffer from claustrophobia. This movie is meant for men to watch. Don't worry because of its long runtime, it will be over before you know it."
lakanman,"Jun 23, 2020",10/10,I had seen this movie two times before I saw it with headphones and what a difference that did to the movie. Today I own the Director's cut on DVD and Blu-ray. The mini series on DVD and Blue-ray. Soundtrack on vinyl. And the book. I think that says it all.
h-28658,"Apr 12, 2020",8/10,"It show us the human side of the soldier, from whatever country he comes and fights for. In this case are the germans, where you clearly can see the difference between the ones that serves for the duty/country and the ones that just are blind humanoids."
the-fearless-america,"Oct 18, 2016",9/10,"Das boot, a movie, which its shape mostly about thrill. Its main focus was to thrill the audiences implicitly. There is something classy about Das Boot, yeah, its thrilling concept. It thrills the audience in a unique way, not by scary scores or back-sound or surprising music, nor by cool action schemes supported by cool CGI, nor scary art-direction make-up or set decoration.Das boots thrill is about emotion and tension. Emotions about hopeless, the powerless crews who got stuck by the tension of sea war and trapped in their only self-saver tool, a submarine. The only option about dying or surviving is the main uplifting aspect to the thrills. Every new rising action or climax scenes begin, they always fall for those 2 option, whether they saves the day or sinking to death. One more good aspect is, Das Boot play and brings its thrill really slow. Sometimes they cut from the outside to the inside as the thrills begin to grow the thrill into audiences slowly.Cameras set piece to shot the tension and emotion of crew really precise. The editing seems incredibly accurate. We also can't forget the realistic impact sounds which erupt scenes, nice work by sound-effect team.When i first watch Das Boot, i realize that i never feel so much thrill before and this movie set my new standard to thrill genre. They play in one set place only (submarine) most of its duration, but the layer of its thrill is so deep which that was hard things to do as a director. Das Boot is at top tier of thrill genre movies."
bjoernidler,"Feb 11, 2019",10/10,"I've recently been to the Bavaria Filmstudios in Munich and entered the real 'Boot' that Petersen shot this film in. When you're inside for more than five minutes you forget that you're not inside a real sub. It's that kind of detail that allows Petersen's camera to float freely through the ship. There simply isn't a bad angle in there.
The atmosphere inside also enhanced the performance of the actors. A lot of them deliver their career highlight in Das Boot.Other reviewers mentioned all the great things about this film. I agree with them. It is one of the anti-war-films with the most impact I know. It's not important for the viewer whether the soldiers are Germans, Americans or Japanese. War is the same for everybody. We can relate and feel with the mariners. Few films are that intense, suspenseful and claustrophobic.There's just one thing I'd like to add:
The climax of the film shows the whole futility of war better than any other I can remember. I'm not going to spoil anything (If you've already seen it you will remember). When I saw it first I couldn't help but feel cheated. But then I thought about it and now I think that this ending just adds to the realism of the film. It is a punch in the face that shows that in war there are no heroes and emphasizes the complete senselessness of it all.If you haven't seen this already, stop reading now and watch it. For the more patient viewer I also recommend the 4.5 hour long tv mini series."
jmcody,"Jun 20, 2000",10/10,"I'll be brief. The introduction tells all one needs to know about the history of the German U-Boat crews. 3 out of every 4 ended up dead.  Yes, the Nazis were a force that needed to be defeated in order for civilization to survive. That fact understood, this film reminds the audience of the ultimate inhumanity and immorality of war. The fact that I, as an American audience member, found myself sympathizing not with the crew's (they, the ""other"" side) cause, but with their humanity is a testament to the power of film.  I just saw the director's cut of this fine film today and it reinforced and enhanced what I already had experienced the first time I became immersed in this film's narrative.  Gritty, well acted and written, claustrophobic, agonizing, tragic and utterly believable, Das Boot is simply one of the finest war films ever made.  Search out the Director's Cut and don't you dare miss it. It is a contemporary classic. A 10 out of 10."
virzak,"Dec 25, 2000",10/10,"Movie about ""The boys in the sea"" more than anything else... Shows the people against the politics... The contrast is pretty clear.If you like military movies or you are in the military or about to join it or considering to go to a mission, you have to see this one. This movie helps to decide whether this is for you or not."
Paul-250,"May 15, 1999",8/10,"I have only ever seen the tv mini-series which was shown for the first time in the U.K in the mid-eighties on BBC2 in the original German, and generated record audience figures for subtitled material of between seven and eight million ( the equivalent in the U.S would be almost forty million). I cannot imagine it being cut, much less dubbed. I can only say that I found it compelling drama, though everyone I know who has seen it has been male, and it may be that this film has particular meaning to those who have at least to consider the possibility that they may one day be required to fight in a war. The British have always been able to distinguish between honourable and dishonourable German fighting units, but the acting in Petersen's film is of such a quality that you really care what happens to these people (and I speak as someone whose father fought against them). The feeling of being part of a U-boat crew that is one moment the hunter and the next moment the hunted, the elation and the fear of combat, the heightened sense of self-awareness, the questioning of one's role, and, above all, the ultimate futility of war are all powerfully brought home. The extraordinary German sense of discipline is evident throughout (helping to explain why it required the combined efforts of The British Empire, The Soviet Union and the United States to defeat Hitler's forces) but it is a discipline infused with respect and intelligence. This is a wonderful piece of filmmaking which I would recommend to anyone. Just make sure you see it in the original German."
Kashmir-4,"Jul 6, 1999",10/10,"This MUST be added to your video library.  Rarely do we see the other side in the conflict, as we are just willing to label all german soldiers during WWII as nazi pigs.  This has the most real feel to it as a submarine epic of its period.  A side bit of trivia - Did you know that Herbert Groenemeyer (Lt. Werner) was (or is... depending on your opinion) a popular singer in Germany?"
ptsj-music,"Sep 8, 2016",10/10,"I wonder if this film would have ended up on the poster at the local cinema in my birth town if it were today. It wasn't any block-buster but so much better than most of them. Back in 1981 one could still see rare and independent quality film also in small town cinemas. I was 14 and absolutely not prepared for this kind of experience.Back then the age limits were normally 7 or 13, and 18 if there was any particular sex or violence. ""Das Boot"" completely lacks sex but the claustrophobic intensity actually feels kind of violent. I wonder if the limit on ""Das Boot"" wasn't 18, and perhaps for a good reason. I am glad I went and got in anyway, but I'm even more glad I never was a German U-boat crew in WW2. Leaving the cinema I felt absolutely stunned, shocked and still not quite aware of what had hit me.This unique film is so fantastic one forget it's fact based fiction. Simply so intense, it feels almost like being in the U-boat. It's No.27 on my top 100 list, but it probably deserves a higher score."
Hen Fan,"Jun 14, 1999",10/10,"Although I have not (yet) seen ""Saving Private Ryan"", this movie best captures the reality of war for me - both the futility and the pointlessness of it. This would probably be a very good movie to show all of those generals and such who seemed to get a rise out of our ""video game"" like bombings in recent US campaigns. The movie reminds one of the fact that the vast majority of the ""enemy"" are everyday ordinary people, just like ourselves - they live and die as horribly as we would if folks were lobbing explosives at us.This is absolutely NOT a movie for children! My wish would be that everyone who is considering joining the military would be forced to watch this - especially those that ""wrap themselves in the flag"".Don't see this if you want to see an uplifting movie, but if you want a movie that will shake you right to the bone and make you question many of the ideas you take for granted, this is your movie. Just be prepared to be a little shaken for a few days afterwards."
tonyle,"Oct 20, 2000",10/10,"Das Boot is by far one of the greatest war movies ever made. The thing that makes this movie so wonderful is its truthfulness - especially that it had the audacity to present WWII Germans as real human beings. In addition, rather than portraying war with the typical feel-good sugar-coated glory, bravery, honor, etc., it portrays war for all it really is: a twisted, terrifying experience that no person should ever have to face. Indeed, Das Boot is masterful at showing how the zeal and enthusiasm of young men (practically boys) slowly erode with each passing day spent in this filthy, humid sardine can they are forced to call home during their tour of duty.The Director's Cut is a fantastic piece of work. The battle scenes especially feature extended, masterfully done tension-building sequences. Often, little more than silence and facial expression heighten the drama, drawing the viewer further and further into the waiting game - Is the enemy ship gone? Is the next depth charge about to explode? Many of the greatest moments in the film occur when these men utter not a single word.In his DVD audio commentary, Wolfgang Petersen tells of how a couple of Hollywood deals fell through before his team finally decided to make a real German epic in ""the German way."" Thank heaven that Hollywood didn't get a chance to taint the story with some fluffy pro-American slant that would've defocused the whole point of this film: War is hell - and that's all you really need to know. My hat goes off to him, his crew, and his actors for their commitment in producing one of finest examples of quality filmmaking in existence."
g-bodyl,"Mar 8, 2015",9/10,"When it comes to ranking submarine movies, I think Das Boot would rank up near the very top. This film does not sacrifice realism for the sake of entertainment. The film tells the story how it is and that is what I truly respect about this film. The story itself is gripping and terrifying. There are many good action scenes and I found this film unique because this film is told from the perspective of the Axis forces, and that is very rare to find in any non-propaganda cinema.Wolfgang Petersen's film is about life on a U-Boat as German soldiers embark on a secret mission during the Battle of the Atlantic as they target English trade ships. The occupants suffer from boredom, fear, and the sense of comradeship as they wrestle thoughts on the ideology in which they are fighting for.Now I'm not familiar with many of the actors in the film, mostly because this film is a foreign film. However, I am familiar with Jurgen Prochnow and he did a great job as the U-Boat's captain. The rest of the cast certainly did a good job.Overall, Das Boot was a very good war film and one of the better submarine movies I have seen. Not only there is a gripping story to be had, the film shows a great deal of technical prowess. The cinematography as well as the battle visuals are major standouts for me. The film is unique due to the perspective of the Nazis, so that was interesting to watch. The film also had a great ending. It is kind of sad, but it made the movie even more powerful.My Grade: A"
kyle_c,"Sep 2, 2002",10/10,"Wolfgang Petersen's landmark submarine film is nothing short of a masterpiece.  The ability to to create tension and suspense equals or surpasses a great deal of Hitchock's work, and the drama at the level of the individual is handled as well as any war film has ever done so.  The story is simple - it follows the story of a German U-Boat on patrol for British convoys, focusing on the Captain (Jurgen Prochnow) and a war correspondent (Herbert Gronemeyer), who has come along to report on the war.  We view the film from a view that is as close to being on a real submarine as you can get, and we identify with these men.  Realizing that these individuals who we sympathize with are the enemy is what makes such a powerful anti-war message, much in the way that ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" did.  I would go so far as to say that this is the single most effective anti-war film ever made, and one that every film viewer must experience."
Marc_Israel_365,"Jun 17, 2012",8/10,"Wolfgang Peterson has succeeded in sharing a claustrophobic and terrorizing experience of a wartime submarine crew as you find yourself rooting for this German U-Boats' survival. With no American flag raised, betrayed or turned back on, this movie was mesmerizing in its' sharing of common war themes, but here as Germans. Ideology is turned on its' head in this role reversal. Ou crew becomes our friends we root for, except the one obvious blinded Nazi, and we feel for them, once an unthinkable option. The sinking feeling of inevitability was inexorable as war- time orders are followed. Retribution and fear of the same, runs through these waters, as we silently wait for our fate to show itself."
nabilwadi1912,"Sep 22, 2016",10/10,"I've watched quite a lot of movies and I've given the ratings in IMDb for some movies. But, this is the first review I'm composing in IMDb. Because, It'd be a shame if I wouldn't have written it, this movie deserves it.It basically focused on the underwater experience of the then U- boats. Yet, it wasn't only about diving and war, it was diversified. We could see the turmoils of war, you can't say a safe zone in War, this matter was portrayed with excellence. The urge to survive was demonstrated considering every subtle details. I just wonder, without the help of modern CGI and all, how could it be done like this.This is the best German movie I've seen in my entire life. Even as a film, this is one of the very few which can be called the best movies of all time. The best thing about this movie is, Nazis were also human, it portrayed their struggle to survive the war, to see their loved ones once again.Even if it was a bit long than other movies, yet enjoyed every bit of it. If it could be possible, I'd have given 11 out of 10 for this movie."
nodialogue,"Dec 21, 2009",10/10,"Back in the day I saw this movie on the big screen which pulls you into the story for the darkness in the cinema is real. Das Boot is one of the few movies going 3hours+ that is always entertaining. The perspective is very clean, you see the action unfold through the eyes of the war correspondent on the boat. This war correspondent is a person in the real world, the story is autobiographic. As a spectator your level of knowledge is the knowledge of the people on board, this is how the suspense lasts all those three hours. Adding to the suspense even more is the use of sounds which are naturally dominant in submarine without any windows, no visual connection to the outside world when under sea. What sets this film apart is also the variety and large number of characters portrayed as their thought and feelings show by their action and faces, Maybe comparable to ""12 angry men"" . Most of the time you do not know their names, maybe their job on the submarine. Nevertheless I predict that any viewer can identify any man on board. I recommend watching this film German with subtitles for non-speakers for the military way of speaking is accurate, I assume a foreigner would get this as well, it adds to the authenticity. Clearly the film centers around the submarine which by its technology determines all activities, the action and most important the roles the people find themselves in as soldiers. These roles are their lives as soon as they leave the port. Clearly the submarine comes first, the people second, the machine is their means survival and weapon to kill others as well. As for the Nazi ideology the submarine also serves as a refuge from the nazi-society on land. Another core conflict of the men on board is they need to kill fellow seamen. The film does a good job in making the viewer understand this drama without ever resorting to some style of argumentation, it is all in the pictures. As for the story there is no obvious red line. The submarine follows military orders and reacts to enemy attacks. No single crew-member could possibly interfere with this. It is finest cinema, you are pulled into the screen, you have the illusion of darkness, even smells. The film is a perfect illusion with some thrill of authenticity. This film never attempts to tell you anything, because you are in the submarine like everyone else."
bellabanana93,"Oct 12, 2017",9/10,"Das Boot (The Boat) is an excellent German film about WW2. This movie is great from start to finish and is full of action and drama. The setting is dark and gloomy and there are many very intense and terrifying scenes. The characters were interesting, but they were not the main focus. The main focus of this film was the overall experience of the war and people fighting in it.The camera angles are excellent and really enhance the story to make it feel as if you are there. The plot is great and it does not drag on. This movie was not short. It was a bit long compared to other movies. But, it actually could have been even a bit longer as I was engaged and enjoying myself the entire time. If you have 2 and a half hours to spare and want the time to go by quickly, then watch this film."
claudialora,"Oct 13, 2015",10/10,"A little-known fact is that eighteen countries had submarines in the water during World War II. Whether a country had one vessel (Brazil) or over nine-hundred vessels (Germany), and whether those vessels saw action in battle or not, all of their crews endured the same living and working conditions as the crew of the fictional German U-96 depicted in this film. That is what makes this film as important as it is riveting. You will experience what life was like for those who served on submarines during the war, many of whom were just teenagers. It was a life lived in dim lighting for months at a time. A life lived in close, cramped quarters with no privacy whatsoever. A life where anxiety and fear were ever-present. A life spent wondering when, or if, you would see your loved ones again. Whether or not you are a World War II enthusiast, do yourself a favor and see this film at least once in your lifetime."
franco-28,"Jan 7, 2000",10/10,"An excellent film, one of the best war movies + the most realistic depictions of submarine warfare in WWII. What action, what glory, what irony! Everyone was at their best in this one, I bought the uncensored version which adds an hour to the flick, I was so sick of the ""Dirty, rotten, Nazi, German"" flicks that I almost didnt want to watch any more war flicks, but this is one about Germans who followed their leader wether they liked it or not, & did the best they could. A must see."
LouisWedge,"Jun 25, 2020",10/10,"The impact, the rhythm, the tension...all strike the right balance. The German language lends itself beautifully to the aggrevated situations they find themselves in. One of the best movies ever made."

in my ""younger"" years.Please see this movie, and give your heart out
to everyone.This is the one that keeps hope in the saying:""Can't we just all get along?"""
jundev,"May 7, 1999",10/10,"I have seen this movie last night in Beverly Cinema.  It blows me away. This is one of the Great War movies made not to glorify the means but to highlight its futility.The movie was well directed, and well acted.  The scenes make you suffer from claustrophobia and the pinging was just as agonizing. You will feel the pain of the crew in their effort to stay afloat and/or stay down 200 meters below the sea surface eluding depth charges.This is a profound movie and very real, not one of those anti-german films against war which as real as the TV series ""Combat.""  What ""Saving Private Ryan"" did in the land, ""Das Boot did it in the sea."
alexander.greb,"Dec 17, 2000",10/10,"""Das Boot"" is simply a stroke of genius.a movie, hollywood is just not able to make (even ""saving private ryan"" is sometimes cheesy). an anti - war movie isn´t just dozens of headshots and martially killed people. its the story which lets the viewer feel helpless. and in this aspect, ""Das Boot"" is even creepier than any horror movie. acting and cast is perfect, setting and effects stunning, the sound the best ever on cinema.if you want to know the meaningless of war, watch ""Das Boot""10/10"
chill-25,"Jul 25, 2000",10/10,"Re. earlier submission.  Meant to say sub-titled version best not dubbed. Dub bad, subtitle good! Sorry. Hope I didn't steer anyone in the wrong direction.  Also forgotten to mention that the director's cut is best. little better background as to what  is going on, especially in the beginning."
cjfort,"Jan 8, 2008",10/10,"When you choose to watch a film that is nearly five hours long (the director's cut), you make more than a simple choice for entertainment, you make a serious commitment to it. This is one of those films that isn't hard to make a commitment to.The German film (yes, spoken in German) ""Das Boot"" tells the story of a submarine captain and his crew in the claustrophobic and truly gritty submarine in the middle of intense battle that masterfully builds suspense. Nearly the whole film is shot in this claustrophobic environment (roughly three small rooms), and yet catches your attention better than most epic films in wide landscapes.But the true feat here is that a five hour movie in a small submarine can hold your attention without letting go. The acting is superb, the direction perfect, and the intensity nearly unbearable. This isn't your average film. It doesn't go to the happy Hollywood formula, but rather a realistic (and, in a sense, surreal) formula that is so very welcomed in the clutter of repetition.Though, not for everyones taste for sure.Rating: ***1/2 (of 4)Entertainment: **** (of 5)"
mynameismud,"Jan 29, 2003",9/10,"For those who haven't had the privalege of viewing this movie,simply need to.Its a different and truly compelling look at World War II through the eyes (and ears) of crewmen aboard a German U-boat.Typically,big budget WWII epics in American cinema are almost always shown through the eyes of American soldiers,but this is a look at war from the German point of view (the film is also entirely in german and was made by a German Production team)and gives the viewer a new understanding of life in a submarine,and life in the midst of a great war.The film is not focused on Allies vs. Axis Powers or Americans vs. Nazis,its about all the basic conflicts in story-telling.Man vs. Man, Man vs. Nature, and Man vs. Himself.It's not just a bunch of Germans in a boat,its men fighting for survival and their country and trying to achieve personal glory and pride as war heroes.Their hopes are quickly shatterd as they suffer through extreme physical and psychological hardship in the claustrophobic containment of thier submarine.You begin to find yourself completely engulfed in the suspense as you view this film especially with the newly remixed soundtrack for the Director's cut which is also about a full hour longer.With A running time of about 3 hours and 48 min. i loved every second of it.Every performance is top notch especially that of the new Lt.Werner who I really enjoyed watching.He doesn't say a large amount,but his intense silences and facial features speak for him.The part of the hard,war worn Captain is masterfully portraid by Jurgen Prochnow and is also a true highlight of the film.This is also an extremely large achievement for director Wolfgang Peterson who's vision has created a true war classic and essential for any moviegoer.War movie fan or not,it is a must-see.Its look at people in a time of extreme pressure and fear puts you on the edge of your seat not wanting to turn away.I highly recommend this film to anyone who is willing to read subtitles for almost four hours and experience the truly magnificent cinematic achievement that is ""Das Boot."""
macphersont,"Feb 12, 2002",10/10,"I loved the fact that this movie made no judgements based on Nazi's.  It showed what I would feel without actually being a submariner, a realistic portrayal of what it must have been like to be a U-Boat crewman during WWII. It is completely believable, draws you into its claustrophobic insides with a magentism that is rarely portrayed well in movies of this genre.  For anyone with an interest in WWII, submarines or marine combat in general, this movie is well worth owning.  Get the DVD if you can, and watch it in German (put on subtitles if you don't understand spoken German) and you will get an even truer feeling for this movie.  An excellent movie and easily makes the top 10 of my list."
FilmOtaku,"Jun 8, 2004",8/10,"Recently, I watched another (semi) war film, `The Deer Hunter', and in my review I complained of pacing problems that led me to not like the film as much as I would have, had there been a little more fluidity.  What solidified this position and what I have used as a comparison since seeing the film, was `Das Boot'.  In theory, I should have been bored.  Here we have a film about a German U-Boat that almost solely takes place on this boat (save book ending scenes ashore) and yet there was not one moment when I could conjure up any sort of criticism regarding the pacing.  There were multiple scenes where the camera pretty much panned the faces of the crewmembers, and still, it was compelling due to the masterful direction of Wolfgang Peterson, a director whose filmography (in my opinion) is spotty at best.`Das Boot' is intense, real and enthralling.  Very quickly I felt slightly claustrophobic because the film has an incredible ability to draw you into any given scene.  `Das Boot' was intriguing to me because it is rare that we see war films from any perspectives other than our own, especially from the perspective of the enemy; and showed that these men were doing their `job' in the war, exactly like the American soldiers were.  `Das Boot', while not one of my `favorite' war films, is indeed an excellent film that requires a certain time commitment, but that time will not be arduous or wasted.--Shelly"
