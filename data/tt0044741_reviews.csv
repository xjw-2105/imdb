Sleepin_Dragon,"Jun 15, 2023",9/10,"Kanji Watanabe discovers that he has cancer, and tries to seek some sort of meaning in his final days, he becomes aware that he's operated as a cog in the giant domestic machinery, and fights against the system.I've been working my way through The Kurosawa films, and thus far I've been impressed with the lot, I'll be honest, I expected a Samurai film, and when it became apparent that that wasn't the case either, I thought it may have been a mystery, it wasn't that either, instead it turned out to be a rather intimate, absorbing character study.It shows that despite being essentially part of a machine, Kanji has a very human side, only he realises it too late.This film moved me to tears on occasion, it had me laughing, it certainly had be captivated for the whole running time. That moment where Kanji explains what's happening to his son, it was phenomenal.I am learning more about Kurosawa with each film I watch, but I must admit, this one threw me totally off guard, it wasn't what I was expecting, it further enhances my realisation that Kurosawa was a genius.Remember all work and no play! There's a really meaningful message in this film.9/10."
The_Void,"Dec 16, 2004",8/10,"Ikiru is a film about life. Constantly complex and thought-provoking, although simple at the same time; it tells a story about life's limits, how we perceive life and the fact that life is short and not to be wasted. Our hero is Kanji Watanabe, the most unlikely 'hero' of all time. He works in a dreary city office, where nothing happens and it's all very meaningless. Watanabe is particularly boring, which has lead to him being nicknamed 'The Mummy' by a fellow worker. He later learns that he is dying from stomach cancer and that he only has six months to live. But Watanabe has been dead for thirty years, and now that he's learned that his life has a limit; it's time for Watanabe to escape his dreary life and finally start living. What follows is probably the most thoughtful analysis of life ever filmed.Ikiru marks a departure for Akira Kurosawa, a man better known for his samurai films, but it's a welcome departure in my opinion. Kurosawa constantly refers to Watanabe as 'our hero' throughout the film, and at first this struck me as rather odd because, as I've mentioned, he's probably the least likely hero that Kurosawa has ever directed; but that's just it! This man is not a superhero samurai, but rather an ordinary guy that decides he doesn't want to be useless anymore. That's why he's 'our hero'. Kurosawa makes us feel for the character every moment he's on screen - we're sorry that he's wasted his life, and we're sorry that his wasted life is about to be cruelly cut short. However, despite the bleak and miserable facade that this movie gives out, there is a distinct beauty about it that shines through. The beauty emits from the way that Watanabe tries to redeem his life; because we feel for him and are with him every step of the way, it's easy to see why Watanabe acts in the way he does. Ikiru is a psychologically beautiful film.It could be said that the fantastic first hour and a half is let down by a more politically based final third - and this is true. The movie needs it's final third in order to finish telling the story, but it really doesn't work as well as the earlier parts did. However, Kurosawa still delights us with some brilliant imagery and the shot of Watanabe on a swing is the most poetically brilliant thing that Kurosawa ever filmed. Together with the music and the rest of the film that you've seen so far; that picture that Kurosawa gives us is as moving as it is brilliant."
OttoVonB,"Jan 11, 2003",10/10,"Ikiru (""to live"")is a Kurosawa film devoid of samurai or Toshiro Mifune. It is an oddity in his canon, neither an adaptation, nor an epic, or even a detective story. Instead, it is the simple and touching story of the last months of the life of a man, Watanabbe, public official, who decides to give a meaning to his life by transcending the obtuse and stiff mind of government bureaucracy to get a small public children's park built. As a parable for the soulless workings of modern bureaucracy, the goal is set pretty high, and Kurosawa goes even further, giving this story a lot of character, frequent humor, life and, most of all, heart. And going beyond the strengths of the direction and script, is the central performance by Takashi Shimura (later Kambei in Seven Samurai). Shimura gives his character such a transparently good heart and such great pain that every second of Watanabe's plight and struggle tugs at your heart, not in an overwhelmingly sentimental manner, but in one than feels honest and pure. If even many hardened souls will be drawn to tears, it is not for pity, but, admirably, because of envy for Watanabe's beautiful human dignity in the end, and for a film to have such power is beyond pure accomplishment, as the need to see this and, more importantly, feel it, goes beyond pure necessity..."
Serge_Zehnder,"Jun 11, 2004",10/10,"Probably one of the most difficult aspects a film like ""Ikiru"" has to overcome is the very rough march of time. To actually find someone these days, let's say a crowd of regular movie-goers to sit down and watch a film about an old Japanese man dying of cancer would be too much to ask.Long held shots, hardly uplifting subject, to westerners very foreign. An array of reasons not to see it. And yet, once you actually start getting into the picture it doesn't let you go. Which is why it may be rightfully considered to be a classic.Of all of Kurosawa's films this is probably the one movie that works perfectly on a universal level. Because at its core it is about one of the most basic desires of human existence...namely to be able to look back on your life and say ""It was worth it.""In its starch and unforgiving black-and-white form the movie records the time of one man's life in such a beautiful and yes, colorful way, that by the time the final moments of the film play out, it will be very hard for anybody not to be touched. A glorious moment in 20th century cinema, that will hopefully be preserved for decades to come."
will_butler,"Oct 21, 2002",10/10,"I can safely say that I have seen no finer film than Kurosawa's true masterpiece, Ikiru.  The story of a dying petty bureaucrat in 1950's Japan, Ikiru is as uncompromisingly honest and beautiful a film as has ever been made on the subject of life.  Kurosawa elevates a story that could have been simple melodrama to the level of masterwork with a genuine love of his characters, and with an incredible technical direction.  The film's structure accentuates and deepens its many, many lessons on life, and the performances, including a heartbreakingly earnest turn by Shimura are all flawless.In short, Ikiru is easily one of the greatest works committed to film, and no discerning film aficionado should avoid experiencing it.  Had Kurosawa directed only this film, it would still be enough to include him in the pantheon of the greatest storytellers who ever lived.  Fortunately for us, it is simply the pinnacle of a staggeringly amazing career.  It is the absolute definition of a 10/10 film."
Raff-3,"Dec 18, 1998",N/A,"This film touched me in a way no other film has. Filmed in black and white and gorgeous, both in the visuals and in how the story unfolds. Behold the clever manner of gradually unfolding the story as people jog each other's memories at his funeral (an obligation for them, that gradually turns into a real eulogy). Everything is told in flashbacks: the mourners' memories unfold naturally, as people remember what the man did and struggle to comprehend why.This film I would nominate for the golden five of the century!I first saw it in 1956 or so at a small theater in downtown Chicago. A second viewing, years later, confirmed my initial pleasure!"
Quinoa1984,"May 19, 2004",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa knew how to get in touch with human nature through his art. With his visual expressiveness and storytelling, he could pierce through his subjects, even in his big and occasionally comical samurai films, and find the elemental things do work. What he probably learned off of Rashomon probably helped out with Ikiru (To Live), a story of an old man who finds out he will die within a year, as both stories deal with perceptions of the significance of a life spent and a life wasted. Though that was to a different degree in Rashomon, with Ikiru Kurosawa expands into full-on existentialism.The old man Kanji Watanabe (in a wholly believable and often heart-breaking performance by Takashi Shimura) knows his life hasn't amounted to much as a (chief) clerk for the city. He knows he hasn't had a great kinship with his son. He's accepting his fate with a heavy soul. One of the tenets of existentialism is that there's free-will, and the responsibility to accept what is done with one's life. Kurosawa might've (as I speculate, I don't entirely know) caught onto this for his lead, and it works, especially with the little details.Such little details, unforgettable ones, have been expounded upon by other reviewers and critics, such as the drunken, sullen singing of ""Life is short, fall in love my maiden"" in the bar. A scene like that almost speaks for itself and yet it's also subtle. But one scene that had me was one not too many talk about. It's when Watanabe is in the Deputy Mayor's office, asking for permission so that a park can be built. At first the Mayor ignores him, but then Watanabe begs, but not in a way that manipulates the audience for sympathy with the old man. The mayor must be sensing something in his eyes, desperate and weak, however determined, and it's something that probably most of the audience can identify with as well, even if they don't entirely identify with the character.But aside from the emotional impact Ikiru can have on a viewer, composition-wise (with the help of Asakazu Nakai, wonderful cinematographer on less than a dozen Kurosawa films) and editing-wise the film is ahead of its time and another example of Kurosawa's intuitive eye. There are some to-tomy shots sometimes (which could be called typical via master Ozu or other), but everything appears so precise on a first viewing, so descriptive. I think I almost can't go into all of them without a repeat viewing, but there were two that are still fresh in me. The first was right as Watanabe was about to sing in the bar, and there were these bead-strings looming in front of the camera. Perhaps mysterious, but definitely evocative.The other was when Watanabe and one of the other clerks are on a bridge during a dark part of the day. Both characters are in silhouette, and Watanabe gives an indication to the character that he will die soon. But for me, I wasn't even paying a terrible amount of attention to the words. The way the two are lit as they are, with the light in the background and darkness in the foreground, it could maybe give an indication of what Kurosawa's trying to say: we're all not in the light of life, but it doesn't have to be an entire down-ward spiral if the will is good. Whether you're into philosophy (ies) or not, Ikiru won't disappoint newcomers to Kurosawa via his action pictures. A+"
Brave Sir Robin,"Dec 29, 2004",10/10,"Kanji Watanabi is a quiet, melancholy man who has spent all his life behind his office desk doing sweet eff-all. When he is diagnosed with stomach cancer he realizes that he has been petty much dead his whole life, and searches desperately for away to live again.This is Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, yes, even better than Rashomon and The Seven Samauri. It is a perfect true story of everybody's life- how we don't even realize we have it until we know it will be over in a short while. Watanabi's quest for self-discovery is one of the greatest from any motion picture ever made. The all-too-true paradox is one to end all paradoxes- that Watanabi is dead, and had been all his life, until he realized he was sick, which is when he began living for the first time. Takashi Shimura, the actor best known for his role as the wise, bald-headed Samauri in The Seven Samauri, and the professor out of the early Godzilla films, plays Watanabi perfectly- in my mind, it's one of the greatest film performances of all time.Not everyone will love this movie. It was made a long time ago, the main character is an old fogey, it has subtitles, and it's pretty long. Many people today, especially young kids, would find it boring. Well, let 'em. There's no need to worry about them, they'll always have Pirates of the Carribbean, they'll always have The Matrix. Leave Ikiru and films like it to the true lovers of cinema."
wobelix,"Aug 29, 2004",10/10,"Being one of the Founding Fathers of Cinema, Kurosawa shines to all directions. In his diverse oeuvre it is hard, if not impossible, to find a weak work.Ikiru is the most humane film of this grand Humanist. Kurosawa's story telling skills are sublime, and he has surpassed himself with this movie.The slow pace and ditto camera movements (except in the night with 'Mephistofeles' where all is logically much more frantic) enhances the story superbly. What a pity some of the nowadays public can't find the tranquility and maybe serenity to watch a gorgeous film like that. That part of the movie lovers will miss a brilliant film, that would have lingered in the mind forever..."
kenjha,"Aug 7, 2011",6/10,"A dying man tries to seize what's left of his life. The pacing is lethargic throughout, but the film practically comes to a halt during the wake scene of the last hour. After the central character dies, it drags on for nearly an hour. As is usually the case with Kurosawa, he has his cast engage in theatrical acting. Perpetually wide-eyed and depressed, Shimura mumbles his lines while barely opening his mouth or moving his lips. It's a one-dimensional performance that saps the film of whatever potential it had. On the other hand, Odagiri is charming as a young lady who's everything Shimura is not: good-humored and spirited, enjoying life to the fullest."
Butch-Higgins,"Oct 16, 2003",N/A,"""Ikiru"" is supposedly one of Steven Spielberg's favourite films, and one can see the influence it's had on him not only in the sentimentality and the ultimate ""feelgood factor"" (which may be a little too extreme for some viewers, although the script never condescends), but visually, especially in the virtuoso sequence in which a reprobate leads our hero, a respectable and dull civil servant, on a whirlwind tour of Tokyo's frenzied nightlife - a masterpiece of camera placement and editing. With images throughout that will stay with you for a long time, and a terrific supporting performance by Miki Odagiri as a vivacious young ""office lady"", ""Ikiru"" is still an absolute knockout more than 50 years on."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 17, 2012",10/10,"As a great fan of Akira Kurasawa, Ikiru is not just Kurasawa's most moving film it is one of his very finest alongside Seven Samurai and Ran. It is as always beautifully made, sumptuous in look and the cinematography simple yet interesting. Kurasawa's direction is at its most delicate, making a story that could easily be mawkish and manipulative into a genuinely moving, powerful and quite inspiring one instead, and making us also care every step of the way for the dignified central character of Watanabe. Together with a hypnotic score, a thought-provoking script and a powerful, yet in a discreet and heart-wrenching way, lead performance from Takeshi Shimura, and you have a fantastic film.Overall, I can't praise Ikiru enough. Any complaints of how the final third is not as good as the rest of the movie is valid but I didn't care so much after being moved and inspired so much by the film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
grantss,"Dec 29, 2016",10/10,"Kanji Watanabe is a civil servant. He has worked in the same department for 30 years. His life is pretty boring and monotonous, though he once used to have passion and drive. Then one day he discovers that he has stomach cancer and has less than a year to live. After the initial depression he sets about living for the first time in over 20 years. Then he realises that his limited time left is not just for living life to the full but to leave something meaningful behind...Written and directed by the legendary Akira Kurosawa, this is his magnum opus. Yes, Seven Samurai, Rashomon or Yojimbo might be more popular or more critically acclaimed but this, for me, is his greatest work.Incredibly profound and thought-provoking, examining life and living it plus death and what you leave behind. Also takes a dig at politicians and the wastefulness of the civil service.Very engaging too: characters are well-formed and develop throughout the movie. Moreover we empathise with Watanabe and his issues, issues which are relatable.Highly emotional towards the end too, as we see the impact he has made.A timeless classic."
Galina_movie_fan,"Sep 7, 2005",10/10,"There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own. Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" (To Live), 1952, is one of them. The film of rare humanity, profoundly moving and often funny ""Ikiru"" tells the story of a dying man's last crusade that turned out to be his triumph, the best thing he had ever done in his life; something he will be remembered for. The film reveals both absurdity of life and the ability of man to find meaning in it through selfless action.Two years before he played the tough lead in ""Seven Samurai"", Takashi Shimara gave even finer performance in a very different role as a government bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe who seemed to lead a life of quiet desperation at his job and at home. Then, he learns that he has terminal cancer and faced with the fact of death, he first tries to take from life as much as possible and spends the half of his savings on gambling, drinking and women. It leads him nowhere and gradually he determines to achieve one good thing before he dies, and settles on converting a junkyard into a playground for children. Rather than make a feel good movie with co-workers helping Kanji Watanabe in his quest and his family around him at his last moment, Kurosawa portrays him as a lonely crusader. No one can understand why this park is so important to him. The answer is very simple, he does not have time and he wants to live to see the park open. His family and co-workers don't even know how ill he is, and that makes some scenes even more powerful and poignant. His words, ""I am not angry with anyone, I have no time for that"", the look at his face when asked by a mafia member if he did not care for his life - these scenes are heartbreaking. The film has many quiet but compelling moments like these.For me, watching ""Ikiru"" was as close to earth shattering experience as it goes. I think it is one of very few films that could really change one's life. I could not help comparing it to ""Cries and Whispers"" - how devastated I was by the theme of inevitable death, how ugly it is, and how helpless we all are while facing it. ""Ikiru"" is about a dying man, too, but how hopeful and life affirming it is. The film did not tell or teach me something I had not known before but it confirmed once more that it is never too late to do something even if you have only few months to live."
Platypuschow,"Aug 12, 2018",7/10,"Ikuri (To Live) currently stands as the 124th highest rated movie on IMDB, and though I respect the accomplishment of getting onto that list I have to say the films are very often not to my taste.The film tells the story of a bureaucrat who learns that he has an incurable stomach cancer and has between 6 months to a year to live. He's spent 30 years in the same boring job and is faced with his mortality and the question of whether he has wasted his life.What would you do if you knew you had months to live? That is the challenge facing our protagonist and it makes for a bleak, yet oddly uplifting human tale.Being Toho I expected it to be well made, it was. Being an Akira Kurosawa film I expected it to be dark, it was. And being that it starred Takashi Shimura I expected it to be well acted, I can confidently say this is a career best.The multi award winning epic certainly deserves it's accolades, Takashi is amazing.On the flipside I think some of the writing is underpar and the films construction is head scratching in places. Despite this however the film is riddled with fantastic messages of both hope and despair and coveys them perfectly.Not the easiest of viewing but regardless still a fantastic piece of Japanese cinema.The Good:Incredible performance by Takashi ShimuraExcellent underlining messagesThe Bad:Poorly constructed in placesThings I Learnt From This Movie:I can't figure out how businesses got patrons before the smoking ban"
Andy-296,"Feb 20, 2007",5/10,"This 1952 film by Akira Kurosawa, about a civil servant learning he has terminal stomach cancer, and trying to do something socially meaningful in the last months of his life to redeem his boring and uneventful life, has become a bit overrated. Some people has even called this film a masterpiece. The material is certainly moving, but the movie is stilted and static, the performance of the main actor is of one note, and the dialogue explains often what is obvious to the viewer. Realistic movies were not Kurosawa's forte. One cannot help but notice that at about the same time Ikiru came out such directors as Ozu and Naruse were making much stronger, fluid and unmawkish movies dealing with the everyday life in postwar Japan."
tomgillespie2002,"Jan 5, 2014",10/10,"As difficult as some Japanese films can be, Akira Kurosawa was always welcomed by Western audiences due to the director's embracing of the cinematic, as opposed to, say, the static, conversation-heavy work of Yasujiro Ozu. Still known primarily for his samurai action films and his film noir homages, Kurosawa's movies were action-packed and grandiose, shot beautifully through a lens that brings to mind the great American westerns or the shadowy mise-en-scene of Orson Welles, making them almost Western in tone. Ikiru, one of Kurosawa's most spiritual and tonally dark films, took a few years to make it across Pacific Ocean, and it's not hard to see why. Although, in my opinion, this is probably Kurosawa's greatest achievement, the subject matter is sobering, it's satire alarming and it's story-telling techniques unconventional.The film opens with an X-ray of our protagonist, Watanabe (Takashi Shimura). The narrator tells us he has stomach cancer, but he does not yet know this, and so we join him, reluctantly, as he goes about stamping his papers in his stagnating job as a bureaucrat. Quiet and eternally hunched, Watanabe is an introverted man, spending little of what he earns to the frustration of his selfish son. When he learns that he has only about a year to live, Watanabe goes through the familiar stages of acceptance as he drinks, parties, fails to turn up for work, becomes involved with a much younger woman and angers his family. But he soon turns his attention to building a children's playground, a project he has seen passed around by the many pencil-pushers in the various departments within the council he works for, which has frustrated the residents of the decaying area.It's with this shift of focus that comes the true masterstroke of Ikiru. Up to this point, we have been with Watanabe every step of the way, but suddenly, as the narrator informs us, he's dead. We no longer get the first-person perspective, but the third-person perspective, as various colleagues and political players gather for Watanabe's funeral. The film becomes less a human drama, and more of a social-political statement, as the other dead-eyed civil servant's in his office slowly come to realise the greatness of the man. The deputy mayor is there, claiming Watanabe's work was within the confines of his job and proving the bureaucratic machine works. This, of course, is simple electioneering, but the others reminisce and the truth begins to slowly reveal itself in the final months of Watanabe's life.A lot of the film relies on the performance of Shimura, a long-time collaborator with Kurosawa. He is utterly magnetic here, remaining a hushed presence and developing his persona into a weapon to ensure his work gets done before he bites the bullet. In a heart-breaking moment, he croaks a quiet song in a packed bar for it to fall silent. The young hipsters slowly move away, while Watanabe's companion, a booze-addled writer, looks emotional. Kurosawa, only 40 at the time, was also making a comment on the post-war social outcasting of the elderly, embodied in the aforementioned bar scene and in Watanabe's success and money-drive son. Ikiru is many things, but it's the humanity of the story that will linger on in your mind after the credits have rolled, and it ends with one of the finest closing shots in history.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
claudio_carvalho,"Oct 1, 2005",9/10,"In a Post-War Tokyo, when the bureaucratic chief of department of the City Hall Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) finds that he has a terminal cancer, he decides to intensively live his last months of life. While dying, he finds the meaning of life, and fights for the construction of a playground in a poor zone of the city and the legacy of his existence.""Ikiru"" is another beautiful movie of Master Akira Kurosawa. The story is very touching and shows the lifestyle of Japan in the 50's. The performance of Takashi Shimura is amazing and heartbreaking, in the role of a man that finds that he spent his life for nothing: his son, motive of his sacrifice, does not care for him and his unproductive job does nothing but useless paperwork and a pejorative nickname of ""Mummy"". In the end, a wonderful message that never is too late to live, watch the sunset and plant a seed of love. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Viver"" (""To Live"")"
siderite,"Aug 3, 2023",9/10,"The story of the film is simple. It's the details that stand out, the subtle hints, the acting and, of course, the directing. I will say that I've also seen the 2022 British adaption and this is by far the superior version. However, there is a problem with the film: it's way too long and slow. It lasts almost two hours and a half and all the scenes are really drawn out. I really think you should watch this film, but do it before continuing to read the review, though.To me, this film seemed to be a direct challenge to the Japanese status quo. It wasn't about a man, but about all people of Japan, locked in strict forms of conduct, eroded by Western influence, growing apart, unable to enjoy life. The protagonist of the story is the head of a state city department, one that should take care of the city and its citizens, but just shuffles paper around and sends people on labyrinthine quests to solve even the simplest problem. Then he finds he is dying and, spurred on by a desire to experience everything he lost in 30 years of pretending to work and pretending to live, he goes on a quest to rediscover himself. The ending is both heartwarming and unnerving, a nudge toward finding your own way as a person, regardless or circumstances.I found the rigid structure of the city hall a caricature of Japanese tradition, the distracting, but ultimately empty, Americanized bars and strip clubs a stain on a Japan defeated less than 10 years before the film came out and the discussion at the end a parody of society, always talking, but never doing. There are subtle scenes that make more sense only when you think about them. The moment he comes back to the car and the look he shares with the carefree young man, the other look he shares with the corrupt Yakuza boss, the sound of the train going by in some of the scenes, the children singing Happy Birthday the moment he figures out what he has to do and so many others that I've probably missed.I liked the direction even without knowing it was Kurosawa, I like the main actor, although I hated his mumbling voices, and the others were a bit weird, but OK. Probably I would have looked weird in a 1952 Japan. It's a film that plays on your heartstrings, but also appeals to the cerebral. I had difficulty continuing to watch it, but it was worth it in the end. I recommend it!"
bob the moo,"Sep 15, 2008",N/A,"For pretty much his whole working life, Kanji Watanabe has been a bureaucrat in one of the departments of the city. In terms of long service it is impressive but in terms of living or achieving something, it is practically the equivalent of having never been on Earth in the first place. This is just one of the realisations that hit Kanji when he discovers that not only does he have cancer but that his options are limited and death is perhaps only months away. Determined to try and capture what he sees others doing and unable to really talk to his son, Kanji makes several new acquaintances before decided on his final actions.I've been using my DVD rental subscription to catch up on ""classics"" that I have never actually seen and recently that has seen me focusing on Akira Kurosawa who I consider a great filmmaker  but mainly because that is what I'm told, hence me seeing for myself! The last few films were very famous ones and also period pieces in feudal Japan so Ikiru was a bit of a change of pace for me and I wasn't even sure what it was about. The rating and high esteem it is held in is probably a bit misleading because those expecting to be amazed or blown away by ""one of the greatest films ever made"" etc will be disappointed because it is a very low key piece. This makes it less roundly enjoyable than, say, Yojimbo, but no less great a film  just very good in a different way. Being a very slight film, we do not see Kanji blow the world away or decide to go sky-diving, climbing a mountain or any one of many things that make their way onto these ""things to do before I die/ turn 30/40/50/whatever"" lists but rather he just looks to feel energetic, less old and just have small fun that his drab life and focus on work has seen him lose.In trying to discover something that will give him this, we see him almost desperate and I loved the mix of pity and fear in the eyes of some of those around him  as if death is perhaps catching. We see it in the bar where he sings and kills the mood and also in the eyes of his female colleague who he so desperately wants to be brought alive by. Ultimately his act is not one of self but one for others; nor is it a heroic act of his own labour but one of gentle persuasion to make others act  in fact it isn't even anything amazing but just a small achievement to try and make him forget the years of inactivity and bureaucracy. It is touching in the simplicity and the meaning of the journey and I did also like the structure of the film at the two-thirds mark where we start looking back instead of following the story forward. Although less full of spectacle than his other films I have seen, Kurosawa delivers some great shots but is more impressive in the detail. He stays very close to his main subject and we are not allow to stay distant from the loss and sense of waste that he feels at the end of his life. It helps greatly that he has drawn a great performance from Shimura, whose face is so expressive and eye's are like a direct link to the character's thoughts. He is the heart of the film and a bad performance would have killed it, but no risk here.Ikiru is perhaps not as well known as some of Kurosawa's work and it is not as easily enjoyable as some of his other films but in this low-key piece there is a real gem of a film that is beautifully delivered without sweeping sentiment, big gestures or lies in the narrative or characters. For this it is all the more touching and another reason why the director is held in such high esteem."
TheUnknown837-1,"Apr 9, 2010",7/10,"Some people consider ""Ikiru"" (""To Live"") as the greatest movie that Japanese director Akira Kurosawa ever made. And remember, this is the same man who also directed acclaimed masterworks such as ""Ran,"" ""Kagemusha,"" ""Seven Samurai,"" ""Yojimbo,"" and ""Rashomon."" Many of Kurosawa's movies also touched on a human level amongst their scenes of gritty, visceral violence and the brilliance of ""Ikiru"" is that its emotional levels outscore all of those without one clip of actual, physical barbarism unless you count a death threat scene near the end of the picture.No swords are swung, no blood is sprayed in ""Ikiru"" because this is not a period piece like ""Seven Samurai"" or ""Kagemusha."" Set in modern-day Japan, a middle-aged bureaucrat discovers despite his doctor's attempts to hide the truth from him, that he has stomach cancer in that he will die in six months...or less. The bureaucrat, Kanji Watanabe, played by the great Takashi Shimura in what may be his finest performance, mourns over the lack of a real life that he has had so far. At work, one of his unenthusiastic employees calls him ""the mummy"" because he does live life to its fullest. He has spent his entire life stamping sheets of paper without bonding with his son or enjoying the time he has on earth. As the title would hit, Watanabe decides that he has ""to live"" before he inevitably dies, and leave something for him to be remembered by.The ways that Akira Kurosawa tugs on our heart strings is utterly brilliant. The level of sympathy that our souls generate for poor Watanabe is simply amazing as even the younger generations can identify with his fears. I don't think there's a person alive on this earth who is not at least subliminally afraid of the dreadful disease of cancer and the even greater fear of knowing that you only have a short time left to live. Like John Wayne's last film ""The Shootist,"" we develop incredible amounts of sympathy and remorse for the protagonist and the tender moments are truly tear-jerking.Kurosawa's storytelling skills are displayed to their absolute fullest in the first two-thirds of ""Ikiru"" when Watanabe discovers he has cancer and then begins to encompass all opportunities that he has left to him. There's a wonderful subplot where he begins to bond with a younger woman who has an unbelievable passion for living. Now this sounds like a formula for a creepy, off-putting payoff, but it does not. Rather, this becomes one of the most enthralling elements of the picture.Now, I will admit it, ""Ikiru"" is not, to my mind, a perfect motion picture and therefore it is not on the same level (to me) as some of Kurosawa's other films. The reason why is because the last third of the picture, I'm terribly sorry to say, runs out of steam. It does not stretch out with the same passion and enthralling emotions that the previous two-thirds did. Perhaps it just did not flow through the way I had wanted it to.But then again, I am still rather young. Film critic Roger Ebert has stated that ""Ikiru"" was his choice for Kurosawa's best film and that every time he saw it, it became more powerful for him because as he grew older, he identified more and more with Kanji Watanabe. I shall undoubtedly come to cherish and adore ""Ikiru"" as I grow older. As it is now, in my youth, I see it as a wonderful movie that does a tremendous job up to a certain point where it only runs slow just by a smidgen. Everything before that is absolutely wonderful and absorbing. ""Ikiru"" is one of Kurosawa's most emotionally-strong pictures and one of the greatest to tackle the subjects of cancer and more importantly, life and death."
bscale,"May 4, 2023",10/10,"I have been watching movie for 20 years, this movie is just too good to rate now. My previous 10 star ratings in this website cannot catch up with how this one made.For total 2 hours and 20 minutes, it moved me constantly with extraordinary screenplay editing. I think nobody can top up this screen arrangement, in term of camera movements to close-up shots.Gradation of the protagonist voice from healthy to near-death is fascinating, not just how his body transformation from upright to crouching body.The storytelling is the best example of how to do, it is masterclass movie to study. The details, the actings, and sound of people are ridiculous great.It is dafe to day that this movie should be in top 10 in every available classic movie. It is for me one of the greatest piece of cinema that human can imagine. It is so simple but so powerful."
DisinterestedWisdom,"Jul 20, 2022",7/10,"I think some of the gushing reactions to this film may be just a tad overdone. I mean, it's a good film, entertaining, but also at times tedious and lacking in any kind of real character development. Takashi Shimura as Watanabe tends to lay the angst on heavy without actually expressing the sentiment or emotion that one would expect from a man in his situation, especially as it relates to his son. His son and wife are mere caricatures, central to the plot but given short shrift as the film spends an inordinate amount of time on unnecessary development, for example the wild binge night that he spends with the novelist and his relationship with Miki. It does speak to issues of life and death in some roundabout way, and it can be forgiven for being a bit mawkish in terms of Watanabe's transformation; that would be standard for cinema of the period. Still, it is just a tiny bit trite to think that a man who's sold himself so completely into a life of oblivion suddenly finds a passion for service, because... well we aren't sure why. It seems to be the influence of Miki, but hers is anything but an example of service. Its a sweet thought, if not a bit saccharine, but ultimately dubious. In addition, in taking on as much as it does it doesn't always succeed. The critique of Japanese society is always present and reinforced in various ways, but sends the narrative off in too many directions, ultimately diluting the central story line. Enjoyable in many ways, but often discursive, it's a good film but not a great one."
briancham1994,"Sep 18, 2021",5/10,"This tedious plodder of a film attempts to express some touching and philosophical truths about the meaning of one's life, told through the story of an old bureaucrat who is dying of stomach cancer. However, the result is very thin and feels empty. There are a few moments that hint at something deeper, like the episodes with the man at the bar, the young woman and his own son. The reminiscence of the song from his youth is definitely a memorable scene. However, these get repetitive and don't add up to much. By the end, we've been served a trite idea that life is short, fleeting pleasures aren't the way to live and true service to others can give us meaning. If only it didn't take two and a half hours to get there (especially the incessant praise from his drunken colleagues which padded the runtime to no effect)."
Ricc0,"Dec 26, 2016",10/10,"Partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's short novel ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"", ""Ikiru"" (To Live) is a Japanese drama film that revolves around the life of an old bureaucrat who learns that he has few more months to live due to terminal cancer. Kanji Watanbi is not so shaken by the fact that he is going to face death as he is by the fact that he left nothing behind.. he could not even remember a moment that he truly lived. He has been long dead! Now, he looks back with regret.. his eyes are frozen, his soul is empty, and he finds himself drunk in a bar singing with a voice that is so cold. Is it too late now to start searching for a meaning?The film shows at the beginning the protagonist sitting on a desk with piles of papers around him.. drowning in this inefficient system of bureaucracy, going by the codes and regulations without emotions, without feelings. It doesn't matter if he saved some money, or if he has been the section head for some time... he is a mummy. Yet, after being confronted by mortality, Watanabi now is determined to go on a last quest to discover his own-self and find what is truly meaningful.. this time not behind a desk but in helping, caring, loving, and being a righteous human being.""Ikiru"" sheds light on the deficiencies in the social system of Japan post WW2 (the film's events occur in the 50s), on the decay of the family life and bonds, and on the matters of life and death and the responsibilities of every human. The script is touching, deep, and warm that it truly inspires.. with ""Ikiru"" you are not just an observer. And for the closing shot.. well it is considered to be one of the best ever, especially when you live with Watanabi his last days, hours, and moments. Another masterpiece and my personal favorite among Kurasawa's masterworks."
beachtv-1,"May 19, 2023",8/10,"""Ikiru,"" directed by the legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, is a profound and deeply affecting meditation on the human condition and the essence of life. Known primarily for his samurai epics, Kurosawa ventures into the realm of the intimate and introspective with ""Ikiru,"" offering audiences a narrative experience that is as illuminating as it is emotionally resonant.The plot centers on Kanji Watanabe, a middle-aged bureaucrat who, upon discovering that he has a terminal illness, embarks on a poignant quest for meaning in his previously mundane life. It's a compelling journey that subtly oscillates between the melancholic and the hopeful, underpinned by a deep existential angst that gives the film its hauntingly evocative quality.The late Takashi Shimura delivers an incredibly powerful performance as Watanabe. His portrayal of a man grappling with the inevitability of his mortality is so nuanced, so sincere, and so deeply human, that it becomes impossible not to share in his despair and eventual epiphany. Shimura's masterful performance lies at the heart of ""Ikiru,"" imbuing the film with a profound emotional depth.Kurosawa's direction is, as always, impeccable. He exhibits a rare sensitivity in his handling of the film's heavy themes, carefully balancing the bleakness of Watanabe's reality with moments of warmth and quiet humor. The film's pacing might seem slow to some, but this measured approach allows the audience to fully appreciate the thematic depth of ""Ikiru.""The cinematography is beautifully understated, a quiet observer to Watanabe's life, while Fumio Hayasaka's elegiac score provides the perfect auditory backdrop to this soul-stirring journey.Despite the seemingly somber subject matter, ""Ikiru"" is anything but depressing. Yes, it's a film about death, but it's also a life-affirming testament to the human spirit's resilience. It makes you contemplate the transient nature of existence and the importance of finding meaning in the everyday.In terms of criticisms, some may find the film's pace slow, and its narrative structure, particularly the shift in perspective in the latter half, a bit jarring. However, these are deliberate choices by Kurosawa, meant to drive home the film's themes and messages.In conclusion, ""Ikiru"" is a profound cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression. It takes you on an introspective journey, eliciting a range of emotions, and leaves you with a heightened appreciation for life. It is an invaluable gem in the realm of cinema, a film that transcends cultural and temporal boundaries to deliver a timeless message about the human condition. It's a must-see for anyone seeking a truly meaningful and thought-provoking cinematic experience."
treywillwest,"May 8, 2021",9/10,"This justly celebrated work is often considered uncharacteristic of its auteur. I've heard it said that it more resembles an Ozu, than a Kurosawa film. I would argue that the only way in which it is un-Kurosawaian is in its subject matter, and even in this respect only superficially so.It has become a cliche to say that of the three classic auteurs of Japanese cinema (Kurosawa, Ozu, Mizoguchi) that Ozu was the most ""Japanese"" where as Kurosawa was the most ""western"". The latter claim strikes me as undeniable. Kurosawa's indebtedness to John Ford is frequently apparent. While it does so in an exceptionally powerful manner, ""Ikiru"" treats it's subject in a way that is more characteristic of Hollywood than of Ozuian cinema.Were one to read a simple synopsis of the plot of ""Ikiru"", a bureaucrat in 1950s Tokyo discovers he is dying of stomach cancer, one would not be blamed for imagining the film as uncharacteristic of its director. It in no way deals with violence as do almost all of Kurosawa's period pieces and noirs. However, like Kurosawa's work in general, it approaches its seemingly simple story as a grandiose conflict in which the protagonist overcomes an obstacle to his goal. Indeed, without intending to give too much away, I think it is fair to call the film's protagonist a ""hero"" by the end. The film is unquestionably powerful and moving, profound even, but it achieves its effect by way of the emotionally manipulative machinations of western melodrama. Ozu's work, which often examines the everyday grievances of death and loss, does so with a stoically detached manner that makes his work, in my opinion, deeper than that of Kurosawa.There is another way in which ""Ikiru"" is distinctly Kurosawaian, and that is one which is most particular to the director. As in ""Rashoman"" Kurosawa is boldly experimental in his manipulation of narrative time. Yet even this strikes me as very western. The non-linear telling of the story highlights the emotional impact of certain scenes in a way that is very operatic in a western sense. As I watched ""Ikiru"" it struck me that Kurosawa might be the single most important influence on the work of Quentin Tarantino."
MovieAddict2016,"Oct 16, 2005",10/10,"""Ikiru"" is a film that expresses itself through two separate parts. The first half is the exploration of a bitter man's death and the second half is an affirmation of life provided through the awareness of mortality, recalled by those whom he knew best.Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is the protagonist of the story, a bureaucrat whose job provides him with little more than paper-shuffling and pen-pushing.The movie opens with an x-ray of Watanabe's stomach and the cancer that thrives within it. His doctor tells him he will die soon.Throughout the first half of the film, Watanabe stumbles about helplessly, remembering his life and trying to figure out what has come of it. He lives with his son, whose resentment for his own father has peaked over the years.Watanabe realizes no one in his life actually knows or loves him. He walks about in a permanent stupor of self-loathing. He embarks on a friendship with a younger female co-worker, but even she soon hates him and thinks he is ""creepy."" Towards the end of the film, Watanabe finally dies and the second half is the recounting of his final days by co-workers. We realize Watanabe's life changed drastically towards the end and he dedicated his final days to the construction of a playground for children.The Criterion DVD is excellent, and inside is an essay written by a Kurosawa biographer. He notes that the film is a study of existentialism and mirrors a few themes from Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane,"" which is true - I was very much reminded of Welles' film at certain moments throughout ""Ikiru."" Both films offer solid examinations of life and death and what propels the man stuck in between - in both cases the cruelties of life broke apart the men, leaving hollow shells where souls once existed. In Watanabe's case, his seeking of his own soul finally brings him to a state of contentment and inner satisfaction - his death is, at the beginning of the film, a lingering doom; and at the end a peaceful pact.This movie can change the way you look at life if you open your eyes. Kurosawa might have made better films but ""Ikiru"" is his most emotionally resonant and powerful that I've seen."
Rokol,"Jul 19, 2004",10/10,"I think that Ikiru is one of Akira Kurosawa's most personal films. This shows in the identification the viewer has with the main character of the movie. Every development in Watanabe's life is like a experience in the own viewers life. I have never been so touched and at the same time been amazed by a film.I just can't see why so many people have trouble appreciating this movie. Maybe because they aren't used to black and white pictures these days.Ikiru is a movie that can't be missed, so be sure to see it. 10/10"

The acting is superb,Takeshi Shimura brings us a powerful performance as a weak men, without doubt Shimura belongs to the list of the greatest actors of all time.I truly mean that this is one of the greatest movies of all time. But i have a single problem with this movie.After i saw it , every other movie i see it looks for me a waste of time.Watch it !!!"
tedg,"Apr 4, 2005",N/A,"Oh what a curse to be a genius! Here we have a nearly perfect film, perfect in all the ordinarily engineered respects. It is rather haunting, and if you choose to watch it you will find it memorable. But Kurosawa is not merely a maker of well engineered films, together with perhaps a hundred others. No, he is an inventor, someone who imagines new ways of dreaming. He invents vision.So when we have a film that is merely excellent but inventive, we are saddened.Missing here is the deep layering, usually three deep with different movement. Missing is the explosive turn. Missing is the grand scope, connecting in selfaware fashion to powers beyond a mere human.We do have some complex storytelling: the last third is a matter of discussion and argument among the surviving bureaucrats about what happened in the fashion of ""12 Angry Men."" But it centers on the humanity, indeed the worth a life. Small stuff for normal Kurasawa adventures.You may want to see this if you are a casual watcher. Or if you are serious and want to see all this master's films. But otherwise, I'll steer you away from it. It is merely strong and compelling, not lifealtering.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
jackmathys,"Nov 17, 2018",6/10,"A film about a society, not about one man.
The protagonist is an inarticulate, voiceless wreck who tries to salvage 30 years of wasted time with one good deed. Good deeds are not permitted. A well-crafted vehicle for a typical existentialist ""art"" film, but nothing to write home about."
Big G-2,"Jan 24, 2003",10/10,"IKIRU is a masterpiece.  I couldn't disagree more with the last reviewer who thought this was overrated!For me it truly deservers to mentioned among the greatest features. Takashi Shimura, playing the dying bureaucrat, Watanabe gives one of the finest performances ever.  In this feature, he looked so weak and fragile.  But in SEVEN SAMURAI (as the head samurai Kamebi), he is strong and able.   Some might think it was two different actors!The man is dying of cancer for goodness sake.  Not everyone handles the situation the same.  Watanabe is just another soul trying to cope with the despair, and for me this was powerful stuff. (I should give kudos to Kurosawa.  The man was able to do more than just epic samurai movies).Hollywood tearjerkers don't compare with IKIRU.   And eventhough this is a 50 year-old black and white foreign movie with subtitles, it shouldn't be an excuse not to watch this.  Expand your horizons.  You may be pleasantly surprised."
moritzherz,"Apr 8, 2023",6/10,"Ikiru is an emotional film. A bureoucrat has been diagnosed cance at the end stadium. For the last 30 years he has done nothing else than stamping papers. He realizes that he has not been living in all these years. Now he wants to enjoy life for the rest of his short time.Akira Kurosawa picks the next brilliant topic to make a movie. Ikiru is emotional, realistic and most important human. It not only tackles the topic of how people should react when they have been diagnosed with a severe disease, it also critizises the enormous amount of buroucracy. This problem not only exists in Japan, Germany struggles with it, too.Ikiru is a well written, heartwarming movie you should watch if you can."
Kdosda_Hegen,"Jan 2, 2021",5/10,"This film is exhausting. I did not find it interesting nor very deep, since it's about a very common experience in this world. It's a Wonderful life did a much better job on why life's worth living for."
BenGW1,"Sep 17, 2001",9/10,"IKIRU is a great film, and a universal one as well. It could translate to any society where there are individuals who live their lives in jobs that are meaningless, who have little personal joy, who don't really know how to enjoy the blessing of life that they have. They won't die homeless but they often die alone and unrecognized. The message of IKIRU is amazing in that it's about the difference one man can make without being preachy or contrived.Mr. Watanabe isn't a great man, nor is he a bad man. He is an ordinary man, undoubtedly drawn from real-life examples of Japanese government workers in the post-WWII era. The thing about his life is that everyone is comfortable with his state of being, until he finds out he's dying and sets out to fulfill a nearly-impossible building task. After that, no one, including him, is comfortable, and that splits between the people who think he's out of his mind and the people who realize that he is driven to make a positive difference before he dies.The most remarkable facet of IKIRU is that we get a sense of this division without seeing any truly evil characters. Mr. Watanabe's son is not likable, but we sense he's got more of a backstory with his often-absent father than we could suspect and don't just hate him (though he's most outspoken about refusing to try and understand what his father was thinking). And the transformation of this man, from a catatonic civil servant to a dynamo obsessed with change, does include an element of madness, albeit in a focused and positive form. And that made me have more respect for Mr. Watanabe than I ever could for someone who was the classic white knight figure. He fought through the barriers that had delineated his spare, safe life and really accomplished something. That's the lesson here, one that Akira Kurosawa presents without jumping up and down about it, and that makes IKIRU a timeless masterpiece."
joel-280,"Jun 28, 2005",10/10,"Superb acting, camera work, cutting, blending of past and present -- Kurasawa and his team take what could be a hokey, sentimental story and create a masterpiece about (sorry to be so trite, but...) the meaning of life. It may be a bit far fetched but this movie recalled to my mind Homer's Odyssey, in the sense that it too is about ""doing the right thing"" -- honor -- heroic response to challenge. In the case of the movie, this is set in a banal, ""everyman"" context of the timid petty bureaucrat Watanabi. The B&W photography, perhaps not deliberately since that was still common in the early '50s, emphasizes the metaphorical aspects of the story.Watch it!"
petshop,"Feb 4, 1999",10/10,"After working as a civil servant for 30 years Mr. Wantanabe is diagnosed with cancer and has only a few months to live.  He realizes that he has wasted his life and tries to make a change.   Coming to this decision is a rocky road itself, as he turns to alcoholism and begins to stalk a young woman.Shimura's amazing performance can bring repulsion one moment and pity the next.  He cuts off the personal space of a young woman and you can feel him sucking the life out of her.  In other scenes, his frustrating passiveness wins your heart as you see where it may have come from.Ikiru is a a dark comedy as well, a sad social commentary of the red tape and bureaucracy of post-war Japan.  Wantanbe eventually makes it his mission to press through this tape and turn a sewage ditch into a park."
kdryan,"Nov 8, 2001",9/10,"Ikiru was my favorite Kurosawa film even before I saw it.  I had read Roger Ebert?s wonderful commentary at his ""The Great Movies"" page and told myself many times that I must get it and never quite got around to it.  I had purchased ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Hidden Fortress"" and found both of them delightful.  The former is probably the greatest action movie ever made and the latter has scenes as intense as anything modern directors ever put on celluloid.  But somehow while I figured Ikiru to be more my type of movie than any of the samurai flicks, I still held off buying it.  I told myself many times to do so, and searched high and low for the DVD, but no American company is willing to come out with a version yet.  I finally settled for having one shipped from China and as of this writing it has yet to arrive.Then I found out a co-worker is dying of cancer.  Having read multiple reviews, searched for months for the DVD and visited almost every Kurosawa site out there, I felt comfortable recommending a movie I had never seen when I almost never recommend a movie to people at all.  I immediately purchased a copy of the video and the afore-mentioned DVD from eBay; the video for him and the DVD for myself.  I received the video last night, banished the wife and kids to bed and for the next three hours sat awed as the story of Watanabe?s life unfolded before me.I could not have made a better choice.  The story takes hold of you and you follow it and never want to let go.  There are several slow spots that you have to work through, but that is the point of this movie.  This is not a movie to check your brain at the door for.  If you are looking for action and adventure with a plot you'll forget about when you try to tell your friends about it the next day, you are in the wrong place.  If you want a deep movie that will make you think and re-examine your life then this is your ticket."
drunk.jack,"Mar 2, 2000",10/10,"As a great fan of Kurosawa, and of Japanese cinema on the whole, Ikiru was a great find for me, rarely receiving the exposure of Seven Samurai, Rashomon et al (although they too are unique and defining films).The story of aging clerk Watanabe discovering he has cancer manages to be deeply moving without stooping to maudlin sentimentality, as is so common in Hollywood productions that deal with the same theme (just watch Terms of Endearment).  Here it is a process of catharsism that leads him through the early days of hedonism to the enlightened finale where he justifies his life as a human being of worth.One of the defining post-war Japanese films along with the likes of Tokyo Story, it reflects a society amidst the turmoil of reconstruction, both politically and economically, and ultimately emotionally.  The image of Watanabe on the swings is one of cinema's greatest moments, reflecting a poignancy that for me has become synonymous with the best of Japanese cinema, from Mizoguchi to Takeshi Kitano. A profound and personal film from the most renowned of Japanese directors.Anyone with a modicum of compassion and patience will recognise it for the masterpiece that it is."
krasik,"May 18, 2002",N/A,"Watanabe realizes how inessential most of his life has been. ""the mummy"" has been dead for many years when he finds out about his body's illness. The coming of death awakens him to life. All previous considerations of remaining stable and safe are shattered (the man having slept for 30 years awakens to the emptiness of his life). What happens here is the neglect of the Delphi oracle ""know thyself""; the approach of death forces Watanabe to examine his life, and this reveals the horrifying void. Many men postpone Socrate's question ""What is a good life"" until some shock awakens them to the decades lost to thoughtlessness (perhaps many only awaken to quickly fall back asleep, like a slave awakened from wonderful dreams who demands to return to them). Watanabe's courage, as noted by the drinking novelist, is his serious consideration of his life (stand and fight) rather than going back to sleep or suicide (run like hell).Watanabe's courting of the working girl is a determination to find something in life, and at their last meeting she gives him the necessary clue. How can you be so happy? She answers that she makes bunnies and thinks many children are happy thanks to her. She lives with some meaning, however trite. Watanabe returns to work determined to do something meaningful. He is happy as soon as he gets the idea and until he dies, working honestly to help create something beautiful.The song sung by him, in the first instant(when drunk) seems to suggest a passionate hedonistic life - given the atmospher this interpretation fits; however the second singing (his last words) is Watanabe swinging on a swing in the park he helped build. In the first he is melancholy and weeping, in the second he is joyous. The words can be paraphrased ""life is short. fall in love maiden. don't let the passion in your heart die"". Watanabe's message is not to indulge in drunken forgetfulness but to find something worthwhile to love, and use one's passion to create something good. It is an appeal to not fall into self-forgeting, but awaken to the urgency of life and the need to love beauty and create it.Watanabe says, ""I don't have time to be angry"". The urgency he feels makes this clear - there is only time to love and admire. In light of his purpose, anger is pettiness.while admiring the sky ""This is beautiful. For 30 years I have not noticed"".The movie also comments on the apathy of people in bearocracy. He reveals that one man can do great things and that apathy is evil that destroys society.Kirasowa asks us to examine out lives, to awaken and look about. Beauty is going unadmired, and men capable of creating beauty are passing the bucket."
knuddelholic,"Oct 25, 2002",10/10,"All right, I have to confess in advance that I might be called prejudice as I think that Akira Kurosawa is one of the great moviemakers ever as he is an artist.Maybe eccentric in some ways but making movies in a special way which you find today not much more, simple and clear, letting the viewer concentrate on the psyche and character of his movie characters without splitting them up in good and bad like light entertaining movies from Hollywood. This movie is another good example of giving us a view into different personalities and their different ways how to deal with life and death.The movie does leave it, like most Akira movies, to the viewer to make our own decision about the characters and their actions. Showing us like in different mirrors the light and shadow sides of our all psyche which we have in us and which we often prefer to deny even from ourselves.Ikiru makes this even clearer as it plays in a modern society instead of the old feudal Japan, which is too distant to most viewers.But the problems showed in the movie and the good and bad traits we can see in this movie are timeless as they show the whole facets of human emotions and traits and how we can grow beyond ourselves when we get confronted with certain situations. Showing without a lifted finger how a single individual can touch the life of others and set a shining example for bravery and determination.And like so many other movies of Akira does also Ikiru leaves the viewer behind with stirred-up emotions, making us once more clear to what positive or negative actions human beings are able to, leaving us with shame and pride at the same time and open the mind for asking ourselves what we often did good and bad in our life and how this decisions affected others.I can just highly recommend watching this movie and showing it also to teenagers to give them something to ponder about."
montferrato,"Mar 8, 2021",5/10,"Overrated, as many movies from Kurosawa. It is very long, the performance of the lead actor is not the best. A lot of Moralistic interference. It looks like a Frank Capra movie. Some people like this type of stories. I prefer doing the judgement myself, instead of being administered "" Moraline Pills""."
Tim-230,"Dec 2, 1999",10/10,"After seeing this wonderful film for only the second time in thirty-five years, I was reminded of how much it resembles Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich.  Both stories are efforts to grapple with the the imminence of death when it finally arrives for a believably human person who touches us deeply because we so readily recognize our own weaknesses and strengths in his. Much in both stories can also be connected with theories on death developed later by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.Like most symphonies, the film can be divided into four movements: 1) Background and diagnosis, 2) Making up for the waste of the past I--a night on the town, 3) Making up for the waste of the past II--a pathetic infatuation, 4) Funeral scene and flashback on the building of the park. Ikiru is less about a corrupt and obstructionist ""system"" than about one man's struggle to achieve something memorable before he dies.  Everything about this masterpiece is graced with a subtlety that is uniquely Japanese and uniquely Kurosawa's.The sad little infatuation of elderly bachelor Watanabe with a young former office underling is a superby honest appraisal of human nature on the parts of both characters.  And the moment during the funeral when the committee of mothers arrive, kneel, and spend a minute in deep keening was one of the most wrenching emotional experiences I have ever received from a film.Takashi Shimura is so good an actor that watching him is like a form of meditation.  Just looking at his photo on the funeral altar brought tears to my eyes.  It is astonishing that this harmless-looking little man also played the role of the leader of the Seven Samurai!"
rjammin,"Jul 27, 2001",10/10,"A magnificent, masterful, unjustly neglected work on a subject that all thoughtful people will face sometime in their lives.  (Yes, everyone will die, but how many truly face that reality?)  And for those who have not given too much time to contemplating their life, how they will not live forever, what they have done to date with their lives, what things they may want to accomplish before dying, this film may spur on such thinking.  While the details of ""modern Japan"" depicted in the film are from around 50 years ago, the content and message are just as relevant for today's audience.  Perhaps more relevant than ever. This is NOT a ""feel good"" film.  There is no Hollywood happy ending, no easy resolution of the conflict portrayed.  The director and prime author, Akira Kurosawa, is very passionate about how people need to wake up and get out of the ruts they have fallen into and perhaps have followed for decades.  He also is astute to the limitations people may have or have set up for themselves, how such limitations blind them to what goes on around them, how becoming more aware of such things and of possibilities outside their limitations can be so painful and hard to grasp, and, sadly, how often they are not grasped or acted on at all. Real life is on display in this film. The film is structured as a two part invention with a coda, to borrow musical terms.  Both parts deal with discovery.  The first part, besides introducing almost all the characters and setting up the plot mechanics (very economically done!), shows how the protagonist, a long time city government employee and low level manager, comes to realize (indirectly!) that he doesn't have long to live, shows how he (in several, painful missteps and poor communication) comes to terms with the situation, and what he decides to do with the remaining time left. This part is lively, bounces around from scene to scene, jarring the viewer with new scenes, situations and points of view that keeps one concentrating on what comes next.  They are filled with irony.  With so much activity occurring in the moment, the viewer is not given time to get caught up in bathos or maudlin sentiments. The second part reveals the Japanese way for reflecting on the life of ""the recently departed.""  It is very regimented with the most important people positioned closest to the memorial, with those of lower status trailing away from it.  It is typical for the comments about the deceased to be cool, measured, not completely laudatory at first.  After a few drinks of sake, when people loosen up and become less inhibited, praise for the individual begins to appear, then take over the talk or conversation.  It is in this setting, with these rituals and conventions in mores, where Kurosawa's sense of irony and rage (outrage?) are ratcheted up further.  For all of them are trying in their own way to understand what the protagonist accomplished and what was his motivation.  He had become a mystery to them during his last months of life and want to solve that mystery, especially after the citizens of the district - whose focus was the deceased's last public act - enter to pay their respects.  (It is an amazing scene to behold, which must be seen, savored and internalized.)  The viewer wants to know what happened as well.  Stories are told (and acted out for the viewer) which demonstrate that what was said early in the wake clearly did not do justice to deceased.  This section is much more static, and greatly, subtly depends on what the viewer has seen in the first part. The coda shows who understands the mystery and reveals how life can be so frustrating and miserable along with its possibilities.  The irony and rage are at their highest fever pitch in these few short final scenes. Within this structure and plot, Kurosawa is able to touch on many aspects basic to modern life.  They include: office politics, social status, the generation gap, poor communication, youthful aspirations, parental aspirations, gossip, children living at home, group dynamics. In addition, he shows specifics of Japanese culture of the early 1950's: American influence (music, shows, though no Americans are seen in the film), third world medical practices, wakes, proper gestures and bowing, etc.  All these aspects are shown in context, are not unduly emphasized, and make their nonchalant contribution to the plot.  Viewing the film with these in mind becomes a richer experience. By making this film, Kurosawa shows how the world could be altered and made better, that the status quo can be overcome.  Yet it also shows, when someone embodies such attitudes in his/her life, how they can be so easily misunderstood and, worse, readily ignored by others.  It demonstrates how so much effort is often required to accomplish so little in return.  Life as it is has never been portrayed any better than in this marvelous, extraordinary film. Quite simply, it is the greatest film ever made. Technical notes: This film was made in 1952 by Toho and it shows in the poor sound quality (the shot of the protagonist heading home from the doctor's office being a special, wonderful exception), the shakiness of certain images, and the overall wear of the print.  The negative for the film does not exist; it was destroyed in a fire.  The film cries out for restoration, but it would be a costly undertaking.  The film is 141 minutes long on the video, not 143 as printed.  The English subtitles on the video are from the 1960 Brandon Films release.  They need to be revised: there are some scenes where important information is not translated."
PedroPires90,"Nov 7, 2022",10/10,"For many it was with Seven Samurai, for others with Rashomon (which I also love), but the Kurosawa I was looking for I found in Ikiru.It's hard to explain everything the movie represents because so many people tend to only focus on the main themes of the movie - death, wasted time, regret, legacy, the search for something that inspires us - that they forget so much about what the film also has to say about family, rumors, and about not being seen by those around us, even if it is our own son. There is so much that we take for granted in our lives - including our parents - that we can never show how we really feel about everything we encounter in this life. And when we decide to change because of a certain event and then everything remains the same? It takes a lot of strength and courage to change anything.It is here that Ikiru surprised me with all the critics of society, public institutions, and politics. Kurosawa was much more incisive than I expected in that regard, doing it right from the opening scene and carrying those themes with him all the way to the final scene.The performances are always at a very high level, with Takashi Shimura being the highlight with a role that touches us at various levels, not only because we feel his pain, but also because it inspires us the most so we don't waste our whole life as he did. Miki Odagiri as Toyo is also fascinating, and I'm just sad she didn't show up in the third act.Technically, there are beautiful shots at any given time, and of course, when the swing scene arrives, our hearts drop to our feet. Excellent soundtrack and cinematography too.I don't say this often, but this film is, without a doubt, a masterpiece."
ppesa,"Jul 18, 2005",10/10,"It's hard to find the words to make someone ready to see something you love without revealing your own pomposity. To put it another way, you can damn with hyperbole just as surely as you can with faint praise. And I really don't want to do that to this movie, because it's amazingly well done, definitely worth seeing, and you'll be a better person if I don't turn you off before you scour the library and independent video outlets for it. So if, like me, you're the sort of counter-dependent brat who revels in ignoring advice that isn't your own, please rent the movie just to prove what an ass I am.For the rest of you who don't use your late fees to prove you cultural sophistication, I'd nonetheless recommend using extended rental policies to see this one a few times. Admittedly, I haven't seen this movie since my VHS days, so the DVD might include the usual goodies that I have no business commenting on. I'll poach off another commenter here and describe Ikiru as a movie about a life almost unlived, and how we find real reasons to overcome the inertial slide to death. Watanabe is the sort of bureaucrat that makes Kafka look like Schwartenegger, and his tentative walking coma at the movie's outset still resonates among those of us making our living in cubicle farms, whacking computer keys like lab rats for our paycheck-pellet rewards.The news that he's dying forces Watanabe into a painful contemplation of the life he's wasted, and the scenes that reveal his back-story are touching and human. When I saw Watanabe's anguish in his doctors' wait room, I was reminded of the pediatrician's office I visited as a child. And when Watanabe's young son humiliates him with embarrassed shame at the boy's baseball game, I felt the guilt a son feels when he doesn't honor his father. When Watanabe finally decides to act, we are moved by his humble desperation to feel alive.I'd agree with other commenters that the final third of the film is a bit stilted; considering the subject matter, however, we can hardly fault Kurosawa for being accurate. Furthermore, I'd rather not take any of the slow, subtle joy you'll get out of this movie by endlessly pontificating about it. Go see it, and if you're not the dork I am, tell others about it too."

Leofwine_draca,"Mar 13, 2014",6/10,"An epic-length movie sure to test the patience of most viewers weaned on modern, short-attention-span fare, IKIRU is a very different change of pace for Akira Kurosawa in comparison to his period samurai action films. It's a slow, poignant and utterly heartfelt tale about a bureaucrat who discovers he has terminal cancer. The film takes that as a starting point and we the viewer proceed to watch as he undergoes a journey of discovery.The story takes inspiration from the likes of Goethe's FAUST in places, but elsewhere it's all it's own. It is admittedly very slow in places - an entire hour seems to consist entirely of men sitting in a room while they drink and argue - but at the same time it's oddly watchable. It helps that Kurosawa is a master of his form, and that he elicits a painfully human performance from his long-time regular star, Takashi Shimura.Come the end, I was most reminded of Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, the classic starring James Stewart. However, IKIRU is the more realistic of the two films, stripping back the fantasy and the sentiment to reveal a starker truth entirely, but one equally as profound."
aislinndragon,"Dec 1, 2005",10/10,"I first saw Ikiru during Japanese-my teacher would often have us watch movies to try and pick up on some of what was being said. I instantly fell in love with the film: it's symbolism and the way in which the subject matter was held. It really captures that government dead-end, run-around that see far to often when trying to get something very important done, while also dealing with the let-downs and triumphs that we sometimes see in our own lives. This movie was so wonderful that I borrowed it from my teacher to show all my friends, and even my parents (my dad needed to see in particular as he was a state worker vaguely resembling Wantanabe). I found this to be a very touching, very inspirational, yet also sad and cynical movie. I think that anyone who watches it would understand what I mean. I would definitely suggest everyone see it!"
ma-cortes,"Apr 29, 2020",7/10,"One of the Great Films of Our Time and heartbreaking drama dealing with a humble civil servant (Takashi Shimura , who is superb in the central character as an intrinsic noble public official) who suffers cancer , following a drunken bout of panic , aimless wandering and odd encounters on learning that he is dying ; eventually discovers a meaning to his empty life patiently pushing through a project to become a city dump into a kiddies' playground , though at the end the sense of desolation remains complete .What can a heart filled with despair grab on to? This isn't it. It isn't here either. I want to do something. There is something I must do. Frivolous human beings who only contemplate the meaning of life when suddenly faced with death.Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece easy to patronise as a classic movie about a clek who finds out he is dying of cancer and he then decides to build a children's playground and give something of himself back to the world . An intensely stirring picture all the same elegiac and sometimes quirkishly fun in the manner of kurosawa style , and following in the wake of his admired John Ford . A classic film about humanism , a celebration of human nature holding an intrinsic nobility , well paced in real sense and great sensibility . Concerning truths of a lifetime bring out the beauty in a person, and move the heart like a tender poem. A sensitive and moving film , including the crucial and wonderful shot of the sick man sitting huddled alone in the park on a kid's swing , while the snow falls and he croons happily to himself as he waits for death .The motion picture was compellingly directed by maestro Akira kurosawa possibly his most Eastern movie .A great achievement in Kurosawa trumphant avoidance of happy end uplight . The usually restrained Kurosawa was one of the films directed of the film history .After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this awesome film . The previous years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , the epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , a masterful rendition that transports the story to Medieval Japan , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , and Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the ""Best Foreign Film"" category. When this film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . Rashomon won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The successful ¨Yojimbo¨ influenced in the known film Leone¨For a fistful of dollars¨is mainly cribbed from this Japanese samurái action classic Yet , there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on Living , The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide . Other important movies were : The idiot based on Feodor Dostowieski , Drunken Angel , Scandal , A quiet duel , Tiger's tale , High and low . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) and Rhapsody in August , among others ."
ebossert,"Jul 6, 2007",4/10,"This review continues my recent assault on particular cinematic themes that annoy me incessantly, and therefore require a therapeutic purging via an extensive (and scathing) IMDb review. The topic in question here is Akira Kurosawa – hereafter referred to as the ""lesser"" Kurosawa, primarily because when one hears the name Kurosawa one should immediately think of Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who is superior in almost every respect to this ""lesser"" Kurosawa, a director artificially propped up on an undeserving pedestal by a group of disillusioned followers. Sure, he had one solid film in Seven Samurai (1954), but every time I see his other movies I wonder how the hell anyone could think that this guy was a great director. It befuddles me, even though I am a huge fan of other directors from the same time period.My primary problem with the ""lesser"" Kurosawa is his indisputable ability of getting the absolute worst out of his actors and actresses. In Ran (1985) Tatsuya Nakadai (who played Lord Hidetora) contributes a series of embarrassingly overacted moments during any and all scenes where strong emotion is required. In Hidden Fortress (1958) Misa Uehara (Princess Yuki) gives one of the worst performances of the 1950s. Even Toshiro Mifune had a truly inept performance in Rashomon (1950). In Dreams (1991) almost everyone stinks the place out. Ikiru (1952) continues the track record for this ""lesser"" Kurosawa, because Takashi Shimura (who plays Kanji Watanabe) is quite simply horrible in this film. He basically has three modes of facial expression:1. Wimpering Crybaby Mode. 2. Sad Puppy Dog Mode. 3. Hallucinogenic Mode.I'll leave it to the viewer to identify the specific instances where each of these modes are employed by Shimura, but I simply cannot help but comment on #2 above. During Sad Puppy Dog phases, Shimura's face lengthens and his eyes bug-out to make even fruit-flies jealous. Basically, he looks like a 3-year-old after being scolded, not a person of sufficient maturity enduring pain or suffering. He doesn't react to situations like any grown man would. In fact, the Watanabe character is so devoid of basic humanity that he comes off as a stand-in for Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I'm not kidding when I say that Shimura's facial expressions make Ikiru both unintentionally hilarious and infuriating. I literally wanted to strike him with a blunt object or stick needles in his eyes just so he'd stop staring pathetically at me through my television screen.This whole situation ruins the entire film. The crux is that even a mediocre director should have prevented this by instructing Shimura appropriately. This ""lesser"" Kurosawa was apparently incapable of understanding the concept of ""overacting"", so he let Shimura ham it up for 140 minutes. You can almost hear this ""lesser"" Kurosawa behind the camera:""You're a puppy dog, Takashi. You're a puppy dog. Show me those puppy dog eyes!""It's no wonder why George Lucas found ""inspiration"" from the ""lesser"" Kurosawa's works, since Lucas practically perfected the ""art"" of getting the absolute worst out of his actors, regardless of how good they perform when not under the ""influence"" of good ole George.Like many of the other works by this director, Ikiru is about an hour too long. Watching Watanabe go clubbing for 60 minutes was totally unnecessary. The very thin premise was stretched out for so long that I was reminded of Peter Jackson, who needed 600 minutes to tell one of the most basic, formulaic stories in the history of cinema. The ""lesser"" Kurosawa could have trimmed the first half, but in all honesty it would have only made this agonizing cinematic experience shorter, not better. Since the lead protagonist had the reason and intellect of a 3-year-old, there wasn't much in the way of potential development, and what little occurs comes from out of nowhere. The entire maturity of Watanabe is expressed in a segment spanning a few measly minutes, when he goes to work with zeal and runs out the front door to help the people. Kurosawa – in his infinite stupidity – then chooses to cut the sequence off completely, only to then shoot ahead half a year in time to show a bunch of politicians reminiscing about Watanabe's tasks for 45 minutes. There is simply no way that the viewer can relate to the revelatory happiness of the main character through the third-person conversations of characters that had a combined screen time of only a few minutes previously. It's a total miscalculation on the part of the director who takes the cheap way out with an abhorrently overrated ""swing"" scene in the snow. Yes, the scene is pretty, but it simply cannot substitute for a lack of character development that essentially occupies 5 total minutes out of a 140-minute film. And no, I refuse to count 30 minutes of puppy dog glances as character development.The mediocrity of this much-loved ""lesser"" Kurosawa is even more evident in the fact that other, greatly superior dramatic directors like Yasujiro Ozu were making fantastic films like Early Summer (1951) and Tokyo Story (1953) – films that make Ikiru (1952) look like amateur hour at best, because they have everything lacking in this film – great acting, storyline, and character development with believable, realistic performances. It's a travesty that exceptional directors like Ozu must live in the shadows of a lesser director who is, quite frankly, incompetent.It's almost humorous that the ""lesser"" Kurosawa came out with Ikiru in the time period in-between Ozu's films mentioned above. We can safely call this a crap sandwich."
PIST-OFF,"Sep 6, 2007",10/10,this movie made me go a big rubbery one. this was way more emotionally resonant than Kane. when happy birthday swells....how do i explain this to friends? how do i recommend this to the derelicts and scumbags i proudly call my friends? i'm not even sure what to say to recommend it. it's something intangible but raw. i can't really refer to anything in particular except the movie was just strong. well worth the $10 criterion disc. this may be one of my new favorites. maybe it's all the cold medicines talking. or maybe that this is kind of like Kane in reverse. the big emotional pay off right in the middle. or maybe it's because unlike Kane our protagonist Watanabe is actually a sympathetic character. is it even possible to watch this movie in groups of people?
kosmasp,"Aug 11, 2010",10/10,"Still let me begin with maybe one of the things that seem to work the least. The ending or should I say ""the endings"". I'm not going to spoil the ending of course, but if you thought Lord of the Rings (3) had too many endings, you could be excused feeling the same (or worse) with Ikiru here.But if you really think about it, even this minor flaw is necessary in the eyes of Kurusawa and therefor as he deemed it rounded up the story, agree with him or not, but it does take the movie to another level. If you are willing to go there and still have the strength to go there, you will be rewarded.But then again, the whole movie is a great experience. And while in other hands this could have become a very muddled affair, trying to push on the morals. A true masterpiece."
mike_peters,"Apr 29, 2004",10/10,"yes id just like to add to the database a little extra information for non-japanese speakersnamely about the nice song the film takes as its theme, as u will notice there is a break in the subtitles when ""our hero"" is singing it in the night club, i think some translation has been left out because it would not make sense exactly without explanaition ( or being japanese )the song is called gondora no uta , which is kinda like ""the gonola song"" and it was released around 1915 if my memory serves me.at that time in japan men and women were not allowed to ""date"" or be seen together alone in public, so basically the song is this guy singing to his sweetheart, come, take my hand and come on this boat etc etc, so that they wont be seen and they can be alone without being frowned upon.just thought ppl might like to know, as for my opinion of the film, bloody marvelous, one of the very very best :)"
gga,"Apr 5, 2000",10/10,"There's no doubt that Kurosawa was one of the best storytellers of the 20th century, appreciated by critics and audiences alike. Still, when mentioning his greatest achievements, most people place ""Rashomon"", ""Ran"" and ""The Seven Samurai"" as his most notable pieces.  Only a few will remember this little film that has so much more significance than those others. ""Ikiru"" is a movie that can bring you to tears with very little manipulation.  It's a movie you will not forget, a life lesson.  It's a movie that will forever change how you think about movies.  It is a social criticism.  It is a discourse on bureaucracy. Improving on Rashomon's non-linear way of storytelling, this is a film that forces you to pay attention.  There are no samurai fights here.  There are no melodramatic dialogues where characters scream at the top of their lungs. There are no forced tears in the character's cheeks. This is a movie of very subtle, inner conflict, with a very simple premise: What would you do if you had three months to live? Kurosawa's answer is so devastatingly powerful, smart and original that it will change you forever.  Or maybe, it won't, proving that the director's pessimistic view of humanity was correct."
bjcwrite-1,"Jul 24, 2005",10/10,"""Ikiru"" is Akira Kurosawa's greatest film. Ikiru in Japanese means ""to live.""And the film tells the story of a man who, upon learning he is terminally ill, doesn't just realize he has lead a meaningless life  but that he hasn't lived at all  a story of a man who begins to live only after he learns he is dying.The first part of the film shows us Watanabe's ""life"" before, and after, he learns he has stomach cancer, and has only three months to live. He realizes he has never really lived.The film informs us that Watanabe thrashing his way through empty efforts to live, to find some meaning to his life. At the end of the film's first half, he finally sees something that opens his eyes to how he must spend his remaining days.The film then takes us to its second half  which begins at a wake held in honor of the late Kanji Watanabe. The rest of the story, how Watanabe spent his remaining days, is told in the flashback recollections of Watanabe's former workmates.Ikiru opens with Watanabe, a widower, at work stamping papers in his dreary civil servant job at Tokyo City Hall. He hasn't missed a day of work in 30 years, and never takes vacations. He lives with his callous son, and his inheritance-obsessed daughter-in-law.The film begins with a group of women arriving at his department to complain about a cesspool in their neighborhood. They want it filled so the site won't be a health hazard; it should be filled in so the site can be a playground for their children. Watanabe dismissively tells them they must take their problem to the engineering department. Off they go, shuffled from department to department until they end up back at Watanabe's department, empty-handed.When Watanabe discovers he is terminally ill, he fails to show up for work. No one at the office sees him for days.He wanders the streets, until one night he is at a bar and begins to talk to a novelist about his fading life. The young man takes Watanabe on a tour of Tokyo's night spots. Maybe a little frivolity is the missing ingredient in Watanabe's life.At one of these places, Watanabe kills the festive atmosphere when the piano player asks for song requests. Watanabe mumbles that he wants to hear an old song, ""Life is Brief.""As the pianist plays the sedate, lovely, tune, Watanabe tearfully sings the song:Life is brief, Fall in love, maidens; Before the crimson bloom, Fades from your lips; Before the tides of passion, Cool within you; For those of you, Who knows no tomorrow.It is a beautiful scene, which will be revisited in a different, more memorable way near the end of the film.Night turns into morning, and Watanabe doesn't want to have another night on the town. He then encounters a young girl who used to work at his office, and they eat lunch.He begins to spend a lot of time with her, and is able to laugh with her hoping part of her liveliness will rub off on him. However, the girl tires of the dour old man, but agrees to meet him for one more dinner. Watanabe tells the girl he is dying and was hoping he could somehow discover from her how to live.During the dinner, she does something that gives Watanabe his breakthrough. He now knows what he must do. He goes back to his office, and digs out the proposal to fix the cesspool and build a park at the site. He immediately takes the proposal to another city department to shepherd the proposal to completion.Next, the movie takes us to the wake, where we learn the park was completed. The women who stormed city hall at the beginning of the film arrive to mourn for Watanabe. And they really mourn, while the opportunistic deputy mayor  who tried to kill the park proposal, then later took credit for it  silently watches. Tellingly, the women have nothing to say to the deputy mayor or the other city officials present.Kurosawa's camera focuses close-up on face after face, the embarrassed expression on the face of each city official reveals they know the truth they won't admit: It is Watanabe who deserves credit for building the park.Later, Watanabe's former co-workers debate his dogged dedication to building the park. The officials, by now drunk, recall his final successful struggle to create the park, but cynically misinterpret everything he did.The fact that they fail to grasp the simple kindness of Watanabe that redeems his otherwise wasted, unhappy life underscores something the funeral party does not comprehend: that Watanabe, not any of them, was the true victor and happy man.The last person to see Watanabe alive, a policeman on patrol, comes to the wake to honor Watanabe. Watanabe's body was found in the park the night before. But the policeman describes, what seemed to him, an eerie site.The film's last flashback shows us what he saw: Watanabe is at the park late at night, using the park's swing set while snow gently falls on him. While slowly swinging, he sings ""Life is Brief."" This scene is one of the most beautiful, memorable experiences in all of cinema. Try watching it without tears welling up in your eyes.Ikiru is a masterpiece -- It doesn't call attention to itself. It is only afterward that Ikiru's brilliance becomes plain  the perfection of style and the dignity and sorrow of Shimura's acting.By Brian Cole"
THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,"Jul 1, 2021",8/10,"Life is temporary, but we all seem to forget it as we go through life. It sometimes hits you though. And usually the first thing to come to mind, especially in case of lives as Watanabe's, is our regrets. It is good that even one action can undo all those regrets. The film is painfully real. Also it is unbelievable to see that the political regime has not changed even after all those years. Therefore, with all its reflection on human nature and political criticism, the film manages to stay very modern to this day."
TheEnigmaticRonin,"Oct 15, 2007",7/10,"Ikiru is a classic piece of cinema about a man who starts ""to live"" when he finds out that his days are soon over, directed by non other than the great Akira Kurosawa.""Ikiru"" is a tragedy about a man named Kanji Watanabe (Shimura), who works as a bureaucrat. Kanji spends his whole working life doing nothing, just like his colleagues, and finds out one day that he has stomach cancer and will die in few days. Knowing that life will end very soon, he tries to live.""Ikiru"" is very radical in its style of narrative, for its time. The film starts with a third person narrative, that tell us about the character's situation, It simplify the story, so we don't have too use to much time, or put too much effort, to get into the protagonist's dilemma. Another example is a scene where we see how the officers reply the people who come in with questions and complaints. The scenes are shot in a very ""documentary"" sort of way, where it looks like that the officers are replying to the same question, a technique later used in documentary shows.The plot of the film is new for it's time, and starts right on the subject. The script is a bit confusing though, because the story focus on the character, and then goes to the world he is living in, where it makes you think that it changed it's focus to the ""system"", on the society, and not this particular individual, and then it comes back to the protagonist. It gives the character more dept and makes him more real, that makes sense, until a part of the film ,where it jumps back to the society again. Other than that, the sequences are set chronologically in order , with a few flashbacks that gives the protagonist, and other characters a lot of development. It gives us a better understanding of relationships between the individual characters.The cinematography, and usage of the camera gives a lot development and dept to the protagonist, and his situation. Throughout the film there are several close-ups, and extreme-close-up-shots, of Kanji. Showing us his facial expression, that shows depression, emptiness, illness, loneliness, and delivers an overall tragic feel. An example is during a conversation with a female colleague at a restaurant. The film also have a scene, just after he finds out about his illness, where shots fades into each other to create a disturbed atmosphere, this effect is used by other directors in later films, an example is the opening scene of 1980s, ""Tetsou"" by Shinya Tsukamoto. The flashback scenes are very clear, again thanks to the cinematography, where the picture dissolve to the flashback, Visually the story is easy to follow.Most of the characters in this film are "" types "", instead of individuals, for example you got the ""happy girl"", ""the mean boss"", ""the selfish son"" , and so on. The characters are developed in a very ""Henrik Ibsen"" sort of way (a famous Scandinavian dramatist). The actors portrayed the roles very well, but the only well developed character is the protagonist. Takashi Shimura, who portrays Kanji Watanabe, menages to express Kanji's feelings through facial expressions. Because the character itself talks very unclear. That gives us a disturbing feeling of, that this man can't express his pain. The character is so real, that we actually sympathize with him. Antoher impressive thing with his character is how he develops through the film. Everything from his voice to his ability to talk, gives us an view of his condition. Shimura's acting was also appreciated internationally, and he was nominated for BAFTA award for best foreign actor (1952). The cast of this film is seen in almost every Kurosawa film, to name up a few examples : Seiji Miyaguchi, Minoru Chiaki, Daisuke Kato, Isao Kimura, Katamari Fujiwara, Takashi Shimura etc., but their roles are very different from the other films, that underlines their versatility, and is maybe the reason why Kurosawa works with them frequently.The setting is very different from Kurosawa's atmospheric samurai films, that made him so famous. The story is set in a ""westernized"" Tokyo. Everything from the characters's clothes and hairstyles, to the music they listen to, and the clubs they go to, is pretty western. An example is a scene, where Kanji, visits a club, the girls are wearing western skirts, are listening to jazz, and dancing in a way like they did in the US, back in the 50s. In a early interview with Kurosawa, he mentioned that one of his autheurs in his films are ""the theme itself"" ( Ref. ""Reading A Japanese Film: Cinema In Contex"", by Keiko I.McDonald ). A question, that ""Why can't people live happy together""?. He claimed that this question is raised in all of his films, there are ""places"", in this film as well, where this question is raised, an example on that is, the relationship between Kanji, and his son.Overall the film offers some wonderful effects, and great performances, and an interesting plot, on the contrary side, the focus of the film is a bit unclear, what or who, it is about. The protagonist or the society he is living in?"
osaltkjel,"Nov 23, 2008",2/10,"The good rating this movie has achieved at IMDb is due to the fact that people who choose to watch a Japanese movie from the 50's are capable of appreciating such a movie. In other words...the rating has not been given be a mean of the people.Personally I can't stand the blockbusters from Hollywood, so in my search for more interesting films I watched this one. I like deep movies, but this one was just too slow. The old man was mumbling the few times he spoke, and unless my subtitles were messing with me he always ended up saying ""In other words..."" or ""What I'm trying to say..."" It gave a funny view on the bureaucratism and what life is all about, that must be said, but this is a typical example of a film being overrated just because it's different. Applause for the diversity in the film-making, but this is not worth watching unless you really enjoy the odd stuff."
LaundryMatt20,"Mar 3, 2021",10/10,"This is one of the most beautiful films I've seen from one of the world's most powerful and influential filmmakers. I can't recommend it enough, it's truly wonderful and touching, and through the sadness, even heartwarming."
aamilsyed,"Dec 24, 2013",10/10,"There's little that I need to say about Akira Kurosawa, one of the greatest film-makers to have walked the earth. This is perhaps his simplest and most stirring movie. A simple setting, a very straightforward story line and very real characters. There was nothing extraordinary about this movie, except the journey that it will take you on.For a little over two hours, you become a bureaucrat in the pre- reformation Japanese society. You start off as a corrupt officer of the government and you then go on to experience apathy, sorrow, grief, revival, struggle, disappointment and then finally inner peace.The movie is not just about Japanese society. It is not a commentary on the state of affairs at that time. It is a brilliant take on the human condition itself. A telling tale of transformation, by whatever means, of a human being into a humane being. Yet, it is bitter-sweet in the sense that even such a metamorphosis doesn't really change things too much. People see the man and his transformation, they hear his story. Some of them even weep for him and grieve, but in the end, they all move on. C'est la vie!A must watch for all movie aficionados and a movie worthy of being cherished. A classic and a masterful work of art. I assure you that when Watanabe sits on the swing and sings his final song, you will feel that lump in your throat."
abhinav-veerwal,"Jan 6, 2016",10/10,"It is my favorite movie of all time. there are so many movies and television series that have made me excited and happy over the years but there are few which can so repeatedly make you feel the happiness as does this movie. I being a doctor in a country like India where people are generally so simple also helps me realize how does this movies protagonist feels as the events turn up. Few of my friends say all he did was a simple job in the end, but they are actually missing the whole point of it. Its just that all of us are bounded so much by our limitations in daily life that only whenever we just try our level best to do whatever our heart says, are we actually fulfilling our purpose, no matter the size or impact of that thing or emotion. Please watch this movie with your parents and family once to even enhance this beautiful journey."
yusuftardas,"Nov 28, 2023",8/10,"Ikiru is the second chronologically Deconstructed masterpiece in the filmography of Akira Kurosawa, one of the greatest directors cinema has ever seen, made between two masterpiece-level films such as Rashomon and 7 Samurai..The film, which is extremely humanistic and touching with its story, has achieved a very important and concise position on the international platform, especially in the Far East, both with the very successful performance of its protagonist and the skillful narration of Kurosawa. When it comes to Kurosawa, most moviegoers think of more prominent classics such as Rashomon, 7 Samurai, Yojimbo, Derzu Uzala, Kagemushave Ran however, Ikiruda is one of the master Japanese director's works that should definitely be watched in the filmography. My bp score is :10/10."
mujtaba-69242,"Feb 12, 2018",9/10,"This film really captures real life, deep and a touching story that shows you how people really are and what a person should do with his life. An amazing performance by Takashi Shimura that he should've been recognized by major awards."
henry8-3,"Feb 21, 2022",7/10,"Mr Watanabe, a manager in a dull, repetitious council administrative role, discovers he is dying of stomach cancer and sets out to understand his place in life and what he should be doing during his remaining time. The film is broadly divided into 3 sections - 1) he spends time with a strange author who guides him through the nightclub world of women and alcohol, 2) he finds joy with a young girl who works in his office and who has a positive and fun outlook on life and 3) his colleagues sit down at his wake to discuss the last few months of his life and his determination to create a much needed children's playground.Interestingly it isn't until the 3rd act that the true power of the story and Kurosawa's great film making really hit you. The foundations for the story in the first 2 acts are strong and dramatically delivered - including an affecting scene where Mr Watanabe sings in a nightclub - as the central character slowly comes to realise and understand what he needs to do with his last 5 months of life and how this brings meaning to his existence. This final part, whilst spelling out blow by blow what he achieved and how he was felt of by colleagues and locals who lived near the playground, allows Kurosawa to let rip at decaying family values, bureaucracy, political corruption and ultimately the weakness of man.In truth it does take a while to really get to grips with all this and it's importance in what often seems a very personal polemic from the great director plus it is slow, sad and not a little sentimental throughout. It remains though a fine piece of cinema."
flamboyanza,"Mar 27, 2015",9/10,"By far, Ikiru has been a favourite among Kurosawa's movies for me. While Takashi Shimura is featured in most of his movies, Ikiru witnesses one of his best performances. Unlike Kurosawa's many other movies, this one lacks of violence and battle save for the protagonist's battle against a deadly stomach cancer, threatening to perish him and his monotonous life to oblivion.Bureaucracy, a choking network with unbiased existence in most countries in our world, can break the best of the stubborn. Wanatabe(our protagonist), a natural victim realises his folly after painfully boring 30 years of his life. This movie aimed neither for a happy ending nor for a revolution but just the daunting reality.And undoubtedly the soundtrack 'Gondola No Uta' deserves a special mention. It is a most wonderful music, apt for this movie."
bahae19,"Jun 11, 2025",6/10,"A deeply respected classic with a meaningful message about life and death-but it didn't fully connect with me.The pacing felt too slow, especially in the second half, and I found myself drifting away at times. Takashi Shimura's performance was strong, and the singing scene at the bar was emotional, but not enough to make this one of my favorites.I get the message. I respect the film. But I didn't love it.A movie for those who enjoy slow, meditative cinema-personally, it left me somewhere in the middle.It's one of those films that makes you think more than it makes you feel.Maybe if I watch it later in life, it will hit differently.For now, I admire it more than I enjoy it.And sometimes, that's okay."

He was a real father of the directors. He was a surprising influent man for the other directors. He was a PROFESSOR of movie. Kurosawa make a high jump for movie knowledge because of his appearance in this world. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF KUROSAWA DIDN'T BORNE IN THIS WORLD ? OUR MOVIE GENERATION WILL NOT DEVELOP AS GOOD AS NOW !!!what ? do you ask me what makes this movie great ? then you must be joking right ? can't you see it ? i even can't tell you what makes this movie great. because this movie is pure great at all. the word ""great"" was in every aspect of this movie. so you wouldn't find anything that not ""great"". even a word ""great"" cant carry this movie, it's beyond. so if you once again ask me what makes this movie great, i wouldn't have a face if i say this movie is ""great"" if you know what i mean.hey Kurosawa ! from now, i re-consider you to be one of the god of director. every time i watched the list of your movies, the more i appreciate you. i don't know why, i am speechless, it's just you're too genius as a human. you're the ""founder of the next level""so guys, iam sure most of you will not enjoy this movie. the only thing that can open your mind to consider this movie as ""great"" is to watch classic movies as much as you can. then you will find this movie is a god from the most movies that have ever created in this world."
Vlad-27,"May 20, 1999",10/10,"Even if you got decades, you cannot live a true life without cause and effort. However, only a few months is long enough for who is awake to the fact. That is strong and obvious theme of this forever masterpiece Ikiru, so I guess nobody wise enough to see the film will miss the message from Kurosawa. And warm, sincere view to Watanabe keeps the movie from being preachy. This is the most earnest love song to the human life and will.But never forget the challenge from Kurosawa to us. Near the ending of the movie, almost all bureaucrats who praised noble will of Watanabe at his funeral, turned back to lifeless, daily ostrichism. Only a young man found the hypocrisy and stood in anger, however, he could not be brave to point their hypocrisy, so sat again silently.You see? Getting the message is far from enough. Just act, or at least try to act, not to waste your precious life. Let's live truly."
Kirpianuscus,"Aug 25, 2024",N/A,"For a long time, after the end of film, the traits of Takashi Shimura remain in memory. Off course, the acting, the close ups, the last part of movie, the discover of a Japanese Ivan Ilich , like the genius of Akira Kurosawa are main causes.But the basic , essential motif is the story just next yourself. You recognize each nuance of bureaucracy and its cold cynismus. And you identify with Mr. Kanji Wataname , looking for reasonable answer about the answer to simillar situation. Not last, good kick to define the implication in the help of others. I saw it, grace, indeed, the circumstances of his death, as a profound religious film. And this makes it a very special experience."
Felix-Wackenhuth,"Aug 22, 2025",6/10,"I have seen many of Kurosawas works, but this unfortunately didn't catch my taste.Ikiru, the last months of a dying man is compared to Kurosawas other works incredibly slow. The movie isn't short so you think it would be packed with dialogue, characters and multiple storylines, but Ikiru is minimal in all those ways.We mostly follow our main character, he is dull and not very exciting. Maybe Kurosawa tried to picture a simple, regular working man, but was 2,2 hours really necessary then? When the protagonist finally decides to make a difference in life the movie cuts and the character fulfillment finally comes in the end when we get it told back at hes funeral. This looses some of the excitment and character fulfillment.The movie is incredibly true to earth but looses the sence of cinema in the process."
revenge_of_shinobi,"Dec 14, 2006",7/10,"the director lingers on the moment. sometimes its great because its a very interesting situation , but other times you might just not be interested .The story is a bit contrived but thats OK because its also very deep in places and the performances are generally top notch , apart from the protagonist himself , whose general patheticness got on my nerves after a while. the supporting cast however, the gentlemen he meets at the beginning was excellent and the girl is absolutely amazing , i wish I knew her so we could get married .the last third of the film is interesting as well but the ending is a bit too clichéd.but i have to admit , i rarely enjoy something this slow moving so I'm giving it a 7"
voodoo,"Mar 2, 1999",1/10,"I could not believe I spent over 2 hours watching this film.  Although the premise/storyline was good, execution was horridly lame, slow, tedious, and boring.Kanji, the ""hero"" of the story, whined way too much, mumbled too much, and failed to capture the emotions of the moment.Watching him speak or attempt to display emotion reminded me way too much of that sequel to ""Star Trek, the movie"" wherein we were tortured by having to witness this ever so slow ""fly-by"" of the new Enterprise.Ikiru would have been much better had the producers trimmed 45 minutes from the film."
bbartelt,"May 4, 1999",10/10,"This is a beautiful, touching film. Yes, it is slow--but it's supposed to be slow. It's very reminiscent of Japanese Noh theater. For people who have trouble appreciating the pace, this is how a professor once explained it to me: When you're watching a football game on TV, often they will do instant replays in slow motion so that you have time to examine the action. Think of the slow pace of Japanese theater (and film) in that way. Don't just sit there thinking it's slow and boring, try to take advantage of the time they give you to examine and reflect on the story."
rondjohn-23005,"Aug 6, 2016",10/10,"Ikiru, a film directed by Akira Kurosawa, is, in my opinion, one of the four or five best films ever made. The plot is so simple, it defies reason: Mr. Watanabe is dying of stomach cancer and only has a year to live.That's it. However his fellow workers from the city Waterworks Department including a newly employed young girl who'd become a fast friend with Mr. Watanabe during the last year of his life, each talk about him at his funeral - each telling a little of Mr. Watanabe's life, but none telling the entire story until we hear from the young girl. This part of the plot is like the nine blind men each telling a little bit about each part of an elephant - the tail, the trunk, the feet - they are all touching, but none telling the story of the elephant completely.However the theme - the story of his last year - the 'real' Mr. Watanabe comes to life as each individual describe the Mr. Watanabe they all know. The girl puts the last piece of the story together.Ikiru is quite slow moving and if you're use to car chase scenes and blood at guts, you will not find Ikiru exciting or interesting at all. But if you want to see life, Ikiru (To Live) and love, then you will be in tears at the end of this beautiful great film."
ctowyi,"Oct 22, 2015",10/10,"In a Post-War Tokyo, when the bureaucratic chief of department of the City Hall Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) finds that he has a terminal cancer, he decides to intensively live his last months of life. While dying, he finds the meaning of life, and fights for the construction of a playground in a poor zone of the city and the legacy of his existence.Ikiru means 'to live' and it is an undeniable masterpiece. With a story like that it would no doubt go the top-down preachy approach, but Kurosawa never treads the well-worn path and he has achieved something simply extraordinary here. There are a few scenes which are simply amazing and I will mention just one.Watanabe is still at a loss with what he wants to do with the rest of his days. While baring his soul to his spunky ex-co-worker, he found his direction in his infinitesimal life. It is not what he realized that is incredible, it is the setting of that scene. It is at a restaurant with a staircase leading up to the seated area. In the background we see a group of office-type excitedly anticipating something. In the foreground we see Watanabe and the woman. The two different parties in the foreground and background are in the perfect juxtaposition. When Watanabe finally knows what he wants needs to do he walks with twinkling steps down the long stairs with a smile plastered on his face, and the group of office workers started launching into a birthday song for a person walking up the stairs. If that's not one of the most sublime scenes in cinema I don't know what it is. You see, the happy birthday song is for Watanabe's rebirth. Kurosawa is saying that it is not the number of days in your life that is important but what you do with your lot, however short it is, that is most important. My tears rolled...Kurosawa is a master storyteller. It would be so easy to go the heart-rending route after that sublime scene but Kurosawa pulls everything including the throttle back to show Watanabe's funeral a few months later. It suddenly felt like a missed opportunity, a wasted move. It felt like a full-stop! But this final hour is a tour de force of sublime power as it becomes a critique of typical top-down human behavior and we also get an in-depth look into Watanabe's end days through the third person. Think a variation of Rashomon as we see flashbacks of Watanabe's efforts to do something not for himself but for a bunch poor folks. The narration by various people at the wake culminates to a haunting picture of Watanabe that I know I will never be able to forget forever, likewise with the life lesson learned.Watanabe has left an indelible mark in a bare landscape and left a legacy behind, but the thing you have to remember steadfastly is that is never his intention. His intention is simple - he wants to cut through all the bureaucracy to build a playground for the common folk. For some people that is ludicrous and small, but for me life is about committing your best effort to performing a task that you deem meaningful. Taking religion aside, life is ultimately meaningless when everything is said and done. What everyone thinks about Watanabe is utterly beside the point. The lesson learnt here is that one's life is about bringing your best to anything you know is the right thing to do, like for me at this point, it is penning down my thoughts and feelings in this small little review. Masterpiece!"
mikohime,"Sep 4, 2006",10/10,"One of Kurosawa's greatest films. Deeply moving exploration of the life of everyman who ever aspired to greatness and never achieved it. This film shows that great men often perform small acts that live on in the lives of those affected by their acts. It also illustrates the type of ""credit takers"" in elective office who try to claim the glory achieved by the small people who are their subordinates. The theme song is enough to make me cry, and I'm an old man. I first saw this when I lived in Japan over 35 years ago. I heartily recommend this film to everyone who has ever toiled in a cubicle or at any mundane job that gives no inner satisfaction. Violence and sex are not necessary in the telling of a story like this. This film MUST be available on DVD."
MattBrady099,"Oct 7, 2016",10/10,"""How tragic that man can never realize how beautiful life is until he is face to face with death.""So after I watched the masterpiece ""Seven Samurai"" back in April, I couldn't wait to watch another Kurosawa movie. ""Ikiru"" was one of his movies that I wanted to watch next after hearing so much recommendation for it from The Criterion Collection selection. And the fact that this has been on my watch-list for quite awhile. Actually, it's been on there for over three years now and I finally got myself to watching it.And what can I honestly say about this one.This movie broke me, but surprisingly in the best ways.Ikiru is a miserable and yet powerful film that has a hard hitting message. And to think that this movie was made in the 50's can have a deep impact on you and make you think twice about your life.I have this feeling inside of me that Kurosawa is slowly becoming my favorite director. The camera work, the transmissions and the finest of acting are only naming a few things that's great about this movie. Never as a film that captured depression and people who are diagnose with cancer so damn accurate. Or how relatable it is even today. He really dose live up to be the most influential directors of all time, as he's film making style is seriously impressive beyond any words. As for right now, I only seen two of his films and I'm already in love. Akira Kurosawa is cinema. No question about it.Takashi Shimura delivers such a raw and haunting performance that you just want to reach out and give the guy a hug. It's one of the finest piece of acting I've ever seen. I don't think any other performance broke me down like this guy did. I mean, a scene that involves a man simultaneously reminisces over a favorite song of his, whilst contemplating imminent death in a drunken state of melancholy. The sadness and regret was captured so perfectly just by his face and eyes that tells so much without him saying anything. Even as I'm writing this right now, I see have the image of Shimura sad face is implanted in my head. And to think that about two years later this guy will be in ""Seven Samurai"", which I didn't know while watching this. That's how good he is.This is one of the most honest look at life anyone has ever portrayed on the screen and it will be long before anyone can do the same. What makes this Akira Kurosawa greatest achievement is by displaying the most poignant images in cinema. Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) swinging slowly in the children's playground, singing to himself, ""Life is so Brief/short"" while snow softly falling. And here's something interesting I found out before I started writing this. Akira Kurosawa instruct Shimura to sing ""Song of the Gondola,"" as if you are a stranger in a world where nobody believes you exist.Kurosawa is just a genius and he never stops to make us be so awed at his work.Overall rating: Ikiru is a movie that I think everyone needs to see. To anyone who lived through cancer or got cancer, I know this movie will touch you very deeply. It's depressing and inspirational at the time."
CinemaClown,"Sep 19, 2017",N/A,"An introspective study of life, death, regret, redemption & human nature, Akira Kurosawa's powerful & thought-provoking tale is a strong reminder that passion & purpose are key to living a happy & content life, and that it is never too late to turn things around."
mervei,"Apr 5, 2006",7/10,"Ikiru is a film about life and death. It told through our hero Kanji Watanabe who is a symbol of people who work in a jaded office. I believe everyone who is not happy with his job will identify himself with Watanabe. Ikiru shows us no matter how boring our job or how meaningless and loveless our lives are, we should live a good life and make good changes in our lives long before we consider the day we die. I do not believe Watanabe is particularly boring or a ""mummy"" since his friends and his children do not seem to love him. That is why he is feeling outcast and he can not identify himself with his environment.Ikiru also tells us about the dis-functionality of bureaucracy. After Watanabe learns that he has six months, he not only tries to change his thirty-year life, but also the mechanism of the things at the office. This makes Watanabe a hero."
bandw,"Mar 4, 2007",10/10,"You should not watch this movie unless you are prepared to look at how you are living your life, particularly if you have, or have had, a routine job.The protagonist, Kanji Watanabe, is an aging civil servant, the Section Chief of Public Affairs, in a large Japanese city (presumably Tokyo). Early in the film Watanabe discovers that he is dying of stomach cancer and this forces him to take a sober look at his life, and he is not too happy with what he sees. He sees that he has effectively been dead for thirty years working in an organization where people fear to take vacations lest it be discovered that they would not be missed.The story is not played for sentiment. For example when Watanabi shares the secret of his disease with a young woman, Toyo, and admits to having lived a sterile, spartan life, he tries to excuse his behavior by saying that he has done it all for his son. But Toyo does not let him get away with that excuse, saying that his son never asked for such sacrifice. She notes that Watanabi made his choices regardless of whether he recognized them as choices or not. Watanabi is ultimately taken to the depths of existential despair which forces him to try to salvage some personal meaning in life before he dies. Salvation lies in the passionate and persistent pursuit of a personally meaningful endeavor, ironically at his job.While the main thrust of the movie is in detailing Watanabi's crisis, many other themes are dealt with.We get insights into the state of Japan in the early 1950s, just after the end of the Allied occupation of Japan following WWII. One thing we see is a government mired in bureaucracy. When a group of women come to the local authorities concerned about cleaning up a sewage pond in their neighborhood they are routed to some sixteen departments (including Watanabi's) getting a royal runaround - should be Pest Control, should be Parks, should be Child Welfare, etc. The women finally give up in frustration making the comment, ""This is not democracy."" The office buildings are run down and many still show scars from the war. Mambers of the Yakuza even make an appearance.Another thing we see is a generational gap. The older generation lives simply and is financially conservative. This distinction is made between Watanabi, who lives in sparse surroundings, versus his son and daughter-in-law who live in the same house but have more possessions and are much more concerned with material things. Also, Watanabi's first attempts to ""live"" after finding out his diagnosis are to frequent the pachinko parlors, jazz clubs, strip-tease bars, and crowded dance halls where young people are congregating. We see that Japan's move to Westernization is well under way. You can interpret Watanabi's death as a symbol of the end of the old Japan and his reluctant passing of his estate to his estranged son and daughter-in-law as the transition from an old self-disciplined Japan to a new more materially oriented, Westernized Japan.In addition to the generational gap, there is an unequal distribution of wealth. When Watanabi and Toyo are at a restaurant there is a birthday party going on in the background. The convivial carefree atmosphere of the birthday party is contrasted with Toyo's jealous gaze as she realizes that she will never be in that class. Initially Toyo works in the same department as Watanabi, but she is smart enough to see that it is a dead end - she is horrified when she realizes that Watanabi has been there for thirty years. But when she quits, the best job she can land is working in a factory that makes stuffed rabbits.""Ikiru"" reaches its true distinction in the extended scene at Watanabi's wake. Here Kurosawa touches on some of the same themes as in ""Rahomon,"" showing how we all filter experience through our own unique outlooks, frequently ignoring the facts. Watanabi's relatives have interpreted his unusual behavior, due to his illness, as resulting from his having an affair. People rewrite history to present themselves in the most favorable light. Instead of reacting to Watanabi's achievement by reflecting on their own impotence, some of his coworkers actually criticize him for having been so aggressive and not following the rules.All of this presented through masterful black and white cinematography. The civil servants sit around a desk and are dwarfed by huge stacks of paper. It is interesting that in a scene where Watanabi rides through the streets of Tokyo the neon lights of the city are reflected off the car windows in exactly the same way that the same scene is played with Bill Murray in ""Lost in Translation.""The Criterion Collection DVD is of good quality, even though there is some significant flicker in some scenes. The subtitles have been made current using phrases like, ""I can't wrap my head around it,"" ""bummer,"" ""you actually *get* it"". There is some explicit profanity that would not have been in the early versions. The commentary track is excellent.This film may have its strongest impact on older people who are forced to look back at their lives, but it should have a powerful effect on younger people as well. As one of the characters says, ""But any one of us could suddenly drop dead."""
emijawdo,"Jun 5, 2016",7/10,"""Ikiru"" or ""To Live""This is one of the Japanese dramas that helped define the genre and reinforced the Japanese cinema's focus on the human side of the plot with deep well-written characters one can't help but relate to.As the title might hint, Akira kurosawa tried to present his approach to life and how one should strive to live it. We follow the main character, Mr. Shimura as his life is completely subverted when he's diagnosed with terminal cancer.One of the most remarkable aspects of the protagonists performance (Kanji Watanabe) were his facial expressions. as the dialogue was kind of simplistic at times, the director relied on the actor's facial expressions to convey how he felt about the cornucopia of events taking place. Coupled with relatively interesting editing, these still expressions seemed to stick with the viewer for long after the scene is over. The sets were varied and enabled to characters to evolve by interacting with various elements of their environments. Personally, I found the music to be mostly gloomy which is in perfect accord with the movie's general mood.This is what usually call a ""thought-provoking"" movie, which might suitable for older audiences as they're more aware of the issues at hand and can, hence, appreciate the messages beyond.In a nutshell, This movie aims at changing the viewer's perspective and approach to life and the way it should be lived. And I think it succeeded to a certain extent, as it will certainly leave you pondering long after the ending credits roll up."
tuzlusekerlipoaca,"Jul 28, 2020",1/10,"The material in this movie is totally wasted. Of course, we have Akira Kurosawa and his great cinematography but watching the movie is totally painfull. Storyline has missing parts, it could give the messages in a better way. What I mean by that is the actors are so overacting that you find it silly. The main character starts to mumble after some time and you just cant focus and continue on watching the movie."
kittycat-18,"Nov 20, 2005",10/10,"Not having everything by Akira Kurosawa, I picked up a copy of Ikiru. Having been slightly let down by ""Sanjuro"", I wasn't sure what to expect. What I got was pure heart-wrenching power, the sort of stuff that one believes is possible by telling a good story, but rarely finds. I'm not going to repeat what others have said, as you can read many a fine summary of the movie, but here is what I will tell y'all...Ikiru gives us the finest of Akira Kurosawa the director and Takashi Shimura the lead actor. And unlike most Japanese films, this one is not about feudal Japan! Instead, one gets a peek at the Japan of 1952, one that remains more unknown to most folks, including myself. Just observing the surroundings is an adventure, a discovery of the hereto unknown.The story itself possesses more raw emotion than, well, forget the comparisons. I'd put it up with Schindler's List. I'd buy it. Wait, I did. Oh never mind."
barkingechoacrosswaves,"Jan 21, 2010",8/10,"This is a wonderfully idealistic, sentimental meditation on what it means ""to live"". Are you missing your own life, and will you one day discover that you've never really experienced it? Will your discovery come just in time, or too late? Watch this movie and take the opportunity to reflect on how you may be running through your brief years with little to show for them...Though at times rather heavy handed and didactic, the vitality and generosity of this movie are a wonderful antidote to our cynical age, and the performances are quite good. My only complaint is that the last third of the film is largely told in flashback, which leads to jerky, abrupt breaks in the movie's flow. Even so, this is an excellent movie in which Kurosawa wears his heart on his sleeve. Bring your Kleenex!"
glock38_110,"Sep 6, 2010",10/10,"A terminally ill civil worker lives out his last 6 months as a changed man, with a new found urge to live as he realises his life has been wasting away for the past 30 years. In other words, he was a mummy; a corpse. Sitting on the same desk everyday, looking busy but not accomplishing anything of substance. This film really touched a nerve with me although you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it. I could especially relate to Watanabe sacrificing his own life for his motherless son, something my dad had to do when my mother passed. One scene that especially moved me was when he requested a song at a bar, and to everyone's surprise he started singing it himself. Similarly, the scene near the end where he was on a swing, singing the same haunting song, was heart wrenching. For the last quarter of the film, after Watanabe has died, we witness his wake as various co-workers discuss his life and piece together what made him change so drastically. Through the scenes at the wake, Kurosawa manages to provide an excellent critique of bureaucracy in post-war Japan but we also get to see how others viewed Watanabe through their rose tinted glasses. A masterpiece, and quite possibly, Kurosawa's best film.9.5/10"
LinkinParkEnjoyer,"Mar 30, 2019",10/10,Akira Kurosawa does it again and I really didn't expect Ikiru to become one of my favorite films. Kurosawa nails the point of death and cancer to ordinary human being. This film shows everything wrong with institutions and how we treat each other. Kurosawa is the best director ever to walk this Earth. The lead actor played Watanabe so perfectly well that Oscar is nothing for him. The score from the start of the movie is so incredible and strong that I can't describe it. This is must watch for every movie lover out there. Total masterpiece.
filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin,"Aug 1, 2019",10/10,"The big concern of movie reviewers, which is to play spoilers, seems inevitable in Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, which begins with an x-ray of the story's protagonist's stomach and a warning that ""at this point, he still doesn't know he has cancer"".In fact, Mr. Watanabe, head of the public relations department at Tokyo City Hall, does not seem to realize what is going on around him. Obsessed with the task of applying his stamp to authenticate the documents that pass through his hands, what he actually does is do nothing, ignoring or solemnly giving runaround to taxpayers who come to the section to make complaints.Absent from his work for the first time in many years, Mr. Watanabe receives the news of his illness, and despairs, less for the doctor's evasive announcement, but for the exact description of his symptoms by an inopportune man in the waiting room who gives him less than three months to live (the doctor does not speak, but believes the man would live at least another six months).Returning home early after nearly being hit by a truck, the old boss kneels in the dark until he inadvertently overhears the talk of his son and daughter-in-law who unknowingly plan to use the father's inheritance and savings. The scene that closes the first half-hour of the movie is very sad and striking: the old man cries under the blanket for no one to hear while the camera shows on the wall a twenty-five-year award for excellent service.Alone, the bureaucrat decides to drink and, in a bar, meets a writer who decides to guide him through places where the man had never dared to live until that moment: pachinko parlors, the red light district, and dance halls. Watanabe asks a pianist to play ""Life is short, fall in love, dear maiden"" and sings the song himself, causing everyone, including the movie audience, to fall into utter bewilderment. Here, Takashi Shimura is unforgettable.Wanted by a coworker, who is resigning and needs his stamp to authenticate his resignation, Watanabe starts dating the girl for dinner and outings and has with her the great insight of her life: something meaningful can always be done. Returning to his work, the boss decides to fulfill an old claim of residents of a neighborhood: eliminate a pool of stagnant water, building a playground there.The last fifty minutes of the film take place at Watanabe's funeral, where successive flashbacks are told of their epic by the city departments to do what they are paid to do. Accomplished, the master solemnly sings ""Life is Short,"" sitting on a park swing under a blizzard, and dies softly."
ilovesaturdays,"Nov 8, 2017",10/10,"I was so moved while watching Ikiru that i felt i had to write a review for it. Watching this movie was a sublime & moving experience. It's really a pity that most cinema lovers today will never take the time to watch this masterpiece from one of the greatest directors ever. Honestly, I myself was very skeptical about this movie and felt that it would be very sad & sappy. For once i'm actually glad to have been proved wrong. While some would say that the movie should've had a faster pace, i feel that the slow pace compliments the storyline really well. Ikiru is one of those films that make us realize the value of the things that we take for granted. I'm so glad that such a beautiful film exists and i am grateful to all the reviewers whose glowing reviews convinced me to watch it! I heartily recommend this movie to everyone."
TxMike,"May 1, 2023",N/A,"This is a 1952 Japanese movie. Watanabe is a 30-year City Hall employee, he and the others in the office go through the motions, none of them seem to enjoy their jobs nor do they go out of their way to help the general public looking for help with something. There is a strong ""turf"" attitude, that is or isn't the job of their department. There seems to be a strong attitude of NOT accomplishing too much.(As I watched the movie and saw how it developed I wondered if this was written and made into a movie as a criticism of the lack of functionality of real Japanese City Hall departments?)So soon, Watanabe finally figures out his illness is more than an upset stomach, he has stomach cancer and has only maybe 6 months to live. His first reaction is to make up for lost time by seeking thrills and maybe some night life. But quickly finds out that doesn't do it for him.His ""ah-ha"" moment comes in talking to a young woman who gets joy out of making things, in this case toy rabbits, and imagining all the children that will be happy as a result. So Watanabe sets out to personally push through a badly needed park for local children to play.The overall theme is life is finite, don't spend all your time trying to avoid work, find something useful and give it your all. After he was gone it seemed the office was starting to adopt a ""What would Watanabe do?"" approach to handling requests.I watched it at home on DVD with English subtitles. Now I know why it has received such high regard over the years. Recently, about 70 years later, it was re-made as a British movie ""Living"" , also set in 1952, and starring Bill Nighy in the lead protagonist role, and the whole story arc is pretty much identical, most of the situations are identical, but with a British sensibility."
m_mehdi_m62,"Dec 3, 2017",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa within his masterpiece take the audience for a long and unexpected journey. Takashi Shimura is actor with many lots of talents, and he offers one of his best in this movie.This movie illustrates how knowing you are going to die is devastating, and at the same time could be enlightening. The protagonist find out he is going to be dead soon. He find life meaning less and consider all his life as a lost. Now he try to find a way to enjoy life and yet nothing can give him that peace of mind which he looking for despite the fact that he got a chance to give a life that he imagined is fun a try.Surprisingly the protagonist find what he was looking for where he were least expected, the place that he thought initially were the most boring place that he could imagined.The story looks like ended at the middle of the movie, Akira Kurosawa surprise the audience when he start the story all over again from other's perspectives. No one could comprehend what happened to the protagonist, and yet everyone tried to analyze, justify and understand the dramatic change which occurred to him.The director picture the Japaneses culture, generation gap and lots of other details within this movie. It take you the working environment, government bureaucracy, society adversity, family nostalgia, parent hood and so forth. This movie have a lot to offer and I am pretty impressed.The movie reach the audience heart and sole several time chief among them when the seen is ready and the song goes like this:Life is brief.Fall in love, maidens, before the crimson bloom fades from your lips before the tides of passion cool within you, for those of you who know no tomorrow.Life is brief.Fall in love, maidens before his hands take up his boat, before the flush of his cheeks fades, for those of you who will never return here.Life is brief.Fall in love, maidens, before the boat drifts away on the waves, before the hand resting on your shoulder becomes frail, for those who will never be seen here again.Life is brief.Fall in love, maidens, before the raven tresses begin to fade, before the flame in your hearts flicker and die, for those to whom today will never return."
Theodevereaux,"May 19, 2017",7/10,"The reviews for this film were fantastic so keep in mind I went in to this with expectations. This film I think had a very decent beginning, and even second act, but as soon as it felt it would go somewhere... it switched. I appreciate the way Kurosawa decided to structure the story like he did, but it did feel like it took me out of the film, and paid less attention to the man and more on the bureaucracy. Perhaps that was the intent, but I wish it had a more impactful ending, though the themes and development of certain characters were impactful, I can't help but feel it fell short of expectations."
paulclaassen,"Apr 7, 2024",4/10,"What would you do if you only have 6 months to live? 'Ikiru' explores this theory.Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is the Section Chief at Public Works who has never been absent from work in nearly 30 years. He does a monotonous job and has an equally monotonous life one can hardly call living. And then he discovers he has stomach cancer. He only has 6 months to live, but he doesn't know this.Kanji's wife passed away 20 years ago, and he reflects on his life with his son, Mitsuo. When Kanji overhears Mitsuo talking to his wife about his money, he decides to spend his money. First, a young man shows Kanji 'how to live' by taking him for a night on the town - from gambling to a strip club.Then, Kanji hangs out with a bubbly young girl from work, and his family believes her to be his mistress. All the while they are only concerned about his money. According to the film, we only realize how beautiful life is until we face death. I believe this to be a sad fact.There are valuable lessons here, but to sit through an overlong, slow and boring movie is not my idea of being entertained. For most parts, Kanji was sitting hunched in a chair, hardly saying anything at all, and looking miserable. As much as the film tried, there was very little character development concerning the protagonist - or any of the characters for that matter.The film blatantly attacks the Government and their procedures and could be seen as propaganda. The film's final 35 minutes (!) sees Kanji's colleagues sitting eating and drinking whilst talking about his life, and getting drunk. In their drunk state they vouch to change for the better, but - coming from a bunch of drunk men - this meant absolutely nothing to me. As we could clearly see thereafter, nothing changed anyway, so what was the point?This is yet another highly acclaimed, high rated movie I found boring. When it comes to entertainment value, I enjoy a movie that's fast-paced, or - if slow paced - to at least be interesting. I didn't find 'Ikiru' interesting enough to be entertained...and...just...way...too...slow... Yawn."
daryopeek,"Apr 28, 2019",10/10,"A great picture. Ikiru leaves me in silence when it ends, a genuinely moving film. The depiction about life and death, in any genre possible, has been done in so many ways, but who thought that a simple drama could change it all?What makes this picture perfect lies in the main character with his physical gesture and his voice, able to speak hope in his dying moments. Some of the subplots feel cruel (his son and daughter-in-law whose always talking about inheritance, the ignorance from co-workers), but to justify them at the wake scene, it's a feeling that I never encountered before when watching a film. It shows after all, that people are indeed have their lifetime, but at what cost we start to live it?The drama brought many issues that relevant to our problems in living. At what cost we start to dwell in a stagnant lifestyle? At what kind of situation we begin living in it? The question about life has been trying to answer in the movies to confirm that ""living life"" is a must. However, this film able to goes beyond a tale with a simple message to a heart moving act that I recommend to see it once. Who knows what Ikiru can affect you?"
kris-oak,"Oct 9, 2006",10/10,"Simply one of the best movies ever made.Every time I see this movie Im stunned by the fact of its sincerity:the sincerity of Kurosawas vision, and his courage to without compromises follow it through.Embedded in a story of an old man, civil servant, who one day gets the information from his doctor that he suffers from stomach cancer, are all the the big features of great storytelling: allergorism truth, symbolism-take any choice from the dictionary. And its all told by the great humanist Akira Kurosawa, in his downplayed, earthy and somewhat warm ironic way. If you ever wondered about what Kurosawa was all about, watch this one.It is a true catharsis.Watch it!!"

ElirGuigs,"Jun 9, 2015",10/10,"I don't mean to sound cold or insensitive when i say that Watanabe's death isn't the problem. He is going to die, it was told to the viewers back at the beginning through a remarkable use of narration (Pay attention, Hollywood). The sad part is that he didn't really live all the years his heart beat. I, also, don't think this movie is meant for everyone. It's pretty old (Almost 65 years) and has subtitles. The character isn't that connectible if you weren't in his position a long time ago and the plot develops pretty slowly. But, actually, none of these are flaws. They make the movie as good as it is. They make ""Ikiru"" the masterpiece it truly is. Back at the beginning, when we first meet Watanabe-san in his daily work routine, we may feel sorry for him (if you've been at his place) or even something that remembers pity. Because, and this is a sign of how brilliant Kurosawa was as a director, with a single take we can understand most of the character. Shimura acts brilliantly, as usual, as a every-day-man who has nothing really special. I don't think i've seen character development as amazing as this one in any other movie, not even a Kurosawa one. The way the character grows around it's own core and, in a amazingly shot and directed scene, has it's peak. He, after all, did live. And, of course, life is brief."

SAMTHEBESTEST,"Aug 9, 2020",8/10,"IKIRU (1952) :
Brief Review -A Japanese Classic blended by TWO Great stories on Life. In the first 30 minutes i thought Ikiru is about a changed perspective of one man on his life but then in the the second half it had another great story unfolded about other people's perception on that man life. That's Incredible! We have seen many films on similar storylines but always two different films made individually on any of either topic, not one film having two stories combined. That's a Great thing for any film released during 50s because even half of the film is an influence to make One Solid Film. Ikiru is about an old man Watanabe, who lived his life half-dead and without any meaning discovers that he has a stomach Cancer and got only 6 months left in hand. Here begins a journey of him to find the meaning of his life and do something that he hasn't done ever. It influences corrupt government officials but what difference does it make? Find out in the film. The story is inspiring and very innovative considering the human genre and may be that's why it is little slow. In the first and last 30 minutes the screenplay feels slow paced but otherwise the middle portion is entertaining. Dialogues are meaningful and i think should be treasured for Vocabulary. This dialogue by Novelist in the film hit me so hard, ""We only realize how beautiful life is when we face death. And even then, few of us realize it. The worst among us know nothing of life until they die"". Takashi Shimura in the lead role is so fantastic and amazing that I don't anything else to say. This is the 4th film of Akira Kurosawa in my watchlist and this is his 4th Classic as well which means i am gonna see more and more from his filmography. Kurosawa is A Legend and it feels like an understatement to me, he's something more. Overall, Ikiru is a Classic from Japan Cinema that will change your perspective about Life.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest"
Prismark10,"Oct 5, 2016",7/10,"Set in post war Japan, we see Tokyo's bureaucracy at play. A group of women have been on a runaround being sent from one department to another with no resolve.They are complaining about a cesspool where they live. No one wants to do anything about it. In fact these bureaucrats shuffle paper but do little of consequence.Watanabe is an elderly bureaucrat who has worked for 30 years without taking a day off. He has got a nice home and accumulated a good pension. His son and daughter in law lives with him. When he is diagnosed with stomach cancer, he realises that he has little time left. It dawns on him that he has accomplished little in his life.There have been lots of movies contemplating the meaning of life but not by 1952. Akira Kurosawa examines a life unfulfilled.If you are a viewer over the first blush of youth, you could understand what Watanabe is going through. You might have built a home, raised a family, loved a woman, have a pension to look forward to, but have you really made a difference?Watanabe delves into the Tokyo nightlife including a sequence where a woman dances the Jitterbug in a nightclub and he sings a sad old song.This is not enough for him. Eventually Watanabe meets a young woman who resigns from their workplace as the job is boring. He sees in her a zest for life which is infectious. He spends some time with her.The last third of the film is set after Watanabe's death as a wake his held. His son never found out that he was dying. His work colleagues finally guessed that he was dying.In his final months Watanabe wanted to zealously accomplish something. Turn that cesspit into a children's playground and he went from one department to another cajoling and not taking no for an answer.Watanabe withstood threats and faced humiliation but showed a steely, determined side of his character.Kurosawa has made an intimate film that is moving and life affirming. About making a difference. Kurosawa made this in between Rashomon and The Seven Samurai.There is an added resonance as Kurosawa tried to killed himself in 1971, despondent that his career might have come to an end.Ikiru was remade in 2022 as Living, where it was set in post war England."
giveantake,"Aug 22, 2007",1/10,"Over 3 hours of sheer boredom, with elderly Japanese guys mumbling every line that comes out of their mouth. It was hard to tell who the main character was at times. The cinematography was absolutely awful and the old Japanese men are simply not interesting to enough to make a 3 hour movie about. How am I supposed to connect with the characters when I can't even understand what they are saying? even with the subtitles on it was impossible most of the time. The story is about a guy who lives a boring life, well the director sure managed to project that onto the presentation of the film. Hands down one of the slowest moving films ever made, this crap was made in 1952. maybe people then found enjoyment in this tedious wreck."
Steffi_P,"Nov 22, 2007",10/10,"The majority of film directors seem to have more trouble getting to grip with directing emotion than they do with acting, and often ability to convey poignancy is a sign of a director's maturity. Kurosawa however fully developed the emotional content of his pictures with Ikiru before he became a fully fledged master of the action genre with 1954's Seven Samurai.Ikiru is one of many great films in which an at-first-glance dull, faceless character is humanised and made sympathetic. Similar examples include William Wyler's Dodsworth, in which Walter Huston's ageing factory owner is rejuvenated by romance, and of course Welles' Citizen Kane, which also resembles Ikiru due to its flashback structure. These films set themselves monumental tasks, but they end up all the more powerful for the depth they give to apparently shallow characters. Ikiru sets up this conundrum from the start, announcing the dowdy bureaucrat as ""our hero"" and informing the audience that ""whatever we say about him now would be dreary"" but that soon he will really begin to live.Kurosawa, who co-scripted all his films, created one of his most finely crafted stories with Ikiru. By showing us early on flashbacks of Watanabe's disintegrating relationship with his son Mitsuo, the audience is emotionally drawn into his life. What really works though is Kurosawa's ability to construct scenes and shots with such respect for both subject and audience. He is of course aided greatly here by what must surely be a career best performance from Takashi Shimura.Sometimes naïve viewers dismiss Kurosawa as a sappy sentimentalist, and even some of his fans dislike Ikiru for similar reasons. But these people are missing the significance, not to mention the skill involved in making a work of sentimentality. It's true that Kurosawa would overdo his humane touch years later with Red Beard, but Ikiru is note perfect, and the sentimental side of the plot is nicely ballanced out by the satirical comedy on bureaucracy.For the final word, as with so many Kurosawa films Ikiru ends with a simple yet brilliant image of optimism. We finish with two children playing on swings in the playground; they jump off when their mother calls them indoors, and Kurosawa holds for a few more seconds on the swings going back and forth  an apt and poignant metaphor for an individual's work living on after they have died."
nrolett2,"Mar 12, 2000",10/10,"Truly one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, Ikiru left me breathless and pondering the meaning of my own existence. The story cuts across all boundaries of race and culture to address the one reality that all human beings must face.  The cinematography is stunning, and the acting is brilliant.  There is a flashback scene in this movie that may be the greatest sequence ever filmed.  If you are an American who is ""foreign"" to foreign films, this one would be a perfect introduction to Japanese cinema and the genius of director Kurosawa."

GManfred,"May 10, 2011",N/A,"... and a masterpiece acting job for Takashi Shimura for his incredibly moving performance as Watanabe, a dying bureaucrat who realizes he has squandered his life in his unrewarding, dead end job. What to do, now that he is facing death? That question is the key to IKIRU, perhaps Kurosawa's best picture and one of the best I have ever seen.Action fans, there is no action, no fighting, no battle scenes. This is an intense character study which hinges on Shimura's bravura acting job, who was himself an action hero in other Kurosawa films. I thought his ability to plumb the depths of sorrow and despair was astonishing, and he was able to sustain the overall impact despite the fact that he was in virtually every scene.I don't think IKIRU could be made today, or if it were it would have a very limited audience. It moves slowly for its length and requires too much involvement with its characters for modern audiences with their abbreviated attention spans. Movies for grownups are such a chore in 2011."

Its compelling story matches the somewhat cynical reality that it addresses.Watanabe, the protagonist, is masterfully played by Takashi Shimura, who brings the pitiful clerk character to life with his heartfelt portrayal of a man facing the end of a life not truly lived.This is my favorite film of all time. I suggest everyone should watch it, if not for the fact that it is an amazing film, then for the self-examination that will undoubtedly follow."
lowellhill,"Apr 9, 2002",10/10,"Ikiru (To Live) gets my vote for movie of the century.  If you can tolerate an older, slow-paced B&W film with subtitles, give it a try.  It's set in urban Japan, around 1950, so it's less ""foreign"" than some other Japanese films made around that time.  I've seen it in several video rental stores over the years, both dubbed and subtitled.In order not to spoil the plot, let's just say that as a result of a series of events, a bureaucrat approaching retirement age realizes that his life to date hasn't amounted to much, and, given an opportunity to reflect, tries to do something about it.  Then, just as you find yourself thinking ""Gee, that sure was a short, sweet movie!"" there is the bonus of a long and fascinating denouement.  As movies go, it's a two-fer.Now I'm firmly in the camp of ""keep your expectations under control and you'll have a better chance of enjoying the film.""  But, much as I believe that another Kurosawa film, Rashomon, illustrates human truth (one truth per person), I think Ikiru illustrates, in a wonderful story with no preaching, the meaning of human life:  it's what we put into it."

DLochner,"Mar 11, 2024",7/10,"A film explores the search for meaning and fulfillment in life.What makes this film so remarkable is Kurosawa's masterful ability to sensitively portray his protagonist's inner turmoil and loneliness. A man who suddenly realizes that his life seems meaningless.Not only is it a simple film about mortality, but also a profound meditation on the nature of life itself. Kurosawa cleverly uses various narrative techniques, including flashbacks and unconventional narrative structure, to take viewers on an emotional journey. The moving score by Fumio Hayasaka reinforces the melancholic mood of the film and contributes to the overall effect.Overall, ""Ikiru"" is a masterpiece that captures the essence of life in all its complexity. It is a thought-provoking film that makes the viewer think about their own priorities and the meaning of their life."
jebous,"Feb 2, 2004",10/10,"The film's structure alone is masterful. The storytelling techniques used by Kurosawa are still unmatched. Also worth mentioning is the acting-Shimura Takashi proves himself as one of the greatest actors of all time with his portrayal of Watanabe Kanji. You may recognize him from his role as the wise leader Kambei in Shichinin no Samurai, but this is his greatest achievement. Several of Kurosawa's core group of actors are also in this movie, such as Fujiwara Kamatari. I would recommend this film not only for film buffs, but for anyone interested in powerful, intelligent cinema."

sc8031,"Jul 6, 2008",8/10,"This is a good film, though extremely slow. There are no real spoilers: the film is told in two parts and we understand that the protagonist is going to die within the first few minutes.Takeshi Shimura is pretty good as the reserved protagonist. Perhaps something of a character actor, his demeanor works well here. Kurosawa actually hired the same acting company for most of his well-known films from this period, so you'll see all the familiar faces from Seven Samurai, Rashomon, The Lower Depths, The Bad Sleep Well, etc.The film relies quite a bit upon the ability of the actors and actresses above all else. Much of the film takes place upon a couple of sets. The only problem here, as one reviewer pointed out, is that few people will be willing to sit through a long movie about an old man who gets stomach cancer. Especially when they already know the ending from the beginning!But still, this is classic polemic yet heart-warming Kurosawa. A little long-winded, but certainly relevant. Watch it if you got the time or are a bad guy with an icy heart."

In every corner of the earth, there is a terrible and precious thing, that is time.
Everyone has it, but everyone wastes it!
We put off doing what we want to do for survival, career, family. In the end, we ask ourselves what have we gained? Only to find that we had wasted our time with empty hands.
Do what you want to do and don't give yourself any excuses.

The film manages to capture human nature perfectly and some of the techniques to convey this were absoloutley brilliant. A truly remarkable film from arguably the greatest film director, Akira Kurosawa."
macey,"Feb 27, 2002",10/10,"The most painfully beautiful movie I've ever seen. It's a Japanese film made in 1952, yet I've never felt a movie speak to me more clearly than this did. It touches on a subject we all face - Death, and how to live life under it's shadow. And it deals with it in a beautiful and profound way. Takashi Shimura gives the performance of his career. And Kurosawa is more personal than he's ever been. The themes dealt with here have more recently been seen in the modern classic 'American Beauty' revealing just how timeless this story is. Give it time, it gets better every time I watch it. Kurosawa's most enduring work."
m-86637,"Jan 24, 2020",10/10,"Ikiru, or ""To Live"", is a 1952 Japanese movie made by the legendary director, Akira Kurosawa. Considered by many to be Kurosawa's magnum opus, this film dives deep into what it means to live a fruitful life and what one's purpose should be. Ikiru is another film that just further contributes to Akira Kurosawa's legacy as it is another masterpiece. Keeping up the consistency of excellent works, Ikiru is nothing less than magnificent as it creates such strong feelings of despair and an overarching idea on what it means to truly live.
Ikiru is based off the Leo Tolstoy book, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, which portrays a high-court judge who is struck with a terminal disease and knows he will die soon. Ikiru follows Mr. Watanabe, an eldery bureaucrat who has been diagnosed with stomach cancer and is only given 6 months left to live. Falling into despair over the fact that he knows when he will die, he reflects on his life and realizes he has never experienced life for what it would be. The journey of the movie is Mr. Watanabe trying to find a purpose in a life full of regret and despair before he meets his unfortunate end.
The beginning scene of this film is one of my favorites. It shows the roundabout way the government deals with problems as women who come in with a complaint are referred to branch after branch until they eventually give up their request and go home. They never show anyone in the government doing actual work for people but simply muddling around their workplace. A disdain for bureaucracy is one of the primary themes Kurosawa employs in this film as Mr. Watanabe cannot even seem to remember anything he has accomplished while working. After Mr. Watanabe finally finds out what it means ""to live"", every bureaucrat sees the opportunity to rise in social status and tries to take credit for what Mr. Watanabe had accomplished. This film's depiction of bureaucracy is nothing less than bleak, ineffective, greedy, apathetic, and almost criminal.
Mr. Watanabe journey to find meaning in his life starts in his own indulgences. After he finds no satisfaction in partying or alcohol, he begins to try and make friendships that he once saw as pointless. He feels nothing until he comes to the realization of his worth. Mr. Watanabe, and Kurowsawa, both exert that the best way ""to live"" is to help others who are in need of assistance and compassion. Mr. Watanabe finally begins to push for something in the government to help out the local people. He is met with heavy resistance and everyone seems to be in the way. Mr. Watanabe shows incredible determination and is what Kurosawa expects people to be, the ones who show compassion to others and try to provoke chance and growth in a community.
Takashi Shimura, well known for his portrayal of Kambei in Seven Samurai, is nothing less than impeccable in the emotions he is able to express and make the audience feel. The pure loneliness and despair is almost tangible. An incredible performance that is nothing less than making one come to tears at points in Mr. Watanabe's life.
The direction of Akira Kurosawa is breathtaking as usual. My favorite use of using all of the frame is a scene in a restaurant where Mr. Watanabe has his self-actualization of a goal. In the time that Mr. Watanabe is coming to the realization of his meaning in life, a birthday party is celebrated in the background. This symbolizes the rebirth of Mr. Watanabe and his renewed interest in staying alive. Just a beautiful use of symbolism and the superior direction of Kurosawa.
Some might find the first half of the film mundane or uninteresting. There is nothing but unadulterated loneliness and sets up a very desperate feeling for the movie. There is no overarching conflict or problem that must be solved but simply following a man in his day to day life. This is like the works of directors such as Sergio Leone or Quentin Tarantino as the film simply follows the characters in his day to day life without some broad goal.
An audience must be vigilant as this movie is in Japanese so be okay with reading subtitles (you are missing out on a lot if you do not). Ikiru's overarching message is applicable to anyone as it tries to answer what is truly the purpose of one's life. Come into the film with an open mind and find a clear masterpiece in cinematic history."
Snow Leopard,"Jan 2, 2003",N/A,"""Ikiru"" is interesting and effective, and quite a change of pace from Kurosawa's action movies.  (Of course, most of his samurai films were made later than this one, but it's almost impossible not to think of them whenever you watch one of his other movies.)  It's long, and sometimes quite slow, but there isn't a minute of it that doesn't have a purpose.Takashi Shimura is memorable as the seriously ill Watanabe.  His distinctive performance might take a short while to get used to, but he has many effective ways of getting across what is going on inside as Watanabe searches desperately for something worthwhile.  It nicely combines the natural need for a meaning in life with the common frustrations that we all have with bureaucracy (""in some districts, just to empty a trash bin requires enough forms to fill the bin"") and other tedious aspects of life. Kurosawa himself gives the story plenty of good touches, most of all in his interesting approach to the last half, with everyone debating what Watanabe has done.  It brings out a lot of interesting things in the characters that are worth thinking about.Just a thought: it's interesting to compare this with Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"".  They are very different, of course, both in approach and content.  But in both cases a great director gives us a thoughtful look at a leading character as he tries to figure out what his life has been about. In any case, ""Ikiru"" is an effective and memorable look at a life.  It also shows that Kurosawa's skills work just as well in something quite different from his more action-oriented movies."
Ric-7,"Mar 15, 2010",10/10,"I knew TCM was running 26 of Kurosawa's films this month. I hoped to be able to stay awake last Tuesday, long enough to again watch Throne of Blood. I had TCM on as I was preparing to go out for dinner. I noticed this film Ikiru had just started. I had never heard of it, and I was not planning to watch it as I didn't have the three hours to invest. Or so I thought.I sat and watched the entire film. Why had I not heard of this before? The film was so fascinating, in so many ways. The director takes his time, and I never felt that the film was proceeding too slowly, or that any scene could have been cut or shortened.This is obviously a stylized film: the mountains of papers in the office, the excessively entrenched bureaucracy--everything was magnified and exaggerated. An example: there is an early scene in which the women from the neighborhood were attempting to find someone to help them, and they were shuffled from one office to the next. Then there is the scene in the doctor's waiting room, when a fellow-patient gives Mr. Watanabe his own diagnosis, and Mr. Watanabe's reaction is extreme. Momentarily, I expected this to become a farce or a black comedy, due to the exaggeration. It was all part of the style, and after seeing the whole film, I was amazed at what Kurosawa had accomplished. He extracted a touching drama from exaggeration and set-ups more typical of satire.I never did get to see Throne of Blood again."
lastliberal,"Feb 1, 2009",9/10,"The opening of this film was just what everyone would think of bureaucracies that we deal with every day. The people wanted a park and they just got shuffled from one office to another. No one wanted to do anything that they could later be criticized for.Wantanabe (Takashi Shimura) was no different. He spent 30 years in government and rose to section chief without doing a thing. He just came to work every day and avoided ""rocking the boat."" His life was so boring that others called him ""The Mummy."" When he found out that he had stomach cancer and less than a year to live, he searched for something to give his life meaning. He went out with a writer (Yûnosuke Itô) to bars and strip clubs to find something, but it wasn't enough.He started hanging around with a young office worker (Miki Odagiri) who gave him pleasure (non sexual, you pervert) until she was tired of being with him. But, before she left him, she gave him an idea, and he started his life anew trying to build that park. Even as a Section Chief, taking on the bureaucracy was an uphill battle.We do not see the struggle until after he dies and all the other functionaries at his wake start telling his story as they try to figure out why he did what he did.Kurosawa and Shimura gave us a treasure about life and one that would do us well to watch over and over.Sacrificing yourself to serve the many. What a message!"
dee.reid,"Jul 28, 2014",10/10,"There is something to be said about the five-decade-long career of the late Japanese cinematic master craftsman Akira Kurosawa. I've only seen a few of his master-works, but every film I have seen of his is a brilliant, breathtaking exercise in cinematic master craftsmanship. Case in point: his 1952 dramatic masterpiece ""Ikiru"" (which when translated from Japanese, means ""to live"").The story itself (co-written by Kurosawa himself, Shinobu Hashimoto, and Hideo Oguni) is pretty simple and centers around Kanji Watanabe (Kurosawa's most prolific go-to man and my favorite international movie performer, the late Takashi Shimura), a faceless government bureaucrat who at the beginning of the story, learns he has been diagnosed with stomach cancer and has less than a year to live. He then sets about trying to make sense of his life and to give his existence some kind of meaning in his few remaining days.Throughout ""Ikiru,"" the one thing that I was continually amazed by was the sincere, heartfelt and ultimately, heartbreaking, performance of Takashi Shimura as this film's dying middle-aged protagonist - and the film's most significantly developed character - Kanji Watanabe. Also throughout the film, I was constantly reminded of Shimura's later performance two years down the road as the wise, headstrong, brave, battle-tested, and heroic samurai master Kambei Shimada in Kurosawa's epic masterpiece ""Seven Samurai"" (1954) - my all-time favorite Kurosawa picture and my all-time favorite foreign-language feature; Shimura's Kambei Shimada was my favorite warrior from ""Seven Samurai"" for his bravery and leadership skills.Here, Shimura's Kanji Watanabe is weak, frail, panic-stricken, and fearful of his impending demise. In a few other ways, I'm somehow reminded of Nicolas Cage's Oscar-winning turn in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995), where he played a failed screenwriter who was determined to drink himself to death and nothing, not even love, was going to stop him from accomplishing his goal. Kanji Watanabe is much the polar opposite of Cage's character, who doesn't just want to live a little bit longer, but just wants to give his few remaining months some sort of meaning and to affirm to himself (and us), that his existence meant something to the world.It's a bold and brilliant statement of what it means to live a life worth living; I've often pondered what it means to go through life and to work in meaningless professions rather than simply living the rich, fulfilling lives that we all really want to live, and not waiting until it's too late to realize it. This is much of what I gather from ""Ikiru,"" though like any great film (or any film, really), many statements and messages can be gathered from it. But this is what I got from ""Ikiru.""After all these years, ""Seven Samurai"" remains my favorite Akira Kurosawa picture, followed by ""Ran"" (1985), ""Rashomon,"" (1950), and now this film. I think Takashi Shimura really gave his all in this picture, a tragic, career-defining performance that is all too real and for some, could possibly hit a little too close to home (though I will always regard Kambei Shimada from ""Seven Samurai"" as the greatest character he's ever played). Why he was never nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, I will never know. But there's no question that after watching this movie, he deserved the greatest official recognition an actor can receive for their work on a motion picture...10/10"
KnightsofNi11,"Sep 21, 2010",8/10,"It's no surprise that this is another beautiful film from legendary Akira Kurosawa. Only this time we move away from the samurai genre and move into modern (1952) times. Ikiru is about a bureaucrat in the city office named Kanji Watanabe. He has worked in the same building, at the same desk, with the same papers for over 30 years. And then one day he finds out he has terminal stomach cancer, left with only six months to live. Upon learning this, Watanabe reflects on his life, coming to the realization that he has no close ties to friends or family. His life is empty. In the six months he has left, Watanabe attempts to fill his life with the things he never experienced in his dull life. From the get-go we expect a strong centralized character development story, and Kurosawa delivers just such a thing in his own beautiful aesthetic.This film covers a lot of ground, and many ideas are presented. It's the story of a dying man, as well as a heartfelt study of life and death, and even a commentary on bureaucracy. There's a lot going on but Kurosawa masterfully organizes it so that it works wonders on the mind and heart. In the beginning we establish just how overcomplicated and heavily structured the bureaucratic system is. It's organized, rigid, and very, very dull. The character of Watanabe acts the same way. He is an empty shell of a man. The film quickly takes a turn down a sloping emotional path when Watanabe learns of his inescapable death. From here this character makes a dramatic switch to actual life. The tag line of the film is ""Only when he learned he would die did he start to live."" This is such a telling sentence that beautifully sums up the bulk of the emotion in this film. Watanabe begins to explore life and what he can make of it before he dies. Kurosawa's fantastic ability for storytelling provides a great narrative style that stays lively and interesting. Watanabe goes through multiple phases of coping with his inevitable death, each phase revealing more and more about his complex and wonderfully crafted character.The narrative changes it's style in the last act of the film after Watanabe dies. The last hour or so of the film is set at his wake, and what happened in the last couple of months of Watanabe's life is told through flashbacks. This was a fantastic storytelling decision that keeps the already compelling narrative all the more alive, especially when the film runs at two and a half hours. Kurosawa even manages to bring his bureaucratic message back around in the end, when Watanabe must battle the own system he worked for diligently for 30 years, in order to achieve his last great service to the world before he dies. Everything comes full circle to close nicely. The film comes to a beautifully tear jerking end that I'm sure, even after only one viewing, will be unforgettable. Kurosawa treats this smaller scale story of a dying man with such care and respect. It is a fantastic example of his range and ability to have an emotional impact, even out of his usual setting of feudal Japan.I could continue to regurgitate the brilliance of Kurosawa but there's not much need to. This man, in his career, established himself as one of the greatest artistic minds of his time. He could tell a story and then visualize it in such an immaculate and grand way. Ikiru is no different. It's another fantastic Kurosawa film that entertains and stirs emotionally. The man was a genius, and every film of his reflects it."
rakeshroy31,"Dec 3, 2019",10/10,Different genre from the master ... but still the same magnificent outcome..:the last one hour is just amazing cinema. I consider myself fortunate to experience this masterpiece
Thanos_Alfie,"Mar 8, 2015",7/10,"""Ikiru"" is a drama movie in which we watch a man tries to find a meaning in his life after he discovers that he has terminal cancer on stomach. Also we watch him had some problems with his family and he as unable to talk to them. After his death and especially in his funeral we watch his co - workers discuss his behavior over the last several months and debate if he knew that he had cancer or not and if he had maybe that it was something that changed his perspective of many things.I liked this movie because of the plot which I found very innovative for those times and also very different from these that Akira Kurosawa used us to expect from him. The direction of this movie was made from the master Akira Kurosawa and it was simply breathtaking. I also liked the interpretation of Takashi Shimura who played as Kanji Watanabe and he was simply outstanding on it.Finally I believe that ""Ikiru"" is a must see movie because it shows and represents many things according to family and an illness and how this influence a person. Also it shows us how this influences not only the person that has this illness but also his family, friends and people in general."
ilprofessore-1,"Apr 16, 2009",9/10,"After ten pages, most of which laud the mastery and humanity of the director, page 11 seems to denigrate this masterpiece. Why? There have been few films that explain what is like to be old and alone as well as this film does. Only DeSica's ""Umberto D"" and Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"" even come near it psychologically. Kurosawa's hero is more than a passive observant, regretful of the life that has passed them by. Here the civil-servant is hell-bent on living the life that he might have had, had he the courage to live. Has there ever been anything in cinema as touching and pathetic as this old man's attraction to the simple, self-absorbed and not too bright office worker whom he befriends and entertains only to be rejected by her as a creep. Emil Jannings in ""Blue Angel"" gets caught in the net of self-hatred and self-abuse, but Kurosawa's hero learns from what's left of life, moves on and does something positive, only to die without due credit for his act. It is a supremely ironic story, devoid of sentimentality. Has there even been a Western director who has told the story of old age with such clear-eyed honesty???"
berestov,"Mar 25, 2024",7/10,"What the film is about: an old peasant finds out that he is going to die soon and after a short search for entertainment wants to do something that will leave a trace behind.And what can I say ...
in principle, the description is more than enough to watch such a movie. There is something in common with the film The Bucket List, but there's a comedy and, in fact, the whole movie is just about entertainment before death.And Kurosawa's main idea is that you can live your whole life without doing anything as the main character.But even at the last moment, if you want and strive, everything can work out!The film runs for almost 2.5 hours, And I don't know what to say about it ...
watch it because it's necessary, not to tell. Classic after all!"
gab-14712,"Jul 3, 2021",9/10,"Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru is an emotional, moving portrait of what it is like to live life. This film really makes you ponder about your life. It asks simple, but important questions such, ""What are you doing with your life?"" Honestly, this film made me contemplate my own life and made some important changes. You only live once, so let's live the best life you can. Based on reviews I have seen from all different ages, this film truly resonated with everyone. Even though Kurosawa constantly mentions death or cancer, this movie never truly felt depressing. I felt happy for the main character because he was finding the will to live despite the diagnosis of terminal cancer. The film is a robust two-and-a-half hours, but you never feel the time passing by thanks to Kurosawa's steady direction, strong visuals and camerawork, and a humane story that invests your mind. Also, Takashi Shimura's performance spoke to me on many levels.Believe it or not, this is the first time I was able to sit through a Kurosawa film. I immediately grasped the idea why he is one of the best directors of all time. He takes these moving images and uses them to create humane stories about life. Everyone knows about The Seven Samurai, which came out several years later, but everyone says this is his most intimate film. I can certainly imagine why. This film was released in Japan in 1952. The United States barely got a chance to see the film in 1956, and it finally was released internationally in 1960. The excuse was that ""it's too Japan."" I was very surprised by that statement because these themes are universal, and they still resonate to me.The literal translation of Ikiru is ""to live"". Our main character, after his cancer diagnosis, tries to find a reason through alcohol and women, but still does not get moved. It comes down to his job and doing the right thing for people which finally gives him that spark. Kurosawa made some bold statements about modern Japanese bureaucracy as seen in the opening scenes. Huge piles of paperwork, the dictation of a rubber stamp, sending people to pointless stations to ""solve"" mundane issues. Kanji Watanabe (the main character) is not living life. He is going through the notion's day after day. As the film itself says, he is already half-dead.Kanji Watanable (Takashi Shimura) is a Tokyo bureaucrat who has been in his position for over thirty years. He does nothing but work, sleep, and eat, hardly the definition of living. In a harsh scene, he is diagnosed with gastric cancer and is given a death sentence. He does not tell his family about his situation, but rather spends the night in town with a novelist. When that does not satisfy him, he strikes up a friendship with a young woman from his office. Ultimately, it is through his job that allows him to make a difference-building a public park. After his death and during the funeral, his peers and family try to solve the mystery of his death.Takashi Shimura gave a heartfelt performance that will always stick with me. I never knew about any of his roles, but that will change. He apparently worked with Kurosawa eleven times. When he sings ""Gondola no Uta"", I am moved to tears. He sang once at a bar which silenced the entire crowd and once later on in a very pivotal scene. His final scenes really struck me. He did everything well; reacting to his diagnosis, fighting his son over money, etc. Each scene is of importance and Shimura gave it all he got.Overall, Ikiru is a movie that any cinephile should seek out. It is a movie that makes you think about your own life. One day, you'll grow old and look back on your life and ask yourself, ""Did I live a good, meaningful life?"" This movie proved how graceful Kurosawa is as a director. He really knows how to create a story about life and not turn it into some soapy melodrama. Whether it's 1956 or 2021, these themes resonate with any society in my humble opinion. While this may not be a flashy movie like The Seven Samurai, this is still worth seeing especially if you are ready to have some feels.My Grade: A."
ozguredizavci,"Feb 20, 2022",8/10,"The subject is very cliche by today's standards, but I believe it was not very common in 50s, especially in Japan.The movie is very touching and moving, makes you appreciate your life. It reminded me of a quote from Mewtwo:
""I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.""Note: I think the last 30 minutes was unnecessary."
gbill-74877,"Jan 22, 2017",9/10,"What if in the dreary days of middle-age, as you were cruising along in the set routine of your life, you came to understand you had six months left to live? And further, that your son and his wife looked forward to their inheritance more than they cared for you, and that your co-workers mocked you for how little you accomplished in your meaningless, bureaucratic job? Such is the fate of Kanji Watanabe, played by Takashi Shimura, in an excellent movie by Akira Kurosawa. It may sound depressing and I suppose parts of it are, but Shimura's face evokes such a depth of emotions, Kurosawa's story-telling is so brilliant, and the movie is so profound, that you can't help being gripped by it. Ikiru – To Live – what does it mean to live, what is the meaning of life, when it's so brief? Can there be meaning?Watanabe at first 'lives it up', going out on a bender with a stranger he meets, playing pachinko, visiting dance halls, drinking, and going to a strip club. It's the reaction some have to the horrifying transience of life, and in some sense, the characters are right when they say that he has begun to live when he found out he was going to die. It's an immature, unsatisfying reaction, however. He attempts to get closer to a much younger woman from his office, played with childish spunk by Miki Odagiri, not in an attempt to seduce her, but because he admires her passion, and her decision at an early age to leave her boring job. She ever-so-subtly steers him onto the right path by saying he needs to find his own things to make, and he has the idea to use his remaining time fighting for the cause of park which has is stuck in a bureaucratic quagmire. Therein lies his redemption.The movie is distinctly Japanese, with customs like bowing and strict hierarchy on full display, but on the other hand, it has a universal feel to it. Faust and 'Ecce Homo' are referenced. The screenplay was influenced by Tolstoy's ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"". The nightclub scenes are highly Western, particularly the piano player. There is evidence of Kurosawa's artistry throughout the movie, with scenes in light and shadow that might remind you of paintings by Caravaggio. The film itself may also remind you of Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece, 'Wild Strawberries'. And of course, the theme itself connects us all at that most fundamental of levels.The story is often told in flashbacks, and revealed gradually. It's poignant seeing Watanabe's relationship with his son over the years. It's profound that he eventually realizes he needs to do good deeds with the time remaining, and that, despite obstacles in his path, he says ""I can't afford to hate people – I haven't got the time"". If only we could all come to this realization! He will see the beauty in a sunset, and perhaps in the most moving scene, swing on the playground in the park he built, singing 'Gondola no Uta', whose lyrics are ""life is brief; fall in love, maidens, before the crimson bloom fades from your lips."" While he had sung those words despondently before, he now sings them in quiet triumph, knowing he may be the only one who ever understands his life and his truths. Perhaps it's the best any of us can hope for."
gavin6942,"Jan 7, 2015",8/10,"A bureaucrat (Takashi Shimura) tries to find a meaning in his life after he discovers he has terminal cancer.The script was partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's 1886 novella ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"", although the plots are not similar beyond the common theme of a bureaucrat struggling with a terminal illness. Though it is an important message, that it is important to reflect. In some ways, this film is the precursor for Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"" (1957).Roger Ebert believed this was Kurosawa's greatest film. ""Over the years I have seen Ikiru every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think. And the older I get, the less Watanabe seems like a pathetic old man, and the more he seems like every one of us."" Indeed."
Estebanico,"Aug 11, 2000",N/A,This movie is so much deeper than any analysis of the plot could reveal. All I really have to say is that anyone who doesn't cry when Watanabe sits on the swing and sings his song must be completely heartless or jaded to the world.
SoumikBanerjee1996,"Jul 21, 2025",7/10,"I view Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" as a heartfelt tribute to the selfless individuals who dedicate everything for their families, sometimes at the expense of them being ungrateful and rude while also serving as a sharp critique of the unhealthy ""overwork"" culture that still exists in modern day Japan.I really appreciate how Kurosawa showcases the complexity of a hardworking man's sacrifices to his unfeeling workplace and colleagues, a man's discovery of life and its beauty at the brink of losing it, all done by paying attention to the smallest details and making meaning observations count at just the appropriate moments.Despite the weighty subject matter that might call for a more serious dramatic tone, Kurosawa skilfully weaves in social commentary along with some lightheartedness, which I believe makes the film more relatable and accessible to a wider set of audience. I do have one concern about the abrupt shift to non-linearity in the final act. While I understand Kurosawa's intention behind it; highlighting nothing but the fragility of human beings when confronted with experiences that challenge our practical beliefs, I can't help but wish he had maintained a linear progression.I think that approach could have given the ending a more lasting impact."
valleyjohn,"Dec 13, 2008",9/10,"In the last three months i have discovered the films of Japanese Director Akira Kurosawa. Thanks to some superb recommendations my movie watching experiences has been broadened and enlightened . Kurosawa's is a masterful story teller and although his films aren't perfect they leave an indelible mark on your brain that will forever be there. Ikiru is my favourite of his films that i have seen so far and i urge anyone who is thinking about discovering Akira Kurosawa's movies to make this one the first.Ikiru is the modern-day tale of a lonely man confronting death in post-war Tokyo.One of the greatest actors of Japanese cinema, Takashi Shimura, plays Kanji Watanabe, a middle-aged civil servant who has slavishly devoted himself to his job for thirty years, only to find that he now has inoperable stomach cancer. With limited time left, and the feeling that he has never truly lived at all, Watanabe embarks on a quest to make the most of his remaining days. After bouts of self-pity, a spell of hedonism and a doomed attempt at a platonic relationship, he commits himself doggedly to the task of converting a city dump into a children's playground.Takashi Shimura was an am amazing actor. His facial expression were masterful. He could light up the screen when he smiled and when he was sad the audience felt his misery. His portrayal of cancer stricken watanabe is amazing. When he says"" I can't afford to hate people. I don't have that kind of time."" you believe every word.Ikiru is a story that makes you wonder why we trudge along in our everyday lives and what would we do or say if we were told we only had months to live and why would we wait for news like that to start living our lives?Ikiru translation into English is ""To Live"" and you have not lived until you have seen this movie.9 out of 10"
charlesturner-75605,"Sep 18, 2022",7/10,"I found Ikiru to be a very sad film. The main character is very shy and always slow to speak. The movie makes you feel sorry for the main character and how he has to deal with his stomach cancer. But it also gives you this perspective on life. How you must enjoy the little things in life because you never know when you might be living in your final days. Ikiru is brilliant in showing that in the film. I love his outings with the younger female character and how it brightens his spirit. But overall a very sad film, and a depressing outlook on just how sad life can be. I would recommend watching Ikiru."
DanDV,"Jul 6, 2025",3/10,"This movie earned high acclaimed because apparently it was the first one to explore the topic of the protagonist discovering they have only a limited time to live.But that doesn't mean it's a GOOD movie on this topic, but modern standards. Nope, not at all. If that's what you seek, watch ""The Bucket List"" or ""The Fault in our Stars"".Ikiru is tedious, slow, boring, often pointless, other times absurd, and overall hard to relate to, even for someone in their 40s.The opening sequence is a somewhat amusing portrayal of public office bureaucracy, which earns it one extra star. But beyond that, not worth watching given other movies with the same theme."
Artimidor,"Sep 13, 2012",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" (""to live"") is a film - you might have guessed it - about life, or more precisely: about the absence of life. It's about that hole that suddenly emerges when our time inevitably draws to an end, that hole that we couldn't fill with meaning. For the old civil servant Kanji Watanabe (played by one of Kurosawa's favorites, Takashi Shimura) it's a pretty big hole. He moved papers around for years and years in his stuffy office, got awards for the monotony he got used to, never questioned what he did and why, was satisfied with what he was and never got the idea to change. But he is ultimately alone when he understands that he will die soon. And as moments of his past flash before his eyes, the value of life hits Watanabe, and he needs to make a decision what to do with the little time he still got left...""Ikiru"" shows us a struggle to escape the ways we are used to and to make the difference. Sounds familiar, right? But if it is kept real and is shot with less sentimental bombast than western productions unashamedly throw at us, then a downtrodden bureaucrat with a sudden fate inspired verve to make something happen turns into a hero. For Kurosawa this film was also a plead for individualism, especially when seen in the face of the Japanese society he lived in, where everybody played his role and life of the single man and woman became just inconveniences. Watanabe represents that flickering of hope, nothing more, but also nothing less, and his key moment occurs when he walks off with a plan, while teenagers celebrate one of their own with singing ""Happy Birthday"" in the background. But well, a single man won't change the world, and to fully appreciate life one needs to be almost dead. One can get a slight advantage by watching ""Ikiru"" though..."
elision10,"Jul 21, 2020",10/10,"I saw this film recently right after watching Seven Samurai. I'd seen both maybe 30, 40 years ago. And while Seven Samurai -- a far more popular film, if IMDB rating totals are a useful indicator -- now seems a touch predictable, even tedious, Ikiru was as compelling as before. (I don't dismiss my advancing age may be a factor.) The one element that didn't ring TOTALLY true was a Japanese bureaucracy dedicated to accomplishing nothing. After all, the movie was produced in the middle of postwar Japan achieving an historic national recovery in record time. But it could also be argued that -- as the movie shows -- this bureaucracy was responsive to corporate and powerful interests and not the public good. At any rate, scene after scene is a pleasure, and I found the ending well conceived and executed. Essential viewing."
gothic_a666,"Sep 23, 2010",10/10,"Movies can and do have an impact on viewers but very few manage to truly change lives. 'Ikiru' is one of those rare cases. Kurosawa, best known for his epic period pieces and innovative action scenes, tackles a delicate subject with unfailing clarity.Without ever falling into cheap sensibility the movie focuses on a man who realizes how empty his life is. His inner struggle to grapple the idea of his incoming death and the resolution to persist on making a difference are all handled with great psychological realism and weaved beautifully with a social environment of wanton excitement. 'Ikiru' combines a very personal character driven narrative with a background of indifference that adds a greater thrust of dynamism to the relation between individual and society.Memorable scenes remain grounded on daily events, they are bits of everyday things made interesting by the camera lending them its magic. In some aspects the montage is akin to that of drama and there is an aura of impending tragedy throughout it all. The resolution is the only one possible and very bitter sweet.This is the kind of movie that makes people stop, feel and think. A masterpiece that reveals itself as such in every frame its true power becomes all more daunting as one reflects about it afterward. Perhaps more than changing lives 'Ikiru' provides an emotionally charged space in which to ponder on how people, no matter how average, can make a change both in themselves and on others.Few times has a title been more true, 'Ikiru' is not about dying. It is about living."
Michael_Elliott,"Feb 28, 2008",N/A,"Ikiru (1952)**** (out of 4)A man (Takaski Shimura) without a life finds out he's going to die of stomach cancer, which causes a big shakeup in his lifeless world. He becomes friends with two people, one who helps him enjoy a little of life and the other someone who teaches him about leaving a legacy. So far this is my favorite Akira Kurosawa film, just ahead of Rashomon. This was an extremely powerful film about life and death that asks a lot of questions and for the most part it tried to give simple answers. There were countless powerful scenes with masterful direction and a brilliant performance by Shimura but the highlight would have to be the singing during the party scene. This was one of the most haunting, beautiful and magical scenes I've ever seen. Another great moment, showing the fear of death, takes place early on in the doctor's office as another character explains the pain that the man will eventually start to suffer. Another interesting and effective move comes in the change of storytelling with an hour left to go in the film. I wasn't quite sure if this move was going to work or not but the director pulled it off quite nicely."
sourav894,"Dec 27, 2011",10/10,"ust like, Bergman's Wild Strawberries, Kurosawa's Ikiru is a film about life. Constantly complex and thought-provoking, although simple at the same time; it tells a story about life's limits, how we perceive life and the fact that life is short and not to be wasted. Of all of films Kurosawa made, this is probably the one movie that works perfectly on an universal level, because at its core it is about one of the basic truths of life- death.In its starch and unforgiving black-and-white form the movie records the time of one man's life in such a beautiful and yes, colorful way, that by the time the final moments of the film play out, it will be very hard for anybody not to be touched. The film details the existential struggle of one ordinary man in his desperate search for purpose.Ikiru is a film that expresses itself in two separate parts. The first half is the exploration of a bitter man's death and the second half is an affirmation of life provided through the awareness of mortality, recalled by those whom he knew best."
petersjoelen,"Feb 3, 2024",7/10,"An apathetic civil servant who doesn't really do anything with his job except count the days for someone who gets stuck in an issue that in other circumstances would have been snowed under in the bureaucratic mill.Actually, the film is more about the bureaucratic system than about a man who only has a few months left to live.The film is very long, but that wasn't a big problem, in my opinion the story still flowed fairly smoothly.I don't think the super high score is really justified, a seven is more than sufficient.Final conclusion: a reasonably good film, the strong point is actually the demonstration of the bureaucracy mill but also the disturbed relationship between father and son who are estranged from each other."
jose-cruz53,"Dec 19, 2012",10/10,"It is not only among Kurosawa's best but among the best ever made, indeed, in my top 25 film list. Kurosawa shoes not only that he knows how to do samurai films but also ordinary dramas set in the present day. Beating Ozu on his own game in the process. This masterpiece fully deserves a perfect score: 10/10.Some have called this film manipulative. Well, that's a bit unfair since every film that is not something made by Tarkovsky and Bergman's two most artsy titles, Persona and Seventh Seal, is indeed manipulative: take Grave of the Fireflies, for instance, that's a manipulative film all right, and it is also one of the greatest tear jerkers, like this one as well."
JiaQiLi,"Nov 17, 2006",10/10,"This film takes a different path from other classic Kurosawa's films. It sets in modern daily life instead of ancient Japan. But it deeply touches my heart, prompting me to reflect on my lifestyle.I have recently written an article about ""Ikiru"" for a church's magazine. The first half is truly amazing. I was initially bored by the second half. But after some deep reflections, the second half actually vaults ""Ikiru"" into the ranks of classics. It does not only criticize bureaucracy, but it tells us that a meaningful life is not based on other people's praises and recognitions. Only one worker among Watanabe's colleagues appreciate his work and spirit. Regardless, Watanabe experiences fulfillment and joy even without any appreciations.We often wish to be glorified when we accomplish great tasks. But ""Ikiru"" teaches the opposite. We really live when we enrich life albeit one individual or a small community. Kurosawa calls us to serve people selflessly without seeking personal glory in the second half. Meanwhile, bureaucracy will continue to swarm and swallow people.I do not think that ""Ikiru"" is about life and death. Rather, ""Ikiru"" discusses how we live meaningful lives every day. Watanabe's terminal cancer motivates him to search a meaning for his life. I hope that ""Ikiru"", instead of death, prompts us to discover our lives' goals.""Ikiru"" deserves to be one of Kurosawa's classic or even a classic or all time. When I reflect on the movie, my tears of admiration drop every time. I purchased the Criterion Edition shortly after I had viewed it in rental. It has become one of my favourite films in my collection."
gurpreetsingh-23756,"Feb 10, 2021",10/10,"I never did buy Akira Kurosawa's hype. I always thought Masaki Kobayashi was a better director . However, this movie established kurusawa as master storyteller.

emretaptik,"May 1, 2024",10/10,"Ikiru"" is a masterpiece that transcends time and cultural barriers, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of viewers worldwide. Directed by the legendary Akira Kurosawa and released in 1952, this Japanese classic is a poignant exploration of the human condition, mortality, and the pursuit of meaning in life.At its core, ""Ikiru"" tells the story of Kanji Watanabe, a middle-aged bureaucrat who discovers he has terminal cancer. Confronted with the brevity of his existence, Watanabe embarks on a soul-searching journey to find purpose and fulfillment before his inevitable demise. Through Watanabe's introspective quest, Kurosawa delves into profound themes of existentialism, societal disillusionment, and the inherent value of human connection.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its character development, particularly that of Watanabe, portrayed with remarkable depth and nuance by Takashi Shimura. As Watanabe grapples with his mortality, Shimura's performance captures the character's quiet desperation, inner turmoil, and eventual resolve with astonishing authenticity. His portrayal is both heartbreaking and inspiring, inviting viewers to reflect on their own lives and the legacy they wish to leave behind."

michaelddubb,"Mar 16, 2025",7/10,"I have been delving into the works of A. K. For the last few years and spent the afternoon with this one. A absolute pleasure to behold the camera work and cinematography. The story was heartfelt and impactful. Especially for the time period of its release.Large portions of the film I was witnessing inspired choices that have definitely made impact and influence on our greatest filmmakers today.The acting by the lead character was subdued but tugged at your heartstrings in a real way.The only flaw I felt the movie had was a very serious tendency to over-explain the plot or fill in portions of the story with unnecessary exposition.The third act is by far the most INTERESTING and MOVING. But it was rife with over-talking and ""telling not showing"" instead of its much more pleasant opposite.Either way a film worth the watch despite its lingering run time."

Jonny_B_Lately,"Apr 2, 2012",9/10,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. FAIR WARNING!First, I want to get the negative out of the way and in so doing, point out that this film was finished and released in 1952. Perhaps melodrama of this type was the norm, but I came away feeling that this man's immanent death and his reaction to that inevitability was a bit overplayed. There, that is out of the way.I love the way Akira Kurosawa put this together. The film opens on the dull and crushingly boring life of Kanji Watanabe. He is a bureaucrat in the office of public affairs. For thirty years his primary responsibility has been to shift what ever comes to his office to some other department. In short he does nothing. He is a ""rubber-stamp"" official.Early in the film Watanabe realizes he has terminal cancer. Worse he is not told the truth by his doctor, but finds out from another patient. It is clear he is going to die; and he realizes that he has lived too regimented a life. He has done nothing useful and this, not his impending death, is what really bothers him. The fact that he has managed, for three decades, to waste not only his own time, but the time of others.Fortune is kind to him though. In his despair, he first encounters a novelist who has a penchant for words. This writer, played by Yûnosuke Itô, perfectly expresses what Kanji is going through and applauds his every effort to rectify his wasted life, but it not enough for Kanji.The next day he runs into the youngest coworker in his office. He soon realizes that she has a childlike joy of life and he begins to experience envy and a longing to see life as she does. He eventually frightens her by wanting to spend so much time with her. This is perhaps the best casting done for the entire film, Miki Odagiri as Toyo, delivers such boundless joy and enthusiasm you forget that she's acting.Eventually Kanji finds a purpose for his life and the first three fourths of the film closes on his death. You don't know what he actually accomplished, but you do know by this point that he found a purpose; perhaps now he can die in peace.The last quarter of the film is Kanji's wake and the revelation that he almost single-handedly got this special project completed. His co-workers refuse to believe it at first, but as the wake wears on and the participants become more inebriated, revelations come about that prove that the lowly Watanabi did indeed accomplish his task.It is interestingly done. This could be a very dull story about a small and almost insignificant man and his life. But Kurosawa completely immerses us in Kanji's pain, dismay, and confusion. We become Watanabe. We cannot help but feel very deeply for this character.Just when you would expect the story to tell of Kanji's triumph Kurasawa kills the character and tells the remainder of his story through a series of flash-backs revealing the truth of Kanji's deeds at his funeral. It is almost astounding how many flash-backs there are yet Kurosawa manages to keep the story cohesive and easy to follow.It is a masterwork of story telling, though it seems overly melodramatic by today's standards of cinema."
I_Ailurophile,"Sep 15, 2024",10/10,"Most any film with a mind for earnest storytelling can be meaningful and impactful, but even at that not every film digs deep into hearty ruminations on life and modern society. Few are those that speak so directly to such themes as this does. As protagonist Watanabe Kanji learns of his terminal illness and poor prognosis, what ensues is a tableau of many years of life wasted: many years emptily filling a seat in an office, in the process letting all possibility of family life slip away, and having spent so little time living that he doesn't know how to spend money; and a hopeless mire of a bureaucracy, failing to serve the public as intended and becoming wrapped up in its own rules and procedures. At the same time, however it's a tableau of self-realization, and self-discovery: exploring the life that one has missed out on, learning what parts of one's life no longer serve us, making the human connections (general or specific) that one has lacked, finding renewed purpose, and leaving some part of ourselves in the world. And still, for as much as 'Ikiru' leans heavily on these notions, all are woven very naturally into the proceedings with a clear, distinct narrative structure in which they are allowed to reverberate. Through moods dour, sorrowful, lively, heartfelt, and bittersweet, the scene writing is unfailingly vibrant and powerful, with strong characterizations and purposeful dialogue, to impart a firmly compelling, engrossing story. All this comes to bear both where Watanabe is pointedly centered, and where he is simply a part of discussion among other characters. And for as wonderfully smart as the screenplay is, penned by master filmmaker Kurosawa Akira with his regular collaborators Hashimoto Shinobu and Oguni Hideo, the result is unquestionably one of the greatest movies ever made.And it's not just about the writing in and of itself. The tale gives us scenes immediately centering Watanabe, and scenes that do not; flashbacks, and prevalent dialogue; and scenes that directly or indirectly speak to the major themes on hand. Through tones soft and more robust, through both the shortsightedness and near-epiphanies of the bureaucrats, and from seeing Watanabe at his most timid and soft-spoken to his most insistent and determined, the plot progresses in a non-linear manner that is nevertheless bright and flawless. This is in part thanks to the screenplay, yes, but Kurosawa's direction is also impeccable, some of the best he ever achieved, indisputably demonstrating that he was one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live. Countless little moments all throughout are downright brilliant and inspired, a surefire product of Kurosawa's vision; in its blend of more zestful sequences with more sullen ones, and in the flourishes with which some shots and scenes were orchestrated, I am reminded at times of F. W. Murnau's 'Sunrise' of 1927, an artistic masterstroke that itself remains, to this day, one of the best works in all of cinema. Nakai Asakazu's shrewd, dynamic, flavorful cinematography also feeds into this ingenuity, definitely, just as Iwashita Koichi's keen editing helps to deftly shape the picture into the precise, unforgettable form we see. And still, 'Ikiru' wouldn't stand as tall as it does if not for the tremendous acting. All involved are superb, by all means, each finding their time to shine - and mostly within the contemplative last hour. Be that as it may, star Shimura Takashi, an icon of Kurosawa's stable of actors and of Japanese cinema at large, carries the lion's share of the title all by himself. Gentle and haunted as he mostly presents as Watanabe, there is incredible range, nuance, emotional depth, and understated vitality in his performance that is the linchpin of these 143 minutes. I, for one, don't think there can be much arguing that it's one of the single finest performances we've ever seen in the medium.All this is to say nothing of the excellent production design, art direction, costume design, and hair and makeup. Hayasaka Fumio's music is a sparing but welcome complement, helplessly outshone by far by Shimura's timeless performance of ""Gondola no uta."" From beginning to end and from top to bottom, from those tidbits that we may forget over time to the image that is one of the most recognizable in all of culture, this is a perfect film. That's all there is to it. Some viewers may prefer more outwardly exciting genre fare, but rare are the examples thereof that bear the potency or the staying power that 'Ikiru' does. No matter who you are, everyone needs to see this at least once, and ideally more than once. For my part I've just rewatched for the first time in too many years, and I can truly say that it's even better than I remembered. Scant few are those flicks that demand viewership more than this does, to the point that it almost seems insufficient to say that I give it my recommendation, no matter how high. All I can say is that everyone must make the time for 'Ikiru' at some point in their lives, and time with a movie has scarcely ever been more well spent."
tjsdshpnd,"Jan 14, 2014",9/10,"All the Kurosawa movies I have seen yet were either samurai based or mythological. Ikiru is way way way different than all those movies. To begin with, this is the most philosophical Kurosawa movie I have seen explaining life and death.The movie is about an aged bureaucrat who has not taken official leave for 30 years, lives his life almost like a robot or a mummy - lifeless. His life takes a massive turn when he comes to know that he has about 6 months to live because of a terminal stomach cancer. The things he does in the remaining part of his short life constitutes the movie. The movie is not only about living your life, it also states that one does not need to party 24/7 or go travel the world for the remaining life-span to enjoy it, if one does the work given to him in the most honest way and enjoys it, it leads to a fulfilled life. The movie also talks about the petty politics that takes place in the low-level bureaucracy in any government system.Takashi Shimura has been in all the Kurosawa movies I have seen. The difference though was those movies also featured Toshiro Mifune who always hijacked the movie and fairly so. This movie was meant for an aging actor who you would not even consider if he stands next to you. Takashi Shimura fits the bill perfectly. He has done a splendid job. Sometimes though, I wanted to shout and say, 'Why are you silent, slap your son and tell him your illness'. His portrayal of helplessness forces one to do so. Bollywood classic movie Anand can be said to have inspired from Ikiru. Enough Said.Rating : 8/10"
fatcat-73450,"May 28, 2023",8/10,"Throughout the movie a running motif is that the main protagonist, Watanabe, is like a mummy - that is, the living dead. And he does act extremely decrepit. From what I can tell, he looks to be in his 70s or late 60s, but he plays it like a 90-year-old. Some could say it symbolises how such an ennervated creature can still make a difference. I appreciate the sentiment, but I found it distracting symbolism cramming if that's the case.As for the rest of the movie, it's about a dying man's quest... I don't know what his actual initial objective is, but the byproduct perhaps overshadows whatever he was first trying to accomplish. That is, he discovers the meaning of life. What is the meaning of life, then? You guessed it - cliche as it is - service to other humans, particularly the downtrodden.The journey is relevant. First he tries to burn himself out on temporal pleasures and excitements, but he seems to only feel nostalgic and empty. Then he has a day in the sun with a sprightly young girl. He seems genuinely happy, but I suppose he has to move on, given the age differences and difficulty in maintaining the affections of such a person for such a man. Through this experience he settles into trying to move things through sluggish Japanese governmental bucreacracy to bring the common people some joy. The effect of this is dampened a bit at it's mostly told in narrative by other characters.Thought-provoking? Sure. But I don't buy the message the film is trying to sell and I don't think even the movie itself buys it. It seems to me he was happiest with the girl. Rather than service to unknown masses, then, happiness is to be found in forming strong, joyful bonds with joyous people and trying to make out something of this life together. Unfortunately for Watanabe, his time had passed. Which then takes us to carpe diem?In other words, an interesting and philosophical work, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece.Honourable Mentions: Jacob's Ladder (1990). Or is there no meaning? Just let things go because that's what you'll have to do eventually anyway."
Falkner1976,"May 3, 2023",8/10,"One of Kurosawa's greatest films, although for several reasons one of the least attractive among his great works for today's audiences.A bureaucrat who has been warming the chair for 30 years and letting the days go by, discovers that he has only a few months to live.As so often in Kurosawa, the structure is very original and surprising, and serves to bring us closer to the story in different and unexpected ways. In addition, Kurosawa is shown as an heir to the best visual cinema of the silent period.The aesthetic is very close, especially in the first half, to the choreographed German expressionism of a Murnau (The last laugh, Sunrise), to the impressive use of depth of field and lighting of Stroheim (Greed), and to the baroque style of the first Welles, or Sternberg (although without his sensuality). The second part is more objective, with an Ozu-esque ceremonial shot brilliantly punctuated with flashbacks. There are plenty of cinematically amazing moments and details of true genius.But there are certainly two aspects, related to each other, that make the film less attractive for today's viewers than other more dynamic and modern works by the author: its expressionism, brilliant as it is, makes it proudly outdated (I'm not saying that as a defect), even for 1952, with its internal rhythm of incisive slowness and its remarkable gestures, ; and the (otherwise inmense and very emotional) performance of Takashi Shimura, which is over the top even in comparison to Jannings in The last laugh. Kurosawa has always liked picturesque and exaggerated theatrical performances, especially in secondary characters (here, the co-workers, for example), but Takashi Shimura is even more overacting than usual, in this case integrating himself into a visual style and a narrative clearly intended.Unforgettable scenes abound: the Faustian night of carousing through various dens culminating in a drunken Takashi Shimura gloomily singing an old carpe diem song; the pivotal moment of the birthday celebration, and the emotional farewell of the protagonist swinging under the snow in the park to whose construction he dedicated all the efforts of the last months of his life.An emotional, great and beautiful film, first class cinema, but one that admires us more than entertains us, that at times seems unnecessarily slow and repetitive, but not to be missed."
kevin_robbins,"Nov 7, 2023",10/10,"I recently revisited the Kurosawa classic Ikiru (1952) on MAX. The storyline follows an aging everyday businessman who receives the unfortunate news that he has terminal cancer. He decides to spend the remainder of his life bringing happiness to others.As previously mentioned, this film is directed by the iconic Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai) and stars Takashi Shimura (Seven Samurai), Nobuo Kaneko (Goke, Body Snatcher from Hell), Shin'ichi Himori (The Only Son) and Haruo Tanaka (Samurai III).Ikiru is a brilliant film in every aspect. It's a heartwarming tale with a main character who's easy to root for. Despite a storyline that has the potential for so much sadness, this movie makes you feel triumphant. The dialogue is fantastic and immerses you in every scene. Takashi Shimura delivers an outstanding performance, with legendary mannerisms and facial expressions. The supporting cast is equally brilliant, creating an authentic atmosphere. The camera angles and lighting are masterfully done, adding to the perfection of the film.In conclusion, Ikiru stands as one of the greatest movies ever made. I would give it a perfect 10/10 and wholeheartedly recommend it."
jbirks106,"Sep 10, 2014",9/10,"Based loosely on Tolstoy's ""Death of Ivan Ilych"", this is a tale of the tragedy and redemption of a man whom few directors would dare featuring: a faceless, lifeless bureaucrat. Takashi Shimura plays said bureaucrat with stolid grace, never overplaying the physical and psychic pain that defines him for the first third of the film. He is estranged from his family, his employers, his life, until an improbable encounter with a lively, lovely former coworker and a pet rabbit. At last he sees how his life, so close to its end, can mean something.I highly recommend the 2-disc Criterion set, which includes two documentaries on Kurosawa's life and work, and a commentary track by Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince, who's done similar work for Criterion's releases of ""Throne of Blood"", ""Seven Samarai"", ""Ran"" and several others. My lone complaint is with the transfer; typically a strength of Criterion's classic discs. While most scenes are clear, bright and unblemished, others have long stretches of vertical scratches and faded black tones. Knowing the attention to detail that other, even older, films have enjoyed, it's a bit jarring to see."
quarterplate,"Jan 10, 2024",8/10,"There are the main themes here that resonate all through--trying to live a life with meaning, and then trying to rectify your life when you realize you've failed. It's a movie about redemption, but the focus is on the struggle to find that redemption, not the feel-good aftermath.It has to be noted that the filming--the cinematography--is astonishing. Sometimes this is what carries the film, as in the moments in the middle where the main character and his new friend and doing the night life in Tokyo.The main character, Kanji Watanabe, may sometimes play the worn out old man too excessively, grunting his way through important moments, but in the big picture that's what this is trying to figure out--how someone at that lowest of lows can find a way forward in his remaining days. Of course, the layers of administration in the municipal government are a key character of their own, playing against the needs of many of the characters and defining those needs for others.The final scenes, extended beautifully, that show a funeral and the men (mostly) interacting is quite humbling. The writing does get contrived here--we know what's happening before it happens--but the overall point is great and has a lot of details between the larger arc.Yes, a kind of great film. And yes, I suppose it works better for people who are older, but who knows?"
krational66,"Apr 27, 2020",8/10,"He died in the middle of the movie, and he was born again in the middle of the movie, happy birthday to you! He had been dead for 30 years when the film began, and by the end he was immortal with every swing. Classic form structure: the first half of the mummy alone to find the meaning of life, the second half of sublimation after quietly overlooking the death of all living beings (and thus the meaning of life and death from the individual to the whole society), as if the order of death and life reversed, and the theme. Make the sharpest realistic criticism with gentle posture, make the person present speechless. Great movie."
theognis2,"Jun 15, 2023",8/10,"The superb black and white cinematography of Asakazu Nakai perfectly complemented the magnificent and astonishingly brilliant visual imagination of Akira Kurosawa in this story of a middle aged bureaucrat, facing death from cancer. Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is the very picture of grief as he tries to cope with the end. It had to move audiences, six years after the end of World War II and two atom bombs. It also followed by two years a very similar story, ""Last Holiday,"" (1950), from a masterful script by J. B. Priestley and starring Alec Guinness in a beautifully textured performance. That version of an insignificant clerk, George Bird, who is told he has a short time left and resolves to make the most of it, has, as one might expect, the stiff upper lip of the Englishman, not unlike Col. Nicholson in ""The Bridge On the River Kwai"" (1957). But, in Kurosawa's picture, nothing, not even the introduction of new American diversions, such as jazz and a striptease by beautiful Rasa Saya or some giggling prostitutes can shake the overarching gloom of the condemned man, until he becomes fascinated by a cheerful, chipper young woman (Miki Odagiri). The pictorial compositions and brilliant staging by Kurosawa are the main stars of this film."
mrluxinatux,"May 16, 2025",10/10,"I find ""Ikiru"" to be a rare film. One amongst so many great classics from the 40s-60s that has a really special touch to it. One that just can't be replicated.You follow Kanji Watanabe around in his last few months, a man seemingly hopeless and confused. Clearly distraught, the man searches for any sort of purpose and something that he can take to the grave with dignity.While the premise is straightforward enough, it's the execution of the film that obviously makes it so great. Watanabe does not have to say much for you to understand the pain of the dilemma he faces. It's actually a really quiet film, despite the rowdiness of the first half when he goes about the town with the novelist and Toyo. That's one of the many beautiful things about the movie. The underlying atmosphere of desperation and hope are present even when it's not the topic of discussion.Sometimes in movies, it's hard to take away a lesson or any moral value that it might have. And sometimes films hardly have any at all. ""Ikiru"" could not be further from this. It is so honest, so forthright in its intentions. It shows how every day is a gift. It tells us that life is a blessing and it moves by way too quickly. It demonstrates how there is beauty in the smallest of things, from a tasty meal to a gorgeous sunset. It lets us know that acts of kindness from the heart are one of the most rewarding and tranquil parts of life.This movie will move you unlike most. There is something very, very special about it. Akira Kurosawa has so many great classics under his belt, but this is his best movie, and it's one of my favorites of all time.10/10."
Kanadiz,"May 17, 2008",8/10,"The real question of this story is: if you knew you were going to die, what would you do? Would you spend your last days doing everything you wanted to do any form of pleasure you can imagine, or would you do something importance, something that would actually mean something.An old man (Takashi Shimura) named Kenji is dying of cancer and feels his whole life has been wasted. For the past 30 years he's been working at Tokyo City Hall behind a desk accomplishing absolutely nothing, mainly just stamping papers with his rubber stamp and warming his chair.When he does find out he has cancer in the beginning of the film, he simply stops going to work and one day meets a stranger (who does a terrific job with his role) in a bar and in a conversation he says that he has money but doesn't know how to spend it for sheer entertainment. The stranger has pity on the man but at the same time envy since he doesn't just kill himself, but faces the facts of life and so of course he helps the old man have a good time but with his money as they go out on a night of night clubs, women and booze.Akira Kurosawa is one of my personal favorite directors and has many masterpieces but this doesn't exactly rank among those masterpieces like ""Ran"", ""Throne of Blood"", ""Yojimbo"" and the forgotten gem ""The Bad Sleep Well"". But that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film because in reality it's a great film, and the strongest point of this film is the simple but brilliant script as it tells us to appreciate life and the beauty of it, while we have it, hence the title of the film, ""Ikiru"" which means ""To Live"".One thing I didn't like about this film is the way the old man talks throughout the film; as if he can barley speak and you can barley make out what he is saying. But then again that is his role, moping around with this performance, you really believe that this man is dying of cancer and is truly upset with himself for not ""living"" his life all these years. One of his co-workers even tells to him over lunch that everyone has a nickname at the office and his was ""The Mummy"". He pauses for a minute and she thinks she has offended him but he reassures her that she hasn't in-fact; she has named him perfectly as he realizes that's what his life has been ever since his beloved wife has left him 30 years ago.Kenji feels that the worse part isn't dying; he feels that he has wasted his whole life and doesn't want to die before he does something of importance, meaning he wants to live his last days and not just exist as he has been doing all his life. He feels that he has been dead for a long time now but is just realizing it now when it's too late.There is a great moral to this story and a novelist in this film says it best with this beautiful and unforgettable quote: ""How tragic that man can never realize how beautiful life is until he is face to face with death."""
owensheekey,"Sep 30, 2024",8/10,"This Japanese film was released in 1952 after the end of World War 2 in the Pacific. This was six years into the American occupation and transformation of Japan into a Democratic, Capitalistic nation.I found it mesmerizing having been born on a USA military base in Japan in 1948 to parents from Pittsburgh PA, then moving from base to base in Japan until the age of seventeen and a half, as the occupation downscaled.It depicts how readily the Americanization of Japan was occurring with baseball, nightclubs, music, and youthful behavior.The entrenched, autocratic bureaucratization of Japanese government is revealed. This is the fictional tale of a midlevel bureaucrat who had been grieving the death of his wife for thirty years thus existing not living. His transformation, due to a life-changing experience, led to his win for good thus exemplifying the potential for change in a corrupted government.The film demonstrates how guilt and ancestry devotion has long played a role in Japanese society."

That moment where Kanji explains what's happening to his son, it was phenomenal.I am learning more about Kurosawa with each film I watch, but I must admit, this one threw me totally off guard, it wasn't what I was expecting, it further enhances my realisation that Kurosawa was a genius.Remember all work and no play! There's a really meaningful message in this film."
benprichardsdotcom,"Feb 14, 2024",9/10,"With brutal honesty I admit that despite loving Japanese cinema that love hasn't extended much beyond Ghibli and some early Manga (Akira) but I've read quite a few Japanese novels and I've had the pleasure of travelling around Japan for 5 weeks.There's something wholly cleansing about the childlike honesty and purity of Japanese culture that's an antidote to the excesses of western consumerism. This heartfelt tale Watanabe and his coming to terms with the vagaries that confront him will enrich your life.Kurasawa is a proper film maker, unapologetically hegemonic and all the better for it. If you're sick of Hollywood watch this."
atlasmb,"Dec 13, 2016",8/10,"""Ikiru"" is the story of one man--Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a government bureaucrat with a boring and meaningless job. He keeps his head down and never questions the status quo or his place as a cog in the machinery of local government.When he realizes he has little time left to live, he thinks of death, then the choices he has made in life. He is absent from work for the first time in thirty years, lost in reverie and unable to cope with what he sees as his failure to achieve anything of value.The viewer, guided by a voice over, knows Watanabe is having an existential meltdown, and wonders how this character can ever find redemption in his own eyes.He tries a variety of new experiences (shades of Ferris Bueller). But he still feels a failure. Eventually, he returns to his job and attempts a new strategy.""Ikiru"" is a tribute to those who get things done. Other films have celebrated the kind man (""It's a Wonderful Life""), the principled man (""12 Angry Men"" or ""To Kill a Mockingbird""); ""Ikiru"" celebrates the man with a vision and the determination to carry it out, especially in the face of bureaucracy.Director Kurosawa called ""Ikiru"" his greatest work, perhaps because he valued its universal themes. Shimura--a Kurosawa favorite--acts with minimal expression. Watanabe is a sponge soaking up his environment. He is a blank slate upon which we paint our own faces and confront our own truths.This is a film that deserves to be seen."
ayckara,"Jan 11, 2024",10/10,"""Ikiru"" is undoubtedly a masterpiece that showcases a mastery of defining the boundaries between life and death; there is no need to debate this. However, it also documents this characteristic by prompting the audience to embark on a quest for ""judgment."" When you see this film, you cannot help but reconsider the reasons for your life (or living). The pivotal moments in our lives, guided by right or wrong choices, become unavoidable to recall. Although this may lead us towards disappointment and despair from one perspective, it also opens the door to questioning whether it is ever too late. ""Ikiru"" conveys the message that preventing the monotony of a perspective that trivializes details is within our control, reminding us not to become mere ""living dead."" It emphasizes the necessity of living a life open to risks."
pranabchaudhury,"Jan 7, 2026",9/10,"Kurosawa gently asks, with a soft but firm tap on the shoulder, ""So... what are you doing with your life?"" What begins as a bureaucratic drama turns into a surprisingly tender, ironic, and life-affirming punch to the gut. With heartbreaking simplicity, dry humor, and a deep undercurrent of sadness, the film proves that meaning isn't found in grand gestures-sometimes it's just a swing set in the snow. Quiet, cheeky, and devastating in the best way. By the end, it doesn't preach; it simply sits with you long after the film is over. Probably my favorite Akira Kurosawa film."
Bibliophile100,"Jul 29, 2024",9/10,"I've recently dived into the history of one of the most amazing, prolific, and legendary Japanese film men of all time: Akira Kurosawa! I've started his filmography with this movie, Ikiru (To Live), and what a touching film it was!Mr. Kanji Watanabe is an apparently ordinary, uneventful man, having been working the same job for the past 30 years. Nothing ever really happens for, or to him in his life...until one day, he receives an unexpected medical diagnoses: stomach cancer! With less than one year to live, Kanji summons up his inner desire to try and enjoy something truly memorable, make as many memories as possible, and perhaps leave something behind for everyone to remember him by, once he ascends to Heaven.I was very engaged and focused with Kanji's predicament, watching as he tries to find some excitement and joy to satisfy him before he dies, telepathically encouraging him to not give up. He meets two different people who attempt to help him find some excitement. One person is an eccentric writer, but he mostly just takes Kanji to bars and clubs, which don't seem to be satisfying him. The other person, is a woman named Toyo, to whom Kanji finds himself attracted to. I personally liked their chemistry and relationship much better; their interactions seemed to be much more eventful, and Kanji seemed to be engaging more and more in life each time he and Toyo meet. Toto eventually shares a fun fact or two with Kanji, and Kanji reveals his cancer to her. I'm glad the two didn't actually become lovers, just friends, because friends are usually one of the best things to cling to if you soon will be leaving the land of the living, as is the love of family, though Kanji's family don't show too much love and support for him, partially because they are unaware of his cancer, but also because they are fixated on inheriting Kanji's money and other belongings. Had Kanji and Toyo became lovers, I suspect that may have created more conflict between the two, and that conflict may have spread outward, and affected Kanji's family and employees, whom he works with.What a gentle, moving, touching, and adventurous movie Ikiru was! I enjoyed it a lot! Take this movie as a reminder to always embrace and enjoy life the best you can! Make as many friends and memories as possible, and most of all, take the love your family and friends give you, and give your own love to them, for none of us know when exactly, our time will come, to leave life, and enter eternal life..."

bonjsumio,"Sep 22, 2024",10/10,"Ikiru is a deeply moving and introspective film by Akira Kurosawa that explores the meaning of life in the face of death. Takashi Shimura delivers a masterful performance as Kanji Watanabe, a bureaucrat who, after learning he's terminally ill, searches for purpose in his final days. The film's delicate portrayal of regret, mortality, and redemption is profound, offering a poignant reflection on how we spend our time and what truly matters. Kurosawa's storytelling is both subtle and powerful, and Ikiru leaves a lasting emotional impact, urging viewers to live with intention and compassion. I love the film."

It's a one way ride, to be sure (there are no easy answers here, and Watanabe is cast adrift like a man stunned by the hammer), and Kurosawa never loses focus, never flinches; never opts for an easy out; we FEEL for this man who must come to terms with his own mortality (which he does, in break-your-heart fashion). There are lessons to be learned here, for all of us must (at some point in our lives) learn ""to live..."""

Chaser923,"Jul 13, 2021",9/10,"Wow, what a great story. I think I barrrrely liked this more than Seven Samurai. But anyway yeah this movie was actually really deep. The lessons in this movie are actually very important: Don't waste your life. Live a little, don't try to just pass the time. I know it's a ""sad"" film, but by the end I couldn't help but feel very satisfied and happy. The only thing holding this movie back for me is (I'm sorry for this) it's AGE. Old movies (<1965) like this just aren't as impactful on me as newer ones. I know many people would disagree with that and defend these older films with their lives, but I just find more entertainment in newer movies. But I cannot deny this films greatness. A great ending, amazing moments throughout, amazing character arc for the main character, just all around a very well made film. Akira Kurosawa really knows how to make movies."
Norwegianheretic,"Aug 30, 2023",10/10,"I could say that it's Kurosawa's greatest (which it is), I could say that Takashi Imura, the star, gave the greatest performance in all cinema history (second only to Chaplin's in the closing moments of City Lights), or I could say that the structure of the script was astonishingly innovate (which it was) - but the thing this film did for me was to save my life in the sense that before I saw it, I never realized how valuable my life was, the things that I could do with my life, and the same is true for all living humans. Kurosawa's contribution to film with Ikiru was much much greater than making an astonishing motion picture, as the title says 'To Live', he has taught me what it means to live and brought newer meaning to every day I have left to live and Kurosawa himself lives on in the soul of everyone who has seen and been so deeply touched by Ikiru."
MlleSedTortue,"Aug 18, 2020",10/10,"Any praise one can give to Ikiru is an understatement. In a filmography composed of masterpieces, I find Ikiru to be one of the most heartfelt and poetic works from the master Kurosawa.Takashi Shimura is Kanji Watanabe a committed bureaucrat in post war Japan. For decades there was just one constant in life, work. In an instant this reality is shattered as Watanabe discovers he little time remaining. And thus Watanabe sets out to live life, to discover the intricate beauties of the people and world around him.Shimura gives the performance of a lifetime. He disappears completely into the role. Every action, every expression, is portrayed with so mach heart I cannot imagine the film without him. This also holds true for the rest of the cast. Each character is given such life and unique subtleties that work well off of Shimura. Kurosawa's direction here is some of his finest, the film being so beautifully shot and composed. And the end, so heartbreaking yet so hopeful. The film is truly art in every sense of the world and stands as one of the finest films ever made."
jaredtonsfeldt,"Mar 23, 2022",10/10,"This is the kind of movie you watch to reinvigorate a love for life.

Spondonman,"May 25, 2008",8/10,"Over the years I think I've devoted nearly half a day of my valuable time watching and re-watching this multi-layered masterpiece. One of its main messages to me is : what would I do in a similar position to the protagonist of the story? Most of us belong to the wage slave class and are in work roles utterly useless to the greater humanity, what would we do if told we had a few months to live (disregarding the fact that even 100 years/1200 months is an infinitesimal fraction of a geological eye-blink)?Watanabe-san is the buck-passing rubber-stamping Section Chief of the Public Affairs Dept. in City Hall, never having had a day off in 30 years until told (in a roundabout way) that he has terminal stomach cancer. He goes AWOL, does a little drinking and flirting and finally comes to the conclusion that he needs to leave something constructive behind him. It all unfolds in Kurosawa's usual inimitable fluid story-telling style  he left behind a beautiful b&w Japanese film languidly but constructively dealing with terminal illness that can still hook people in to this day. Favourite bits: In the bar where Watanabe-san mournfully groans out his requested song Life Is Brief to the suddenly electrified patrons  and us; the stark contrast between him and his confused state and the young and healthy flibbertigibbet he spends a few days with; the flashbacks of him doggedly pursuing his pet project at City Hall; the culmination of everything on the playground swing at 11:00 pm on a snowy night. No good doing that here  the park would be full of losers instead of winners like him.To the impatient I suppose it would be pretty slow at times, but in the hands of this particular Master I wouldn't have minded it lasting another hour. Beautiful, poignant, elegant, thoughtful, wistful, powerful  and imho not Kurosawa's best either! In other words, a film other directors would die for."
SnoopyStyle,"Nov 15, 2015",8/10,Kanji Watanabe is a widowed bureaucrat as the city's public affairs section chief. The bureaucratic machine has ground any ambition out of him. He has slowly climbed up the ladder by doing nothing and therefore doing nothing wrong. He discovers that he has stomach cancer and probably only six months to live. He is lost. He doesn't go to work and takes out his life savings. His son is shocked. He spends a wild night with a writer but he feels empty. He spends some time with a young exuberant female staffer. Eventually he decides to make a difference through his work.This is a movie that makes one think about one's own life. It is a compelling everyman movie. The last third isn't quite as compelling without Kanji. That part does have a point to make but it could have been done in a shorter way. This is a Kurosawa classic and an important one.
MarcoParzivalRocha,"Oct 4, 2020",10/10,"Kanji Watanabe, a bureaucrat workaholic, tries to find his purpose in the world after discovering tgst he suffers from terminal cancer.Master Kurosawa's most emotional and moving film, and his best work besides the samurai theme. Everything in this film flows the way it is supposed to, with no boring moments, with the right pace since the initial exposure to the climax, fabulous interpretations and such an authenticity only at the level of the best in the industry.I see Ikiru as the most sentimental and beautiful satirical film about bureaucracy ever made.An exemplary life, leaded by the (supposedly) right values, or a bohemian life, full of lust and the satisfaction of carnal desires, is meaningless if the heart does not have the right reason to keep beating, and that is what Kurosawa wants to show with this work of art.""I can't afford to hate anyone. I don't have that kind of time."""

This is why he decides to start living life a different way.Loved this film and its message."
De_Sam,"Dec 15, 2016",9/10,"Probably 黒澤明 (Akira Kurosawa)'s most realistic take on his humanism; one should try to do as much good as he/she can, but should also expect resistance at every turn in this endeavour. That goes double for the societies we live in today, were we are so interconnected you cannot accomplish anything on your own, you will have to rely on others and while it can be difficult to motivate yourself, just imagine how borderline to impossible it will be to convince those others to partake in your actions out of something as old-fashioned as altruistic philanthropy. People being too self-centred, departments more interested in maintaining their continued existence by evading their responsibilities, it all still rings true today.Yet, lest one wallow in the cynicism that pervades parts of the film, he/she should remember that individuals can still achieve meaningful feats even in the face of such adversity. Let that be the most optimistic message 生きる (Ikiru) conveys. Plus, I give it extra credit for conveying said message without even a hint of moral obligation or patronising attitude."
etg1701,"Oct 29, 2007",9/10,"It is unfortunate that Japanese television calls to mind overly elaborate mecha battles and bizarre scenes of tentacle monsters, for this film portrays an altogether different side of Japanese cinema. It tells the simple tale of a dying man, Watanabe, and how he reacts to the news of terminal stomach cancer over the course of several months. Despite its serious premise, Ikiru balances sorrow with clever touches of humor, such as an early scene demonstrating effectively the bureaucracy at which Watanabe works. Those expecting the rapid and action-packed style of modern films will no doubt find it slow and even ponderous at points, but I believe it hearkens back effectively to the days before movies driven fancy special effects and action at every turn."
Farzad-Doosti,"Mar 3, 2022",8/10,"A film that realistically deals with the social and political issues that governed Japanese society in those years.Apart from the fact that Kurosawa explores such a big issue as life and death in his film, he makes a lot of jokes about his country's administrative system.

bobsgrock,"Dec 11, 2008",8/10,"Akira Kurosawa, the Japanese director more famously known for his epic samurai stories, takes us into the depths of post-war Japan in this very human story of a government official who discovers he has terminal cancer and only six months to live. With this new found information, he decides to start living his life, something he neglected to do for the past thirty years when he never missed a day of work.As the story progresses, we learn more as to why our protagonist is in such a conservative state of mind. This, in turn, propels him to take up a crusade for the people of the city and help them and change their life for the better. This goes to show the most human side of Kurosawa we have ever seen. The character of Watanabe is handled very delicately, never condescending or preaching. He is simply a man who struggles with meaning and definition of his own life but wants to change that forever.It is in this context that Ikiru also has its failures. The final third act of this film is mostly a group of men sitting around talking about Watanabe while drinking plenty of sake and getting very drunk. TO me, this scene dragged on for way to long and was in fact mostly unnecessary. There were also some other scenes that didn't fit too well with the narrative, but they were far and few in between.So, to be honest, this is a real underrated treasure from Kurosawa. And even though it doesn't have the sheer willpower or amazement from his other works, this is definitely a testament to humans and the remarkable changes we can make by putting our mind to something."
jamesrupert2014,"May 16, 2020",10/10,"Senior bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) searches for meaning and purpose in life after finding out that he has only a few months to live. Kurosawa's film is a beautiful, sad masterpiece and Takashi Shimura is excellent as the soft-spoken man who belatedly realises that his life has become meaningless. The film is structured episodically as first Watanabe and a dissipated writer (Yunosuke Ito) explore the seamier side of Tokyo's nightlife, finding no answer in there, he spends time with a vivacious young co-worker (Miki Odagiri) whose joy in life he admires but ultimately cannot be part of, and finally the development of the children's park, in which he finally finds solace and meaning. Kurosawa expertly switches from linear narrative to a flashback structure halfway through the film, and viewers move from Watanabe's perspective to those of his bureaucratic co-workers, as they drink sake at his wake and discuss the changes in the man over his dying days. The scenes of the increasingly drunk men reminiscing are similar to the director's earlier classic Rashomon (1950), as each man tells an aspect of the story from a different perspective. Kurosawa also uses the film to skewer a stultified Japanese bureaucracy, especially self-serving public 'servants' and their sycophants, the wasteful redundancy and resulting zealous turf-guarding, and the endless, worthless 'busywork'. The final scene of Watanabe, serene and satisfied, is beautiful. A flawless, timeless classic."
davidmvining,"Mar 24, 2022",10/10,"The only film Akira Kurosawa made between 1948 and 1965 that did not include Toshiro Mifune in any way, Ikiru is one of the most tenderly human, aesthetically beautiful, and deeply moving films I've ever seen. I labeled it my favorite Kurosawa many years ago, long before I'd seen all of his film (I still haven't as of this writing), and yet I seriously doubt that any film will topple it from that spot. This is one of the pinnacles of cinema, a work of such unbridled and touching emotion that faces death squarely and demands a chance to make an impact on the world. The impact may be small, no larger than a small city park for children, but the impact will remain.The story is about Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a thirty-year veteran of the Tokyo city bureaucracy given the anodyne prognosis of a mild stomach ulcer that he knows is actually a cover for stomach cancer, an effective death sentence that gives him no more than a year to live (a common practice in Japanese medicine at the time was to lie about certain terminal diseases to patients in order to save them grief). Understanding his fate, he's left facing the life he's led, and he realizes how little he's actually lived.This film is both deceptively simple and marvelously complex, and the way the complexity arises is in its structure. There are two major sections of the film that are dominated by flashbacks, the opening third and the final third. The opening third's flashbacks serve a specific purpose in that it is Watanabe reflecting back on the failings of his life, in particular around his son Mitsuo (Nobuo Kaneko). Watanabe's wife died when Mitsuo was only a small child, and Watanabe reflects back on key moments from Mitsuo's childhood when he failed his son. There was the car ride to the funeral of the boy's mother, where he failed to properly console him, a baseball game when the boy was older where Watanabe could not bring himself to cheer on the boy after he had ran into a pickle and been picked off, and Mitsuo's going in for an appendectomy that Watanabe finds an excuse to leave. Combined with his meritorious work in the public affairs department of the city government where Watanabe failed to accomplish a single thing over three decades, Watanabe feels lost with only a few months to live, a mountain of savings from a life of frugality, and nothing to live for.So, he tries to live for himself. He disappears from work for a week and starts drinking in little dive sake bars, eventually running across a writer (Yunosuke Ito) who listens to Watanabe's tale, only able to tell it to a complete stranger, and the duo go out on the town. What follows is a string of bars, dancing, and hat purchasing as the writer shows Watanabe the selfish side of life. He's ultimately unfulfilled by it all, though, with a crushing moment as Watanabe requests the song ""Gondola no Uta"" from a piano player and sings the lyrics, his mouth hardly opening, and in such a sad way that it stops everyone around him to observe. Finding this empty, Watanabe, the next morning, comes across one of his underlings on the street. This is Toyo (Miki Odagiri), the young woman in his office who has come to him to get him to sign off on her resignation from the civil service. She can't stand the inaction, the monotony, and the lack of interest that accompanies a life in the Japanese bureaucracy.Instead of simply stamping her resignation (the wrong form, he informs her before dutifully stamping the form that's in front of him like he always does) and letting her go, he invites her out to a day on the town, showering her with presents like stockings, lunch, and a time at the carnival. For over a week, he keeps doing this, even after her resignation at city hall has gone through and she's started working in a toy manufacturing plant assembling mechanical hopping bunnies, and her patience grows thin. His selfless act of showering her with attention, presents, and nights out on the town has become unsatisfying to her, and the news is crushing to Watanabe. He wants to live in his final months. He wants to live through someone else, and when Toyo pushes him away he gets an idea. He shows up at work for the first time in two weeks, dashing the hopes of advancement of his second in command Sub-Section Chief Ono (Kamatari Fujiwara) with his mere presence, he finds the first request on his large stack of papers, a request for the paving over of an open and fetid water source in a slum to be replaced by a playground for children, and he's off to make it happen.Then the movie does something unexpected. It jumps forward five months to his wake. He's accomplished his goal of building the playground, credit denied to him by the Deputy Mayor (Nobuo Nakamura), seen the opening ceremony, and then died, succumbing to his illness, that very night, alone on the playground. What erupts next is an extended debate on what Watanabe did, how responsible he was for the construction of the playground, and the effect he's had on those around him. This is the final fifty minutes of the film, and it's marvelous. With a more straightforward telling of the story, we'd have Kurosawa stringing us along with the ins and outs of the bureaucracy while forming tension around whether the playground will get constructed or not. By skipping ahead, Kurosawa completely changes the focus. There's no longer any tension around the material construction but a refocus on the effects of Watanabe's embrace of life on those around him.It begins with the Deputy Mayor announcing that he should be given the full credit for the playground's construction, not Watanabe, and that his disrespecting of Watanabe at the opening ceremony by placing him in the back of the crowd was completely justified. All of the section chiefs nod in approval, along with their subordinates, but the Deputy Mayor has to leave after a crowd of women arrive, tearfully placing incense and flowers before Watanabe's picture, obviously giving him credit for saving them and their children from the fetid water that had plagued their homes. With the Deputy Mayor and his section chiefs gone, the subordinates begin the real debate where they piece together the final few months from their individual interactions with Watanabe to discover that it was his dedication above and beyond the limits of his station that led to this good work, that he was driven by his stomach cancer that they decide he must have known about, and that they will all endeavor to become like him in their daily lives. This, of course, does not happen, for the new Public Affairs Section Chief, Ono, sends the next group of petitioners at the desk on the same runaround that the ladies who wished to have the park built had gone through.There's a remarkable mixture of cynicism and humanism apparent here with the grinding down of the bureaucracy removing the basics of human decency from those within it, but, at the same time, the finding of power within the individual to make a difference, no matter how small. Watanabe went through his life alone, even in the end he relied on no one else to give him solace. He worked to make his life matter, and the final shots of Watanabe, perhaps his ghost, swinging in the playground, and singing ""Gondola no Uta"" are touching. He will be forgotten. His works will endure for at least a while longer.The tender humanity in Watanabe's journey from mummy (Toyo's nickname for him) to someone who lives, even for a short time, is wonderfully laid out and executed by Kurosawa, his cowriters (Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni), and, in particular, Takashi Shimura. Shimura was a very good actor in general, and he had a distinctive face, especially when he was meant to look sad, pulling his lower face in and pronouncing his lips, and he gives Watanabe a deep sense of loss, resolve, and emotion as he faces his final days with determination. It's also another example of Kurosawa's remarkable eye, providing marvelous compositions from beginning to end from two people talking in a rundown sake bar to Watanabe facing down goons in a hallway to the final shot of Watanabe on that swing. The aesthetics support the narrative, never calling attention to themselves, always feeling appropriate, and very often just being beautiful to look at.Ikiru is a masterpiece. It's one of my favorite films. It is a towering achievement of humanism and emotion. I adore this movie."
jerschwab,"Mar 20, 2002",9/10,"Like many other people who have had the benefit of watching this fine piece from Kurosawa, I was touched and found that alot that goes on is still true in our society.  It's pathetic to see how much bureaucracy there is in this world today and how much time is wasted doing nothing.  This happens everywhere you look.  People filling out forms, following absurd procedures, following the status quo.  This film will make you want to make a change in your own way and perhaps put a little more effort into helping others. This film is about finding happiness... the ultimate goal in life.  I give it 9/10."
ukcritic,"Sep 12, 2002",8/10,"At the centre of ""Ikiru"" are the massive issue of mortality and the thoughtful, poignant performance by Takashi Shimura, but Kurosawa's direction also managed to find moments of humour in the oddest places. The wake sequence is brilliant in the way it gets laughs both sad and pure out of drunkenness and bad logic, satirises bureaucracy and its servants, and also lets us think about the meaning of life, whether a wasted life can secure a legacy by attempting to redeem itself near the end, and whether those attempts at redemption, if successful, actually qualify a life as meaningful.The film could perhaps do without so much of the voice-over, which at times explains things a little too much, but that's a small complaint."

filipemanuelneto,"Oct 9, 2025",9/10,"I've seen a few of Kurosawa's films, and while I agree he's a good filmmaker, I've never been truly captivated. ""Ran"" is a good film, but it's basically ""King Lear"" in Japan and told in a stylized and painfully slow manner; ""Yojimbo"" is a good action film with plenty of violence, but that's it; ""Seven Samurai"" is good and very well-made, but it's also very slow, bloated and predictable; ""Rashomon"" has a very well-thought-out mystery, but it's overly complicated.Well... with this film, Kurosawa finally won my admiration. Never before had a film by this director captivated and touched me in this way. The director, who also wrote the screenplay, offers us a truly moving story about an elderly civil servant who discovers he has cancer and will die within a few months. Far from being a depressing film about the inexorability of death or human ephemerality, the film philosophizes a lot (yes, Kurosawa loves to make his films a marathon lasting hours, and this one is even short) about the meaning of life and the mark we leave on the world. The old man finally realizes that he spent decades in a room cluttered with paperwork doing nothing and, therefore, his existence was a waste of time. Thus, he begins to seek new meaning for his final months. The film is full of incredible moments, like the one where the bureaucrats vow to follow his example knowing, as we also know, that such words are the vain babble of drunks filled with self-pity, or the tension between father and son when the inheritance is threatened by the man's unpredictable behavior.Anyone who knows Japan at all knows that, in general, the Japanese are perfectionists and meticulous, used to dedicating themselves 110% to whatever they do, and raised within a society that cultivates extreme, almost servile, humility and respect for hierarchies and ""institutional"" ways. Unlike us, Latins, they never seek shortcuts to circumvent bureaucracy or overcome obstacles. The Japanese, even more than obeying the law, love to follow directives and do everything by the book. And the director shows us how this, in a way, has created a public administration paralyzed by the interests or disinterest of powerful individuals, cluttered with useless paperwork and officials who push files from department to department instead of giving solutions. Those employees could also be from a multinational corporation or any other service provider: they are people who do nothing, who waste their lives and force others to do the same while they wait for their requests to be solved. They are parasites. Ultimately, the film's message is the good old ""carpe diem"": the best way to give meaning to our lives is to seek our own happiness and that of those around us, and not waste time on things that can be resolved with a little goodwill and dedication from each person.The performances by Takashi Shimura and Miki Odagiri are magnetic, and both actors deserve congratulations on their work. The film boasts very well-done cinematography, excellent sets and good costumes. As I said, it is a bit too long, it's possible to make a cut version of about an hour and fifty minutes without losing much of anything important. The film also has almost no soundtrack, and this, combined with its length and the occasional deadpan, can dull the audience. This time I handled it well, but Kurosawa has this problem."
thethrill,"Nov 11, 1999",10/10,"Now I am completely and irreversibly depressed about the state of modern man and the enveloping bureaucracy.  Hopeless.Just the same, a very beautiful film.  Unmatched in its genre."
christinakennedy-10035,"Nov 13, 2024",8/10,"Ikiru is a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. I had the opportunity to watch it on a rainy afternoon, which added to the somber yet reflective mood of the film. From the moment Kanji Watanabe, played masterfully by Takashi Shimura, learns of his terminal illness, I felt an immediate connection to his plight. The stark contrast between his monotonous bureaucratic life and the vibrant emotions he begins to experience was striking.What struck me most was how Kurosawa beautifully encapsulates the essence of life's fleeting nature. Watanabe's journey from a lifeless cog in a bureaucratic machine to a man seeking meaning was both heartbreaking and inspiring. I found myself laughing and crying in equal measure, especially during the poignant moments with his son. The scene where Watanabe attempts to share his diagnosis is a gut-wrenching reminder of the emotional distance that often exists in familial relationships. It resonated with me deeply, as it made me reflect on my own connections with loved ones.The film's exploration of bureaucracy is another layer that I found compelling. The absurdity of the system that Watanabe navigates is both frustrating and humorous. It's a critique of how society often prioritizes rules over human connection, and that struck a chord with me. I could feel the weight of his realization that he had spent so much of his life in a soulless routine, and it made me question my own daily choices.As the film progresses, Watanabe's quest to leave a meaningful legacy becomes a powerful narrative. The moment he decides to build a park for children is a turning point that filled me with hope. It's a reminder that it's never too late to make a difference, and that small acts of kindness can ripple through the lives of others. The imagery of him on the swing, a symbol of reclaiming joy, is etched in my memory.While the final act shifts towards a more political commentary, I found it necessary to complete the story arc. It serves as a reminder that even in our most personal struggles, we are often entangled in larger societal issues. Kurosawa's ability to weave these themes together is a testament to his genius.Ikiru is not just a film; it's an experience that challenges you to reflect on your own life choices and the legacy you wish to leave behind. It's a gentle nudge to embrace the beauty of existence, even in the face of inevitable."
frankde-jong,"Feb 5, 2023",10/10,"I watched ""Ikiru"" for the second time after seeing its remake ""Living"" (2022, Oliver Hermanus). The pitfall therefore is that I compare the two films in the wrong order. I shall try to avoid this pitfall by not comparing the two films at all (or at least as little as possible). All I would like to say about it is that ""Living"" is a very faithfull remake of ""Ikiru"" and still a good film in its own right. This indicates that ""Ikiru"" must be a great film, and this indication is true.The story is about the bureaucrat Watanabe (played by Takashi Shimura) who is diagnosed with cancer at the beginning of the movie. He has only a few month to live. His first reaction is to take a walk on the wilde side for the first time in his lfe. He soon realises that this only leads to a shallow satisfaction and decides to spend his last months creating a neighborhood playground.I will make some remarks about each phase of the storyline.We are first introduced to Watanabe the bureaucrat. The bureacracy is really outrageous. Piles of papers are shuffled around, collecting a lot of (apparently necessary) stamps. The bureaucrats are disappearing after there own piles, citizens are sent from one department to another. After watching this part of the film you know that the concept of meaningless jobs was not discovered by David Graeber.The diagnosis scene is I think a bit dated. The doctors don't tell Watanabe the bad news but they try to comfort him. However a man in the waiting room had Wanabe told which words doctors usually use to wrap bad news in, and these doctors use exactly the same words. This is probably the scene in which ""Living"" differs the most from its original. It is still a fascinating scene though. When Watanabe leaves the hospital the film is completely silent to convey the extent to which Watanabe is shocked by the news. Only when a truck passes by there is sound again.The desire to walk on the wild side is partly prompted by the arduous relationship between Watanabe and his son. He has heard a conversation between his son and his girlfriend indicating that they are most of all interested in his inheritance. A few flashbacks however show that this arduous relationship is not only due to the son.Watanabe may want to walk on the wild side, he has no idea how. A novelist comes to his aid, acting (in his own words) as a sort of benificent Mephistopheles. Together they visit gambling palaces, dance halls and the red light district. In the red light district scene there is practically no nude, but still this scene is more erotic than the equivalent one in ""Living"". The most moving scene of this part of the film is however a drunken Watanabe singing an old song in a dance hall, reminding not only himself but all visitors of their mortality.The transition from the wild side to good deeds is set in motion by a young colleague from the office. She has resigned because the work was dull and monotonous. She has put a meaningful job ahead of career perspective and causes Watanabe to rethink his own decisions thirty years ago.The good deeds part of the story is told as a flash back. The colleague bureacrats of Watanabe visit his funeral and talk about his strange behaviour of the last months. They only begin to understand when they are drunk, and prefer to forget this understanding when they are sober again.There are many beautiful shots in ""Ikiru"". I already mentioned a few (Watanabe leaving the hospital, the drunken Watanabe singing in a dance hall) but the most famous is without any doubt the shot of Watanabe happily on the swing of the playground he fought so hard for.There are many films about love, but there are only a few films about dying. By dying I do not mean dying the quick way (such as in the shoot out of a Western), but dying the slow way (such as in ""Ikiru""). But don't be fooled, ""Ikiru"" translates as ""to live"". It is not about a man dying too soon, it is about a man starting living too late.""Ikiru"" is a film that makes you think. Yes Watanabe is an outrageous bureaucrat, but what about me? Maybe I'm also postponing good intentions until after my retirement?Akira Kurosawa is most well known for his samourai films such as ""Rashomon"" (1950) and ""Seven samourai"" (1954). He has however also made very good movies in other genres. Apart from ""Ikiru"" (1952) I like to mention ""Red beard"" (1965) and ""Dersu Uzala"" (1975).In the ""old man looks back on his life"" genre ""Ikiru"" is only equaled in my opinion by ""Wild strawberries"" (1957, Ingmar Bergman)."
elvircorhodzic,"Oct 15, 2016",9/10,"IKIRU is a film about loneliness, lethargic society, absurdity and deep human feeling. Middle-aged bureaucrat after the discovery of his remains because of a serious illness a year of life, he decides to spend the remaining time to make up for all that in life has failed. It actually looks for his life meaning, because he does not want to spend the last days of life, referring to the failures and terrible disease.This movie is really fascinating in a somewhat strange way. A touching story includes a bit pathetic old man with that in certain parts of the film a lot of people can relate to. A ""last"" year is filled with life. Loneliness, challenge, search, knowledge, purpose, peace and tranquility.Drama that causes progress and strength of character. A lone man in a deceptive world, without friends and family support searching for the meaning of his life. Death is closer with each passing day and she is inevitable. Life is dynamic in spite of everything, the end is ironic. Nobody's there to lend a hand, hug, kiss or encourage in difficult times. After death, they are all here to discuss, ask questions and seek answers.Director patiently studied the people. Somewhere based and on society as a whole. The goal is one, to present human nature and characteristics, strong emotions and way of life in a realistic way. Maybe a little taunt at the end.Takashi Shimura as Kanji Watanabe is incredible. He gave us a deep and exhausting picture of his character."
jomarcdulatre,"Dec 17, 2024",10/10,The film invites you of a rich man who found out he has a terminal. This gives us a very heartwarming experience of finding meaning in a limited but finding what is his purpose.It makes us reflect of our life that it is limited but we should find purpose for it. This gives us the true and sensible meaning of this life.This movie will make you realize many things and will make you appreciate your life and may through you will also find your true purpose because we often see ourselves in a loophole where we can't see our true purpose that can be beneficial to every human being that we encounter in our daily lives.
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Oct 22, 2024",9/10,"Like most Akira Kurosawa films, Ikiru is better the second time around, and I remember thinking it was pretty great then first time. It's certainly the director's most emotional movie, but it's not overly sentimental. It strikes this perfect balance between being broadly moving but also realistic. There are moments that hit hard, but it never feels like it's overdoing things, and the final act - though there are many points at which it could - never ventures into something overly sweet. I appreciate that balancing act more than ever. It feels warm and sad all at once, and I left feeling both inspired and a little despondent, which isn't something you can say about most films.It's long, and a tiny bit slow, but I'll also give it this: I was tired tonight and watched this in a dark theater, but I never came close to nodding off. That's always a good sign, especially for something that's relatively grounded and patiently paced. I'd forgotten how well this was filmed, too. Even though Kurosawa is capturing rather ordinary sights and locations, there are still some really awe-inspiring moments of camerawork - less flashy than Seven Samurai, but still. It's not as flashy a movie, but it still has that visual punch.It was also good to see this in a cinema that was pretty much filled to capacity with people rocking up to see a 70-year-old Japanese film that's 140 minutes long on a Tuesday night. This can only be a good thing, and is worth celebrating, even if it's not directly tied to the film's quality itself.Also, a line from this ran through my mind as I was driving home. Someone in the lane in front of me was going a bit too slow. I started to feel myself getting angry, but then I remembered the main character in this, faced with his mortality, saying, ""I don't have the time to hate anyone,"" resisting the urge to get angry and instead opting to just persevere. And that calmed me down. It's a silly and small example of the film sticking with me, but I hope to keep some of the lessons here in mind. There's a simple message at the heart of this film, but it's one worth repeating, if just to serve as a reminder about the fragility of life and the necessity of standing up to passive negativity and bureaucracy (a word I hate so much, partly because I can never spell it. Any movie that critiques bureaucracy as much as Ikiru is cool in my book)."
steventim-65023,"Feb 24, 2024",10/10,"Kanji Watanabe discovers that he has cancer, and tries to seek some sort of meaning in his final days, he becomes aware that he's operated as a cog in the giant domestic machinery, and fights against the system.I've been working my way through The Kurosawa films, and thus far I've been impressed with the lot, I'll be honest, I expected a Samurai film, and when it became apparent that that wasn't the case either, I thought it may have been a mystery, it wasn't that either, instead it turned out to be a rather intimate, absorbing character study.It shows that despite being essentially part of a machine, Kanji has a very human side, only he realises it too late."
ThomasDrufke,"Mar 29, 2017",8/10,"Sometimes films released more than 50 years ago don't have the same impact they once did. Well, that's not the case at all for Ikiru, one of Akira Kurosawa's first universally praised hits.Ikiru tells the story of a man out of time. A bureaucratic man who has worked the same job for decades and can't seem to find any purpose in his work or life in general. That is, until he finds out he has terminal stomach cancer. What follows is a coming of age story for a middle aged man who does his best to leave an impact on the world he will inevitably leave. With one of these types of stories, it all comes down to execution. The only way to make a film like this leave you with a particularly effective message is to have a filmmaker like Kurosawa. For the most part, I did go through the emotions the film wanted me to. It's also a story that lends itself to being more relatable the older you get. It's not easy for a 23-year-old guy like me to understand what Watanabe goes through in Ikiru, but it may be something that I relate to more as I get older.I found this film to be especially inspiring from his co-workers perspective. No one at the office does anything of value it seems, and it's only until after Watanabe takes a leave of absence and goes on a journey of self-discovery that they feel like they need to do something as well. The film shifts from Watanabe's story to his friends & families' story about half way through. I found each part to be interesting in its own right, but watching the people he cares about look back on his life and the impact he seemed to have made was some powerful stuff. The lessons and themes in the film are important ones. Pleasure is not living. Don't always do things for others or to please others, make sure you're taken care of as well. And most importantly, life is brief, make of it as you wish.+Poignant+Kurosawa's direction (duh)-Two separate parts feel jarring at first8.4/10"

sprude,"Aug 12, 2025",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa retrospective came to my city, where many of his great films played. I originally was set to see three, but added a fourth one. But for the last movie I saw was Ikiru or To Live, while has a comedic tone but underneath is a somber tale about a man that has a terminal illness a man who hasn't been able to live his life to the fullest until he realizes his life will be brief just like we are all life is short not only should we live to our fullest until it's the end but more when we lose a loved one a friend or family how do we as human who loved them how should we remember them by all the good things they do for people and society. With so much going on in the world, it's okay to be alone, but knowing that human connection is the best way to heal is the best way to be with people who make you enjoy life and feel comfortable talking to and being good to them. The film made me cry. I am very much a tough guy when it comes to certain movies. Still, this one broke me a scene where the main lead of the movie the amazing Takashi Shimura stared singing a song I felt a tear go down from each eyes on to my cheek that is why film is so important not only to tell beautiful stories but to move you with its powerful story telling and performances only Kurosawa can only convey that power and stature through his films!5/5 a perfect fim a true tour de force."
JayWolfgramm,"Jan 9, 2025",9/10,"I didn't know what to make of ""Ikiru"" as I began watching it. I had not heard anything about the film. I watched it because it was a Kurosawa film, and even if they don't feature samurai, Kurosawa makes great films. Our main character, Kanji, is told that he does not have long to live. Kanji has spent his life working for the government. There is an amusing montage showing how the red tape of government work prevents anything from being done. Given this ultimatum of life, Kanji begins to reevaluate things. He tries to find happiness.At first, I thought I had this movie figured out, and I thought it was fine. But then it takes a turn. After this turn happens, this movie upgrades from fine to spectacular. I won't say what that turn is, but when it happens, I was blown away.Life is short, but this film is still worth your time."
avik-basu1889,"Jul 4, 2017",9/10,"In 'Rashomon', Kurosawa went back in time and used a period setting to tell a simple story about the mysteries and perspectives involved in deciding what's true and what's not. But what Rashomon also succeeded in doing, was underlining the general paranoia and cynicism prevalent in post WWII Japan. In 'Ikiru', Kurosawa does something similar, but this time in a contemporary setting, with a little more intimacy. The protagonist Watanabe's quest to find a purpose in the last few days of his life directly reflects Japan's quest to find a new identity after the war.But having said all that, what makes 'Ikiru' the special film that it is, isn't the discussion it lends itself to in terms of the broader historical context. What makes it special is the fact that 'Ikiru' is a deeply personal film whose themes will resonate with every viewer. The character of Kenji Watanabe is incredible, because he transcends geographical and racial boundaries. Each and every viewer has either known someone like this or is someone like this irrespective of which nation they belong to. In Ermanno Olmi's 'Il Posto'(which is a film that deals with the dehumanisation of people in the growing industrial setting of post war Italy), for a few minutes, the film shifts the perspective from the protagonist Domenico to the older employees of the corporation to underline the pointlessness of their lives. Watanabe could easily have been one of those older men in 'Il Posto'. I have known many men like Watanabe. He is a man who allowed himself to get trapped in the bureaucratic maze. In the scene where we first meet him, Watanabe is in the middle of the shot, while the rest of the shot is crammed up completely with official documents. When the devastating news of the stomach cancer hits Watanabe, we can't help but feel immensely sorry for him. Kurosawa then gives us a insight into the world of this old man. We get to know that he has a son and daughter-in-law who remain distant to him(which reminded me of Ozu's 'Tokyo Story'). We learn that he is a widow and had decided to not remarry for the sake of his son. We see laminated certificates on the wall symbolising Watanabe's slavish dedication to his job for decades. But as he stands at the brink of death, his job, his sacrifices, his life as a whole, everything seems pointless.I really loved how Kurosawa patiently devotes a lot of time towards Watanabe's existential crisis, his search for a purpose, a motivation to achieve some mental satisfaction during the last few days of his life. We see him seek the company of different individuals and try out various activities to initially enjoy himself and loosen up a bit, which he realised he hadn't really ever done. But even then, something always seemed to be missing. We as a viewer also feel his frustration during this struggle. This is why when he identifies his calling i.e. when he identifies exactly what he needs to devote the remainder of his life to, we completely understand his decision, his motivations and we rejoice in our own way for him.The screenplay breaks the narrative of the film into two distinct parts by playing around with the timeline. Although the 2nd part of the film (which to a great extent reminded me of Lumet's '12 Angry Men')flirts with the prospect of becoming a little too didactic, it never crosses that line, because Kurosawa doesn't make the theme completely overshadow the character.It is needless to say Kurosawa's frame composition and use of movement(of both camera and actors) is just imperious. As is the case with his other films, Kurosawa characteristically uses space incredibly in every frame in terms of the visual juxtaposition between the foreground and the background. He might cram a particular shot with numerous characters or objects, but even then you'll automatically focus on the movement of the one character that Kurosawa wants you to focus on due to the beautiful choreography and extremely fluid camera movement.Of course one has to give all the love to Takashi Shimura. His use of a hunched posture while walking, along with his facial expressions make it impossible for a viewer to not fall completely in love with him. Kurosawa uses Shimura's face brilliantly in various close-ups and these close-ups are really expressive. There is a moment where a colleague watches Watanabe walking alone down one of the corridors of the City Hall again with his hunched posture with his back to the camera. This is a wordless, haunting moment and that image of the solitary Watanabe in the corridor will stay with me for a long time.'Ikiru' is an exploration of the cynicism in post WWII Japan, it is a damning indictment of the uselessness of the bureaucratic system(which again is a universal issue), but more so than anything else, it is a touching tale of a man who desperately seeks fulfillment in the final lap of the marathon called life by devoting himself to a worthy cause. It is a film that has the power to make someone care, it is a film that has the power to make someone learn to 'live'."
f-57307,"Apr 24, 2020",8/10,"""Ikiru"" is a great movie, even aside from the analysis and criticism of the numb reality of the Japanese government at that time. From the perspective of human awakening, it is equally great, and the film structure alone is enough to be a great movie."
Holt344,"Feb 20, 2022",10/10,"Ikiru translates to ""To Live"" and the major themes of the film include learning how to live, the inefficiency of bureaucracy and the decaying family life in Japan. Akira Kurosawa directed and co-wrote a film many critics agree in how it's among one of the best films, it's also Kurosawa's favorite. Roger Ebert added it to his list of Great Movies in 1996, saying, ""Over the years I have seen Ikiru every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think. And the older I get, the less Watanabe seems like a pathetic old man, and the more he seems like every one of us."" Those words are 100% true, I think I'll do the same thing when I rewatch this film in five years time, it will probably move me as much then as now.The film examines the struggles of a terminally ill Tokyo bureaucrat and his final quest for meaning. Takashi Shimura starts in the main role as Kanji Watanabe and though he doesn't have many lines of dialogue, his acting is truly memorable and even mesmerizing at times, brilliant performance.Kurosawa's long time work relationship with Asakazu Nakai is one of many reasons why his movies always look so excellent, for Ikiru, the cinematography is brilliant and so is Kurosawa's direction. The story is simple but it's his writing, his vision, his direction, that ultimately makes this film into the masterpiece it is. It isn't a movie you'll find entertaining and it never strives to be that kind of a movie, but Ikiru makes you think, truly ponder about its themes, and it moves you with its emotional story of a dying man and his final quest for meaning. Ikiru came out back in 1952 and that's 70 years ago now, it was a masterpiece then and it have stayed a masterpiece until this date, a movie that will live on for 70 more years."
herwinsg,"Nov 16, 2017",9/10,"This movie is according to me one of the finest works of flimmaking. This movie has deep meaning in every scene, from the terrifying realism of one finding his imminent fate to him discovering his purpose in life and rebirth (happy birthday) to the truth of human negligence and lack of appreciation and regret. This movie surely earns a spot in my top 10 Everyone can find something he/she can relate to in this masterpiece."
chera_khalid,"May 10, 2025",8/10,"Ikiru (1952), directed by Akira Kurosawa, is one of the most profound and moving films in Japanese cinema. It tells the story of Kanji Watanabe, a middle-aged, bureaucratic civil servant, who learns that he has terminal cancer and is faced with the realization that his life has been largely spent in meaningless routine. The film follows his quest for purpose in the final months of his life, exploring deep themes of existentialism, mortality, and the search for meaning.Toshiro Mifune's portrayal of Watanabe is nothing short of extraordinary. Known for his roles in samurai films, Mifune takes on a much quieter, more introspective role here, and he shines in it. His performance captures the inner turmoil of a man who has spent decades in a meaningless job and now must confront the finality of his existence. His transition from a passive, almost robotic character to someone desperately seeking meaning in the face of death is both heartbreaking and redemptive.Kurosawa's direction is subtle but masterful. The pacing of Ikiru is deliberate, and the film doesn't rush to deliver its message. It allows the audience to sit with Watanabe's character as he grapples with his fear of death and his desire to leave behind something of value. The film's minimalist approach works in its favor, giving the audience room to reflect on the themes it presents without being overwhelmed by sentimentality. It's a slow burn, but one that rewards patience with deep emotional resonance.The cinematography is equally effective in conveying the theme of isolation that pervades Watanabe's life. Kurosawa often uses wide shots and stark contrasts to emphasize Watanabe's loneliness and emotional distance from the world around him. The contrast between the dreary, gray bureaucratic offices and the vibrant, warm scenes in Watanabe's search for meaning reinforces the transformation he undergoes.The screenplay is introspective, offering reflections on the futility of bureaucracy and the larger social forces that shape one's life. However, the film is not overly preachy. Instead, it gently nudges the audience to examine their own lives and consider how they are living. There are moments of humor and lightness, especially in the second half of the film, which provides a welcome emotional contrast to the heavier themes of death and legacy. The story, while focused on one man's existential crisis, ultimately becomes a universal meditation on how we choose to spend our time on earth.The supporting characters also play crucial roles in the story, particularly the young woman, Toyo, who helps Watanabe achieve a sense of purpose. Their relationship, built on mutual respect and shared humanity, provides a sense of hope and warmth in an otherwise somber narrative. Toyo represents the potential for change, the possibility of making a difference in the world, even if that difference is small and seemingly insignificant in the grand scheme of things.The music, composed by Fumio Hayasaka, complements the reflective mood of the film. The score is subtle, never intrusive, but perfectly attuned to the quiet beauty and sadness of Watanabe's journey. It enhances the emotional depth of the film, especially in the pivotal moments when Watanabe finally begins to make peace with his life and death.Ikiru is a film that encourages deep reflection. While it might not have the action or overt drama of other Kurosawa films, its emotional and philosophical weight is unparalleled. It's a movie that asks profound questions about the value of life, the meaning of work, and the legacy we leave behind, without offering easy answers. Kurosawa's direction and Mifune's performance ensure that the film doesn't merely dwell on these questions but also provides a deeply human answer that resonates on a personal level.In conclusion, Ikiru is a meditative, emotional exploration of life and death. Its minimalist approach, powerful performances, and philosophical depth make it a must-watch for anyone seeking a meaningful, introspective film experience. While the pacing might be slow for some, its lasting emotional impact and timeless themes ensure that it remains one of the finest examples of cinema ever made."

angelkennedy-45185,"Nov 15, 2024",8/10,"Watching ""Ikiru"" was an experience that transcended mere film; it felt like a profound journey into the essence of what it means to truly live. As I settled in, I was initially caught off guard by the absence of the samurai action I had come to expect from Akira Kurosawa. Instead, I was greeted by the mundane existence of Kanji Watanabe, a man who has spent decades as a cog in the bureaucratic machine, his life defined by monotony and indifference.The film's emotional weight hit me hard as Watanabe receives the devastating news of his terminal cancer diagnosis. I felt a visceral connection to his plight, the realization that he had been living a life devoid of purpose resonated deeply within me. The transformation that follows is nothing short of remarkable. Watching him grapple with his mortality, I found myself reflecting on my own life choices and the moments I have let slip away in the pursuit of the mundane.There were moments of levity, too, particularly in his interactions with the young office worker, which oscillated between warmth and heartbreaking distance. The scene where he attempts to confide in his son, only to be met with resentment, struck a chord that echoed long after the credits rolled. It was a poignant reminder of the emotional costs of years spent in emotional isolation.Kurosawa's direction is masterful, capturing the stark contrast between Watanabe's dreary office life and the vibrant moments he seeks in his final days. The imagery, particularly the iconic shot of Watanabe on the swing, encapsulates a bittersweet beauty that lingers in my mind. The film is not just a critique of bureaucracy but a celebration of the human spirit's capacity for change, even in the face of impending doom.""Ikiru"" left me in tears, not just for Watanabe's lost opportunities, but for the universal truth it conveys: life is fleeting, and it is our responsibility to imbue it with meaning. This film is a timeless reminder to seize the day, to find joy in the little things, and to leave a legacy that matters. It's a cinematic experience that will stay with me for years to come, urging me to live with intention and purpose."
Gymnopedies,"Jan 14, 2025",9/10,"At its very core 'Ikiru' is a simple story, albeit an extremely thought-provoking and potent tale - that we can all learn from. We follow Kanji Watanabe (played by Takashi Shimura) a bureaucrat who desperately tries to find some meaning in his life after he discovers that he has terminal cancer. Ikiru is a tragic Japanese film directed by the legendary Akira Kurosawa, and which the screenplay was loosely inspired by Leo Tolstoy's 1886 novel ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich.""While Kurosawa is perhaps better known for his action films, Ikiru could very well be considered his best. The protagonist, Kanji Watanabe, never seems like a pathetic old man, but rather one of us. As you would expect from a film with such a narrative the film explores themes such as learning how to live, mortality, and family life. Like I said, Ikiru never strays into the mawkish, but rather maintains a dramatic tone throughout.Ikiru is an extremely well-acted and deeply moving tale about a man that is forced to face his own mortality. What I found from watching Ikiru is that the older I get, the more I appreciate it, the more it means to me. It is rightly revered as one of the most human films that you will see, and that is most certainly an accurate description because it broaches some of the most salient and precious lessens of life."
panag-parask,"Sep 22, 2015",9/10,"I have to admit. The second I finished this movie, I thought "" I liked it. But I didn't love it."" So, I gave it a 7. After that, I caught myself thinking about it for the next few weeks. I thought, well, I was wrong so I came back and gave it an 8. After many months I decided to watch it again, just cause I liked it that much. The second I finished it for the second time I thought that this movie is an absolute masterpiece.I can understand why some people don't like this movie. It's slow paced. But Kurosawa does something that quite a few directors can do. Every shot has a beginning, middle and an end. Every character just feels alive, different. Εvery action has an underlying meaning and above all, Takashi Shimura acting is superb!I don't want to go into much detail about the movie itself. The less you know the better. It's one of this movies that does an excellent job at making you feel empathy and understand the motives behind the protagonists actions and emotions. Simply.. Beautiful!"
williambass-64326,"Aug 15, 2023",10/10,"Staring death in the face is like a cold wind that blows all the unimportant away. The most painful regrets are those where little or nothing is left.Ikiru follows one man's journey out of that pit, grasping here and there in despair not knowing what to do. The scene where the protagonist meets the stranger in the bar is perhaps the most powerful portrayal of human suffering, and compassion, in the history of film.There is a part of the film which many will find rather tedious and slow. I believe this is the point. It is pointlessness ad neuseam all made more pathetic by its setting.There are movies that are bad, then good, very good, and excellent. Ikiru goes beyond the excellent and represents the highest form of cinema."

Jithindurden,"Nov 10, 2017",9/10,The plot of Ikiru has been reiterated in countless forms in film industries all over the world but none has touched me like this one. The last 45 minutes begins with a sudden change in focus on the storytelling yet it was the most intriguing part for me. It was a bit distant from the rest when it began but then it turned out to be the most exquisite part. Some of the shots from the last 20 minutes might be some of the most iconic shots I've ever seen. The only negative if any is the unnecessary narration but its scarce presence helped to ignore it anyway.

One of the few movies one wants to watch again and again. The intense emotions in multiple colors brilliantly described in white and black. The story telling in slow tempo, yes 70 years old, but viewer has no chance to be distracted. It is astonishing to see Kuorosawa just 42 years old by then, could capture and describe the despair of end of life. This movie may have influenced many people to make sense out of their routine. Yes, life is short, let's fall in love girls as long as lips are red.."
YasenMarinov,"Nov 19, 2025",10/10,"""I can't afford to hate people. I haven't got that kind of time.""Akira Kurosawa can craft epic stories of heroism and honor, but he can also convey the same depth and magnitude in a story about something as ordinary as a person's life. ""Ikiru"" is a powerful and very touching movie, a meditation on life, death, purpose, happiness, and legacy.The first half is somewhat difficult to watch. The main character, Kurasawa, goes through the pain of realizing he only has several months left to live. He has to admit to himself that he has wasted his whole life. He has to come to terms with himself and stop blaming others for his current state and the losses in his life. He is alone and empty, and even the spark that is ignited somewhere deep in him doesn't immediately give him hope and something to live for.His quest to find meaning leads him to start appreciating the pleasures of life and attempt to discover how he can become happy and carefree, just for one day. But it's not enough, and deep down he feels it in his gut. And then, everything changes in the most memorable way.It's that unforgettable scene where he walks down the stairs. A bunch of kids at the top are singing ""Happy birthday"" and looking at him; then he moves away from the camera, and a girl comes up the stairs, revealing that she's the one they are singing to. But in fact, it's he who is truly born at that moment and has a metaphorical last birthday. This is the moment he realizes that he shouldn't pursue merely enjoying the pleasures of life while he still can; instead, he must dedicate what time he has left to creating something for others. And that will become his legacy.At that point, the movie changes and shifts to a different story. I like how some 2-3 minutes after Watanabe's metaphorical rebirth comes his death and funeral. Kurasawa skips the whole 5 months of his character's new life and goes straight to the aftermath, to his legacy. The funeral is just a masterclass in storytelling, dialogue, and cinematography. I won't say more because words won't be enough.However, I feel obliged to mention how powerful the flashbacks are and how the tension and dynamics between all the present characters slowly but surely shift. Watanabe became a hero for everyone and inspired change, which is something so rare and precious. In the flashbacks, you can see he's barely standing on his feet, he's barely able to talk; he's probably going through hell, but he doesn't give up the fight and keeps pursuing his goal.I haven't cried at a movie since Return of the King. However, the ending, and especially the scene with the swing, moved me in a way that no other movie has. The last two scenes are especially powerful, providing even more depth to the movie's themes and messages. It becomes clear that no matter how moved everyone might be from one act of good (no matter how big), the world won't change, the system won't change, and even people won't necessarily change. In the end, it's a personal fight, and it's all up to you to decide if you really want to make something with your life.However, despite this negativity, there is still light and hope for the future, because every good deed is important and holds significance. Even if it won't change the world, it might change someone's world. And that's the beauty of it."
Vartiainen,"Dec 27, 2017",8/10,"So far I've mostly seen samurai period pieces from Akira Kurosawa. And the few non-period pieces I have seen, I have not particularly liked. They have been too slow, too Japanese in themes, for me to get into them. Until today.And don't get me wrong, Ikiru is very Japanese in themes, but those themes happen to be pretty universal. That of the meaning of life and why we live in the first place. Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is a middle-aged bureaucrat, who has dedicated his entire life to the wheels and cogs of paperwork. Endless paperwork, with no clear goal or even function. Just paperwork. But then he learns that he's about to die of cancer. And this monumental discovery finally jolts him awake and forces him to take a look at what he has accomplished in his life. He doesn't like what he sees.Ikiru's strength is the same that has always been Kurosawa's forte. A really strong central character and a strong theme that is explored through him. And Watanabe just might be one of Kurosawa's best. Through him we explore Japanese society and work culture with quite a critical eye, but the themes and problems themselves are universal. Why do we live? On our deathbeds, can we say we wouldn't have done anything differently? Few of us can, I'd claim.Ikiru is a slow movie. It is also deep, provoking and quite sad. Not for everyone, but for fans of Kurosawa and great themes in general, it is quite worth it."
eddie_baggins,"Dec 13, 2020",10/10,"Most well known and deservingly so for his work in the samurai film landscape, visionary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa was clearly just as at home directing humanly realistic and relatable dramas as he was spectacle and scope with his touching and memorable Ikiru a showcase for the versatility the esteemed artist had.Regarded by its creator as a favourite of his works, Ikiru is Kurosawa at his most restrained as he examines the last few months in the life of dying government bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe (frequent Kurosawa collaborator Takashi Shimura) who upon discovery that he has terminal cancer and only a short time to live, sets out to find meaning in a life he is unhappy with upon reflection of wasted years and missed opportunities.Translated in English to simply mean ""To Live"", Ikiru is all about its title as Watanabe tries a life full of revelry and excess, a potential close friendship with a female colleague far younger than he and most importantly fulfilment in his job that could see long lasting changes and a legacy to his works that for the most part have not been a part of his over 30 years of service to a role he slept walked through.It's a situation we as humans could all relate to, one's face to face meeting with their own mortality and cause for reflection upon a life one would hope has been well lived and full of love, laughter, friendships and meaning and Kurosawa explores this idea with a deft hand and one full of grace, care and thoughtfulness.Filmed in stunning black and white, with a moving soundtrack and enough memorable scenery to last multiple films (the films iconic playground scene a standout), Ikiru is as strong in the technical department as it is in the narrative components of its intimate yet grand story and despite being nearly 70 years old, age has failed to weary a story that is ageless in its timeless themes and human interactions.It's the type of classic film that excels in every department, from performances of its entire cast, its carefully considered script work and already discussed technical feats, there's barely a wrongly timed step in a film that is moving, funny and memorable and undoubtedly one of Kurosawa's finest moments.Final Say -A key component of Akira Kurosawa's career, Ikiru is a life-affirming tale that has a magic and power rarely found in such human centric dramas. A classic piece of cinema that movie fans from across the world should seek out if they have yet to partake in it.5 games of Pachinko out of 5"

The spiritual definition of life and death, the strong satire of the government, the in-depth analysis of human nature, and the thorough reflection on life are so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. I personally think that this film has reached the highest peak of Kurosawa's movie. I am glad to see such a shocking classic. Shimura Qiao's performance deserves the same high evaluation as Sanchuan.

evanston_dad,"Mar 12, 2024",8/10,"""Ikiru"" is a very moving film from Akira Kurosawa, but it's not one I think I'd ever want to watch again. I generally am very weirded out by stories about people dying of lingering illnesses, especially cancer, so this film made me quite uncomfortable, even if the conclusion it reaches is one I agree with, which is that we're all living on borrowed time and so we should be very frugal with it and selective about how we want to spend it.The film ""Living"" with Bill Nighy was an updated version of this story, but needless to say it's a pale imitation of Kurosawa's original. The best part of the original version isn't even in the remake -- an extended scene set at the wake of the main character where everyone tries to justify their own lack of charity and selflessness in the face of someone who was an example of both.Grade: A."
EasonVonn,"Feb 16, 2024",10/10,"A brush with Akira Kurosawa's deep subject matter of life and death. The actual look and feel has a bit of Antonioni's Eclipsed vibe to it, eaten away by modern society. Of course the difference with Eclipse is that Lust for Life is from a world where Kurosawa overdoes Eclipse (a remake of Noryo Inu) and then looks for some life in it to spark an exploration of life.In the stage with the novelist when the rhythm is very precise, perfect illustration of Kurosawa's moving image, the end is quite a kind of Hitchcock-style, in front of the dead calmly analyze, this should also be Kurosawa Ming a few so a lot of use of flashback clips of the work, although not as silky smooth as Bergman's, but such a hard to cut quite a kind of experimental aesthetics, bureaucratic gestures are very distasteful, but is also considered satirical to the point of, a full of a hole in Japanese society. A full-on insight into Japanese society."
deepakdavid-71727,"Sep 6, 2025",9/10,Considered one of Kurosawa's best works for a reason. It's a simple premise about an elderly government bureaucrat realising he only has a short time to live. The film delves into lives deeper meanings and questions the audience on what living truly is. It does have a fair amount of humour as well just to add some levity to the way the story unfolds.This is a must watch for any cinephile or lovers of slice of life movies.

JohnDeSando,"Jan 27, 2023",N/A,"""But at my back I always hear/Time's winged chariot hurrying near."" Andrew MarvelLiving is the most delicate film of the last year, and Bill Nighy's understated performance as a terminally-ill bureaucratic Brit, Mr. Williams, is achingly memorable. (Subtle sentiment enough to swamp a whale or ban a banshee, I say! ) This adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's legendary 1952 Ikiru does the master justice, both worlds, Japan and Britain, characteristically reserved and private.Having just learned of his impending death from cancer, uptight London civil servant Williams at first goes the way any of us might such as seaside penny arcades and striptease shows. However, he slowly steps into the role of caring human being, starting by taking a young bucktoothed office worker, Margaret Harris (Sex Education's Aimee Lou Wood), to lunch without any other agenda than to begin opening up. He is leaving his ""nowhere man"" behind.The scenes between them, with her never quite sure if this can be the same tightly-bound boss she's always known and an openness that begs him to watch how life is to be lived. Nighy plays it right by lacking flamboyance but rather as if he were just quietly emerging into life as it should be lived-caring without an agenda. In some ways, he's Tom Hanks' Otto but just across the pond with a little emotional help from Dvorak and Vaughn Williams.While his close-knit bureaucratic colleagues continue to be like their bowler hats--rigid and lacking color, Williams already has a hip new hat along with his new life of meaning. The civil servants remain rigid, except for the new worker, Peter Wakeling (Alex Sharp), young and quiet but smiling and charming, meant by prize-winning writer Kazuo Ishiguro (and before him, of course, Kurosawa) to be the new, softer, more romantic Williams.One of the virtues of this sober take on end of days is to go gently, not drunkenly, and leave no mountains of office folders, but a legacy that cares for children at play, not adults playing at life. When he files into the ""in basket"" the plaintiff request from three ladies to rehab a playground, he is promoting the reserve he needs to let go.Although Brits are often depicted as conservatively stifling romance and even joy in life, Living shows how one bureaucrat broke the mold, even if he had a short time to enjoy a life of love and service. Better living than not at all when you are alive, Living warns us.""I took to looking around myself a little."" Mr. Williams."
