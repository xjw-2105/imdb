Stibbert,"Nov 12, 2005",8/10,"Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It's down to earth and believable.Jerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don't exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.The Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It's a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don't even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they're reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.The actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.The cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.The score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It's moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It's used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.Fargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it's well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!"
paul2001sw-1,"Apr 13, 2005",7/10,"The Coen brothers' 'Fargo' is nearly a great film: a beautifully shot, blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention of the genre. This is a film where the remote mid-western city of Minneapolis plays the same role as New York in a normal crime story, a hub of civilisation and vice; where the hero is a woman (and a heavily pregnant, happily married woman at that); and the chief villain a car salesman of absolutely no slickness whatsoever. In a final irony, most of the action doesn't even take place in Fargo, but in the even more obscure town of Brainerd. Yet I found it hard to love this film. At brief moments (in depicting the relationship of policewoman Marge, played superbly by Frances McDormaid, and her husband), it feels astonishingly tender, yet at others, it feels as if it is simply making fun of the strange folks from outer America with the wacky accents and absurdly stoical demeanour. And the combination of deadpan acting and frankly silly plot excess sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Above all else, perhaps, 'Fargo' lacks a beating heart: while nearly moving, and nearly funny, there's a part of this film that refuses to commit itself, that prefers to hold back and mock not just its subjects, but also the idea that a film should take itself seriously. The Coens are widely celebrated as among the best film-makers of our age, but watching their films, I usually end up wondering whether irony is not a slightly over-rated virtue. Fargo looks lovely, and weird, and has a wry outlook all of it's own; but it won't make you laugh out loud, or cry. If it wasn't called a masterpiece I might almost like it."
aharmon,"Apr 2, 2001",N/A,"""What'd this guy look like anyway?""  ""Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.""  ""Uh-huh. In what way?""  ""Just a general way.""  In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness  discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal  pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan  Coen's finest film.  Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as  Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski.  But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama  more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have  a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that  goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry  Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo  at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie  specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation  with Gaear and the wood-chipper.  Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced,  intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward  methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H.  Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful  and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable  manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two  occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and  a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress  doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, ""He's fleeing  the interview!""  Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare  playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con  his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching  Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior,  and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all  the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing  Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife.  If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent  life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a  half this movie has to show you."
ccthemovieman-1,"Nov 24, 2006",10/10,"I didn't see this in the theater but saw it the first week it was out for rental, and have enjoyed it ever since. In fact, I probably enjoy this more each time I view it. It's a sick movie, though, make no mistake about that. However, it holds a strange fascination, probably because of the odd characters.About the story: first, it is NOT a true story as indicated in the movie. That's a lie. It's a fictional kidnapping-turned into murder story with a few bloody scenes, lots of profanity (most of it by Steve Buscemi) and a comedy. Yup, this is pure ""black comedy."" It's dark humor mixed in with a parody about the way the Scandanavian people in the upper Midwest supposedly speak.Both William H. Macy and Frances McDormand have some wonderful facial expressions along with their accents. Those two and Buscemi are the lead characters and all three ""are a trip."" Macy is hilarious; the best character in here, in my opinion. The more I watch this film, the funnier he gets. It's also the best role, I assume, ever for McDormand who was never a star before - or since - this movie. Her character in here, ""Marge Gunderson,"" elevates this movie from just another modern-day sick crime movie, to an original. It's nice to see a wonderful husband-wife relationship, too, as is shown here with her and husband ""Norm"" (John Lynch).You have this clean, old-fashioned lady cop (McDormand), a middle-of-the-road bungling car salesman (Macy) and two extreme low-life killers in ""Carl Showalter"" (Buscemi) and ""Gaear Grimsrud"" (Peter Stormare) all combining to make this story a mixture not only of people but genres. Other minor characters are strange, too, led by one of Marge's old high school acquaintances ""Mike Yanagita"" (Steve Park). Add to that some equally-bizarre music (slow violins) and you have this unusual story that brings out the morbid fascination in us viewers.So, I guess what I am saying is this movie truly is an original, the best film the Coen Brothers have ever made and maybe the rest roles ever for the three main actors, McDormand, Macy and Buscemi."
retroman85,"Nov 11, 2004",10/10,"I've always thought Fargo would make a great Shakesperean play; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban England. Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet's, in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seem to like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of the Minnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for its brilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William H Macy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of political correctness (how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how well the music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scored superbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance, notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter ""What's this?"" in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how you interpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay, from start to finish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, a brilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the '90s."
julieshotmail,"Nov 26, 2023",9/10,"Some may argue that this film is too violent. Some may say that this film is offensive to those who live in Minnesota or North Dakota due to the exaggerated accents. Nevertheless, this film is superb in that it has just the right amount of mix between comedy, horror, and police procedural antics. I recommend it because it does flow well, and you get to appreciate the talents and commitment the actors put into this film. Rewatching this in 2023, I have come to appreciate why this has become a cult classic that has spawned its own TV series dating back to 2014, with a season 5 just dropped, paying homage to the movie with neat Easter eggs. If you enjoy the TV series, you'll do yourself a favor with a rewatch of this one."
Muelko,"Jun 17, 2022",6/10,"I didn't really think, about what to expect from this movie, but ehm - it was good, but I don't understand the cult status here. Absolutely not. It has some interesting ideas and some bizarre moments and it's fun and all, but not a single twist or some kind of thick character development - I don't know, wasn't bored, but it is just a mediocre crime thriller with some nice moments here and there, but certainly nothing more. Francia McDormand was very good, and so was Macy and Buscemi and that blonde guy, but I don't really know what to love. I appreciate it, of course I do, it's not a trash movie and the cinematography isn't bad (omg it's Deakins), but 4.2 on Letterboxd? That's quite a lot for this movie. But finally watched it, because I remember I started a watch long ago but didn't watch it so yeah, glad I finally did and - it wasn't excellent. Just a fun little crime movie, nothing more I'm afraid."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Nov 12, 2023",8/10,"Jerry Lundegaard is sick of working for his father in law, sick of his wife, and decides it's time to get rid of his challenging relatives, he employs hitmen, but things don't go according to plan.Fargo is one of those films that didn't finish with time, arguably it gets better with subsequent viewings. Yes it's a thriller, but it's way too comical to be a straight up action thriller, the humour is prevelant throughout, it's a black comedy, and for my money, it's one of the best of them, some of the situations are outrageous.It's almost a little surreal at times, let's be clear, this is not based on any real life events, what it is however is thoroughly entertaining. It will make you want to watch the TV series.I will never tire of hearing the word 'Marge,' and if you're watching for the first time, you'll hear it a lot, you'll also hear some curious accents.Very well acted, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi nailed it for me.I'd have gone crazy at that lake too!8/10."
Bored_Dragon,"Mar 5, 2020",6/10,"This movie ranks in the IMDb top 250 and has won two Oscars out of seven nominations, not to mention its cult status. If I didn't know all this, it would have left me without a special impression. But this way, it left me completely shocked. I honestly wonder who's crazy here. ""Fargo"" won an Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Okay, on paper this story really has great potential. I can also understand William H. Macy's nomination somewhat. But nominations for Best Picture and directing?! Really, WTF?! All the characters in the film, except the cold-blooded sociopath, are portrayed as slightly falling behind in their mental development. Both their actions and how they are portrayed by the cast cause chronic embarrassment transfers throughout the film. Something like that would work in some types of comedy, but with such characters and acting, to call this movie a drama or a thriller ... WTF ?! Directing also has nothing to do with these genres. Drama and tension do not occur even in trace amounts. The story may be a true event, and in reality it was probably a drama and a thriller, but the way it is presented in this movie is totally frivolous. It had the potential for upsetting drama, for a suspenseful thriller, and even for a morbid comedy, but this mix of the Coen brothers looks like a clumsy result of their hesitation to opt for the genre. Watchable, but probably the most overrated movie I saw in years.6/10"
cmkdakota-65369,"Dec 5, 2023",10/10,"This is one of those movies that emotes nostalgia from the viewer....even years later. I score very few movies a perfect 10, but this one is even kiel to Three Billboards over Missouri, also with Frances McDormand rocking her role.The fascination of the personalities, voice and diction of the residence of the northernmost portions of Minnesota, and North Dakota provides a fabulous foundation for this iconic movie.This movie is broken down into various scenes that might give you a moment of disconnect when they start, but they flow perfectly once you realize what is going on.Put very likable people in tragic and murderous situations and you have an almost Shakespearean tragic comedy....and that is hard to emulate."
lestewart,"Sep 6, 2004",7/10,"I saw this film in 2004, long after the Oscar buzz had died down. I suppose it's a victim of its own hype. I enjoyed the film, but it seemed somehow smaller than I expected. Frances McDormand's Oscar-winning performance seems so trivial, seen through the perspective of eight years. The story is okay, though I again wonder about the Oscar the Coens received. (The 1996 Oscars were a somewhat weak field.) I spent most of the movie wondering if people in Minnesota and the Dakotas really talk that way, or is ""Fargo"" as much a travesty of regional accents as most ""southern"" movies are? Overall, the whole film was a nicely filmed, tight little story with apparently overdone regional ironies."
Keyser Soze-12,"Apr 17, 2001",4/10,"Okay, I know I have just made more enemies than I can count.  But, I ask, what is so funny about Fargo?  Really, I never laughed through the whole movie, ever.  I have a really twisted sense of humor, but anything can make me laugh.  I loved O' Brother Where Art Thou.  I loved Happy Gilmore.  I loved Clerks.  I loved Dr. Strangelove.  I loved Blazing Saddles.  So there, I love a very diverse amount of comedies.  But I did not love Fargo.First off, the accents.  People say that these Wisconsin accents are hilarious.  Well, they're not.  I grew up in the South, okay.  I have never met a person with a Wisconsin accent in my life.  But I do see them in movies and on TV a lot.  These are just normal accents.  There is nothing satirical about them.  They aren't that funny.  Get over it.Okay, the plot.  Is it just me or is the plot to this movie mediocre and boring?  It's an average crime movie.  I know crime movies.  That's my forte, you could say.  My favorite movie genre is crime (Pulp fiction, Leon, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Heat, etc...).  But this movie is just an average movie.  The plot is pretty predictable too.  I could have guessed the entire movie from the word go.Now, I will give credit where credit is due.  The movie isn't all bad.  The acting is good.  The dialog is quick and edgy.  The writing is intelligent. And the direction is sharp and nice.  But there is nothing funny, groundbreaking, or remotely interesting about this movie.Okay, one last gripe.  If you haven't seen the movie, avert thy eyes, because the ending is about to be told.  Okay, you still here?  Good, I warned you.The wood chipper scene is one of the most famous scenes in the history of movies, or so it has become.  Honestly, I see nothing funny about it.  It's not that I'm against throwing people into wood chippers.  I liked Evil Dead 2.  Gore doesn't bother me.  But what is so damn funny about throwing a human corpse into a wood chipper?  It makes sense to me.  If you wanted to dispose of a body and a wood chipper is near by, well hey! IDEA!  THROW IT IN!  But is it funny?  Not really.  Is it gory? No.  Is it bad?  No.  But is it deserving of being called one of the greatest scenes ever?  HELL NO!I am really trying to understand people's love of this movie.  I wasn't the biggest fan of The Blues Brothers, but I understand why people love it. Fargo isn't funny, nor is it very interesting.  The acting is the only thing that kept me interested.  I love W.H. Macy.  All the actors and actresses are good in this movie.  But is this movie the work of genus that people make it out to be?  No, ohhhhhhhhhh God no.In conclusion: This movie is an ""okay"" movie.  There's nothing bad about it, but it isn't great.  I hate it when people make movies out to be better than they really are.  I found The Untouchables, The Blues Brothers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Being John Malkovic, and Fargo to all be overrated movies.  They're not bad, they're just not great, or even that good either. (ESPECIALLY CROUCHING TIGER!)  People, please join me in the crusade to bring the truth out and bring down the overrated movies!My rating: 5/10PS:  Go ahead, send the hate mail.  I welcome it."
tfrizzell,"Jun 25, 2000",N/A,"With all the sorry films these days it is good to see a movie as funny, wicked, dramatic, and utterly demented as ""Fargo"".  It's one of those films that you just have to see.  William H. Macy gives an Oscar-nominated performance as a car salesman who hires two thugs (one a know-it-all-know-nothing and the other a demented psychopath) to kidnap his wife so that he can keep half the ransom from her well-off father. Needless to say nothing goes right and Brainerd sheriff Frances McDormand (in an Oscar-winning role) comes in to save the day.  I won't give anything away because the material is too good to tell those who haven't seen this inventive film.  ""Fargo"" was ranked on the 100 Greatest Films list in 1996 and it was well-deserved.  In this age of by-the-numbers film making, this film was a refreshing flashback to the risk-taking style that made the 1970s such a great decade for movies.  5 stars out of 5."
Ceetee,"Aug 5, 1998",9/10,"With no major stars or well-known names, the actors outshine many more familiar personages.  The story is well thought out.  The criminals don't try to ingratiate themselves with the audience which adds to its reality.  The acting is most convincing and the writing is excellent.  Even the cold of a North Dakota winter comes across.  Every film course should make use of this movie to demonstrate how to make a very good film without relying on a bottomless budget."
mccartnist_lennonist,"Mar 2, 2005",10/10,"If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it. It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness. At times scary (not in the horror movie sense) and quite rich in dark humour, this is one of those movies that gives you a weird felling inside even an hour after its over. The music is quite appropriate and unlike Scarface, is timeless. The camera work is usually quite basic but whoever directed the photography had the enjoyable habit of giving us interestingly artistic segways between scenes. This is the first film so far that I've given a 10 out of 10. I was going to give it a 9, but I couldn't think of a reason to take any points from perfect."

However, this quickly falls apart when his father-in-law , Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell) , meddles into the twisted happenings insisting on delivering himself and after three killings and the persistent work of chirpy but efficient police chief, the six-months pregnant Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormad) who's very much more cunning than her staff and is soon on the trail of the truth . A homespun murder story !. Small town !. Big crime !. Dead cold !. A lot can happen in the middle of nowhere !. An ordinary place, an extraordinary thriller !.A riveting mixture of black comedy , drama , violence , gore , giggles , and some very outlandish as well as excessive dialog , not without its dull patches . While this may seem like plot-a-plenty , it's mainly a showcase for the Cohen brothers' unique texturing of style and quirky but deep roles . Includes the Cohen's pithy dialogue , it looks and sounds marvellous . The film may not have the enigmatic elegance or emotional resonance of Barton Fink or Blood Simple but it is still a prime example of the Cohen's effortless brand of stylistic and storytelling brilliance . Starred by some rare characters suffering several Coanesque adventures ; what the protagonists encounter along the way are a number of surprising situations and off-the-wall characters that , when all is said and done , seem like just that individual incidents that never really add up to a whole plot . Stars the Oscarized Frances MacDormand giving a very likable acting as the headstrong officer of the law , while Steve Buscemi , Peter Stormare are two botcher evil-tempered , short-fused gunmen and William H. Macy as the desperate husband. Followed by Fargo TV series (2014) , it is one of the best TV surprises of the last years by co-opting the tone of the Coen Brothers' classic film, but still adding a unique stamp on the material .Thanks to Roger Deakin's gleaming camerawork the film expand a colorful and luminous cinematography. As well as sensitive and agreeable musical score by Carter Burwell , Coen's regular . This fun and entertainining motion picture was well written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen . They have shared these duties on all of their films, but Joel has always been listed as director and Ethan as producer . The first Coen brothers film where both he and brother Ethan Coen are given directing and producing credits was Ladykillers (2004). Both of whom are part of the prestigious group of individuals to have won Oscars for writing , directing and producing in the same year, for the film No Country for Old Men (2007).

moonspinner55,"Jul 8, 2001",6/10,"Minnesota car-dealer arranges to have his wife kidnapped in order to get his hands on his father-in-law's money, but the plan goes awry. Another blood-soaked black comedy from the Coen Brothers (Joel directed, and he and Ethan wrote the screenplay from a ""true story"", which won them Oscars). Frances McDormand, William H. Macy (in a star-making performance) and nearly everyone else in the cast give funny, credible and memorable performances, but the film itself is wobbly (purposefully, yet often irritatingly so), padded, and at times brutal--but nearly always undermined by a quasi-comedic tone which is both tiresome and tasteless. Despite strong scenes, it is over-scaled and cut very broadly, and cannot escape the Coens' penchant for self-reverence. **1/2 from ****"
miloterrabuca,"Nov 19, 2023",9/10,"Fargo is an interesting film. While it may not be for everyone it's got a unique charm that is difficult to dislike. All of the events (even the darker elements of the film) are almost satirical in nature. The characters all act in this funny, uncanny, almost awkward manner, and my wife and I couldn't help but find ourselves giggling and cracking up at several points as the events of the story transpired. The actors all do a fantastic job portraying their roles, especially Frances McDormand as one of cinema's most unexpected protagonists, the impossible to hate, Margie Gunderson. Only the Coen Brothers could pull off making an 8 months pregnant police detective the protagonist of a film and it work so well. If you're looking for something different, give it a shot."
akshatmahajan,"Oct 30, 2022",6/10,"Black comedy genre is not my cup of tea but then also I gave this movie a try. I liked the movie from start till end but I don't know why I was unable to connect with the characters. The movie ended and I was like ""so it's over?"". The story was simple and execution was also good but something felt incomplete. Some of the side stories and scenes were unnecessary and I was unable to understand why those scenes were even added. Other than that, the direction, screenplay were simple and clean.Overall, it was a good and simple black comedy drama which I don't think will excite anyone except black comedy fans."
ConjureFlameAtronach,"Jan 6, 2025",9/10,"This was unbeliavably fun. I expected some kind of mystery or twist so i was ready to not like it, there's some exceptions but usually i dont like movies that rely on the plot twisting too much. They feel like the director doesn't do anything for 2 hours and then it just hits you and you have to act all surprised, pretend it's the greatest movie ever made. I enjoy movies that just pick up and go without any twists. I could not predict a single scene of this movie. It went in the completely opposite direction from my predictions. This is definetly a classic and one of the Coen's best movies. A really nice crime thriller that you can watch over and over again!"
Leofwine_draca,"Jul 11, 2016",10/10,"The Coen brothers can always be guaranteed to deliver a quirky, diverting, off-key movie experience, and FARGO remains their most successful movie to date; a story of small-town life, dead cold temperatures, and a bloody crime wave. As with the majority – if not all – of their films, it's a densely-plotted, intelligently-scripted story, with a cold grasp on reality throughout but nevertheless some absurd situations to enjoy.Things begin small and gradually build up to a blood-spattered climax, propelled by tons of originality and irregularity which propels this past most similar genre fare. Frances McDormand deservedly got an Oscar for her excellent performance as the pregnant cop, but William H. Macy is equally good as the nervous car salesman whose life spirals out of control. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are also brilliant as the two psychotic criminals who begin by kidnapping and end in  well I'll leave it for you to find out. In parts touching, warm, funny, frightening and shocking, FARGO is an example of the crime thriller at its best."
jotix100,"Jan 31, 2006",10/10,"Joel Coen the director of ""Fargo"", proves he is one of our best directors with this tale of deception and murder told in a style that takes humorous turns in the action. ""Fargo"" is one of the best American films of the nineties. Joel Coen working together with his brother, Ethan, have made pictures that will be viewed as classics, as time will tell. Their movies are always an excellent way to spend some time because they always manage to deliver, even in films that aren't popular with the public.A lot of what makes this film work is the amazing casting feat the Coen brothers achieved in giving Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, two of our best film actors, prominent presence in it. The Marge Gunderson of Ms. McDormand is one of the best creations the Coen brothers have produced. The same can be said of William H. Macy's take on the pathetic Jerry Lundergaard, the idiotic man who sets things in motion in the film. Ms. McDormand and Mr. Macy have only one scene together, yet one wouldn't even think about other actors playing these roles.The supporting cast of ""Fargo"" is a joy to watch. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make two of the most enjoyable bad guys in memory. These two scum bags are a joke. Anyone in his right mind wouldn't entrust either Carl or Gaer for a hit job. John Carroll Lynch plays Norm, the stoic man who is married to Marge. Harve Presnell is good as Wade Gustafson.The atmosphere created by the Coens work well. We are constantly reminded of the deep winter seasons of the area where the action takes place. They have given their characters a local flavor and even to hear them talk would take us to that region of the country.""Fargo"" is a joy to watch thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen."
george.schmidt,"Mar 13, 2003",N/A,"FARGO (1996) **** Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Harve Presnell, Peter Stormare.  Dark comic undertones and excellent character actor performances dominate this richly macabre crime story gone awry flick by the Coen brothers(Joel and Ethan) involving pathetic used car salesman Macy so hard up for money and respect (not necessarily in that order) that he hires a pair of dim-witted thugs to kidnap his wife for ransom from his father-in-law's vast wealth in a plot-line that unravels with nice little twists and snags.  McDormand (Best Actress) is perfect as a pregnant Midwestern sheriff on the case with a no-nonsense and homespun effect with her tactics of crime solving.  Great cinematography by Roger A.

billpoet,"Aug 14, 2005",10/10,"Nobody seems to know that Fargo is first and foremost a beautiful and very simple love story about two ordinary rural small town American people and secondly a superbly acted crime murder mayhem movie, probably the best that has ever been filmed. Every character is genuine, believable, and Home, not Hollywood, spun. The suspense rolls in and out like a San Francisco fog. The side shows that are built in are amazing (sheriff's conversation at a bar with old acquaintance - stamp conversations - breakfast makings). The whole film is an American Shakesphere. I actually know frequent moviegoers who have not seen Fargo (and Sling Blade and Shine). I feel a special sorrow for them. Back to Fargo, every time I watch it I don't want it to ever end. I even sometimes find myself wishfully thinking I could move up there, it's a Lake Wobegone, and then the movie would never end. Fargo is as close to capturing and portraying real life as a director and bunch of actors can get. I wish IMDb had a just one time eleven so I could crown it emperor above all."
mariushms,"Feb 2, 2025",7/10,"A planned kidnapping in snowy and somewhat sleepy Minnesota goes wrong. Jerry Lundegaard (William Macy), Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) and Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) are all three fantastic. All the characters exude a comedy and strangeness that you won't find in any other film. In a world where good (Marge Gunderson) and evil (Carl Showalter) can be clearly separated, the naive Jerry Lundegaard finds himself helplessly caught in the middle of the two forces.Despite everything, the film falls victim to its extreme hype. A good story, set against a great backdrop with unintentionally funny characters - but that's all it is for me."
jte6451,"Feb 6, 2019",10/10,"""There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don'tcha know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Well, I just don't understand it."" - Marge GundersonPure genius. Those two words are what best describes Coen Brothers' Fargo. I saw this for the first time, and, I'm happy to say, it ranks up there with The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men as one of the Coen's best films with its dark and quirky writing, its gorgeous cinematography, a solid performance from much of the cast, and its mixture of black comedy, violence, and satire that only the Coen Brothers can pull off.This dark and quirky story begins with Jerry Lundegaard, a down-on-his-luck car salesman who is hard up for money to finance for his family. So, he hires two crooks to kidnap his wife so he can extort a ransom from his father-in-law. The plan seems to be going well, until one minor incident leads to three roadside murders and the plan slowly starts falling apart. In the center of all this craziness is Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief who is investigating the murders and she starts to realize that the murders are connected to Jerry's ill-thought out plan.Despite opening with a disclaimer that this ""based on a true story"", it's not really based on a true story, although it was loosely based on a real life case. But it perfectly sets the tone to the absurdity that is about to unfold. What the Coen Brothers do best is their perfect blend of dark humor, satire, and excessive violence and execute it in a flawless manner. You can't help but to laugh at all of the misfortunes that is happening to the characters, like Carl's short-tempered outbursts when something goes wrong or when Jerry is on the verge of having a nervous breakdown.I must say that I have to give huge props to the cinematography, courtesy of Roger Deakins. It gives it a seemly peaceful feeling of the snowy Minnesota countryside and the music gives it an old time folk feel that just fits perfectly to the setting. One of my favorite shots is that overhead shot of Jerry walking to his car in the snow-covered parking lot.The performances from the film's star-studded cast are all excellent. From William H. Macy as the timid Jerry, to Steve Buscemi as the loud, trash talking Carl Showalter, to even Peter Stormare as the emotionless and mostly mute Gaear Grimsrud. But the best of the cast is Francis McDormand as Marge. She's the only character out of all of them that is pleasant, whereas some of them, mainly the crooks, are crazy. She is seen as having a happy and modest life, has a loving and supporting husband, is witty, and, despite the situation that she's in and her life as a police chief, she still maintains her upbeat and ""Minnesota Nice"" attitude.Overall, Fargo is a genuine classic that manages to rank up to masterpiece-level of quality. Certainly, one of the Coen Brothers' best films.Final Verdict: 10/10 with the Epic Seal of Awesomeness"
exzanya,"Dec 11, 2020",7/10,"I really appreciate the stripped-back style and the characters are wonderfully unique, but this film unironically left me a bit cold, and I don't find the Coen style of quasi-quirky humour all that funny, i.e Hudsucker Proxy. But still a relatively fun and decent feature"
Dr_J,"Jun 27, 2003",1/10,"I can only classify this film as a missed opportunity. While it did have a good storyline, worthy of a film noir, and some very good performances, especially by William H. Macy (you can almost see him crumbling under the weight of not just his crimes, but his cover-ups as well), it is tainted by the Coen brothers' directorial style.  What made it intolerable for me was the amount of ""quirkiness"" that was injected into every single character, scene, and situation. Taken alone, each little quirk is not a big deal, but after so many of them, one after another, it just gets too much to stomach.Some examples...The title: The movie takes place mostly in Minneapolis (which isn't quirky enough -- that's where the Mary Tyler Moore Show took place, after all), and Brainerd (and nobody would go see a movie called ""Brainerd""). About 5 minutes of screen time were set in Fargo, and Fargo has a quirky-enough sound.""True"" story: Just because a story is true, does that make it a better story? There is both good and bad fiction and non-fiction. So, what is gained by lying about whether a story is true or not? Quirkiness! See, if you believe this story is true, then all this quirkiness must be true too!Names: Character names were given as Grimsrud, Lundegaard, Showalter and Gunderson. Apparently, Scandinavian-sounding names (especially with a double-a) are much quirkier than Pryce, Lopez, Rossi and Sheppard.The weather: The snow and the cold serve no purpose but to make the characters put on parkas and snow boots, which make them look quirky. For instance, when the policeman was talking with the man shoveling his driveway, and had to put his hood up so far you couldn't see his face. Quirky! However, anyone who lives in a cold climate knows that when the sky is that grey and the snow is as wet as the stuff he was shoveling, it isn't all that cold...Accents: Whether or not people actually talk ""like that"", what's the point of everyone talking like some country bumpkin, even the ones in the fairly large city of Minneapolis? Accents: quirky. No accents: not quirky.Pregnancy: Apart from making the lead character wobble when she walked, and to give her a convenient excuse to throw up every once in a while, what exactly was the point of making the police chief pregnant? Ah yes, another quirk.The old friend: A cop meeting an old high school flame at a bar. Sounds kinda dull, right? Well, let's quirk it up a bit. Make the cop a woman -- no, wait: a pregnant woman. Make the guy Oriental. Make it totally unnecessary to the plot. Now we're talkin' quirky!By the time we get to the end, we're almost surprised that Macy's character sold plain old GM cars instead of Austin Minis or VW Beetles. The whole thing feels like the directors had no confidence in the subject matter, so they slathered on layer after layer of quirks in the hope the audience wouldn't notice.In the end, it just becomes an exercise in frustration, as a movie that had everything going for it just turns you off after one wink and a poke in the ribs too many."
NEFARlOUS,"Oct 20, 1998",10/10,"Fargo is an excellent film, not least because of the characters portrayed within it. (Special mention obviously going to Francis McDortmund as Marge Gundersson) It is unmistakeably a Coen brother's film - both weird and wonderful. Unfortunately it fell victim to its own success. A lot of people seem to have gone to the cinema expecting it to be Pulp Fiction. They were predictably disappointed. For those of us already Fans of the brothers work or who went in with an open mind, this film was wonderful - from the afore-mentioned characterisations to the bleak landscapes to the town (and accent..) itself. It is Blood Simple all over again, but polished to a gleaming shineDan Marcus"
thejdrage,"Jul 22, 2022",10/10,This is a slow burn and raw film about some odd folk in the a state that has few people and a ton of snow and cold in the winter.The cast is nothing short of perfect. Same with the script and filming.It's one that I watch again and again and again. Who doesn't?
jmholmes-73727,"Apr 27, 2019",10/10,"The eternal conflict between good and evil is played out here against the backdrop of a bitter cold American landscape. A group of quirky, ruthless criminals eventually find themselves pursued by a very pregnant cop and her unassuming colleagues. With the Coen brothers at the helm, the audience gets equal doses of humor and violence - often simultaneously - and finally feels awestruck by the simple goodness of Marge and her sweet-tempered husband. This is the movie that should have won the Oscar in '97 but lost to The English Patient which had lots of snob appeal, the one thing Fargo lacked - for sure. It would take years for the Academy to make up for their error by awarding the statuette to the Coen's No Country For Old Men, one of the rare times when the best picture winner actually WAS the year's best picture. Fargo May have lost that year, but one thing it did win was the gratitude of many film-goers for the gift of a wonderfully entertaining crime movie."
almafuerte-1,"Sep 12, 2010",N/A,"I have written a few reviews on IMDb, and this is the first time I feel compelled to write a negative one.8.4 IMDb score. Really?Just don't watch this movie. You are not getting those 90 minutes back, and you will really retreat it.Steve Buscemi is awesome as usual, but otherwise the movie just falls apart.The movie is slow, boring, and it makes no sense whatsoever. I understand it's based on a real story, but it's been adapted poorly (or not adapted at all). The side stories add nothing to the main plot (if there is such a thing in this film), and they are added in such a way that make them look like editing mistakes. It actually looks like they mixed their reels and just pasted things from other films.Besides that, there is no conflict. Just a lot of characters that are truly stupid, make all kind of mistakes, and most end up dead or imprisoned.(warning, spoilers ahead)There are several clearly connected crimes. So the investigator, who is a colorless boring character, just plays it exactly by the book and finds the killers immediately. There is just no story. She goes to the crime scene, everything is bloody obvious, so she just makes a few calls, interviews two people, and finds out she has to go to a nearby city. She goes there, and finds the killers who happen to have the car just parked outside waiting to be found. But before doing that, she stops to meet a creepy Asian guy that she hasn't seen for a long time that wants to bang her, but she says no and goes away.Yes, that is the actual plot.On the side, you see a lot of terminally stupid criminals doing everything wrong, a desperate guy that needs money, but WHY is never explained, so he makes a lot of blatantly obvious mistakes and ends up in jail.I can't even begin to explain why the movie is so bad, because it doesn't even deserve much explanation. There is no conflict, no story, no characters. Just a lot of stupid people that kill each other in the most meaningless ways."
seanmatern,"Apr 10, 2025",7/10,"With such an impressive rating of 8.1/10, (which is super good on IMDB) I had high hopes. Unfortunately the rating set an expectation that was not met during the film. Now, the movie is fine/good. However, when the movie lies to you at the beginning, claiming to be a ""true story"" you can't help but think about that as you're watching this crazy story unfold...until you find out that was all a blatant lie. A lie to help people get more engaged with the story. It feels so disrespectful to just lie to your audience like that's. Here's an idea, do that through storytelling not deception. The accents are unbelievably annoying. I don't care if it's ""authentic"" annoying is annoying. Also, This movie has to have one of the most worthless sub plots I've ever seen. What did the, going out to catch up with some random friend, scene accomplish? It's literally just 10 minutes wasted. Was it to prove she's loyal? We had no reason to believe she wasn't. With a runtime of 1h 30, you'd think you'd want to maximize content. This film worked a lot with nuance, which is fine but it does leave things to be desired. Knowing about how his debts came to be that made him make this drastic decision would've been interesting to see. The ending also feels rushed, with everything getting tied up in 5 minutes. Everything else was fine, the story was interesting and the acting was good. William Macy and Steven Buscemi carry the film. But I'm just appalled that it has an 8.1/10 when this film is just average. If I could I'd give it a 6.5/10."
JackRJosie,"Sep 4, 2023",7/10,"Ya know this is actually quite a hard film to evaluate. It left me feeling unsatisfied and gross. This story is so disastrous and disturbing I cannot believe it's true. This being said this film has a lot going for it, it has a wicked funny sense of dark humor. Although with each scene disaster seems to continually unfurl, it's written so well that each tragedy comes off as amusing. It is a bit reminiscent of pulp fiction. I enjoyed the vibe and humor of this film, it's down my alley. But again, something about it was incredibly unsatisfying and gross.

michaelRokeefe,"Mar 14, 2001",7/10,Ethan and Joel Coen are at it again. Their masterful directing and writing makes this movie unforgettable. Snowy North Dakota sets the mood real well for this maliciously funny story of a botched kidnapping. William Macy is a car salesman in the need of some big bucks. He hires two inept scum buckets (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare)to kidnap his wife thus letting him cash in on a huge ransom to be paid by his father-in-law. Frances McDormand plays a pregnant police chief that takes charge of picking up the pieces of the crime that has come unraveled.Strong violence and foul language go hand in hand with the awkward and hilarious situations. You will certainly be eager to watch this one again immediately.
CineCritic2517,"Oct 22, 2006",1/10,"What is it about these movies from the Coen brothers which appeals to so many people? How can anyone enjoy a slow paced, over-the-top acted borefest with an impressive collection of the most annoying personalities available. Movies which don't seem to go anywhere despite the fact that there is plenty of story to go about. It must be something masochistic which I don't get.Fargo.Surely none of the characters are real life persons but yet I'm not watching a cartoon. None of the dialog seems to be of this Earth, yet I'm not watching a re-enactment of our planet by the inhabitants of Planet KzOrp. So I can only imagine that I'm watching a comedy or at least a movie with an attempt at humor. I mean, what else could it be? It's too preposterous to be a thriller and the characters and the screenplay are too bizarre to make it a drama.I must have been misinformed about this genre of film. Because it has always been my understanding that a comedy had something to do with laughter and amusement. A ridiculous situation could become quite funny, but truly not when the whole movie is ridiculous as well. Same goes for the abominable, hateful characters.If the movie Groundhog Day, arguably amongst the best comedies ever made, was made by the Coen brothers, they would have had the entire village reliving the same day over and over again. And not only that, they would have made every character in that movie be twice as arrogant (Murray), dorky (Larry) and desirable (MacDowell) etc. Its result would be the a monstrosity of a caricature .This movie lacks everything what Groundhog Day makes a good comedy; namely finesse, subtlety and something which makes the viewer not being alienated from the characters and above all, something actually funny going on. (Since when is a kidnapping and a lot of deaths a funny setting? Because Buscemi and Macy are in it?..give me a break, this is hardly Pulp Fiction)For a crime/thriller based on actual fact, it lacks a seriousness and perhaps even respect to the events that have taken place. And the lack of means of time-travel aside, watching Fargo, I was expecting Jeff Bridges to walk onto the set looking for his stupid rug which would have been my longed for queue to press the eject button.So all in all it is not a comedy, it is not a crime/drama/thriller but simply a Coen production. To me it's just an incredibly annoying in-between-genre film which cannot decide what it's supposed to be. Therefore it misses the mark on all counts which make the redeeming qualities of the production (and there are a lot) seem sadly wasted.But it seems to be the minority opinionthe bandwagon ride is so comfy.."
halmt,"Mar 3, 2021",9/10,"Frances McDormand won the Oscar for her lead performance and William H. Macy is perfect in his role as the bumbling protagonist. However, it is the two villains, played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi and Peter Storemare, who define this black comedy from the Coen brothers. Storemare is especially gruesome as the stone cold killer who can stare a hole through you. The only flaw of this movie is a side story about a former high school friend of McDormand's who weakly tries to romance her during her murder investigation. This part of the script could be removed and the movie would actually improve."
SnoopyStyle,"May 18, 2014",9/10,"The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hires two bumbling criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and force his hard father-in-law Wade Gustafson to pay the ransom. Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.This is a great movie. It has its funny moments. It has great visual touches, the quirky characters, and the off-kilter style that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Macy is incredible as the sniffling little weasel. It walks the absurd line between dark and comedy. It has plenty of both. It is simply wonderful."
dtb,"Jul 11, 2005",10/10,"Even people I know who can't stand the Coen Brothers' style *love* this slyly low-key comedy-thriller. Unlike so many ""offbeat"" movies, the quirkiness of FARGO's Oscar-winning screenplay never cancels out its warmth or suspense as the Coens deftly balance clever plotting (*not* really based on a true story, as a poor disturbed Japanese woman found out when she came to the U.S. to dig up the hidden ransom money only to freeze to death trying), engaging characters, scares, poignancy, and the brothers' trademark loopy humor. Darkly hilarious as the kidnappers' bungling is, it renders the violence all the more chilling; one minute you're laughing, the next minute you're cringing over the shock of sympathetic characters meeting swift, bloody deaths. I found myself feeling terribly sorry for poor, sweet, unsuspecting Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud), her vulnerable adolescent son Scotty (Tony Denman), her wealthy father Wade (a delightfully bombastic Harve Presnell), and the other poor slobs unwittingly caught up in car salesman Jerry Lundegaard's plot to get money out of Wade by hiring two thugs to kidnap wife Jean and hold her for ransom, not factoring in the kidnappers' lack of both patience and anger management skills. Nobody plays losers like William H. Macy, and he sure deserved his Best Supporting Actor nomination for playing Jerry, who ought to have his picture in the dictionary next to the word ""inept."" Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are letter-perfect as the loose-cannon wife-snatchers; if Buscemi isn't our generation's Peter Lorre, I don't know who is. But the heart and soul of FARGO is Frances McDormand, who truly earned her Best Actress Oscar here. Looking a bit like a young brunette Carol Burnett, McDormand is beyond superb as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant sheriff (my husband always liked the fact that FARGO doesn't include the nigh-obligatory scene of The Pregnant Heroine Suddenly Going Into Labor At The Worst Possible Time) who runs circles around the bad guys *and* her own well-meaning police force. Courteous and smart, down-to-earth yet slick, her luminous blue-green eyes never missing a thing, McDormand's Marge comes off as a warm Minnesota (is that an oxymoron? :-) female hybrid of Joe Friday and Lt. Columbo (I mean Columbo's stealth smarts, not his sloppiness :-). If you love FARGO, you owe it to yourself to own the deluxe DVD, chock full of way-cool extras too nifty and numerous to go into here -- oh, yah! :-)"
kevin_robbins,"Jun 19, 2021",10/10,"Fargo (1996) is a movie I recently watched again on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a group of kidnappers executing a paid job for a scammer of sorts. As some eccentrically behaved local detectives start investigating a recent murder conducted by the previously referenced kidnappers, the entire kidnapping may get blown up. This move is directed by the amazing Coen Brothers (Raising Arizona) and stars William H. Macy (Shameless), Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs), Kristin Rudrüd (Drop Dead Gorgeous), Frances McDormand (Nomadland) and John Carroll Lynch (Zodiac). The storyline for this is so interesting and contains intricate characters, sub plots and primary plot. There's so much depth in every aspect of this movie you get fascinated by every facet, and both the good and bad guys. Loved how the entire story unfolds and every aspect of this movie is satisfying. I'd score this a 10/10 and is an American all time masterpiece."
Galina_movie_fan,"Oct 6, 2009",10/10,"""Films like ""Fargo"" are why I love the movies"", said Roger Ebert. The film-makers Joel and Ethan Coen, the writing/directing team also known as Two Headed Director, are the reason why I believe in the modern movie-making. To take the story like the one Fargo is based on which has been told so many times before and, I am sure, will be told over and over again, to turn and twist it in the most in-anticipated ways, to create the characters so alive and three dimensional that you believe every word they say and every step they take, to provide them with some of the best quotes and dialogs I've ever had pleasure to hear, to mix dry humor and humanity, to make the film recognizable but uniquely beautiful, dark, dramatic, and funny - that's what Coens achieved in Fargo which has been supposedly the Best film they ever made.All of Coens' fans have their own favorite film but it is hard to disagree that with Fargo, Coens sealed the place in Cinema Hall of Fame. Fargo is a movie of many dimensions. As many of Coens' films, it centers on a botched crime that includes kidnapping gone terribly wrong. Many viewers see it as a dark comical crime/mystery thriller which it is but it is much more. It rises to the high tragedy, and it is one of the most beautiful gentle love stories committed to screen which is very unusual for Coens. What I especially love in Fargo - the perfect balance between the scenes of building suspense, graphic violence, humor, and the real drama from the lives of the real people.The visual palette of the film with color white dominating the screen is stunning, and the snow that covers American Midwest for what seems the eternal winter, is as important character for the film as the rest of them. The sorrowful music score deserves a special mention for creating the mood.It has been told a lot about dream cast that Coens gathered for the film. Of all stars, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy got the most recognition, and very deservingly so. Macy is amazing and a spot- on, and in the final scene of the film, genuinely heartbreaking. It is impossible to imagine anybody else in the role of Jerry Lundegaard, the desperate man who came up with the perfect scheme to become rich without hurting anyone and whose good intentions paved the road directly to hell of Shakespearean proportions. Macy was determined from the beginning that it was HIS role in spite Coens' doubts even after the second reading. He did not hesitate to beg them, and the result proved absolutely terrific.Any way we look at Fargo, it is a great work of Cinema that would make it difficult for its creators to overpass its perfection. As a true masterpiece, it only gets better as time passes and it turns with new facets with every new viewing."
Surecure,"Feb 22, 2006",9/10,"What can be said of Fargo that has not been said before? Fargo is a film that cannot be cornered with any easy definition. The Coen brothers have defined themselves with a style that is unique and refreshing and Fargo stands as one of their masterworks. Equal parts crime-caper, drama and comedy, Fargo takes its audience on a journey where every turn is a breathe of fresh air and every line of dialog is something that you could never translate to another film.Frances McDormand shines in her lead role as the pregnant cop who has a small-town, matter-of-fact way about her that is both endearing and unpredictable, a performance easily earning her Oscar win. William H Macy is as memorable as ever as the car dealer whose ransom master-plan and life spins further and further out of control. And while Steve Buscemi is known for his quirky performances, in Fargo his quirkiness almost seems to make his character appear the most ""normal"" of the bunch.While certainly not a film for everybody (many in my family still don't know what to make of it) it is an easy recommendation for anybody who wants to experience a truly unique, original film. The barren landscape of mid-winter Fargo certainly hides a spectrum of colorful scenarios that amount to a wholly entertaining film."
Humphrey_Bogie,"May 28, 2006",7/10,"The movie is more overrated than you can imagine ! Yes, the movie has it's moments, great screenplay, it's a nice film nothing less, nothing more!! The thing everybody saying about it's weird structure, trust me it is NOT weird nor unique!!

Miki-13,"Apr 7, 1999",1/10,"I am sorry, it may be a 'work of art' as some have suggested here, but Fargo is the most BORING movie I have ever seen.  You just can't care about the characters, the plot, anything!  The only way my friends and I could continue to watch after the first hour was to MST3K it, shouting comments at our TV screen that at least kept us amused. There was a whole lot of snow..a bunch of really 'meaningful' scenes including snow.  Some more snow.  Some person who was so pregnant she could hardly walk, but seemed just fine stalking down the rabid killer at the end...oh, and she was in the snow when she did it.  Then there was some more snow.  I think the snow had a really bad accent, but I cannot be sure, because eventually I couldn't even stand looking at the screen to see who was saying their incredibly banal and annoying lines. Fargo is boring.  Fargo is bad.  Never watch Fargo, not even to put you to sleep.  It just isn't worth it."
Luleo_23,"Dec 27, 2023",8/10,"The setting of ""Fargo"" with its snowy landscapes reminds me of Scandinavian productions. The crime thriller, enriched with black humor, is quite exciting and entertaining. The actors do a good job. I think an Oscar for Frances Louise McDormand is absolutely appropriate and well deserved.Directed by the Coen brothers (No Country for Old Men, True Grit), ""Fargo"" is a black-humored, grotesque crime thriller that paints a portrait of the provincial inhabitants of the north of the USA that is as affectionate as it is curious.""Fargo"" successfully combines bizarre situations, quirky characters and crude violence with a crime plot that may not be particularly innovative, but is certainly cleverly constructed and always has a few surprises in store. Added to this is the strongly captured wintry atmosphere of snowy Minnesota and a very playful ensemble of actors, from which Frances McDormand stands out in particular as a pregnant police officer who combines an engaging warmth with determination and shrewdness.The Coen brothers could have tightened the tension a little more here and there and cut out some scenes that are irrelevant to the main plot - such as the policewoman's meeting with her old acquaintance Mike (Steve Park) - but even so, ""Fargo"" is brilliantly entertaining with its finely tuned mixture of humor and thrills.The movie is rounded off by the very nice, wintry atmosphere in snowy Minnesota, where the clocks tick differently and everything has this rural backwater character. I like movies like this that are set in more remote regions and ""Fargo"" also captures this charm in a fun and likeable way. Ultimately, the movie is easily accessible and provides good entertainment.A few somewhat unnecessary subplots and humor passages that didn't click with me keep ""Fargo"" from being my favorite Coens film so far, but it's still a very successful and worthwhile film.Conclusion: Exciting story, somewhat dorky kidnappers, peppered with quirky characters, pleasantly restrained touches of humor. Worth seeing!"
severindringel,"Feb 11, 2021",9/10,"The first big hit by the directing duo Joel and Ethan Coen really heralded the somewhat different kind of filmmaking. Further films like No Country For Old Men, A Serious Man or True Grit followed and finally established the Coen Brothers as masters of their craft. Fargo contains all the elements that their style stands for: unorthodox violence, the discreet incorporation of comedic aspects and a plot that seems very simple at first glance, but which brings much more meaning and hidden social criticism after watching the film several times.Besides the Coen Brothers, the film was also the big breakthrough of acting icon Frances McDormand. Her character Marge Gunderson does not appear as often as one would expect from the ""main character"". When she is seen, she delights with her amiable nature, which is topped off by her stubborn naivety and belief in the good. McDormand also masters the Minnesota accent perfectly, which only makes her character more likeable and refreshing. She is never really aware of the gravity of the situation at any point and is constantly miles off the mark as the police officer in charge of the occurring crime. William H. Macy's slightly crazy character Jerry Lundegaard is the centre of the film at the beginning. The main action starts from him and he is pretty much the opposite of Marge: he always knows what is going on and is shady without end. Although he has no real evil intentions, pretty much all of his plans go awry, leaving him constantly on the run and always quick to lose his cool. Macy plays big and makes this shambles of a man weirdly likeable. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are responsible for the more brutal moments as the crooks and are hilarious in their scenes together because of the difference of their characters.It is not for nothing that a television series of the same name was developed based on Fargo. The peculiarity of this film still has a cult following for many. Also beautiful to look at is the completely snowed-in Minnesota and the cast covered in fur coats. The performances by McDormand, Macy and Buscemi of course help the plot, which is a little dull towards the middle, enormously. It picks up towards the end without offering a big showdown or explosive finale. Fargo is generally a rather quietly constructed film that uses its violent scenes very selectively. What is so impressive is the socio-critical factor behind it. There is a clear demarcation between good and bad people. The Coen Brothers are not above depicting this in sometimes very subtle but also extreme ways. Fargo is rightly an important part of film history that should be watched alone for the fact that the Coen Brothers really took off with it."
Steve_Winjet,"Feb 26, 2021",10/10,"Fargo is brilliant in every way! Bang on cinematography, top notch acting and masterful direction."
Jamie_Seaton,"Aug 12, 2009",N/A,"Another winner by the Coen Brothers. Not my favourite of theirs but still a brilliant film. The acting is amazing by Frances Mcdormand, William H.Macy and Steve Buscemi. Love the voice lingo they use in this, its really odd. If thats how they talk in Minnesota then i better go there for a holiday hahaha!!Getting nominated for 7 Oscars which is more than your average film added to the awards roster and only won 2 if i remember correctly. I'm glad Frances Mcdormand 'a Coen regular' won an Oscar for her performance in this. she deserved it. William H. Macy should of won too i think."
labelletravica,"Oct 9, 2019",8/10,Fargo effortlessly plays off of the dichotomy between an idiot husband's desperation and a police chief's Minnesotan charm. Highly rewatchable.
st-shot,"May 23, 2009",10/10,"Fargo is probably the last American Film masterpiece of the Twentieth Century and the last 25 years. Highly original and imaginative it is a depressing tale told in a dark comic style with flesh and blood characters intricately and smoothly connected with dialog and plot twists all brilliantly conceived by the brothers Coen.Sleazy car dealer Jerry Lundergaard hatches a plan to have his wife kidnapped so he can pocket some of the ransom his emasculating father in-law will have to fork over. Through one of his mechanics he gets the name of a low life who might be interested and travels to Fargo to work out the plan. Things go awry from the outset though and soon the cold snowy landscape is littered with dead bodies. Solving the case is left up to a last trimester pregnant Sheriff from Brainerd, Minnesota who initially comes across as a little slow on the draw.Fargo is flawlessly constructed with subplots girding the storyline, enriching characterization and sharply calibrating the suspenseful pace. The frozen north setting is a refreshing change from big city and vacation land locales that dominate feature films and the Coens expertly put it to use to create mood, evoke humor and accent imagery. It is the best use of snow since Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller.William Macy as Jerry takes the car salesman stereotypes to new lows with one of the most memorable cloyingly unctuous characters in film history as he dismantles his family in pursuit of wealth. Whether trying to tack on extras to customers or keeping police at bay while surrounded in a motel room he remains steadfast in deceptive practice until the end. As the Sheriff Frances McDormand evolves from small town cop to Colombo subtlety and successfully without fanfare while Coen economically brings more depth and mystery to her with dry comic snapshots of her married life and a meeting with an old school chum. As one of the blundering kidnappers Steve Buscemi is a motormouth of comic complaint while his taciturn, hypochondrial partner played by Peter Stomare (a lot more grounded in reality than the Frankenstein creation running amok in the Coen's No Country for Old Men) is icily terrifying.Fargo is the Coens' best film to date. They fell into a malaise after The Big Lebowski with heavy handed comedies (The Lady Killers, Intolerable Cruelty), dependence on charming movie star George Clooney as well as a flaccid and forgettable foray into black and white (The Man Who Wasn't There) before going Oscar with the slow moving overrated Old Country, followed by the praise worthy acerbic screwball comedy Burn After Reading. Even with their failures they had more to offer than quality work of tamer directors by offering razzle dazzle camera work and original off-beat characters. Taking chances they sometimes pushed the envelope beyond credulity but with Fargo they give us a perfect measure of style and realism with a dark comic soul that is rich in detail and perception of this thing known as the human comedy."
moritzherz,"Jan 30, 2023",7/10,"Last year I watched rhe first season of the Fargo Series and it blew away my mind. Definitely one of the best seasons I watched my entire life. So of course I wanted to see the Fargo movie. Now, after trying the MGM channel on Prime Video I could finally watch it. My expectations were high, the story the movie is based in is the same like the series.And I did not get dissapointed! Although the series is a lot better this movie manages to tell a different but also great story. You also have to admit that the series had more time to develope the story.So in summary I will remember both, the show and the movie of Fargo as great pieces of art."
cwoodul,"Mar 19, 2005",10/10,"Perfectly written, perfectly cast, perfectly acted, this is one of the best works of cinematic art of all time. Each scene is artfully composed, the actors' performances are subtle, powerful and evoke far more than than their words alone convey. The tongue-in-cheek but so-serious performances are dead-on. I have seen this film at least a dozen times and never tire of it; in fact, I appreciate it more each time I see it. Its economy of dialog, composition, and plot is the soul of this wonderful piece. A fresh plot, the artful placement of the spare and haunting musical score, the stark cinematography, masterful directing and first-rate performances make this one a real winner!"
hyqzbmq,"Apr 28, 2024",10/10,"Going on 30 years of crime dramas and cop dramas, Fargo exists as an antithesis to them. And that - along with the gloriously dire soundtrack - is what makes this movie a masterpiece.To whit: everyone is not quite idiots, but certainly no masterminds. The criminals. Lundergaard. The father. Even Marge the cop. It's what makes McDermott so amazing. She doesn't play Ms. Supercop. She's not Sherlock. She's just a small town chief who's duped by multiple people, both personally and professionally. Not because she's that dumb, but because she hasn't seen the world through that lens.It's not a thriller. It's no tragedy. It's not even a mystery. It's just a very well told story, told under the guise of a ""can't make this up"" true story.It holds up very well given the sheer volume of super cops and super villains we've seen over the years. A very nice breath of fresh air after watching so many of those."
K3nzit,"Mar 6, 2024",10/10,"One of my favorite movies by the Coen brothers. The writing and directing is absolutely amazing. Love this style of black comedy - very unique, but it never takes you out of the movie. Cinematography is done by the legendary Roger Deakins. Casting is also spot on. Watch this movie for acting alone and you won't be disappointed. Frances McDormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi all give memorable performances. But even the smaller characters are brilliantly acted. Peter Stormare and John Carroll Lynch are the best examples.Just sit back and let the story suck you in to the wonderful world of crime, drama and laughter - Enjoy!"
bob the moo,"Apr 18, 2004",N/A,"Jerry Lundegaard is a car dealer who has money problems.  Unable to ask his wealthy father-in-law for money, Jerry employs two criminal types to kidnap his wife and then split the ransom with Jerry.  However when a cop pulls over the two criminals, a triple shooting is the result and the police get involved.  With Jerry getting pressure from the kidnappers now that thing has gone sour and Officer Marge Gunderson making progress in her investigation, things are far from as straightforward as was originally planned.Getting past the whole `true story' nonsense, this is easily one of the Coen's most polished films as well as one of their most enjoyable.  The film opens with a bleak, snowy scene with a great sweeping score and pretty much sets the tone for a film that feels bigger than it actually is.  The opening scene between Jerry and his two contracted hoods is really good and is typical of the comic tone that runs all the way through the film.  The plot is cleverly written and so much more than another `job gone wrong' thing, however what drives the film is the weird web of unusual characters that we encounter along the way.  Setting the film in a part of American with Scandinavian roots was clever as it gives the characters funny accents before you even worry about what they are going to say with them!  The screenplay won an Oscar and it deserved it simply for the dialogue and the characters it creates.  It is a dark film but it is one that fans of the Coen brothers' universe will find funny.Of course it helps no end to have a great cast to deliver it.  McDormand won the Oscar despite only being one of several good performances in the film. Her Marge is funny yet relentless in her pursuit.  Macy is as reliable as ever and it is his increasingly frantic performance that is the best of the film for my money - weedy, pathetic and hopelessly out of his depth but funny with it.  Buscemi and Stormare are both very good for very different reasons and the rest of the support cast is comprised of many strange characters who are funny.  Only the very occasional bit hits a sour note, but this is very occasional and doesn't hurt the film one little bit.Overall this may not be a true story but that is not to say that it isn't fascinating anyway - who says truth is better than fiction?!  The roundly great performances do great work with a deserved Oscar winner of a screen play that fills a solid crime storyline with all manner of characters that produce a gripping and funny film that is one of the best and most accessible of the Coen brother films."
lagudafuad,"Sep 1, 2012",7/10,"Fargo is a movie that depicts the Murphy's Law in total ""If anything can go wrong, it will..."" Well in this movie it all went wrong.The movie states this is a true story, but that can be argued since the movie itself is completely fictional. The Coen brothers claim that many of the events that took place in the movie were actually based on true events from other cases that they threw together to make one story.The movie's radical turn of events is something that will catch the interest of any audience, as things just don't go as they should for anybody. The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, winning two for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress in a Leading Role for McDormand. It also won the BAFTA Award and the Award for Best Director for Joel Coen at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. The movie plots have Frances McDormand starring as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief with a sharp and smart mind, who begins piecing together a case where a pair of motorists are found slain not far from the corpse of a state trooper.As Marge continues to put it all together, more people seem to be involved in the case than there should.On the other side of the events we have Jerry (William H. Macy) who has had his wife kidnapped so he can get the ransom money but everything just goes wrong.Kudos to the Coen brothers for a nice screenplay as everything that seems to happen on each shot complements the next, the characters are well depicted and the acting is a strong A+. The movie did have its faults, there were scenes that were totally unnecessary and a lot of people may complement the accents but I found it meaningless.Editing was top notch, directing to me was not so bad but won't award it. The story too had its lapse it took too long to pick up.Coen brothers are no stranger to the Academy awards, their 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? Was also nominated (no wins), their 2007 movie No Country for Old Men won 4 Academy awards and their 2010 movie True Grit had 10 nominations (no wins).Fargo is a drama, if you are not a huge fan of dramas this could bore you, but if you don't mind, you will find it interesting to watch.www.lagsreviews.com"
jayjaycee,"Feb 7, 2020",9/10,"""Fargo"" is a 1996 (comedic) thriller (officially) directed by Joel Coen starring Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. I gotta admit that I've already watched it roughly one year ago when I had personal issues and was in a bad mood that resulted in a disability to like films in general and that I heavily disliked this film. Now that the worst of my personal problem is over and I'm able to appreciate everything again, I had the strange feeling that I didn't do this film justice and that I had to give it a rewatch and after finding this nice little Mediabook I knew I had to set things straight. Like I expected, this film is actually pretty good. There's so much to cherish in it and I still cannot believe that, as the opening titles state, all these depicted events are based on a true story. It's just insane. What appears to be another brilliant gathering of thoughts of the Coen brothers really happened in 1987. They took it and made it a brilliant comedic thriller. Yes, I say it's a comedic thriller, because overall it might be a thriller, but there too many scenes that feature crude humour that I couldn't leave that part out. Actually, it's undeniable that in it's cold core it's a black satirical crime flick. First of all, the way how the plot is constructed and links several storylines with weird, but original characters is simply superb. It's full of funny running gags, dialogue and it perfectly combines the right amount of abstruse humour and true earnestness. From the wannabe gangster duo, to a desperate car salesman in the need for cash to a pregnant, but still determined police chief there's not a single character that is boring in any way. This cold-blooded thriller features so many outstanding actors and actresses that made them come to life with such an easiness. Leading lady Frances McDormand (who only has had one hour of screentime to again proof that she's the greatest) delivered an ingenious performance as the protagonist police chief. She's such a sweet lady and she dominates every single scene she's in, also the way she speaks is just lovely. Definitely one of the greatest actresses in the business. But let's not forget to praise Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the quirky and evilly hilarious kidnappers and William H. Macy as the salesman who also knew to entertain with their weird charisma. Set in a scenery of frozen highways and endless widths of cold snow they all manage to create this unique atmosphere. Also, mostly enabled by the breathtaking cinematography of Roger Deakins. I could seriously feel the cold of the film crawling down my spine although I was sitting in my warm room under my even warmer blanket. It's so beautifully shot and moody that I still cannot understand why it took the Academy more than twenty years to award that man. He's a virtuoso with the camera! All in all, this shockingly beautiful and brutally bloody snow satire is an outstanding entry to the independent cinema, with an inimitable atmosphere and tense music and unbelievably real story lead by a magnificent McDormand. It took me another watch to appreciate this classic flick and feel redemption. Better late than never."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Oct 27, 2018",7/10,"Built around a sweet, polite, small-town police officer and her attempts to solve a murderous mystery seemingly by being as nice as possible, this strangely pleasant yet decidedly dark tale is somewhat satirical and screams 'Coen' as soon as it starts, with a totally phoney 'based on a true story' title-card that's supposed to excuse some of the more extreme coincidences and absurd-isms found in the plot. 'Fargo (1996)' is an entertaining time that feels as home-spun as its supposed to, doesn't always take the expected route and focuses on fairly realistic characters who are mostly atypical of the usual archetypes found in this type of story, but it is also sometimes slow and meandering, too (which is actually Coen trademark). 7/10"
MacAindrais,"Dec 4, 2005",9/10,"Fargo: ***.5*Fargo is a strange little movie. It is, in my opinion, the Cohen Brothers best film. It deals with a very serious subject, yet somehow it does so without taking itself overly serious. There is a very realistic quality to be found here- The subject matter is dark, yet there is a crack of light shining through always. The conversations are spot on with how they would probably be spoken in real life.McDormands character, the pregnant Marge, is the persistent pursuer but she is not obsessive like so many other movie clichéd 'good guys' are when it comes to catching their adversary. She is involved, but remains detached, just as 95% of real cops will be. You see it clearest in the conversations she has with her fellow officers; husband, and just about everyone else she speaks to. You really feel that she is, as her character says during an interview, just doing her job. This realism is not just present in Marge, but in every character. None are over the top, though the accents are probably slightly exaggerated.Jerry and his cronies are stupid. We never really find out Jerry's original troubles, but we are front row center for the idiocy that follows. There are no super intelligent characters which you find in many other crime dramas. There is only those who have some wits and common sense, and those who are helplessly daft.Personally, I loved this movie. It's quirky; it's real; it's charming; and its just plain fun (though bordering on the edge of painful) to watch this freezing fable of stupidity unfold. I did however feel that the ending was a little rushed, but this is not really a bad thing. I felt that the scene of Marge with her friend Mike in the city could have been removed, and that time could have gone to filling out the ending a little more. All in all, this nitpick is rather insignificant, and does little, if nothing at all to distract from the quality of the movie.I wanted to give this movie a 10, but it is lacking something, i don't know what, which is preventing me from giving it so. I also feel that it deserves more than a nine: 9.5/10"

GoUSN,"Mar 28, 2008",1/10,"What galls me most about this movie specifically and the Coen brothers' movies generally is that they all reveal the insipidness of both the Coens and their fans. What they can't achieve with excellent dialogue, well-spun stories, and logical continuity in plotting, the Coens make up for via blood, lust, more blood, and then more blood. Vanquished from their movies is any sense of humanity or hope, and we are left in what I can best describe as a ""bleakscape"" - where the great positive is the presence of so much that is negative. I do delight, however, in the spectacle of reading swooning fans' fawning tributes to the Coens' ""films"" (and yes, their fans will watch only ""films"").Utterly unbelievable in the bleak, depressing, and joyless tableaux they offer, the Coen films are the perfect answer to a society full of soulless narcissists."
moviesleuth2,"Apr 26, 2009",10/10,"Going into a Coen brothers movie expecting something traditional is ridiculous by any stretch of the imagination. Any movie directed by the Coens is going to be severely warped in one way or another, either by approach (""No Country for Old Men"") or by their sense of humor (everything else).By all accounts, ""Fargo"" is a murder mystery, though it is anything but straightforward. This is not ""Law & Order."" It's about a simple crime that spiraled way out of control for all the principal characters. That's understandable, since everyone populating this story is either hopelessly inept or hopelessly stupid.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman who needs money to open a new car lot. But since he thinks that the only person who could give the money to him, his father-in-law (Harve Presnell), won't put down the money, he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife (Kristen Rudrud) and split the ransom that his father-in-law will pay. Unfortunately for Jerry, the two thugs he hired don't have any brain cells between them, and Jerry is probably the most incompetent criminal the world has ever seen. Things get out of hand very quickly and the bodies start piling up. This draws the attention of the very pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).It may seem like I've given a lot away, but really, I haven't. That's just the set-up for a series of unexpected (not to mention bizarre) twist and turns that the Coens throw at us. Many thrillers, even the best ones, have easily projected paths. ""Fargo"" is anything but.Despite IMDb listing it as such, merely calling ""Fargo"" a crime/thriller is an insufficient description. The film is as much a comedy as anything else. From the character's stupidity or complete ineptitude, to the funny accents and way of speaking that everyone has, the Coens never take ""Fargo"" too seriously.The acting is the best part of the film. Frances McDormand is a real scene-stealer, and in many ways the best part of the movie. Marge is relentlessly chirpy and optimistic, and she's easily the smartest character in the film (although that's not exactly saying much). ""Fargo"" really takes off whenever she's on screen. William H. Macy gives his best performance as Jerry. As reprehensible as his plan is, you can't help but feel sorry for the guy. He's so bad at being a criminal, it's really pathetic. But seeing him try to get out of the jams he gets himself into are nothing short of hilarious. Steve Buscemi and Harve Presnell are good as the brainless kidnappers, and even though they think they're smart, they're really, REALLY dumb.Joel Coen has a knack for twisting the story just enough so that it's funny without lampooning the genre. This isn't a satire, but the jabs it takes almost make it so. It has its share of violence, including a scene that in any other movie would be completely sick and disturbing, but as told by the Coens, it's so shocking and absurd that it's laugh-out-loud hilarious.Roger Ebert heaped tons of praise on ""Fargo,"" saying that ""Movies like 'Fargo' are the reasons why I love movies."" While I greatly enjoyed ""Fargo,"" I can't heap that much praise on it. Some of the cuts in the film are too long, and I half-expected a commercial break. Additionally, there's one scene where Marge reunites with a guy from high school that, while funny and irreverent, really doesn't add anything to the story. Still, it's enjoyable enough that it's hardly worth complaining about.While it may not be perfect, ""Fargo"" is still a very good film, especially if you have a warped sense of humor."
briancham1994,"Apr 11, 2021",8/10,"I hesitate to call this a comedy film. I found parts of it funny but more in the way that Wes Anderson films are dainty rather than laugh-out-loud funny. The storyline features a clueless and bumbling car salesman attempting a hare-brained scheme with equally incompetent criminals, all juxtaposed a disarmingly mundane and friendly Midwest setting. The stand-out feature of this film is the acting, as the characters are all perfect depictions of those who simply cannot get anything right! I see more inspiration from old screwball films than traditional crime dramas. After a spate of Martin Scorsese films, Heat and Scarface, the easygoing style of this film was a breath of fresh air."
campbell-russell-a,"Aug 19, 2013",10/10,"Evil as depicted in films such as ""Fargo"" and ""Badlands"" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In ""Fargo"" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over ""a little bit of money"" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are ""doing pretty good"" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying.This is a depiction of humankind at their worst and their best. It is a roller-coaster ride and possibly the best film ever made. And the score is just brilliant."
lukasleesteenhoek,"Dec 16, 2019",N/A,"""Fargo"" is a dualistic masterpiece that examines a world of great darkness and little joys. It achieves it's masterpiece status by fascinating character studies and fantastic dialogue. Between ""Fargo"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" the Coen brothers have put together two pieces of the greatest filmmaking I have ever seen."
maddmaxx46,"Dec 8, 2024",7/10,This was a pretty solid film from the Coen brothers but I can't figure out why it's such a highly rated movie. The acting is fantastic in this one; they capture the upper Midwest so well in each scene. I also appreciate the tremendous cinematography that the Coen brothers are consistent within their direction. Scenes like the kitchen where they can capture the husband at the table with the wife struggling to start the car are just a little attention to detail that they do so well in their films. But maybe this film hasn't aged as well. It might have been such a unique and cool concept in the 90s but I don't know what makes this movie so special and reading other reviews doesn't explain it either. I'm glad I watched it but it didn't hit high marks for me and I'll probably pass on a rewatch. 3.5/5 stars.
mbhgkmsgg,"Dec 30, 2020",9/10,"Fargo is one of those films that I have always known about and heard nothing but great things of. Yet, for some inexplicable reason, I had never seen it, until now, of course. What's more, the two other Coen films that I have seen, No Country for Old Men and The Big Lebowski, were both fantastic. So, while I'm a little mad that it took me this long to get around to Fargo, I'm glad that I've finally seen it.Interestingly, despite its critical acclaim and popularity, I had no idea what this film was about. And I'm glad that that was the case. I believe that Fargo benefits greatly, from being experienced without any prior knowledge. It gives the film a chance to create the narrative and expectations, which turns out to be quite important considering how simple it ultimately is. And while the story and the characters are relatively simple, it's that simplicity, I believe, that makes this film as fantastic as it is. It gives the chance to really focus on the characters and their personalities and what drives them. Because at the end of the day, this film is all about the characters. They make Fargo enjoyable and entertaining and easy to fall in to. The main characters, which there aren't many of, are all distinctly different, but together, they end up creating such a complete and perfect end product, that it's hard not to enjoy it.The story is certainly another highpoint, not that there are really any low points. It follows Jerry, a car salesman, who is under a debt burden. To get out of the pinch, he devises a plan to have his wife kidnapped, and for his father-in-law to pay the ransom. However, as the plan starts going sideways and bodies start dropping, Marge, the head of police, is called in. As Jerry and the bad guys start feeling the heat, it's clear that the plan will never work, and they must all hope to getaway.
The story ends up sounding far more complicated than it is when written out. Indeed, when watching the final product, it's especially the story that amazed me with its simplicity. But there is also a certain simplicity associated with the characters. All of them tend to follow a clear personality type, be it jumpy and uncertain, short-tempered and assertive, or calm and trusting. And apart from Marge, none of the characters goes through a phase of self-discovery or change. From the very first scene of each character, it's easy to understand who they are. And as the movie progresses, it's easy to predict how they are going to act. While that may, at first, sound like a bad thing, in the case of Fargo, it becomes the opposite. To keep the story concise and enjoyable, there needs to be a certain degree of predictability, and Fargo captures that balance perfectly.Although I have already discussed the characters, there is one that I have yet to touch upon. That character, who is omnipresent throughout, is, of course, the dialogue and the accents it is delivered with. A lot of the novelty, as well as the fun, comes from the way conversations flow, as well as the mannerisms and sayings that the characters have. There is this certain friendliness, even in the most uncomfortable and frustrating conversations which gives the film an almost surreal feel. And although Fargo deals with some familiar themes and topics, thanks to its dialogue and environment it feels oddly otherworldly. It's something that I can't really explain, and I'm not even sure that those who have seen it would all agree, but the whole film felt close, yet simultaneously distant, which certainly added a lot to the overall feel.Having now finally seen Fargo, I'm tremendously happy that I did so. It most certainly lives up to all the praise it has received, and is, without a doubt, one of the most perfect films ever created. While it might not be a personal favourite, nor one that I look forward to revisiting as soon as I get the chance, what it is, is a tremendously enjoyable and entertaining experience."
eagandersongil,"Jul 25, 2016",7/10,"""Fargo"" is a good movie, I confess that my experience with the movie was impaired because I watched the great series ""Fargo"" first, which contains a similar plot, but much better detailed and developed, because it is a series, so I watching the film compared to the series, and missed the further development of the characters, then the script to me, was not suppressed, on the contrary, I even I was disappointed a little (save dialogs), the soundtrack is good, photography the film is great, the acting is good, mainly from Frances McDormand, the way the situation is getting worse more is comical, his black mood is very good, violence is sarcastic, the great dialogues, the Coen brothers are masters in this type of humor, and use a lot of visual to help build all the comic climate / tragic film. For those who like comedy, especially the most acidic, or like the estilão Coen brothers' ""Fargo"" is a required film, otherwise straight pass through ""Fargo."" Forgive my English translator google"
matthewssilverhammer,"Apr 1, 2021",10/10,"Fargo is the optimistic counter-point to No Country..., each starring hard-working, small-town cops dealing with a crime so beyond their usual work that it stirs an existential crisis. However, where Jones' character seems forfeited to the insurmountable evil, Marge (best character ever?) is unflappable in her determination to beat the bad guys; this covers both ends of Coen-nihilism. Simpler, Fargo is as pure as the fresh-fallen snow, delicately balancing dry rural humor with pointed & surprising bursts of violence."

By the way, the film kinda reminded me of ""Pulp Fiction""... for example, the criminals behave similarly in this film. But it's not nearly the same film.Overall, ""Fargo"" is a very good and very enjoyable movie, with a lot of outstanding features, and I gladly recommend it, fans of crime/comedy films will probably enjoy it."

At first, I didn't see what was so great about this like the way Roger Ebert raved about it. The whole movie is funny from the overly- polite midwestern accents. Reminded me of Canadian accents. But I did not find it to be a masterpiece. Then I tried really watching it, and I never looked back.The film is about a used car salesman named Jerry Lundengaard (Macy) who rigs his wife being kidnapped by two criminals be doesn't know (Buscemi, Stormare) as ransom so he can get needed money from his father-in-law (Presnell) he knows he would not get any other way. The kidnapping leads to three homicides where pregnant cop, Marge (McDormand) does some investigation and is soon hot on all their trails.In the first 20 minutes or so, we meet Jerry then witness the kidnapping and the murders. This start has always been exciting. Then we meet Marge and the story really starts to unfold as she does some detective work and Jerry gets what's coming to him. For some reason, the movie lost my interest when we meet Marge. After we meet her I became more interested with just hearing the people say ""yeah!"" and ""you betcha!"" After not watching the movie for a while, I tried really watching it and I finally understood what all the commotion was all about. The story is the one of the most original you'll ever see. Originality is what makes movies great and this has it. What makes the story and events original are the characters. All characters, even bad, are lovable and well-developed, the whole movie is exciting with character-driven twists that add sheer excitement, great morals and some nice filming techniques, all while keeping funny accents with humour so dark that it messes with you. There's nothing not to like. Jerry is probably the antagonist and villain since he was the brains behind ransom and started the chain of events. He is developed so well and there is so much sympathy created for him that the viewer feels sorry for him anytime he is brought down or is seen through. He never gives up and is greatly determined. Marge, the protagonist and hero, is the most original female hero ever. She is as awesome as The Bride in the Kill Bill movies. Nobody wants to see Marge nab Jerry. Steve Buscemi is like a creature that eats away at his boss's enemy. Stormare is kick-ass psycho that plays by his own rules and answers to nobody. Both of them are funny together because they are totally different: a chatterbox and a mute. These, as well as the other characters, are so real and well-developed that they drive the movie. A pure, original character driven story and important morals that arise are Shakespeare-like. Add great filming, odd humour and thrills, you get one of America's best films ever.4/4"
Red_Identity,"Sep 19, 2008",N/A,"I re watched Fargo, and I have to say, without giving too much, it is impossible to not LOVE this film! Fargo is such a brilliant piece of film-making! The script was written with such intelligence. It's mixture of black comedy with crime and drama is so original, it is a pity why films like this cannot be done these days. To just explain the greatness of Fargo is not enough. Unlike other 'so called' masterpieces out there, Fargo's genuine emotional appeal cannot be described. It is enough to just watch the film. Yes, it is disturbing, sometimes a little too much, but that mixed in with amazingly memorable characters, makes for a truly amazing ride. It is a simple kidnapping movie, but the way events fold out, and unfold themselves are so bizarre, that it is even original(something that is hard to grasp these days).A strong part of this film is the acting. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a character that is sometimes mixed with fright and worry, and Macy gives such a well done performance. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormware are great as the two kidnappers, Buscemi actually giving a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. But the greatest performance has to come from Frances McDormand, who plays her character of Police Chief Marge Gunderson so well, mixed with quirkiness so well, this is a true landmark for acting. Usually dramatic performances capture scenes, but McDormand captures every scene with her charm. One of the best performances of the 90's. Mixed with the acting are the strong sides to the film. The cinematography is so real and gorgeous, the film editing flawless, the music score so originally made, they all enhance the experience more.All in all, Fargo is a perfect film. It has a lot of themes inside of it, and they all come out sooner or later. But unlike theme-filled movies, this is a joy to watch. This is what films should be. They should entertain, but also react strongly to the audience and enhance us in different ways. This is Joel and Ethan Coen's best films. There is no way they could beat this. It is just difficult to describe how truly great it is. And unlike most 1990's famous films, Fargo is not overrated in such a way that people call it to be so 'important'. Fargo is, after second thoughts, the best film of the 90's. It is also one of the best films ever made, in the aspect that it is, after all, one little joy of a film! 10/10"
Calicodreamin,"Nov 4, 2020",7/10,"Good storyline, great acting, and those accents will be stuck in my head for days. The storyline was well developed and captivating, kept up pace and intrigue throughout the whole movie."
Blomkoli69,"Jun 7, 2018",8/10,"This slow-paced movie is really surprising in the way that it put an effort to show how things can go wrong when stupid, unexperienced people are tumbling in crime world. I loved how Cohen brothers unraveled a very well written plot that lead to an unsurprising end but close to how it ends in real life when these misdeeds are committed.
One of the other feeling that transmit this movie is that everything that is happening looks so normal that it creates a strange atmosphere, burlesque, 
 almost stupid, that makes the movie really funny to watch. 
So if you add all those things together plus a really good casting and filmmaking you've got a must see movie !!"
Uriah43,"Sep 27, 2018",7/10,"Somewhat slyly advertised as being based on a true story, a car salesman by the name of ""Jerry Lundegaard"" (William H. Macy) hires two psychotic thugs named ""Carl Showalter"" (Steve Buscemi) and ""Gaear Grimsrud"" (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife ""Jean Lundegaard"" (Kristin Rudrud) so that his rich father-in-law ""Wade Gustafson"" (Harve Presnell) can pay the ransom which will then be split between Jerry and the two kidnappers. Unfortunately, rather than being kept as secret as possible, things take a severe turn for the worse when Carl and Gaear shoot and kill several innocent bystanders in the process. And things get even more out-of-hand when a police investigator by the name of ""Marge Gunderson"" (Frances McDormand) is assigned to the case. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I didn't think much of this film the first time I saw it but after further viewings I began to appreciate the dark humor a bit more. That being said, I have rated the film accordingly. Above average."
baumer,"Jun 26, 2000",10/10,"This is a strange film.  Most of the time, when it comes to films that are reality based, I get tired of them real fast.  Take a film like Affliction. That film was about an alcoholic father and the abuse of his sons.  It got real old real fast because there was just too much reality in there.  And it didn't manage to mesh the reality with even a modicum of entertainment. Fargo is different.  This is a very serious film with a whole slew of funny moments.  I don't think I have laughed this hard in a film when people weren't doing anything particularly funny.  But when a guy with a shovel in his hand tells you than there are clouds coming in over the horizon, and you find that gut-splittingly funny, then you are in for a special film.  Fargo is that film.But besides the hilarity, what makes this film work is the breakthrough performance of William H. Macy.  Macy plays Jerry Lundergard the only way he should be played.  Lundergard is a troubled man.  He is in some financial difficulty and he has rich relatives that wouldn't give him any money for any reason.  They don't particularly like him.  Lundergard is a normal man. He comes from a small town and he ends up hatching a big scheme to get the money.  He will have his wife kidnapped and then set up a ransom for her that will go to him.  His wife won't be harmed and then he can pay off his financial debt.  So he hires a couple of idiots, violent idiots, but idiots nonetheless.  Of course this being a crime movie, and a Coen crime movie at that, everything is going to go wrong.  And it does.Macy captures the true feel of what it would be like to be in Lundergard's position.  He is nervous.  He is nervous because he is so inept at crime that he hasn't even bothered to get the kidnappers phone numbers and he tried to supply them with a car by smudging some numbers when sending in a fax to GM.  In one of the best scenes in the film, what starts out as a friendly meeting between Marge, the police detective, and Jerry turns into disaster for Jerry.  He can't even lie well enough to a police officer who really isn't questioning him about the crime, just the possibility that the crooks stole a car from his lot.  Now I'm no expert in kidnapping, but wouldn't it have been better for him to just say that he had a car stolen from the lot?  But he can't even figure that out properly.Marge is played by Academy Award winner Frances McDormand.  She is from the small town of Fargo, she is pregnant and she has trouble starting her car in the morning.  But she is also a gifted police officer.  Upon investigating the scene of the first crime, she figures it out with common sense and logic.  "" I don't think I agree with some of your police work there..."" she tells the other officer that seems to have it all backwards.  When she gets to the big city, the first thing she does is look for a buffet, then she goes onto trying to solve a crime.  She still has her priorities straight.The two kidnappers are played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare.  Buscemi is Showalter and Stormare is Grimsrud and they couldn't be more opposite. Buscemi is ""funny looking"" and a nervous, talkative fellow while Stormare is a quiet, almost dumb looking dork.  But they are ruthlessly violent and quick to pull the trigger.  Buscemi provides the film with some of the bigger laughs as his character is always described as being funny looking by the locals.The Coens have made some movies that were considered good, although not my taste ( Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink ) but Fargo is a step above most other films.  It is smarter than any film should be and it is honest and deceptively funny.  If something is supposed to go wrong then it does.  In most films, when a crime is committed, the only reason it is solved and the good guys win is because that is the way scripts are written.  The good guys have to win because that is the formula for a film.  But in Fargo, everything that happens does so because there are reasons for it and reasons given for it.  If Marge is going to figure out the crime, she does so because she has done her homework and found out where the bad guys are. The script doesn't let her down.Fargo was one of the best films to come out of 1996 and it sure as hell was much better than English Patient.  I don't think we are meant to figure out the academy though.  One year it gives out best picture to a worthy film like Titanic and overlooks unworthy opponents like L.A. Confidential and then other years it gives best picture to crap like Shakespeare In Love and English Patient overlooking films like Saving Private Ryan and Fargo. Fargo is one of the most original films ever made and it is a perfect one to watch when you are tired of the formula that Hollywood releases time and time again.10 out of 10"
MartianOctocretr5,"Jul 6, 2006",7/10,"A movie that's hard to categorize, because, quite frankly, it's so weird. It's innovative and artistic, with quirky characters and an offbeat approach.Dark humor can be difficult to digest sometimes, and that is my one major criticism of the film as several innocents suffer or even die violently. The movie doesn't seem to care, as it scurries along in an effort to showcase its weirdest characters. Sheriff Marge Gunderson (skillfully portrayed by Frances McDormond) is the only character who seems to notice that the victims are human beings. She's the protagonist with a calm demeanor and low key, Columbo style approach to the grisly crime she is investigating. She also serves symbolically as the only force of peace and sanity in this film's bizarre universe.In stark and comedic contrast to her are all the freaks. William H. Macy is brilliant as a car salesman who would try to sell an Eskimo an air conditioner. He hatches a foolhardy scheme involving two thugs to get some quick cash which starts to unravel. His efforts to keep on talking his way through everything reminds one of a guy trying to talk his way out of quicksand. His father-in-law is equally nutty; a zillionaire whose every conversation resembles a board-room style exec meeting with his ever-present business partner.The two crooks are just psychos, perhaps patterned after the two slime balls in ""In Cold Blood."" One is an idiot who never shuts up and errantly imagines he's the brains of the partnership; the other a mindless automaton who rarely speaks, but the wheels are always turning in his head. When he acts, he is devoid of any emotional response--just like a machine calculating, and reacting with ruthless efficiency.The actors work all of these over the top characters well, and the film delights in bouncing them off each other. The dark humor is at times brutal, but overall this movie is an entertaining watch."
AriSquad,"Sep 24, 2003",1/10,"I love most coen brothers films but even the ones I love have that one awful part to them, the supernatural unexplained arty farty scenes (The biker in raising arizona, the devil & the flood in oh brother, the ufo in the man who wasn't there, etc) I find them to be the low points in every one of their films. Fargo either missed that obstacle or the entire film consisted of a variation of it, either way it failed me from the first 5 minutes I was unhappy with this film. Just stripped down simple times in a simple place with complicated deadly themes. Disregard the value of life and be entertained. Art? yes lots of art, if you want to think it's there.. This movie should not have been the staple for the Coen brothers, people hold this movie in such high regard it just makes me think they are just wanting to sound smart because they only had to watch it twice to understand it. That and Wood chipper wood chipper wood chipper.. Yes I always hear the talk about the wood chipper scene, over & over, maybe the highlight of the film? wow.. so sad.. This film is nothing but a basic simple life town with wood chipper shock value. Bring up Fargo in a coversation & you will hear the words ""wood chipper"" within five seconds.."
stk974,"Dec 1, 2017",10/10,"This is my first review about a movie which is not in my mother language and I chose this movie specifically because although I like many Coen brothers' movies, this film will be in my heart in its special place, kind of forever.This is a black comedy crime movie but even in its gory scenes, the humanitarian perspective intelligently mixed with unnerving humor has never lost on you. This movie is an excellent example of what we should know and learn further about crime world and what individual ethics mean in every way we could comprehend. In all the characters, we can observe what is right and wrong and why they choose the paths they choose and what makes a human being a good person or evil. It is kind of a moral teaching session.The excellent acting and the script carry you from the first moment to the final moment of this film. The whole movie, even in its dark moments flows like a river and you forget the minutes pass. You can also see that the actors disappear in their performances and you cannot even say they are acting even though you know because they seem to you as if they were the real people and you were watching a horribly dark story in actual life from the first row alive. I especially fell in love with Frances McDormand's superb acting skills in this masterpiece, as I should call it since Coen Brothers' directing is peerless as well.The plot seems quite ordinary yet it reveals itself in no time with unexpected twists and turns throughout until you start to predict the next moves and fail each and every time. It is difficult not to empathize with each and every character and ask ""what would I do if I were in their shoes?"". The answers are always undetermined as they depend on your own character, even your mood and that's the beauty and the sincerity of this art work.The scenes, especially the ones with the plain snow are fascinating and resonating for sure and also those are sort of etched in one's mind.Also special kudos to William Macy, as a master in acting as he will always be. I am always a huge fan of him but in Fargo, he is excellent. And of course, Buscemi is fantastic as usual.All in all, this movie is a timeless classic and a never to miss. It is such a movie that you can enjoy any time you watch and as if the first time no matter how many times you have already watched it. In my opinion, every real film lover should be thankful to Coen Brothers and all of the cast and crew for making such an unforgettable treat for us and I am definitely lucky to know this film."
MxS7HGS,"Mar 18, 2024",8/10,"I could seriously listen to these guys shoot the breeze for hours on end and never get bored. Their accents are just so captivating, and they're always so darn cheerful, it's infectious. But let me tell you, this movie? Total riot. The Coen brothers really nailed it with their quirky sense of humor, always poking fun at anything remotely serious.Seriously though, the skill behind this film is off the charts. The writing and directing are spot-on, the cinematography by Deakins is absolutely breathtaking, the acting is top-notch, and don't even get me started on the killer soundtrack. Speaking of which, let's talk about the music because, man, it's another highlight for me.Carter Burwell's score is something else. Not only is it just plain beautiful to listen to, but it adds this whole other layer to the story's sarcastic vibe. It's like the music is in on the joke, mirroring the characters' messed up lives with its haunting melodies. But amidst all the darkness, there's Marge, shining like a beacon of goodness, brilliantly portrayed by Frances McDormand.And let's talk about those winter scenes - Deakins really outdid himself capturing that desolate landscape. It's like the perfect backdrop for the characters' flat lives, highlighting the irony and humor of it all. We're all secretly rooting for Marge and eagerly waiting for her to become a mom, hoping her kid takes after her and not Norm."
asherrbh_15,"Sep 3, 2023",9/10,"As a Native Minnesotan myself, being born and raised in the urban parts of North Minneapolis, it was pretty fun watching an excellent thriller set right in my home town, I now know what to blame for the deep rooted stereotypes about how we sound and how much snow we get, (usually more than depicted, but whatever).Bearing quite a few similarities to No Country for Old Men, which I gave an 8/10, Fargo is an excellently directed thriller that bears plenty similarities to what I mentioned, no country for old men, which is another terrific thriller.Steve Buscemi stole a lot of the scenes for me, bringing an exceptional charisma, the Coen brothers also directed it brilliantly, showing the cold interior of Minnesota during the winter season, Frances MacDonald and William H. Macy are also truly brilliant.I'm gonna give Fargo an A."
Devotchka,"Jan 22, 2001",N/A,"I really enjoyed this film despite the fact that it was, as my friend so aptly put it, ""disturbing"".  The characters were wonderful, the filming was often stunning, and the script managed to present the horror of humanity in a surprisingly irreverent light."
HunterL-42,"Oct 24, 2025",7/10,"I had to watch it for film class. Not really my preferred genre, so I was surprised how much I liked it. Has great cinematography and music that really sets the scene. The characters are compelling and the plot keeps tension throughout, though neither are anything out of this world. Overall, a solid experience. I'd rate it a little over a 7.5 if this site allowed for partial-star ratings, but I can't say I'm likely to ever sit and watch it a second time."
Ed-Shullivan,"Mar 3, 2022",9/10,"The five (5) stars Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, William H. Macy, Peter Stormare, and Harve Presnell in the order listed made this a spectacular film, but without the Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel as the triple threats that they are in writing, producing and directing this dark comedy/crime film it would not have been as memorable a film that it has become.So good is this simple story line that has been repeated hundreds of times before and after this 1996 rendition of a kidnapping gone wrong but somehow the combination of these five (5) top actors quirky midwestern accents, and mannerisms, and the superb cinematography and scenes developed by the two (2) Coen brothers makes this film a classic that will surely stand the test of time and grow in stature as each decade passes us by.I would rate this film certainly in the realm of the top 100 films of the 21st century. I give it a highly rated and deserving 9 out of 10 IMDB rating. Mrs. Shullivan also agrees with my evaluation and the 2014 TV spinoff series is a deserving homage to this 1996 film classic."
bahaevengeance,"May 29, 2022",7/10,"Honestly, an ordinary movie, with a simple story. The acting was good from most of the actors except for the police, whose acting was very annoying, the cinematography was very wonderful and the soundtrack was great as well. What I did not like about the film is the slow pace of events, as well as the presence of several uninterrupted dialogues. It did not shed light on the harmful effects of greed and what a person can do for a small amount of money, nor did it embody the human soul at its worst."
bscrivener-50810,"May 14, 2016",9/10,"Fargo is a 1996 black comedy/crime drama film directed by Ethan and Joel Coen (The Coen Brothers) and stars William H. Macy, Frances McDormand and Steve Buscemi. Often seen as the film that launched the Coen Brothers successful career, Fargo without a doubt deserves all the credit it receives. The story focuses around a spineless, nervous car salesman who arranges for his wife to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of $80,000 to extort from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, in his desperation for money to repay an outstanding loan. Which ends up going horrifically wrong resulting in a series of grizzly murders. Fargo fantastically blends its sharp wit of dry humour and black comedy with its gruesome, thrilling and intriguing narrative, the two seem to go hand-in-hand perfectly with Fargo having scenes that will have you bursting out laughing and others on the edge of your seat. Fargo also features beautiful cinematography with wide, expansive shots of snow covered landscapes as well as a fitting dark and unsettling soundtrack. Each actor/actress completely owns their character making their motivations and actions clear, as well as relatable. Fargo has but a few nit-picking flaws, such as a particular scene which seems unnecessary to the advancement of the plot and feels out of place, in which Frances McDormand's character meets an old friend. Another is a plot-line which focused around Peter Stormare's character Gaear Grimsrud- not enough of the story was focused around his role as it should or could have been, also another flaw being the slight overuse of the word 'ya'. Overall, Fargo is a phenomenal film, both winning 2 well deserved Oscar's and launching the Coen Brothers career onto a new level, proving they are two of the greatest filmmakers of the modern film era. Not forgetting notifying the world of the traditional (and comedic) Minnesotan accent. Fargo is hilarious, violent, tense and intriguing. 9/10"
jmdlse,"Feb 16, 2019",7/10,"I just saw the movie couple hours ago and i liked it. I think its a good movie but it could be better, feels like the directors didnt want to risk too much and stay on a good movie.
This movie is entertaining from the beginning to the end, the actors did a very good perfomance. The story is simple and may have alredy been used in another movie, but still a good decent movie."
blackbird_00,"Oct 21, 2002",1/10,"This movie is one piece of pretentious s**t. This is a very harsh story that should be told with the integrity and honesty it deserves. Instead the Coen brothers  chose to make it some kind of black comedy. It just doesn't work. The story isn't original at all, that's what everyone should know. People that like this movie so much are blindsided by it's unconventional, pretentious approach and it's sarcastic view.It made me want to puke."
maxtbuettner,"May 7, 2018",9/10,"Fargo is about how far Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) will go to get some money and how out of control the situation becomes. The film follows pregnant chief police Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) as she tries to piece it all together. Frances McDormand gives a wonderful, Oscar winning performance as the multi-layered police chief. On the outside she has a comical personality, but she is also deeply caring. The movie is rounded together with fantastic performances from Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, and William H. Macy.
 
The movie is beautifully shot by Roger Deakins, earning him his second Oscar nomination. The greatest aspect of the film is how the Coen brother's combated the barren landscape with dark comedy. The mixture of irony, awkward moments, and laughing at inappropriate times really make this film enjoyable to watch and a great film over all."
BigJimNoFool,"Sep 5, 2020",10/10,"This is a real step up in film making for the Coens from all their previous works, to this, debatable their finest.Everything here is perfect from the pacing, the cinematography, the performances and script and the score.Marge's final few scenes encapsulate a wisdom and heartfelt frustration that is very moving and one i whole heartedly embrace.Gerry is such a loathsome, squirming, passive aggressive little rat that only the beautiful soul of Marge could be the anti-dote and she is in spades here.It's a grim tale told without any cynicism and a few wry laughs that we have come to expect from the brothers, mainly around the bugling kidnappers."
On2browse,"Oct 29, 2001",N/A,Fantastic.  One of my top four favorite movies of all time.  Its unbelievable that a performance of William H. Macy's calaber was not found to be Oscar worthy (not to say that Cuba didn't do a good job).  This is the Coen brothers greatest film so far.  Probably the greatest film they'll ever make.  Fantastic!
Spondonman,"Oct 21, 2012",7/10,"On the strength of liking the rather coarse In Bruges I was recommended to see this one, one that had passed me by but trailed for me by the recommender as an even blacker comedy. Being a sucker for black comedies I complied, and found it ingenious and engrossing fiction, but with a streak of nastiness not in In Bruges. Brainerd definitely looked colder than Bruges!Geeky husband (Macy) arranges for two hit men, one dumb the other kind of funny looking, to kidnap his wife so they can all share the ransom money to come from her rich father. Except it all goes wrong - especially for a lot of innocent passers by, which is something I always find difficult to extract humour from as I never know what or in particular who lies around the next corner myself. Some funny alleged Minnesota mannerisms and accents from the cast, the pregnant Sheriff Marge had some of the most whimsical lines and was a convincing eccentric, to this outsider anyway. Favourite bits: Her police outrage when she sees Macy Fleein' The Interview; the funny looking guy getting shot in the teeth and continually whinging about it; trying to guess exactly how Macy's wife met her end, how often Ya was uttered throughout and where's the money buried. Nice photography and the music was atmospheric and excellent too, although it sometimes put in mind 17th century France. I just wish the main characters and their many foibles had been fleshed out a little more, otoh it was all nicely packed into 90 minutes...maybe the rather pointless meeting of Marge with Mike could have been jettisoned?Although redolent of Twin Peaks it's one of the best films from the '90's I've seen from my limited experience, episodic but good and enigmatic enough to bear repeated viewings."
filipemanuelneto,"Sep 8, 2022",8/10,"When I saw this movie for the first time, a few years ago, I didn't understand it, and it annoyed me a lot. However, I've always heard good things about it, and after seeing several Cohen films that I liked, I realized the film's potential and decided to rewatch it. I did it at a good time: the film is better than I thought, and I just didn't know how to evaluate it as it deserved.The film begins with a note indicating that it is based on real events. It's a joke, actually, as it's entirely fictional. The story, however, can be based on several crimes, because it's nothing that we haven't seen on some TV news: a man who desperately needs money decides to hire two criminals and fake the kidnapping of his own wife, in order to convince his wealthy father-in-law to pay a fat ransom. It turns out that, as is so often the case in Cohen Brothers movies, things don't go as planned, the criminal duo's control gets out of hand and people start to die, as the local authorities, which practically boil down to a pregnant sheriff and a few colleagues, try to investigate what is going on.The film made a huge sensation among critics and at festivals. It was nominated for several Oscars, but only won two statuettes (Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress). It was also considered by many to be the best film by the Cohen Brothers, a highly relative consideration, which largely depends on the personal taste of the person who claims it. Anyway, it's a good movie, quite tense and dramatic, and where the comedy is in the brutally ironic way in which things happen.Frances McDormand is an actress who deserves particular attention in this film. She's not the kind of law enforcement officer we'd expect to see, because she appears to have a friendliness and sweetness that goes hand in hand with uncompromising law enforcement or even the use of firearms. However, her character does that and is actually very good at following her lead. Another actor to be congratulated is Steve Buscemi. He gives a huge performance, perhaps one of the best of his career so far. Next to him, Peter Stormare gives us the image of a cold and few-spoken criminal, who exerts brutal violence when he gets angry. William Macy is convincing in the role of the car salesman, with a slimy overdose of hypocritical politeness and cowardice.Technically, the film has excellent cinematography, where snow and gray tones are the dominant accent. Interestingly, it seems that a lot of artificial snow was used in the film in order to achieve the icy and inhospitable look that the directors wanted. The sets and costumes are very good, particularly McDormand's costume and her hairstyle. The film uses a lot of very good visual and special effects, particularly in the more violent scenes, like the one where the killer tries to tear his victim apart in a shredder. The soundtrack has one of the most interesting main themes in the Cohens' filmography."
EyeoftheBeholder1,"Jan 6, 2010",10/10,"Great film. Coen brothers did a fine job with this one. I really dig the fact that despite it's very serious nature the script has some very humorous moments which blend in very nicely and don't stick out at all. McDormand, Macy, and Buscemi were fantastic in their respective roles. McDormand's portrayal was very charming and I enjoyed watching her in this very much.The setting of the film really added atmosphere to the film and it wouldn't be the same without it, along with the musical score. Cinematography was top notch.I recommend this to everyone!"
djbeardpaperclip,"Dec 9, 2024",6/10,"There seems to be a Tarantino influence to this film, with a few twists. There is no snappy dialogue. Indeed there is almost a total lack of dialogue. The two villains barely talk. There is also no great mystery to the detective deduction. The female cop unravels the mystery fairly effortlessly, as the crime goes progressively wrong. The film jolts along with serial shocks of sudden and sporadic violence - like a cartoon, complete with squirty blood.The thing that starts to irritate is the dim-witted stupidity of almost everyone, and the eventually irritating use of 'yah, yah', every time anyone talks. Most characters seem to be portrayed as total thickos out in the sticks of Brainerd, Minnesota. Brain-nerd,get it?""Oh yah.....yah yah""."
colinjscrook,"Dec 14, 2010",1/10,"As mentioned in the title I really have no idea why this movie is held in such high regard. Did I miss something obvious? The plot was insubstantial and then the movie seems in a hurry to wrap itself up. The humour for me was perhaps a little to quirky and I did not find it funny in the least.I should have been warned by the mention of an Oscar, that tends to mean its going to be rubbish.I have read that its primarily a love story, I would like to ask how, where and when?The one redeeming feature was...wait a sec there wasn't one."
dbdumonteil,"Jan 31, 2004",9/10,"When it was released in 1996, ""Fargo"" met public and especially critical acclaim and collected several rewards. But I think that if the Prize for the Best Directing at the Cannes festival was absolutely justified, on the other hand, Frances McDormand didn't deserve her Oscar in 1997. William H.Macy should have won it. His performance as an hypocritical and dishonest car seller is powerful and unforgettable.What is amazing in ""Fargo"" are the landscapes, the sceneries and above all the characters. The Coen brothers said about the movie: "" the landscapes, the sceneries are an integral part of the movie. They are typical of the Midwest as well as the characters with their sensitivity and their mentality"". They know what they are talking about since they come from the Midwest, more precisely from the Minnesota. As a consequence, they must have been at ease by making this thrilling movie.Concerning the characters, they are the subject of a realistic and down-to-earth description. Each of them has a different but not very status-enhancing characteristic: William H.Macy's cues are almost always hesitating, unfinished or unsure, the two gangsters are just silly guys (one of them nearly never talks) and most of the inhabitants including Frances McDormand are narrow-minded. By this way, the Coen brothers wanted to underline their meanness of mind and the fact that they are firmly rooted in their land of the Minnesota.Apart from the characters and although the movie is based on a true story, I am obliged to recognize that the script and the way the movie is designed have nothing new. But nonetheless, the tone is daring, there's black humor cleverly used (notably in bloody moments) that contrasts with a quiet even neutral directing. As for the snowy landscapes, they will later inspire Sam Raimi for ""a simple plan"" (1998), a movie as successful as ""Fargo"".""Fargo"" is eventually the finest movie made by the Coen brothers and its place in the top 250 is thoroughly justified."
2782,"Aug 30, 1998",10/10,"This is the best movie I saw in a theater since Jurassic Park (only because it's such a ""theater"" movie). I have absolutely no idea how this movie didn't beat out ""The English Patient"" for Best Picture. Frances McDormand, although not appearing until way into the film, truly deserved that Best Actress Award. I really thought the English Patient sucked."
dhauff78,"Feb 4, 2023",10/10,"Although ostensibly a crime thriller, Fargo is really a dark comedy and probably the best one ever. I love how this movie makes fun of midwestern culture and total schmucks like Jerry Lundegaard and Carl Showalter.Frances McDormand is the best actor of her generation and perhaps the most underrated. I think she doesn't get enough praise sometimes.The Coen Brothers have certainly crafted their best with Fargo. I think it's even better than No Country For Old Men or The Big Lebowski (two films I also love).Not too many films of more than one genre can be good let alone great. Fargo is a true masterpiece and a must see experience."
thomascorbett88,"Apr 15, 2014",N/A,"Beneath the pleasantries and politeness of a remote town, a horrible tragedy follows a bumbling extortion attempt. A greedy car salesman overlooks his own family and leads this dark and at sometimes humorous true account of events. The courage of the police officer to chase the scent but at all times carry a smile, manages to separate the daily tragedy of her work and maintain her domestic happiness. The trio of criminals all behave at their own whim with little care to who steps in their way, no matter how trivial the concern. A classic tale of the allure of greed clouding better judgment and upholding the peace in a town unaccustomed to the consequences of a crime spree."
nikosklimentos,"Jan 7, 2022",6/10,"Recently noticed that a lot of these IMDB reviews are outdated. The movie was just okay, but nothing special in 2022. I'm a HUGE fan of the Fargo series and I prefer seasons one and two over this film. The movie isn't bad at all, but I finished it and was bummed afterward because I thought it was going to be amazing. Definitely watch it if you came here after watching the series, but don't expect to be blown away."
cbentrott,"May 3, 2021",8/10,"Being from Minnesota, this movie is unreal. The amount of Minnesotan shoutouts and city name drops is fantastic. In true Coen brothers fashion, the movie is a slow burn with sarcastic dialogue throughout sprinkled with some crazy twist violence. Great film from beginning to end."
auto2113,"May 5, 2002",6/10,"William H.Macy is my fave actor at the moment. He has been in a long list alongside such names like John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, and Matt Damon. To me, Macy makes this film a whole lot better than it should be. To me, it's a very basic plot with an overall average acting performance bar the unbeatable Mr. Macy. Frances McDormand got an oscar for her performance. I couldn't believe this after watching the film because to me she comes across as a very dim-witted talentless actress. Of course, a lot of people would say that was what her character's personality was like, but to me, I see her as not a dimwitted character, but as a poor actress who is failing to make a connection with me. I despised her in this film.Macy on the other hand, played his character with such excellence, that this film was the reason why I love the guy as much as I do now. His character is perfect, he says the silly lines perfectly, and when he's in a pickle, I love the way he makes it seem like nothing's happening... the scene in the motel bathroom as an example.The storyline as I previously mentioned is very basic. A car salesman needs money, so he hires two guys to hold his wife hostage, and then claim a huge ransom off her wealthy father. Things go wrong though due to the mistakes of the two criminals, and then it's a case of the hot-shot police officer to find the criminals who've left a bloody trail in their wake. It doesn't sound gripping stuff, tho neither The Usual Suspects on its back cover and we all know about that don't we?So Fargo... it is good, don't get me wrong. Some of the acting performances are top notch but don't expect a twisting crime thriller... it's more comedy than serious!PROS: + Macy + The conversations within are pretty funny. + Steve Buscemi plays a good crook.CONS:Frances McDormand does my head in! She's so annoying! - The storyline's a bit basic. - That other crook lacks belief. - Nothing stands out as a major point in the film."
rtromb43,"Apr 26, 2016",6/10,"So many people told me that this was a ""must see"", but I wasn't very impressed. The plot had so much potential and that is the only reason that it was somewhat entertaining.I couldn't get over how stupid every single character in this whole entire movie was. EVERY character seemed to have an IQ below 70. From the criminals to the police officers, all seemed to lack any form of intelligence based on the exchanges of dialog between characters.I think that ultimately this movie is one that should be watched. Perhaps if I watched it a second time I would enjoy it more. This movie is so highly regarded that my first though after watching it was, ""Did I miss something?""."

theognis2,"Feb 27, 2022",9/10,"Perfect casting, acting, directing, writing, photography and music distinguish this outstanding mixture of the comic and pathetic, although much of the humor revolves around exaggerated midwestern accents. A bit of schmaltz is a minor demerit, but it comes in at a trim 98 minutes. It can be seen several times with much satisfaction. William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi became stars and Frances McDormand edged out Kristin Scott Thomas (""The English Patient"") for an Oscar."
adamonIMDb,"Apr 22, 2019",8/10,"'Fargo' is another quirky gem from the Coen brothers and one of the best black comedy I've seen from the 90s. I always finds the Coens' films to be hugely enjoyable but this one was particularly rewarding for me.I thought the plot was great and the characters fun and entertaining. The dark and subtle humour was also right up my street and provided lots of good laughs.I'm not sure how much of this supposedly 'true story' is actually true, but the storyline was clearly never intended to be taken seriously. That said, it is also quite effective as a thriller and as silly as the characters and plot are, it does have you gripped and wanting to know what happens next.A great film all round - interesting, absorbing and yet light-hearted and highly entertaining."
ralphgillis,"Sep 2, 2021",8/10,"2 September 2000Fargo is a captivating thriller that has a straightforward story but it's effective because it catches the viewer's attention in it's artistic value. The performances are sublime, every character is interesting.Steve Buscemi and Peter Storemare are great together and both play their roles perfectly. Frances McDormand won an oscar for her performance. William H. Macy makes you sympathise for his character because of how desperate and troubled he looks throughout the movie. The performances are top notch, the entire cast did a great job.The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery is ominous and can feel quite claustrophobic. It seems as if the snow adds tension to the story and keeps these characters in a bubble of trouble. A place you can't escape from. Every shot feels precised and intricate as if it was meant to be this way.The story caught my interest throughout it's entire runtime. The movie creates tension in a subtle way by quickly showing the viewer the danger without notice, all of that is done without a single sound signifying danger is on the way. This technique should be used more often in horror movies because it creates a tense atmosphere for a considerably long amount of time as opposed to a few seconds of jumpiness, it is the opposite of a ""jump scare"". I might not be picking the best film but there are other films that prove this technique of film-making is one to keep.They could've improved the pace of the movie if they got rid of the useless side-story of the former high school friend trying to seduce McDormand. That scene should've been included in the deleted scenes. It would've also been a bit informative if we could understand how Mr Lundegaard got himself in this tough situation.I recommend Fargo for it's interesting plot, enticing characters and overall artistic value."
bill_golden,"Nov 24, 2005",9/10,"What more can be said after 487 viewer comments? For #488, all I will say is that, after watching this three times, Fargo is a fine piece of cinema, with an emphasis on a minimalist approach to story-telling and without much in the way of theatrics. The setting is bleak, the dialog is mostly direct and to-the-point, and the characters are well-drawn, what few main characters there are. I thought Steve Buscemi was wonderful as the villain in a humorously sick way. The one negative comment I have is that I feel the movie ends much too abruptly: too many loose threads left hanging. I thought the viewer was entitled to know a little bit more about why Jerry (William H. Macy) would go to such outlandish lengths to raise money as to stage his own wife's kidnapping. The fact that he ""owed money"" or ""got in over his head"" wasn't quite enough for me as an explanation since I had kept asking myself during the course of this escapade, ""Why? Exactly why is he doing this?"" We never really find out except in the most vague terms. All in all, probably my favorite Coen Brothers film."
tedg,"Aug 18, 2006",N/A,"The Coens are masters of the tease. By that I mean they'll find a closely embroidered dress and then goof with its perfection. They'll pull this and that element of the colored threads out so that its frayed, disturbing the scene so carefully constructed by the original craftswoman. Superficially it looks more homemade, more genuine this way. But if you look closely you'll see that what they've done is a matter of orchestrated destruction. Things defined by their distance from other things.Past that point it is merely a matter of whether the teasing engages or not.Their previous movie was not well received. The original garment was a combination of a mild Capra screwball and a 30's newspaper fold of a sassy woman detective. The noir mechanics were made explicit, as were the cinematic components.The audience  by this I mean the general paying audience  stayed away. They just weren't in the mood for clever deconstruction, no matter how polished.This is a reaction. Its a wonderful project, just wonderful in its way, but also sad in the implied tightness behind the decisions you see.What they've done is frayed the garment on the inside. Everything is sparse, bleak. All the camera setups are overly simplified, all the emotional mechanics understated. Most of it is buried in the snow.If this movie were made by anyone else, it would just be amusing, a calm sketch of a deliberately uncaffeinated selling itself as if it were a chain of simple products.But it isn't. Its a suppressed visit by extremists pretending to not be extreme. Its Lynch doing ""Straight Story"" and not asking us to know that over every dusk hued horizon is one of his ragged unreal movies.Because of this, we see small gateways into the world of the Dude, or the Sirens. The unborn child will enter a different world. The postage stamp will fly to a different world (when the rates change).Watch it for the simple garment, a dress covered by a coat. Watch it for the fraying and teasing on the inside, and imagine the colorful embroidery disturbed on the out.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
TheTheatreKidFrom90s,"Jan 11, 2010",6/10,"Fargo is a movie that has an interesting story, it is a good movie, but also well directed with a snowy cinematography. There are outstanding actors such as Wlliam H. Macy, Peter Stormare, Steve Buscemi. There is also Frances Mc Dormand, another outstanding actress, even if she is so unsympathetic in this movie, she is usually cold anyway, but. If Fargo had been made after A Simple Plan, I would have said cliché or an imitation, but I can say that it was a pioneer. This is a crime movie, a bag full of money, two killers, a female cop and misfortunes. As said, a good movie, but no more than that. This is the problem. It is seen as one of the best movies of 1990s, some say it is the best Coen Brothers movie by far! Almost every Coen movie is compared with Fargo, so found disappointing, critics say that it was a masterpiece. This is the problem. The movie is good, but there is nothing that great in the movie. By the way, Fargo is not flawed, but I did not like the end. It was raw and too simple for such a movie. Honestly, I liked A Simple Plan more, even if it was inspired by Fargo and made later. Because it was stunning, but Fargo is not. At least it should not have been in IMDb Top 250."
ackstasis,"Nov 19, 2007",7/10,"It's probably inevitable that, after hearing so much about its greatness, 'Fargo' proves something of a minor disappointment. After numerous critical successes {including their finest film to date, 'Miller's Crossing (1990)' and the Palme d'Or-winning 'Barton Fink (1991)'}, Joel and Ethan Coen apparently struck gold with 'Fargo (1996),' the ""true story"" of a kidnapping and murder in the icy wastelands of Minnesota. The film is a thematic retread of the brothers' debut picture, 'Blood Simple (1984)' {of which I was not overly-fond}, and explores how a seemingly-simple crime can escalate into the tragic and devastating destruction of innocent (and not-so-innocent) lives. The Coens would return once again to this popular theme with the accomplished film-noir, 'The Man Who Wasn't There (2001),' which is arguably one of their best efforts. 'Fargo' was the filmmakers' first real Oscar success, retrieving seven Academy Award nominations and two wins (Best Writing and Best Actress in a Leading Role {Francis McDormand}). However, the film's Best Picture chances were upset by Anthony Minghella's majestic wartime romance epic, 'The English Patient.'In a dreary small-town region of the United States, where the road is perpetually covered in frost and a sheet of ice affixes itself to your car windscreen, money-troubled father Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) plots a simple, fool-proof method of acquiring funds. He hires two dubious-looking thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife (Kristin Rudrüd), in order to extort ransom money from his wealthy, domineering father-in-law (Wade Gustafson). However, things don't go quite to plan, and after the two low-life criminals murder a state trooper and two passing witnesses, local Brainerd Chief of Police Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) arrives to investigate. She, like almost every other character in the film, has the jovial disposition and exaggerated mannerisms of typical Midwestern small-town folk, discussing a triple-homicide as though somebody has just stolen a cookie from the jar, and making frequent use of such quaint phrases as ""You betcha,"" ""Aw Jeez,"" ""Okie-Dokie"" and ""Yah.""The Coens have done a lot right with 'Fargo.' Their decision to blend a thrilling tale of deceit and murder with moments of satirical  almost slapstick  comedy creates a unique and interesting contrast that sets the film apart from most thrillers. William H. Macy is at his jittery best as a potential con-man so hopelessly inept that he can't call off the dangerous ruse because he never acquired the kidnappers' phone number. Steve Buscemi is, likewise, fantastic as Carl Showalter, a ""funny-looking"" weasel with a hot temper. Peter Stormare is suitably psychotic as the sullen but dangerous Gaear Grimsrud, even if his role just required him to remain silent and look creepy. Then we come to Frances McDormand (a.k.a. Mrs. Joel Coen), who, regardless of her talents as an actress, has annoyed me in every film in which I've seen her {which basically just covers 'Blood Simple,' 'Fargo' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There,' though to a lesser extent in the latter}.I know that Marge Gunderson is supposed to be one of the Coen Brothers' most entertaining creations, but her character somehow seemed so pointless. We spend all our time following her lightweight attempts at an investigation, and yet all I cared about was the kidnapping and how Jerry was coping with it all. Perhaps to hide the fact that Marge has almost nothing to do, the Coens toss in a couple of extraneous, dead-end minor characters who serve no purpose other than to distract me from the more exciting segments of the story. All things considered, 'Fargo' is a solid, albeit flawed, thriller/comedy that is characteristic of the Coens in every respect. Allow me to reiterate that William H. Macy was absolutely phenomenal, and definitely gives the film's greatest performance, though I did think that his character gave himself away too easily. In the grand scheme of things, 'Fargo' could certainly scrape into the directors' top five films, though my hope is that their latest release, 'No Country For Old Men (2007),' will oust it from the list."

TrashcnMn,"Sep 4, 2001",2/10,"""Heh heh, they talk funny.""That's the only real reason I could even IMAGINE anybody thinking this movie is funny.  This movie is really not that interesting.  The one critical thing that I noticed about this movie is that you don't care about the characters.  The apathy is AMAZING.  I really could not care less if a friggin' nuclear missile hit Fargo and all the characters died.  Normally, for a movie to be good and have suspense, you need to feel for the characters (ie Memento, American Beauty, Pulp Fiction), but I just didn't feel that in this movie."
AvinashPatalay,"Jul 8, 2010",N/A,"Heard quite a lot about ""Coen Bros"" but never really got around to watch any of their body of work. When I watched ""Fargo"" today I was spellbound by the cinematic genius('es). Considering this movie is about 15-years old it would be an understatement to say that their writing and cinematic sensibilities is beyond expression.The characterisation of each actor leaves an impression. For instance unlike other movies in ""Fargo"" a cop is just not a character, he has a life too, a family and emotions. Unlike a cog-in-the-wheel the writing goes a bit deeper to flesh out the character more effectively thereby making them more true-to-life and connectable.Performance wise, as stated earlier every character is a gem.۩ William Hacey:: The backbone of the plot and hence he ought to have delivered good in good condition. He delivers to the utmost perfection. Perhaps the best in his career.۩ Steve Buscemi:: A hidden gem then as opposed to now. And his spark showed way back then. A very natural and gifted actor.۩ Frances McDormand:: She literally gets into the skin of the Marge.۩ Harve Presnell:: very regal and assertive performance.The dark humour is plenty and slightly shocking, which is kind of expected. The background music is paced well with the narrative and does linger in the head for a while.Watch it once and you can be absolutely certain to come back and relish the characters all over again."
yaseminturkish,"Apr 16, 2002",6/10,"The first time I saw Fargo in 1996 I enjoyed it mainly because I was hoping that it would edge out the highly over-rated snorefest The English Patient at the Academy Awards.  Now I'm aware of the fact that Fargo is also highly over-rated.  Three generations of my family grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota.  The mannerisms and speech used by William H Macy and Frances McDormand is realistic but why should I remember this screenplay twenty years from now?  Apparently it is a true story which must have all the fans of Survivor running for their local Blockbuster stores along with the fans of America's Most Wanted and Cops.  When I want to see reality that will impact me for years to come I'll rent something historically significant like Malcolm X or a documentary film like No Man's Land or One Day in September.  These movies are by the books as reality movies should be and don't look for black comedy that offends the memories of the people who were most closely affected by the tragedy.I did appreciate the effort on the part of the Coen brothers to add their usual wit to the mix.  William H Macy was hilarious as the father and husband who was more worried about money than about the lives of his family. It was a somewhat enchanting experience to watch him try to keep everything under control while slightly breaking down with every passing moment. Frances McDormand has proven herself to be talented in Almost Famous and The Man who Wasn't There but she is highly over-rated here.  Perhaps it's my bias that was putting all bets on Emily Watson's extraordinary performance in Breaking the Waves for the Academy Award.  For me McDormand was adequate and appeared to be having fun but not memorable 20 years down the road.  The always reliable Steve Buscemi (he should have won for Ghost World) stole the show here.Fargo is a film that I'd recommend to the reality-television audience and to serious fans of the Coen brothers films.  It enchants on some level but may disgust some viewers who will be perplexed that this really did happen. It suffices as a rental on a Saturday night when you want to see what all the fuss is about.  Be prepared however, if your from Fargo or Minnesota to be somewhat offended.  After all, when you see Frances McDormand, you'll be looking in the mirror.6/10"
fernandoschiavi,"Apr 15, 2023",8/10,"Masters in the art of telling a good story through cinematographic cameras, the Coen brothers tend to stand out for their very peculiar characteristics, such as their narrative economy, the hints of black humor that permeate their films and their remarkable ability to create striking scenes. All of this can be found in the excellent ""Fargo"", a feature that certainly deserves a prominent place among the countless interesting works of the Coens, which is no small thing, considering the vast and qualified filmography of the duo. Beneath the surface of a suspense thriller and police investigation, the screenplay for ""Fargo"" (written, as usual, by Ethan and Joel Coen themselves) tells the story of desperate Jerry (William H. Macy), a manager at a car dealership. Automaker who faces financial difficulties and decides to plan the kidnapping of his own wife, Jean (Kristin Rudrud). Problem is, things don't go as well as planned, and when kidnappers Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) commit multiple murders, determined cop Marge (Frances McDormand) starts investigating the case.Responsible not only for the script, direction and production, but also for editing ""Fargo"" under the fictitious name of Roderick Jaynes, the Coens confirm their ability to keep the viewer attentive to the intriguing events that follow, leading the narrative in a direct and efficient. Filled with interesting dialogues, the creative script opens up a range of possibilities at every moment, always brilliantly working on how chance influences our lives. However, unlike the characters who can never predict what will happen next, the Coens demonstrate total control over what we see on the screen, creating absolutely electrifying moments (which I will come back to in a moment) amidst the sea of tranquility of the peaceful city from Brainerd. However, despite all the suspense, ""Fargo"" is also filled with a lot of dark humor, featuring a series of hilarious moments that serve to break the growing tension of the narrative, such as when Jean runs away tied up on arrival at the captivity or in the funny interview of Marge with the hookers.Betting on graphic violence, as in the scene of the murder of the policeman, in the delivery of money in a hotel and in the arrest of Grimsrud, the Coens create a chain of events that only worsen Jerry's situation and, precisely because they show the tragic results of their actions, make the viewer care about the fate of the characters. However, despite working very well as a thriller, ""Fargo"" relies on dark humor to address other issues, functioning as a study on the lifestyle of that peculiar region of the USA. One of the aspects that deserves extra attention is the cinematography, directed by Roger Deakins. Jerry is normally framed at the shoulders or closer. This type of cut accentuates the intensity of the scenes: the viewer can feel almost trapped by the character's gaze or emotions, bearing in mind that the actor's proximity to the camera leaves little more space to look at, just the expression of disgrace of this man. Like him, we have nowhere to escape. One of the most visually striking scenes takes place after the protagonist's father-in-law refuses to give him the amount of money that would completely cover his debts. Jerry ends up leaving the building and sees him from above, heading for his car. The canvas is completely covered by the white of the snow and the only color is his small and insignificant figure, illustrating the solitude he was relegated to, completely abandoned to his fate. Furthermore, the vases symmetrically placed in space almost corner man in his own misery.Investing in icy colors and masterfully exploring the rawness of the neighboring regions of Minnesota and North Dakota, full of roads surrounded by snow that blend into the skyline and create a look that is both beautiful and frightening at the same time, Deakins' photography is crucial to illustrate the loneliness of the people who live there. This isolation even collaborates to increase the tension in key moments of the narrative, such as the night of the murders, where we know that the innocents who cross the path of the kidnappers will rarely escape with their lives on that cold and abandoned road. Incidentally, this chase scene is among the great moments of the feature, making the viewer glued to the chair while following its outcome.Wearing sober suits or clothes that convey an austere image (Mary Zophres costumes), the characters of ""Fargo"" represent the central force of the narrative. With his drawn accents and sharp dialogues that betray the funny way of speaking, even supporting characters with small participations become a separate attraction, as Mr. Mohra (Bain Boehlke), who delights us by telling how she heard from the drunken Carl where he would be hiding. On the other hand, this grace will hardly be perceived by a spectator who does not have at least some notion of English (it would be like trying to explain to a foreigner the grace of an accent from any region of Brazil). Also amusing is Peter Stormare's performance as Grimsrud, Carl's mute and menacing partner - who, as usual, is masterfully played by Steve Buscemi, a true expert in the art of playing criminals.Appearing fragile and hesitant most of the time, Jerry from the great William H. Macy seems unable to impose himself in any dialogue, stopping to speak at the slightest sign that he will be interrupted and stammering several times, in a clear sign of lack of confidence that the actor demonstrates it very well. This feeling, combined with the character's determination to seek a way out of every obstacle that arises (and there are many), is essential for the development of the narrative, since we can rarely predict the character's next steps. But if the entire cast has a great performance, the highlight is Frances McDormand, who gives enormous charisma and a disconcerting simplicity to Marge, a woman seven months pregnant who dedicates herself to her work and her family with the same intensity, calling her attention whenever she enters the scene thanks also to the great performance of the actress. It is she who calms the viewer with her simple reasoning and her direct way of solving problems, something that is clear, for example, in her visit to Jerry's office and in her conversation with an old college friend.Among so many great moments, it is worth highlighting the excellent kidnapping scene, in which we see Jean paralyzed in front of the image of the kidnapper looking into the house through the window. Notice how Joel conducts the scene with precision, investing in black humor to ease the tension - after all, only in a Coen film would a kidnapper calmly walk around the house looking for an ointment while the victim, after trying to hide, leaves wrapped in a curtain and hides. Crashes to the ground. Likewise, the way in which the big guy Grimsrud tries to disentangle himself from his partner's body in the third act is simultaneously comic and tragic. What is never tragic is the result of the work of the Coens, who, even when they don't get it right, manage to make great films. When they are inspired then, the result can only be spectacular, and this is what happens in ""Fargo"", a tense and fun film, which has a talented cast to become one of the best examples of what the Coens are capable of.The way the Coen brothers develop Fargo's story is wonderful. With mastery they manage to create chaos through a huge chain of lies, without making the story complicated or surreal. With a very well written script and great performances, they show how one lie leads to another until it turns into a huge snowball. In other words, they prove that if you're not a good liar, it's better to tell the truth soon because sooner or later you're going to fall.""Fargo"" is a work of impeccable script and unique execution that manages to create different reactions from the spectator, managing to bring him into the film, immersing him completely. His work with three parallel narratives guarantees a unique dynamic to the film, which is, at the same time, fast and slow without ever losing harmony. It definitely has enough material to be explored in the recent TV series adaptation, even if it's a risky bet. It is an unmissable film that leaves us wondering if those events really happened."
ElyesaDogru,"Aug 31, 2024",6/10,"Fargo leaves a lasting impression, exposing the dark underbelly of the American Dream. Jerry Lundegaard's ""small"" scam, which begins as a seemingly harmless plan, quickly spirals out of control, leading to a tragic series of events. The film masterfully depicts the deep voids in the lives of ordinary people and the extreme lengths they might go to to fill them.Marge Gunderson shines as a beacon of light within this darkness. When she asks, ""And all for what?"" we, too, are prompted to reflect: Is all this violence, bloodshed, and pain just for a few dollars? This question forces us to confront the selfish side of human nature, while Marge's warmth and moral steadfastness remind us that hope and innocence still exist.Throughout the film, the bodies buried in the snow symbolize the internal decay of each character. Jerry's seemingly insignificant scheme reflects how fragile and dangerous the American Dream can be. How easily our ""small"" desires, ambitions, and self-interests can lead to catastrophic consequences.Fargo also scrutinizes themes of family and love. Jerry's greed jeopardizes his family's safety, while Marge prioritizes her loving marriage above all else, showcasing the clash between two very different worlds. The quiet, ordinary love shared by Marge and Norm stands as a refuge amidst the film's dark and cold atmosphere.In conclusion, Fargo brilliantly illustrates the chaos lurking beneath ordinary lives, the dark sides of human nature, and the epic dramas that can unfold even in the smallest towns. It challenges the viewer to reconsider what truly matters in life and helps us find ourselves as we search for innocence amidst the darkness."
frazierandrew-63114,"Nov 5, 2020",7/10,Movie was fine. A bit overrated. I don't think anyone had a great performance. The show greatly improved the story and was much much better.
mist,"May 21, 2003",1/10,"Am i the only one that thinks/feels that this film sucks...???When i saw the film, ALL the ""great"" scenes had already been seen in trailers and review programs and the rest was pure s***.And how could Frances get an Academy Award for this?????She just waggled around like a pregnant duck and tried to speak english with a swedish accent.Check out ""Murder on the Orient Express"" and see how Ingrid Bergman did it. There´s a fine actor/actress......"
vaughans-77417,"Mar 23, 2024",10/10,"SO well done. The casting is outstanding. Each actor has found the core of the character, that solid foundation from which everything else is built effortlessly. At least that's the way the actors make it seem. The performances are organic, spun from an organic thread that runs through the performances moment to moment, scene to scene, episode to episode. You never see the strings...There's Ben Wishaw's deadly serious and morally reborn Rabbi Milligan, who will kill without hesitation in defense of a higher ethic and code. And Salvatore Esposito's clownish and wildly dangerous Gaetano, a lover of opera and a complete psycho. Jessie Buckley kills as Nurse Mayflower, a a quirky Angel of Death. Buckley proves that killers CAN be fun-nee!Jason Schwartzman deserves an award, playing a mob boss like no other you've seen before. He shifts between ruthlessness and wit with ease, between boss and pretender in the blink of an eye, and somehow manages to convince us that he is the Top-Dog Italian in town despite that he looks like he more belongs behind the counter at the local Jewish deli. One great moment-to-moment choice after another. Brilliant casting choice.And then there is Chris Rock. Hard to buy in at first, cuz. ""It's Chris Rock!"" But with each episode, you buy in more and more. Head of the local Black crime family, the more ruthless he becomes, the better it gets. No trace of the funny man here. And that makes his performance all the more revelatory. I mean, who casts Rock as a mob boss, in a drama? Well, it worked!Direction is great, sound and lighting and all production values are high. And the writing is marvelous!Really good show, and too bad we can't binge and have to wait a week."
bpw182,"Sep 16, 2005",10/10,"If you are annoyed by the word, ""yeah"" then this is not the movie for you. With that said, this movie is freakin awesome. It's great plot and storyline along with amazing performances by Steve Buscemi and Frances McDormand and it's a great thriller. William H. Macy is also really good. It shows how a small, petty crime turns into six people dying and two people being arrested. Some of it maybe be confusing, but it's still a great thriller. To add on to that, I thought it was pretty funny too. To wrap it up, I wouldn't suggest this to anyone younger than fourteen or fifteen, because you see people having sex and it drops the ""F"" bomb a lot. Also some mild violence, but still a great movie. 9.5/10. For Fans Of: THE USUAL SUSPECTS OR ANY COEN BROTHERS MOVIES"
DennisLittrell,"Jan 17, 2000",8/10,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Fargo is the kind of movie that appeals to people who have seen a lot of movies because everything is surprising and unexpected. The cop's a woman (Frances McDormand). Pregnant. The perps are psychos of course, but there are three of them and each is a different breed of psycho. William H. Macy is a car salesman who dreams up a scheme to cheat his rich father in law out of a million dollars by getting some degenerates to kidnap his wife. He's a white collar sociopath who always lies whenever his lips are moving unless there is some very good reason to tell the truth. One of the degenerates is a big silent guy (Peter Stormare) who kills people as one squishes bugs. The other (Steve Buscemi) is an ugly little bantam who lies and cheats and kills and steals and whines until finally somebody puts him out of his misery.This is Fargo, North Dakota, where people are country and it's cold and not very sophisticated. The movie makes gentle fun of the locals while guiding us to identify with them. McDormand eats a whole lot of Hardee's and Arby's and greasy dishes from the cafeteria piled high on her plate. She's eating for two. She loves her husband and he loves her. They lie in bed at night and watch TV. She's the police chief. She meets an old admirer in the big city. He's Asian. She is just curious. He is desperate. She has a self-effacing, aw-sucks, I'm not too bright (but I really am) style reminiscent of Tyne Daly in TV's ""Cagey and Lacy"" from some years back. Her husband Norm is a big guy who cooks for her and is an artist who paints wildlife. One of his duck paintings becomes a postage stamp. They all say ""Yaw"" a lot.The forlorn cold and desolate landscape of North Dakota is a Americana locale not used cinematically since I don't know when-Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter (1973), I guess. The script and direction are tidy without being too flashy. Everything is designed to surprise or bemuse the audience. Even the accents. There is the requisite quota of bright red blood; plenty of bullets puncture flesh and split bone. There's some gutter sex and a few shocking sights (one of the perps stuffs the other into a wood chip machine). All in all it's a slick, carefully crafted thriller with an artistic veneer, nicely photographed. It's clear that Coen and Coen have watched the movies of Atom Egoyan, Gus Van Sant, David Lynch, Oliver Stone, etc., and here pay them the sincere compliment of imitation with variation-or is it the other way around?"
dhuey,"Aug 28, 2005",N/A,"I love this film. One thing it never reveals is why the Macy character badly needed so much cash in the first place. First, this need for cash leads to the fraud with GMAC Financing (early in the film), but then, of course, it leads to the series of events in the main plot of the film.Anyone care to guess what the Macy character did to need so much cash, so quickly? We see no substance abuse or gambling tendencies. I'm stumped.One minor gripe with the film: the ""true story"" bit. It isn't. I don't understand why the Coens would feel the need to make that up, but they did."
MovieAddict2016,"Oct 14, 2003",10/10,"There are a great many reasons for the extraordinary success of ""Fargo."" One of the reasons is the uproar it caused upon release when nosy little reporters found out it was not really based on true events like the disclaimer says at the beginning of the film. Then there was the tragedy of the Japanese woman who went looking for the buried stash of money and froze to death. The press had, what movie characters always call, a ""field day"" with this story. They overlooked the fact that she had left behind a suicide note and was informed by police the story was false upon arrival in Minnesota, where she was picked up by a worried police officer. She had a death wish.And the other reason for success is, of course, because the movie is one of the best of all films--a true ""story"" if ever there was one. It's more than a scathing social satire, more than a dark comedy, more than a great drama with a fabulous story filled with irony and coincedences and morals and so on and so forth. It's more than a great movie. It's superb.Marge Gunderson has become a sort of cultural character. People quote her like the Terminator or Charles Foster Kane or George Bailey or Darth Vader. She's so famous that I do not think many people realize Marge essentially comes in around forty minutes into the 98-minute movie. Yet that's what people think of when they hear the word ""Fargo""--Marge Gunderson--and so it just shows what an impact a film like ""Fargo"" made. And not only impact, but the remembrance of characters we love to remember.Marge provides a sort of balance between the wild and the crazy. She is the moral character of the story who juggles the two and tries to keep them from falling. When the film starts to get violent or ironic Marge steps in to sort out the mess. The Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, obviously have a firm grasp on the actuality of storytelling as opposed to filmmakers who can simply put a story on screen--ignoring whether it provides any sort of actual storytelling at all.I think we all remember the first moment Marge wakes up in bed and receives the phone call. She drives out to the barren, frosty highway with a view of Minnesota that stretches for miles, and investigates the crime scene of a most brutal murder. Three people haev been murdered: A cop, and two passersby. The villain(s)? Unknown. (Regarding the killer: ""And by the size of his feet he looks like a big fella'!"")The murders were, of course, all coincedental, having to do with a simple yet oddly complex plot: Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) has debts he is unable to pay, so he hires two crooks, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaeur (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife,  Jean (Kristin Rudrud). Unfortunately, their plan did not go to...er...plan, and they had to kill three people along the way.The point where Gauer shoots the police officer who has pulled the men over for not displaying the proper tags on their vehicle is funny. And yet when you really think about it, that scene shouldn't be funny at all. But it is. The Coen Brothers know how to make it funny. They are like experts of the dark humor--when Carl says, ""Whoa, Daddy!"" and has that speckle of blood on his face, I always burst out in laughter. It sounds sick, but strangely, it isn't.The dialogue in ""Fargo"" is just as excellent as the film's twisty little plot. Frances McDormand rightfully won an Oscar for her portrayal of Marge Gunderson. She speaks with the perfect accent of, what the Coen Brothers call, the language ""Minnesota Nice""--where people are always cheery, even when they're being mean. It's just something inbred into citizens of Minnesota. And even when the worst things are happening to characters, you're smiling, because who doesn't love to hear, ""Gee, golly, gee whiz,"" throughout a movie, and who doesn't think it's funny?""Fargo"" is the type of film you can watch over and over. Sometimes I think to myself that I'm just going to watch a scene or two, but as soon as the credits start the film has my interest and never lets go. It's the odd sort of delightful little film that keeps the viewer's interest for the first time up through the fiftieth time and beyond.The film's plot takes twist after twist and we can identify ever so much with the character of Jerry as all his well-thought-out plans go to waste, causing his debt to become even worse and his life even more ruined than it already is. Steve Buscemi, as Carl, is just as much a scene-stealer as Marge Gunderson (I love to type that name), and Jerry is just as much a lovable character as someone who hasn't hired two crooks to kidnap his wife. That's the secret to ""Fargo""--or at least part of the secret. We like the characters, simply because we know they don't really mean any harm. Harm just happens to find them.5/5 stars.John Ulmer"
jtindahouse,"Jul 2, 2006",7/10,"It's pretty clear to me that you have to know a lot of the ins and outs of movies to enjoy a Coen brothers movie. But unfortunately if you don't your left bored and bemused. Now I can appreciate this movie has some top-notch acting. Not many will deny that, but there are a lot of movies out there with fine acting. So it needs something else which apparently this movie has, but as someone who just purely wants to be entertained and left thinking ""wow"", I was let down. Nothing shocked me, the ending didn't give me goosebumps etc. There were scenes (such as the one where the female cop talks to her old Asian friend from school) that I can't for the life of me work out why they needed to be there.So if you've been to film school or just simply have good knowledge of how a movie should be then by all means check this out and enjoy, but otherwise I recommend you stay away."
the-fearless-america,"Mar 14, 2015",8/10,"its really hard to combine thrilling-crime with comedy. but coen brothers successfully did it. he really have a unique character as a director. most of his movies, intellect-funny, thrilling-crime, and also creative-comedic script. and now in Fargo, he did it again, the way he turn a genre into somekind funny is completely hard thing to do.Fargo, how should i say this. It's simple i think, when you watched it, then you will like it. Every character in this movie take their best part. No characters give a mediocre performances, all of them were just splendid. Steve buscemi is a main star. Every scene when he appeared, always giving a totality and funny-looking acting. He was completely adaptive, giving a villain and comedic act in one piece. Yeah, buscemi is the coen brother's main weapon.Not only the performances, when you see the cinematography, then it will amaze you also. Always takes place at snowy set, this movie was thrilling yet beautiful, what a talented set-decorator.The script was creative, funny, original, and unique. So many word ""Yeah"" that makes you laugh really hard. It appears that this movie also intellect to serve us a joke.Fargo, definitely one of the best of it's genre (crime-thriller). There are no director that can turn a true-story of fargo into something as enjoyable as coen brother's did. You watch it alone, you will laugh and amazed. you watch it with friends, you will laugh and amazed. You watch it a decade years later, you will laugh and amazed. No doubt !"
chlsyblsy_723,"Oct 7, 2004",7/10,"All right, this movie was interesting. I did enjoy it, but I wasn't overly impressed. Partly because it was such an odd story and partly because the people of North Dakota were portrayed so inaccurately. As I was watching, I was looking forward to seeing how they would present these totally unique people to me and I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps it's because much of my family originates from North Dakota, but i was hoping to see a part of someone I could recognize, but all the people were just simple, everyday stereotypes of Midwestern folk. Still, the story was intriguing, and though the people didn't seem entirely real to me, they made an amusing spoof. I'd say that it's about a 7/10. Not perfect, but still worth the watch"
Steviereno,"Jan 19, 2002",1/10,"For those who haven't had the pleasure (???) of seeing the performance of Frances McDormand, read no further.  Ms. McDormand probably did the worst artificial Scandinavian sing-song dialect ever heard by man, woman or dead cat, except when a bad amateur mimic was mocking Norwegians, etc.  This story was really lame!  I walked out at the end (why did I stay till the end? - I don't know to this day) wondering who the movie critics were that recommended it - I would certainly not trust their opinions in the future. This movie was highly thought of in the worst movie year ever - all the candidates for the Oscar were weak, small films . . . that would never be CONSIDERED for awards in a normal year.  Compare 1996 to THIS PAST year (2001), especially at Xmas time, with several legitiimate 4-star movies out at the same time.  'Fargo' would not rate 1.5 stars if released in 2001. 1996 was a really hard-up year for Hollywood.  I left the theater think I had probably seen the worst flick of my life.  Then I rented 'Barton Fink' a few months later (also by the Coens) --- I actually do not have words to express how unbelievably awful THAT was!  No more Coen films for me, thank you."
oxley-18240,"Aug 15, 2020",9/10,"This movie is damn near perfect, its funny suspenseful, and all in all a great time. I especially love Steve Buscemi's acting, and believe he is a major part of what makes this film so good."
PredragReviews,"May 10, 2016",9/10,"So, why is the movie called ""Fargo""? Maybe it's because that's where chaos starts. For the next 98 minutes, we watch a hapless, smiley, terminally nervous Minneapolis car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), try to settle some debts by engineering the kidnapping of his docile wife and wangling a ransom from his millionaire father-in-law. This scheme blows up in his face after he hires the wrong thugs in Fargo: Steve Buscemi as motormouth Carl Showalter and Peter Stormare as taciturn Gaear Grimsrud. The error soon results in a triple murder, with more deaths to come. And we also watch local super-sleuth Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), the very pregnant police chief of the Minnesota town of Brainerd, as she relentlessly tracks them down.The characters in Fargo are what keep the film going. Steve Buscemi plays Carl to perfection, talking too much and described as ""funny looking"". His colleague, Gaear is that shady silent type who likes to do things his own way and Peter Stormare delivers his threatening stares in a chilling way. For me, these two were the highlight of the film but William H. Macy pulls of Jerry brilliantly, displaying simultaneously a liar, a thief, a loving father and husband as well as ultimately a good guy whose life has taken a turn for the worse. Frances McDormand comically plays the traditional Minnesota local - good hearted and innocent and is a joy to watch. Fargo is deep, chilling and clever as well as very witty in places and is definitely worth seeing.Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
aedixon-1,"Mar 18, 2005",8/10,"I enjoyed this movie, for the same reasons as previous commenters did. I also liked the absence of hackneyed plot devices, such as the McDormand character being taken off the case but solving it anyway, or a turf war between the local police and the FBI.However, I notice that the opening credits say that the story is true, while the closing credits say that it is entirely fictional. For a while I thought that it was a true story, then I realized that the murder of three people, including a police officer, would be taken very seriously. Instead of the case being given to one uniformed officer, a team of homicide detectives would descend on the scene.It would have been better if the makers of the movie had been straightforward about whether the movie is true."
Ricky_Roma__,"Sep 17, 2005",N/A,"It's well known now that Fargo, contrary to the titles at the start, isn't based on a true story. It was just a little dig, a little joke at the expense of the 'true story' phenomenon. But at the same time it was a calculated move to get the audience to go with the story, because if the audience is told that something is true they're more likely to allow themselves to be swept up by it and believe in it. And I guess for some people Fargo may seem a little weird (well, to people who have been weaned on blockbusters). Therefore the true story tag was there to help make the plot seem more plausible.But, really, the film didn't need it. The film only seems odd in that the characters speak like real people, with all the broken sentences and 'ums' and 'ahs' (and 'yahs'), and act like real people  some act with nobility, others are completely feckless and some are violent. It also seems unusual because we're used to films where people speak perfectly, think perfectly and act perfectly. So, therefore, most audiences are used to a Hollywood unreality, which is why Fargo was such a breath of fresh air all those years backWhat I enjoy most about Fargo is Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy). He's such an idiot, a real putz ('What the heck d'ya mean?'). Yet despite the fact that he's stupid, and despite the fact that he has his own wife kidnapped for money, I can't help but kind of feel sorry for the guy. And I sort of feel sorry for him because he's human. He's embarrassed when he's asked why he needs the money; he's awkward when he's telling his son that something has happened to his mother; he gets angry when his plans fall through; and he loses his rag when the police finally catch on to him. Yet even then he desperately tries to maintain his dignity. He never reveals his true feelings. ('I answered the darn I'm co-operating here.') And I also like the fact that he always tries to overcome the new problems that he faces. He never quits. The funniest example is the way that he drives off halfway through a police interview. It kind of reminds me of The Simpsons (the sound of rushing footsteps and then the screeching of tyres). But there's also his final scene where he tries to escape the police by climbing through a window. He's a pathetic guy but at least he seems real.But although Lundegaard is something of a sympathetic character, he's also the most unforgivable. I mean, Steve Buscemi's character and Peter Stormare's character are just plain ruthless. They're greedy, immoral people and that's that. But Lundergaard is a family man with responsibilities and people who are dependant on him. Therefore, although he doesn't kill anyone, his actions are the most heinous.But speaking of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, they're absolutely fantastic in this film. At first they kind of seem like a buffoonish odd couple, but because you've bought into their weird relationship with its amusing eccentricities (I love the pancake conversation), it makes the violence all the more shocking. These aren't cackling villains or loud-mouthed bad guys; they're the sort of psychopathic people you could meet in a bar or on the street. And as a consequence they're more interesting to watch. I especially like the scene where Buscemi is trying to get Stormare to talk. Even kidnappers need conversation. But I also like the scene with the state trooper. It's the scene where the fun and games stop. You really know what these characters are capable of. And the coldly efficient killings that follow are brutal in how simply they're directed. Too often directors try and tell you how to feel. The Coens just show it, and it's a technique that, for me, is far more effective.Another thing that the Coens show are the Minnesota people. Having never been there I have no idea whether the accent is accurate, but it's an interesting portrait of a society. Everyone is so damn polite. Even when a parking attendant is getting threatened he's still got a big smile on his face. And there's one guy who, matter of factly, tells how Buscemi's character threatened him. It's a great scene because it captures the way that people tell stories  kind of flatly and with little creativity. And at the end they talk about the weather. Brilliant. But setting the story in Minnesota was a great decision because polite societies are often the most violent  just take Victorian England. Everything gets repressed and it ends up bursting. Plus the snow and the pure white landscape hint at something dark under the surface.However, what lingers most in the memory is the character of Marge. She's the film's moral centre. She's the one who sees through the insanity of what's happening and the one that gives you hope for the future. Indeed, Marge and Norm are comforting figures. They have a relationship that is without mystery but one that is rock solid. They give you hope that sanity will prevail. And I like Marge's scene with the frighteningly needy Mike. ('You're such a super lady and I'm so lonely.') Even in the face of such pent-up madness she keeps her dignity and her composure. She really is a super lady.And Fargo is a super film. I'm not sure I'd put it on a par with The Big Lebowski and it's a bit too thin to be truly great, but it's certainly an excellent piece of cinema.Oh, but I've also got to mention one of my favourite lines in film. When Buscemi is talking to an escort he says, 'Find that work interesting, do you?' The woman's reaction is priceless."
Atle_O,"Jun 15, 2024",7/10,"""Fargo"" is a good movie, but not great. It has a unique mix of dark comedy and crime drama, which sets it apart from many other films. The story, centered around a botched kidnapping plot, is interesting and keeps you engaged. The cold, snowy setting of Minnesota adds a lot to the movie's atmosphere, making everything feel more intense.The performances are solid. Frances McDormand as Marge Gunderson is the standout. She brings a lot of warmth and quirkiness to her role as a pregnant police chief. William H. Macy also does a good job as the desperate car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard. The rest of the cast is decent, but these two really shine.One thing I liked about ""Fargo"" is its mix of humor and violence. The Coen Brothers did a good job balancing the two, making some scenes unexpectedly funny while others are quite brutal. The dialogue is sharp and often witty, which helps lighten the mood in a film that's otherwise pretty dark.However, there are some parts of the movie that drag a bit. Some scenes feel slow and don't add much to the overall plot. The pacing could have been tighter to keep the momentum going throughout the film. Also, while the quirky characters are fun, not all of them are memorable or fully fleshed out.Overall, ""Fargo"" is a good watch with strong performances and a unique style. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're not into dark humor, but it's definitely worth seeing for the standout moments and the distinct Coen Brothers' touch."
pmtelefon,"Aug 9, 2020",10/10,"""Fargo"" is one of those movies that if I happen to come across it on TV I put the remote down and I settle in for a great piece of filmmaking. ""Fargo"" hits on all cylinders. The dialogue, acting, music and photography are all top-notch. Although ""Fargo"" has a lot of laughs, it annoys me when people call it a comedy. People laugh when the wife is running around in the shower curtain. I'm sorry but that scene is scary not funny. I think people laugh at that scene because they're uncomfortable watching what's going on. Other than a few moments like that, ""Fargo"" is a practically flawless movie. It'a a true classic. Honorable mention: a terrifying Peter Stormare."
Zooha-47207,"Mar 9, 2024",8/10,"Fargo, released in 1996, is a standout film that earns high marks for its compelling narrative, intriguing characters, and a suspenseful plot that feels almost too real.

The narrative is crafted with skill, keeping the viewer hooked with its twists and turns. The fact that the story is based on real events adds an extra layer of intrigue, making it all the more captivating.The characters in Fargo are exceptionally well-developed and contribute significantly to the film's appeal. Each character is unique and adds depth to the story, making the events and their interactions feel authentic and believable. The performances are top-notch, bringing these characters to life in a way that's both entertaining and thought-provoking.One of the most striking aspects of Fargo is its ability to balance tension with moments of dark comedy. This blend makes the film not just a crime drama but also a fascinating study of human nature and behavior under extreme circumstances.In conclusion, Fargo is a brilliantly executed film that deserves its acclaim. Its combination of an engaging story, well-crafted characters, and a seamless blend of different genres makes it a must-watch. The film's portrayal of a crime story that's almost too strange to be true is what sets it apart and earns it high praise."
The_Movie_Cat,"Mar 9, 1999",6/10,"There is a segment in Fargo where the female police officer meets an old Asian friend from high school. The segment is wholly irrelevant to the plot, and does nothing to advance character. Around this dubious moment are slices of violence, sex and profanity, peppering a one-note story.While nicely acted and shot, this indulgent excuse for entertainment must surely stand as one of the most over-rated of modern cinema."
pitosworld-76301,"Sep 28, 2025",3/10,"I was looking forward to this. I had never seen this movie, and after hearing about it for years (including many Top 50 lists), I was hoping for a lot more. Other than a few scenes that made me smile, this might be one of the most overrated films I've ever watched. When the most interesting characters in the movie is one of the perpetrators of the crime you have a serious problem. Buscemi is always worth a watch, but otherwise the rest of the film is a series of dull, plodding, pointless scenes."
mbrcf,"Aug 12, 2023",9/10,"This is one of the most hilarious films in the entire existence, and it also happens to be a story of kidnapping and homicide(s). The sheer comedy comes though not through one-liners or brainless jokes, but in the form of a situation in which a group of massively incompetent criminals are chased and hunted by a 7 month pregnant police officer. And the most important accomplishment of Coen brothers in this film is that as funny as the whole thing is, it's not so unbelievable. In fact, you'll find out that these are real people, people we might've known ourselves, that are going at it. Jerry Lundegaard is not a masterful lawbreaker, he's just a desperate, despicable mess in dire need of quick money, not nearly careful enough about what he's cooking. Likewise, Marge Gunderson is a talented policewoman that happens to be a human being, full of compassion and love for her relatives. That essence, normal people caught up in this story, is applicable to all main characters of this film, with an exception or two.Sometimes I think about what happens if, for example, my illiterate uncle gives a speech in, let's say Stanford university and I get a chuckle just by imagining such occurrence, watching Fargo offers a lot of these chuckles and sometimes laughters."
LinkinParkEnjoyer,"Feb 23, 2020",9/10,"Rewatched after 2 years and gotta say it is still my favorite Coen. The weather plays crucial role in the film, it feels like the character itself.

chaos-rampant,"Jun 6, 2016",N/A,"Blood Simple introduced the combination of mood and noir karma from above, the key was in making the first long, the second precise.Arizona went two steps further, supplying the multitudinous desiring mind that makes reality bubble up, Ozzie and Harriet through HI's mind.Miller's Crossing tried to do both the karmic noir while toying with 'the world of the mind' in the forest. They made Barton Fink that film about the mind instead, in a most obvious way by that point, rooms mapping to mind, wallpaper coming unglued.So by the time the Coens made this, there was already a clear blueprint of inclinations. Once more a film noir about a schmuck whose desire makes the skies cave in on him. Once more about the life of the mind, the mind dictating egoistic desire and greed, less obvious than Barton. Along the way we get their quirky staples, dry gaffe, guns, blood, a satchel of money, to offset the frigid pace in the broad audience's mind.But although Macy's desire makes all sorts of accident and chaotic whimsy bubble up in the world, a softly maintained order straight from Frances' calm Minnesotan mind prevails. The film offers in fact a perfectly centered metaphor of the Coens at work and their larger blueprint. It's a cold world out there, with human ego and desire creating inane anxieties, but it hasn't numbed the heroine's soul who calmly goes through a narrative, piecing it together, much like the Coens piece theirs.And from Frances' point of view, this to save a mirrored wife from danger and restore order in the world of the film.It's fine work to see on your first rounds. Methodical, exact, clean, some of the cleanest work you'll see anywhere.But clean logic comes with a tradeoff in unfettered intuition that can slip ahead of you into places you didn't know or can't quite explain. It takes a parting of this logic to give me the great stuff that go beyond story and ideas; Lynch's whole career has been a creative journey of this. I miss this here. Still, the entry points are there to see and imagine from. The kidnapping plot as a thought that wafts from his mind before he could keep hold of it, herself woken up in the middle of the night by nightmare.The Coens must have been aware of this fettering. They would drop a bomb on the logical mind with their next one.Noir Meter: 3/4 / Neo-noir or post noir? Neo"
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oct 3, 2005",7/10,"I went over to my sister's the other night, her and I have the same love and passion for movies. She asked me what genre I wanted to watch and I quote ""romance, action, horror, happy, gore..."" and I was like ""Gore!"". It was a Saturday night, it had to be some kind of a scary movie to have a little fun. I had heard a lot about this movie, my sister kept praising it, and a lot of IMDb fans as I can see from the #101 rating on the top 250 love it as well.""Fargo"" is a great film. The acting is phenomenal, the story, even though my sister said it really isn't true, is disturbing, and the whole movie is just a good one to watch. I want to talk about what the movie is about, but I'm not even sure if words could describe this story. It's very disturbing, this was not meant for children in any way. I know this sounds silly, but before the kidnapping of the wife, for a few minutes I thought it was actually a comedy. While even after that and a few disturbing scenes, you still laugh. It's a very dark comedy with very dark drama.I would recommend this movie, but not for the faint of heart. It's a little too much to handle if you can't stand gore. Boy did I get it when I asked for it.7/10"
arthur_tafero,"Jan 18, 2023",9/10,"The Coen Brothers are famous for biting, cutting-edge satire that is both shocking and entertaining. They have made some of the finest films of the last two decades; among them are: The Big Lebowski, Brother, Where Art Thou? And Blood Simple. However, Fargo is easily the best of all others the Coens have done.The cast is led by the multi-talented Frances McDormand, a winner of several awards over the years. She particularly shines in this film. She is amply supported by some talented character actors including William Macy, a hilarious Steve Buscemi, and a fearsome Peter Stormare, who plays a menacing killer. The setting of Fargo in North Dakota, is a great part of its atmosphere and charm. Don't miss this classic."
davim5,"Aug 25, 2014",6/10,"I would like to start by saying that my plan was to see all the IMDb Top 250 movies, and from ""City Lights"" to ""Le scaphandre et le papillon"" I saw a lot from that list, but this one is really showed the cloven hoof. Generally i like movies which scenes are laid in a cold, drear land, but although the film had some stunning scenes, it's rather dull and uninteresting, that contains incomprehensible characters without any sympathy. It's actually quite boring and overrated. Could have told a better story. There's so many other films, that has much more potential difference. I don't see the hype(?) either. Meaning is, I don't like it at all. Maybe in 10 years I come back and saw it again. I might missed out something."
spamproofme,"Dec 16, 2018",9/10,"Extremely well written, outstandingly directed and superbly acted, every performance is spot on and memorable. Steve Buscemi is at his best, so is William Macy. In fact, all the acting is flawless."
cuppa_tetleys,"Apr 25, 2011",6/10,"I will acknowledge that Fargo is, technically at least, a fantastic film. The Coen brothers always deliver fantastically written, directed and shot pieces of cinema, but I just didn't enjoy this one very much. I think it maybe to do with the setting - I know nothing about, nor care for Dakota or its significance. Also the characters - they were mostly appealing, but I just couldn't get in to any of them. There's some wonderful black humour on display here, some suspense, and good characterisation. However I just feel as if I've seen all of this done better elsewhere in individual instances, and I certainly wouldn't compare this to No Country For Old Men, which I watched recently.If I want humour, I'll watch a comedy, if I want suspense I'll watch a thriller and if I want good writing I'll watch Oscar nominees. Though, to me, Fargo seems to be a diluted collaboration of elements that I've seen done better in their specific environment.All in all, I suppose I'd compare my viewing experience to one of someone who is told the twist before they've seen the film - one of the major aspects of enjoyment is ruined from the beginning, and I just really didn't like the setting or characters."
yusgul,"Mar 24, 2024",5/10,"This movie had basically nothing special to it in particular. I just don't understand the hype. Being a very gullible person who's easily influenced by the IMDB reviews a lot, this movie, I just couldn't wrap my head around.I side with the minority here. There was a mediocre plot which just wasn't going anywhere. It had a really good atmosphere to it. It had a nice vibe overall. The characters were brilliant. They had a very cohesive mannerism. The difference in the characters' behaviors is apparent as the movie progresses, but this is where it all ends.There's nothing that, in my opinion, propels it to the IMDB Top 250 movie list. The acting was incredible, no doubt about it. The Oscars given or the nominations in that regard are justified, but the movie itself was as mediocre as they come."
blanbrn,"Jun 22, 2009",8/10,"""Fargo"" is clearly one of the better films of the 90's probably one of 1996's best. As always I learned with each film I've watched from the Coen brothers even though most of their plots are a little offbeat they still entertain and hold interest. As evidenced from watching this film it proves even ordinary people anywhere can finds themselves caught up in crazy things that involve unexpected twist and turns yet somehow it all solves it's self in the end.Set in the great northern united states mostly taking place in a small Minnesota town it involves William H. Macy as a desperate car salesman who wants money. And he will do anything even if it means arranging a crazy scheme to have his wife kidnapped so he could get ransom money from her well to do father. And that's just what he does when he contacts two stone cold thugs(one who's played brilliant by Steve Buscemi who enjoys having sex with truck stop prostitutes and escorts on the side!) from Fargo, North Dakota to travel to Minnesota to kidnap his wife. As with any Coen brothers movie it gets interesting as the drama comes in the most unexpected ways the plan goes not as planned as then a crazy game of chase and phone tag develops.Enter the wild card and key element of the film as her character added such common ground and normalcy in a fantastic and blazing performance Frances McDormand is very memorable as the small town Minnesota deputy who investigates. As you really feel for her character she's so plain spoken like most in the film with her north mid western draw accent she's also pregnant yet she continues to fight hard on the investigation and come thru and break the case open like breaking ice on the cold Minnesota lakes.Overall ""Fargo"" is a film that holds your interest the whole time as it's blended so well with suspense drama and dark humor that thrills it just makes you think just like so many other Coen brother films. And the performances and chemistry of the cast is super it just proves ordinary people can find themselves twisted up in crazy things only to all have back to normal in the end. Really a unique film that's memorable and very good."
evanston_dad,"Jun 16, 2009",10/10,"I imagine popular opinion now holds that ""No Country for Old Men"" is the best Coen brothers movie ever made, but for me this 1996 crime thriller will live on as their masterpiece.The Coens have always had trouble integrating their warped sense of humor into their films, and too often they tip the balance over into the grotesque. But in ""Fargo,"" they for once strike the perfect balance between the macabre and the absurd, and though laughs abound, the film never lets us forget the seriousness at the film's center.The plot revolves around a money scheme gone badly awry, but the scheme itself doesn't matter. The Coens are more interested in watching what can happen to a bunch of ordinary Joes when money lust is involved. Anchoring the film with a beautiful performance is Frances McDormand as pregnant police officer Marge, whose country bumpkin accent and demeanor belies the sharp acuity of her investigative skills. The Coens are frequently mean and snide to their own characters, as if they're making movies about people who they feel superior to, but Marge is one of their most fully-realized and warmly human creations. She's the lioness protecting not only her cub but everyone else's cub as well, and the fact that she goes about her job with a smile and a friendly ""hello"" doesn't make her any less ferocious.I love the film's final scene, in which Marge and her husband watch the evening news, both without actually speaking the words asking the other just what kind of world they're bringing their unborn child into.Grade: A+"

I absolutely all the characters, the setting, cinematography, great lines, humor, music and madness! The perfectly orchestrated Story about car deals, kidnappers, and the wackiness within the deals done so well that it definitely deserved the 2 Oscar wins!

filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin,"Dec 28, 2019",10/10,"Fargo begins with a white canvas, and as the initial credits start to appear, the icy North Dakota landscape arises, with the strange flight of a bird through the snow. There is a warning that the story tells a real fact that happened in Minnesota in 1987, but that the real names were changed in ""respect to the dead.""The locations took place made in the two neighboring states and in the cities where the tragedy occurred. It looks like a home-made movie, as the directors, the Cohen brothers, Ethan, and director Joel grew up in Minneapolis.Every expectation falls apart as the story progresses, to the point of not knowing for sure whether we are witnessing a tragedy, as promised, or a satire, comedy, thriller, or thriller. It's a unique, unrivaled movie where transitions occur smoothly, and even violence seems ""natural.""The story revolves around a failed car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who desperately needs money for a deal that can save him from bankruptcy and also the domination of his wealthy father-in-law (Harve Presnell), who, by chance, owns the car agency where Jerry works.To make his investment viable, Jerry hires two scumbag lowlifes called Showalter and Grimsrud (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife Jean (Kristin Rudrud) and share the $ 80,000 ransom paid by father-in-law Wade. Simple like that simple. Said no one ever, because everything goes wrong and all expectations turn into nightmares in the most amazing ways possible.In the middle of the movie, some corpses begin to appear, frozen. Called to investigate possible murders, Brainerd's border town police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) also has an unexpected profile: pregnant, she needs to have her vehicle pushed to get the engine started, and before going to the police station, goes to the market to buy worms for her husband Norm (John Carrol Lynch) to fish."
wellesly01,"Jul 2, 2002",N/A,The Coen Brothers have always been my favorite directors. They are about the only worthy protocessors to the almighty Stanley Kubrick.When I first saw Fargo I must admit I was not paying much attention to it.I was talking on the phone with a friend and because of it I entirely missed the magic. A couple months later I saw it and it completely blew my expectations away. The rural setting of Minnesota and its people provide the perfect juxtaposition for this mixed up murder thriller.The endless snowy landscpes and frigid cold create a great mood for a sullen and intoxicating climax. My favorite part of this film was definetly the subtle craftsmanship. The violin music. The editing. Frances McDormand's performance. Peter Stormare' performance. I especially loved the axe scene. It made Stormare almost into a larger than life character. He was Paul Bunyan. And in the end it was a little old pregnant police woman that took him down. This film is about as perfect as you can get. The only action thriller that even comes close to it is Memento. Years from now this will be seen as one of America's greatest Post Modern Films. ***** You're darn tootin.
becky-92346,"Mar 3, 2022",6/10,"Fargo (1996) follows a car salesman who's crime falls apart after he consults two people to stage the kidnapping of his wife for money. I understand the appeal of this film however unfortunately it wasn't for me and I ended up being quite disappointed. It definitely was a fun little film I just wish I'd enjoy it more.Something I did like about this film was the characters, acting and dialogue. Frances McDormand as Marge was a standout; her character was funny and sweet, definitely an iconic character! The dialogue was also quick and witty and I liked the strange, unnatural character interactions.The concept for the film was quite interesting, but it just wasn't executed in an original or unique way in my opinion. But, I did like that it was based off a true story as this made me more interested, I would like to learn more about the events that inspired it in order to appreciate the film more!Unfortunately there wasn't much to say in terms of filmmaking and I just wasn't impressed by the cinematography. I respect how minimalist it was but this left me wanting more from the colour palettes and something a bit more outstanding.The film was a little hard to get into at first, but from there the pacing was quite fast. I wasn't really gripped by the movie. Also, I didn't find the payoff satisfying, I felt like this could've been improved if the film was longer in order to flesh the story out more."
bigham69,"Jun 7, 2022",7/10,"This movie might be a bit overrated if you ask me. It's got decent shock value and light humor sprinkled in but overall it's just a garbled display of annoying ass Minnesota accents and a kidnapping gone awry. The acting is all top notch and so is the writing, being a southern man I guess the accents just put this one in the irritating category for me. Good film, not great. 7/10."
xG-Manx,"Mar 18, 2024",9/10,"The movie starts with Mr. Kirby from Jurassic Park 3 hiring criminals to kidnap his own wife to get some money. The story is exciting and has some weird unique humor in it.We don't get to see the true protagonist Marge after the end of the first act. While she is an likeable protagonist this makes me question the Academy Awards even more, why exactly did Frances McDormand win an oscar for this?Anyway, the dynamic between the two criminals who kidnap Mr. Kirbys wife is very fun to what, skinny small dude likes to talk and seems to be more hestitant about murder while big silent dude hasn't any problem with killing or certain other thinks, except he sees them on TV.Definitely a must watch if you like dark comedies, thrillers or detective stories.9/10 bloody snow fields."
siderite,"Jun 25, 2014",7/10,"I understand the positive reviews, I really do. The story is non conventional, based on real events that lack the serendipity and skill of movie events. The actors, some of my favorites are in it, play very well. The mix of dread, disgust, contempt and amusement has a nice flavour, too. But the film is too real, too mundane and ultimately totally boring. It's like a heist movie done by idiots, but dangerous idiots at that.Bottom line: I really wanted to like this film, because they just released a series based on it. However, after watching it, I can't bring myself to view the series. The average grade that I give this film doesn't mean that I am indifferent to it, just that it kind of hits mediocrity, but that only because I average good acting and intriguing potential with my feeling of utter boredom after watching it."

FilmOtaku,"Sep 7, 2004",10/10,"How do I even begin to review a film that has been in my personal Top Three of all time since the second I left the theater back in 1996? I guess that has always been one reason that I've avoided watching this film in the past year and a half that I have been reviewing every film that I see. The best thing to do, as I did with my other two favorites in my personal cinematic trinity, is describe why this movie is, in my opinion, incredible.'Fargo' is, like many Coen brothers films, the story of a stupid crime gone horribly wrong. In this case, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is in deep debt after committing some major fraud at his father-in-law's car dealership, so he comes up with a scheme to have his wife kidnapped in order for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom. Unfortunately, the men he hires (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi) are not only completely unstable, scary and share a half a brain among them, and what was supposed to be a simple kidnapping culminates in the murder of three innocent bystanders. Enter Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) a small-town sheriff, who also happens to be seven months pregnant, who steps in to try to solve the case.'Fargo' has so many things going for it: Phenomenal acting (McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her role) by all players, supporting and lead and a brilliant script that is part mystery, part thriller and part drama, and all layered in a thin veneer of some of the darkest comedy seen in recent years, are just two of the outstanding elements. The cinematography of 'Fargo' however is absolutely beautiful. The snow-white landscape is so stark and vast; yet suddenly you realize that you are watching a tiny figure in the distance, trudging through the snow; and it's one of the main characters. One shot in particular is so unbelievably framed, that for a good ten seconds, the viewer isn't entirely sure what they are looking at, until it becomes obvious that it is a deserted parking lot with one car parked in the middle of it. Scenes like these are literally breath-taking, and harkens back to some of the beautiful cinematography in one of their earlier films, 'Millers Crossing'.One of the funniest things I remember about this film was actually an unfavorable review my parents, who are both movie lovers themselves, gave it before I saw it for myself. It was, verbatim, 'We saw 'Fargo' and it was REALLY dark. We hated it. You will LOVE it.' And indeed I did. I walked out of the theater eight years ago on a cold, snowy night and literally thought to myself, 'THAT is how films should be made.'That really sums it all up in simple, non-flashy terms. And because of my very true adoration for their work, I have described how choosing my favorite Coen Brothers film is like a mother choosing her favorite child. It takes a film that is a step above 'phenomenal' in order for it to shine above all of the other fantastic films they have made. In my opinion, 'Fargo' is and always will be that caliber of film for me. Every other film of theirs have varying degrees of 'great-ness', because I truly love and admire all of their work, but because of its standout performances, intelligent and compelling script, and it's beautiful presentation, 'Fargo' is a four star film, and will always remain on my personal 'favorites' list.--Shelly"
CubsandCulture,"Apr 30, 2021",10/10,The Coen brothers' early films are all variants-usually comedic-on film noir. This is the most successful of their early efforts. In some ways it is a rather blunt in how it turns the style inside out. I.e. The negative space of typical noir is made white by setting the story in Minnesota or how basically every character is dumber than a bag of rocks. The film is highly enjoyable because of this quality. And if nothing else the film is always amusing.
twanginsanchez49,"May 8, 2006",10/10,"This is without a doubt the most brilliant, creative, and stylish film I have ever seen. The coen's really out did themselves with this piece of work. It is by far they're greatest achievement as directors and writers. How this film did not win best picture of 1996 is beyond me, and it astonishes me that the Joel coen did not win best director for this. At least the academy recognized the great acting by Francis Mcdormand and the creative brilliance of the screenplay. William H. Macy also did a wonderful job although I believe they overlooked Steve Buscemi, who in my mind is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. But perhaps I am most impressed with the acting of Peter Stormare who portrayed an excellent cold-blooded character. Everything about this film is great. The acting, the locations, the story, and the accents. I give this film a 10/10 and its well-deserved. Thank you Coen brothers for adding a masterpiece to my collection."
darkneox119,"Jun 1, 2001",N/A,"Fargo is a great film about a kindnapping scheme gone wrong. Macy is the pathetic car dealer who plots to have his wife kidnapped so he can get the reward money for his own greedy prospects. He drafts Buscemi and his silent partner who in my opinion are the greatest pair of comedic criminals. Things go wrong when a body count starts and a pregnant police chief starts an investigation. Macy, McDormand, Buscemi and Stromare. Great dialouge and the locations are wonderous. ****"
SmileysWorld,"Apr 16, 2007",6/10,"I can see the humor in Fargo.The characters have a quirkiness and a dialect that most would find at least a little humorous,particularly that of Marge Gunderson.They do and say things that would give you at least a slight chuckle.The American Film Institute ranks it not only in their top 100 greatest films in cinema history,but it is also in their top 100 funniest films.It has a uniqueness that I suppose qualifies it for both lists,but speaking on a personal taste level,I had trouble laughing at this film's humor due to the fact that there were so many dead bodies lying in the way.I don't argue with what the AFI calls a great film,but I just didn't connect with this film at all,and this will most likely be my first and last trip to Fargo."
Prismark10,"Feb 3, 2021",6/10,"Fargo is a curious wacky but dark crime thriller.The Coen Brothers build on their previous noir crime movies and play around with the conventions. They do this by imbuing it with some bizarro characters.Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is an executive car dealer with a rich father in law. He enlists two wacko hoods. The talkative Carl (Steve Buscemi) and the quieter Gaear (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife.Jerry hopes to split the ransom money with the hoods but the plan goes awry. Carl and Gaear leave a trail of bodies behind.Heavily pregnant Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) investigates the murders. The victims includes a state trooper.There is little by way of background to the characters. Jerry seems to be running some kind of car scam, he is in debt and has a business investment where he wants his father in law to lend him some money. It is clear that nervy Jerry is way over his head with his mad bad plan.The snowy landscapes of Minneapolis, the mock Scandinavian accents all give the movie some distinction. Despite some humour which mainly comes from a cool kooky Marge. This is a misanthropic film.The dead bodies pile up and the killings become nastier as the movie goes on. It was an accomplished movie from the Coens who were still regarded as Independent filmmakers. It is just that Fargo is a difficult film to like."

Steffi_P,"Feb 9, 2012",8/10,"In the 1990s the younger generation of independent filmmakers gained their prestige with some odd movies, movies that were both grim and noir-ish but with an almost nonchalant twist of comedy running through all the nastiness. This was the kind of picture in which the Brothers Coen specialised. Fargo is among their purest expressions of that type, a grisly thriller set in a snowbound Minnesota that, despite its inherent darkness, comes across as humane and affectionate.While the New Wave-influenced directors showed off an abundance of technique, the Coens and their generation have tended more towards minimalism. There's an elegant simplicity to their approach, with few camera moves or obvious artifice. That's not to say the Coens were directing on autopilot. The camera may not move but there's a lot of thought gone into those static shots. We see a beleaguered William H. Macy at his desk while cars rushing by on the freeway behind him seem to mirror his nervous jitters. In the opposing shot of the indignant couple, the array of statuettes makes it look as if the whole room's ganging up on him. It's a kind of meaningful shot composition that is actually rather witty. This triumph of the image over technicality allows the Coens to really bring out some detail. Many filmmakers may attach a camera to the front of a car for a bit of high-speed action, but in Fargo we have such a shot pointing down at the road surface in the headlights, picking out every little crack and grain. The Coens have really painted a world with palpable texture.But just as character seems to live in the very landscape of Fargo, it also lives in the actual characters, brought to vividness by a cast that's at just the right level of quirky. What's neat about Frances McDormand is that she is comical without actually doing a comedy performance. Other than a slightly strained accent, its all done in very genuine timings and expressions, which stops it slipping into farce and weaves it well with the movie's more unpleasant moments. William H. Macy is full of twitches and mannerisms, but he just manages to pull it inside the realms of believability. And Steve Buscemi too is straddling that delicate line on the edge of reality. In short, the people that inhabit the world of Fargo give us this impression of normality stretched to its limits, but normality all the same.Unlike your average thriller, Fargo is not exactly a tightly-constructed ride of suspense and excitement, but this doesn't mean it's not enjoyable and engrossing. Rather than seeming to have some grand theme or focused structure, it's as if the screenplay just grew organically out of a number of elements. Like many works by the Brothers Coen, Fargo is rich with the weirdness of America, with ominous statues of local heroes and checkout girls grinning vacantly like a taxi driver from Total Recall. Brilliantly offset by a doom-laden and very Nordic score from Carter Burwell as well as a sprinkling of familiar American hits, it scampers smoothly from one mood to the next. This isn't a big movie by any stretch, but it in its constant, delightful diversity, it seems to be part of some large and tangible world."
LoneWolfAndCub,"Jul 12, 2006",9/10,"Fargo is rightly named one of the best movies of the 90's. Featuring some outstanding performances, a great script and some beautiful cinematography. Frances McDormand rightly earned herself the Oscar for Best Actress portraying Marge Gunderson, chief of Brainerd police.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is facing financial troubles. He concocts a scheme to get more money to support a new project he is undertaking. Jerry hires two men (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so he can get his rich father in law (Harve Presnell) to pay the ransom of $1,000,000. Unfortunately things get way out of hand.Fargo is a movie everyone needs to see. It is a mixture of many things. Crime, comedy, thriller, drama and romance. The screenplay is witty and packs many delights along the way. All the performances are perfect in this movie. The movies also is extremely true to life. The characters are not overdone or inhuman. Nothing seems unrealistic. If I were to name anything wrong with this movie it would be that it was too short. I really wanted it to continue on.4½/5."
akash_sebastian,"May 19, 2016",8/10,"The ordinariness of the characters in this film are so carefully crafted, and if the scenes are carefully analysed in the light of all the information, the characters are really not simple and black/white as they seem. The Coen Brothers, being brought up in Minnesota, critique the Minnesota Nice nature - people with their plain and warm exterior with folksy speaking style, but not so empathetic or well-wishing from within; the characters are as cold and distant as the letters of the film title because the characters are as emotionally isolated as story's vast empty landscape. The accent and snow, the white and distant environment, all these things accentuate the feel of the living conditions and community of northern US. I can't testify to the accuracy of the time and place, but the Coens surely give us an intriguing character study.The film takes quite a few witty jabs at capitalism and consumerism; it explores people's (here, especially Americans') obsession with fast food, television and cars. The realistic dialogues and quirkiness do make the characters stand out, like all Coen Brothers films. Many might say Marge Gunderson is the only character with good morals, but she isn't as pure as she seems. Marge, though an interesting character who defies prescribed gender roles and becomes our lead protagonist (though she enters only after one-third the film), she is as emotionally distant as the rest, as evidenced from her murder-scene inspection and ending ride with one of the kidnappers. Her routine life and by-the-book procedure, combined with her husband's not-so- sophisticated paintings about ducks and the decor of their house, exemplify the fact how they are a regular couple in a consumerist web so blissfully content in their simplicity and mediocrity.Expectation vs what's given to us. From the opening title where it says that this is based on a true story and events are shown as it occurred, a certain expectation is set. The Coens take advantage of this liberty and tell the story in the most unusual but interesting way. But they subvert these expectations by slowly inserting scenes that people couldn't have known (if the events are being shown as they occurred). But this helps us understand the characters much better. (We now know that almost the entire thing is fictional, other than, maybe, the murder that inspired them.) The Coens do this throughout the film. Two other good examples come from the scene where Marge meets her Asian friend from college. Compared to the ways Asians are traditionally portrayed in films, Mike really stood out - not at all a clichéd, accented Asian guy, but an emotionally unstable lonely guy who still stays with his parents in his 30s. And the story he tells Marge about his life, we immediately lap it all up, just like Marge does, not realising that the story had the exact plot details from 'Love Story'. The Coens surely take other such jabs at American pop culture. It's not what you expect from a true-story-based crime thriller. It's not what you expect from a comedy. Coen Brother films never usually fit into a single genre, and the unusual blend of crime and humour makes the film stand out.And without Roger Deakins, the film wouldn't look the way it does. That parking lot scene has been praised and analysed to death by now. And yes, it's a spectacular shot and has so much to say. The acting from everyone in the cast is terrific, especially Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. Macy gives us such a unique and memorably loathsome character - an apathetic, selfish and cowardly hypocrite, always maintaining such a cheery facade. But he represents the frustrations felt by the pawns in the capitalist system, rarely able to earn or save much to be financially or emotionally satisfied. Hence, his various schemes to collect enough money, run away and start a new comfortable life.Though just a little less than 100 minutes, the film has been assembled with such attention to detail and innovation that it can be analysed and understood in so many different ways. It's not something that seems so great in the first view itself, but the more you see it or think about it, the more it lingers in your mind. Clever to end the film with the words ""Two more months"", since we know it might be a reference to the end of winter when the snow might melt and reveal the suitcase to a passerby."

shadow_blade-89459,"Feb 15, 2019",6/10,"""Fargo"" (1996) is a professionally produced crime drama about a kidnapping unraveled by small-time cop Marge Gunderson, played by Frances McDormand. Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, hires two thugs to kidnap his wife in order to ransom her to his father-in-law to pay an undisclosed debt. I really enjoy films that I can identify with, rather it's the situation or specific character, or something that transports me into a different realm, unfortunately this film did neither for me. This film seems overly silly for such a serious genre that is based on true events. I am not a fan, but I can appreciate the unconventional approach.I have never been to either Dakotas nor Minnesota, outside of the airport, to attest to how they actually speak, but if they really sound like that, I may have to bite my tongue in saying it really hurt this film. I think I would have really enjoyed this film if there were less accents to detract from the storyline. This film, for me, painted everyone that wasn't rich as some type of simpleton with the silly accents, which by the end of the film is unfounded, especially for one particular character. The storyline, for as crazy as it is, especially based on real events, is really strong and followable. Overall, that one aspect mostly ruined the film for me as a viewer but allowed me to really appreciate other nuances in the beautifully shot cinematography. My recommendation to this film is solely for those who wish to approach a genre a little different."
up2u,"Sep 10, 1998",10/10,"This delicious blend of dark drama and light comedy follows the hilarious investigation of a kidnapping scheme gone wrong. The incomparable Frances McDormand gives a brilliant performance as a sweet, incompetent, pregnant sheriff and William H. Macy is equally good as a family man whose kidnapping scheme is falling apart and is making him implode. The screenplay is see-it-to-believe-it funny, the direction great and the cinematography perfect. Those miles of snow will be forever etched in my heart."
shemarnold,"Jul 26, 2018",6/10,"Finally got round to seeing this and I was rather disappointed.
It is slow paced and sometimes that's not a bad thing but it seems the reason in this case is that the movie wouldn't be long enough otherwise and still don't know why the scene with the infatuated Japanese man was in the movie! More padding?
It's not all bad though. It's a ok movie and there are good acting performances all round, funny dialogue and good on screen chemistry between the actors. Just a little overrated. Go in with lower expectations and you won't be as disappointed as I was."
IceCream-57,"Mar 27, 2024",10/10,"Classic! The Cohen Brothers are silly! That's best way I can describe them! This film takes place in a small Minnesota town. This is a film about greed and stupidity, to be completely honest. A man that is behind with so much debt does the worst thing humanly possible- he had his wife kidnapped to fake a ransom so that he could get the money to pay off his debt. But there are so many plot twist and turns in this film due to the greed and horrible personalities of the crew involved with carrying out the plot. One thing I enjoy about this film to is how the crew is so much more intelligent in the town of Fargo then what they come off as. I definitely would recommend. Classic film."
HudsonBane,"Jun 14, 2022",1/10,"A mediocre movie about mediocre people living possibly the most boring existences imaginable. Heres the whole movie; ""blundering buffoon solves a dumb murder case."" I saved you an hour and a half of your life! Go enjoy it by doing something infinitely more interesting than what the characters in this movie do."
MaddoxMoviesnTv,"Jun 20, 2024",9/10,"Fargo is one of those movies where there just isn't much to complain about. It has one of my favorite environments for a movie, that being one where it feels relatively empty, lonely, and boring (similar to napoleon dynamite). This film, while not perfect thus getting a 9, hits home on just about every element. It has good crime, good comedy, great cinematography, great acting, and anything else you could hope for. A highlight of the movie to me was it's ability to make me feel what the character was feeling. If they were annoyed, angry, tense, or nervous the feeling was portrayed well. Solid 9."
chas437,"Jul 1, 2021",10/10,"...and its not even close. What more can be said about Fargo? Fargo is Shakespearian in its grandness, with career defining performances from the elite ranks of American actors and a brilliant insight into the human condition, from the best of what people can achieve to the lowest, most contemptable.I see a disturbing number of negative reviews on here, and it really makes you consider how fall standards in art have fallen among younger people. Back in 1997, even those who didn't love the violence in Fargo at least conceded that its a superbly constructed film.This is a top-10 film of all time."
samagramz,"Sep 6, 2024",10/10,"A lot of people consider No Country for Old Men to be the best effort from the Coens, and while that movie is A masterpiece, it doesn't really match the genius of Fargo.A lot of people forget that in 1996 the Coens weren't popularly successful. They'd had critical acclaim with Blood Simple, Raising Arizona and Barton Fink, but it was Fargo that truly put them on the map. And why not? Fargo is just about as perfect a film as you can find.The reason I consider this a step above No Country for Old Men is that Fargo offers pointed but not preachy philosophy about what truly matters in life and where genuine happiness comes from. No Country is brilliant, but it's also deeply nihilistic (which should come as no surprise, being based on a Cormac McCarthy novel).Everything about Fargo is top-class. The acting, the cinematography, and especially the writing. The entire cast gives career-best performances, Roger Deakins creates incredible visuals out of the Minnesotan winter, and the dialogue mixes tragedy and comedy so well that they're almost indistinguishable. And at the center of it all is France McDormand in her Oscar-winning portrayal of a brilliant police chief.The Coens have no shortage of classics, but this amazing film will always be my personal favorite."
Spleen,"Aug 6, 2000",9/10,"There are many incidental pleasures in ""Fargo"", but where's the structure? I recall reading a definition in one of those concepts-for-which-we-have-no-words dictionaries: ""a book in which everything is clear except the author's purpose in writing it"".  Here is the cinematic equivalent.For those who want to excuse the film's messiness as the result of being based on a true story ... well, guys, I don't know how to say this: it isn't.  That ""the events you are about to see"" opening statement is a simple lie.  They made it all up.  I don't know about you, but I'm not inclined to just shrug my shoulders and say, ""oh, well""; this is AT BEST the Coen brothers' shameful way of manipulating us into doing their work for them. They should use craft to make us accept their stories, not deceit.  No doubt they can pass it all off easily enough as a postmodern joke, but to tell the truth, I'd thought the Coen brothers were above postmodern jokes - and they are.  ""Barton Fink"" was one of the best films of the 1990s.  ""Fargo"", thanks to its shapelessness, fails to live up to the other three Coen works I've seen.  (In case you're interested, the remaining two are ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"".)And yet, and yet ... Particular plot elements, individual scenes, certain characters and aspects of people's characters, are so fascinating, so artfully drawn ... it's frustrating.  Lundegaard is a wonderful character. He's the kind of man who stumbles from one weak act to the next and would probably hate himself if he stopped to think about his actions at all.  It was very clever of the Coens to begin his story in the middle.  We're never told exactly what fraud he's trying to cover up by kidnapping his wife; but we know, we just KNOW, that he committed THAT to cover up some lesser fraud, and the lesser fraud was in turn a way of saving face after he'd done some other thing, and that when we trace the chain of events back to its source we'll find ... in all likelihood, nothing.  Marge Gunderson is also a wonderful character.  She's proof that someone can be deeply, deeply good without being dull, or getting on our nerves.  Take the superb scene where she meets her old school friend in a restaurant ... but I'm reminded of what's wrong with ""Fargo"", for what's THAT scene doing in THIS movie?  I can't make it out.  ""Fargo"" really baffles me.  So many good parts, a curiously unsatisfying whole; great throughout, good overall."
alucas-2,"Dec 7, 2000",N/A,"I may not know movies as much as your average film student, but I know literature.  With that said, I'm convinced that if Shakespeare were alive today he'd be making movies and the Coen Brothers would be his chief competition. In Fargo, every line spoken, every facial expression rendered, and every broad shot of American tundra moves me in some way.  If this movie doesn't stand the test of time then I don't trust the test of time and whoever made up the test of time should be immediately flogged for fooling us all for so long. There, now.  That's as good a review as I can make.  I hope it takes.Feel free to contact me with questions or comments."

The good: The acting is the very good. Probably not worth an Oscar good (looking at you Francis McDormand) but still it is good.You also do get the sense this is a small town area.The bad/what I don't understand:
IMDb categorizes this movie as:
Cop drama. Dark comedy. Police procedural. Crime. Thriller.I understand the crime part. And I can (barely) understand the dark comedy part. (Although there was never any moment that I even smirked because of any sort of ""comedy"")
I don't see how this is a cop drama or a police procedural or a thriller.This movie is only 1.5 hours, and I found my self checking how much time was left multiple times.This feels like a movie that ""film"" people like to like. I don't really understand why that is or why it has such a cult following.When it ended my only feeling was relieve that it was over. Other than that it did not make me feel anything.But honestly now I can check it off my list and never watch it again."
natecjohnstone,"Apr 2, 2021",10/10,"Fargo (1996) has a simple opening - a car driving on a snowy day. Carter Burwells music in the background starts soft, yet sad - we know that this is the start of something tragic. As the car grows closer, the music grows louder, and we understand the scale of the tragedy about to occur - it is all about to go down, and it won't be good. This is one of many astounding scenes that comprise this movie.I can not express my intense love for Fargo enough. This movie is just sheer brilliance. It manages to be so much at once - tragic, hilarious, dark, gritty, touching, sad, tense. Yet the tone feels consistent throughout the movie. What makes it even more unique is its separation from heist movies - it just keeps topping itself. We've all seen movies where heists don't go according to plan - Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Reservoir Dogs (1993). But what Fargo does is it doesn't stop at one error, no - it just keeps going. Things just keep going wrong to the point where you, the viewer, believe that it just can't get worse. But then, of course, it does.Each character is unique and perfectly cast. The movie is known for Frances McDormands performance as Marge - a friendly, yet good cop. However, I also think that both Steve Buscemi's portrayal as Carl Showalter and Peter Stormares portrayal of Gaear Grimsrud are fantastic. The same applies to William H. Macys portrayal of Jerry Lundengaard. As I said, each character is unique and fleshed out, separate from the rest.There is so much brilliance in Fargo to be loved. The Coen brothers prove themselves as masterful filmmakers once again with this movie. If you have not seen it, I could not recommend it more."
robh,"Jul 29, 1998",6/10,This movie does not live up to the hype. It's ok but nothing special.
karins-2,"Sep 18, 1999",1/10,"I can't for the life of me understand why people like this movie. It was TERRIBLE! It glorifies violence (even tries to turn it into a big ""joke"") and makes all the characters look stupid -- the ""bad guys"" as well as the ""good guys"". This is, quite simply, a movie without any redeeming qualities. When I left the theater, I was depressed for hours."
bellino-angelo2014,"Nov 10, 2022",8/10,"While I am not really a big fan of the Coen brothers I liked most of their movies I saw, the best being THE HUDSUCKER PROXY. Having heard for years about FARGO since they made also a TV show based on it, I knew that some day I would have seen it, and I did last March. Considering that to date there are 1,087 reviews I'll be short.Jerry Lundergaard (William Macy) is an idiot businessman that has some problems in money. For having more money he has a plan: to fake the kidnapping of his wife Jean so that his father in law is forced to pay the ransom. After the advice of a car repairman he goes to a bar in Fargo where he meets Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsud (Peter Stormare) and promises them to give a car and, give half of the ransom money to both of them. Carl and Gaear succedd but Jerry didn't considered that the two are idiots: while Carl drives the car with the hostage Gaear shoots a police officer and two that were witnesses to the scene. All goes unnoticed until Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) comes, and she takes the problem personally while she is also waiting a baby. There are lots of twists and turns, but it's best that you see them for yourselves.I liked the performances: William Macy is perfect for the role of the salesman that plots the kidnapping of his wife, and Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are great as his bumbling henchmen. And while Frances McDormand looks like a supporting character, she truly deserved her Academy Award for best Actress (see the ending and you'll understand what I mean). The setting was cool in a way, and the whole movie has some sort of nostalgic feeling from the 1990s that even folks who didn't lived there like me would have.In substance, FARGO stands to his reputation as a cult movie and it's certainly a must see. Just don't have too much expectations for it."
shawnmikedryer,"May 11, 2021",10/10,"Jerry Lundegard runs his father-in-law's car dealership in Minnesota who always seems to be in massive financial trouble for one reason or another. Even after possible embezzlement at Jerry's place of work he still must go to absolute drastic measures. Thats when Jerry puts a scheme in motion to hire two out of area criminals to kidnap his wife in order to push his father-in-law to pay a million dollar ransom without his direct involvement. The hired men, Wade & Gaear, are successful in kidnapping Jerry's wife Jean but on the way to the safe house an unfortunate event leaves three people left in bloodshed. As Jerry attempts to mend the situation to keep the gears in motion and Wade & Gaear seemingly unravel a pesky, persistent, and very pregnant Sheriff Marge Gunderson is tenaciously motivated to unearth the truth of the murders so justice can be served.This film manages to be quite a poignant piece of filmmaking but in all regards deep within has beauty in it. Joel and Ethan Coen have always been fantastic storytellers but Fargo takes the cake with its twists, turns, and many layers leaves the viewer guessing until the very end. This is a very dark true story the pulls no punches in its brutality. The acting was phenomenal, the cinematography beautiful, and the musical score was on point. Might I add this cast is absolutely stacked even by todays standards. This is a 90's classic you need to add to your watchlist."
FilmCriticLalitRao,"Jul 23, 2007",10/10,"Coen brothers are known to be one of the most original film making duo working in Hollywood.A lot of adjectives can be used to describe their films and the great thing is that no two films made by them are same. Fargo is a great film as it doesn't hover around neither Hollywood type conventional narrative structure nor sometimes hard to fathom independent cinema style.It is a film in which mystery elements are revealed following a chronological order.Coen brothers have taken proper care of the screenplay as they have added their own material to a real life event which took place years ago.It is not at all a film about mistakes made while killing people. It is a film about human sentiments such as greed,helplessness and dedication to work.All those who like films with story are going to enjoy it.There are no special effects,animation and other high tech elements.What is to be seen in the film is pure emotional poetry-a poetry of human sentiments.The cast is outstanding especially Frances McDormand who makes a good try at being a workaholic pregnant policewoman."
cinephile-27690,"May 28, 2018",10/10,"Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel both called this the best movie of 1996. I think it's the best LIVE ACTION one. But they did say something I agree with: ""This is why I love the movies!"" Right on! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! The movie has strong profanity(mostly from Steve Bucuesmi) but it is very good!If you are a Veggie Tales fan Phil Vischer named this one of his favorite movies. This was nominated for Best Picture but lost to The English Patient-that's a good movie but Fargo is WAY better.Now, what makes it work so well? The dialogue is natural, the way everyone talks. it's funny at times as well.The plot is unique ,also. How many other movies are about a man who plot's his wife's murder to have her money to pay off a debt?This is a great adventure to witness-and it is only 98 minutes long!"
Fever,"Mar 29, 2000",N/A,"I finally saw this movie just recently and I have to say that I was very impressed. First off, the North Dakota accents were so true to life it was scary. It had an original plot (so rare these days) and excellent actors to carry it out. While it was a little on the bloody side, it deserved the Oscars it received."
charliemyett,"Aug 12, 2021",6/10,"I understand the praise and high ratings for this film. It's just not my style. The Coen brothers have made much better. McDormand, Macy and Buscemi are terrific actors as well, I just found the story to be a bit narrow. To be honest I enjoyed the first 2 seasons of the Fargo series to be much more enjoyable."
A_FORTY_SEVEN,"Aug 28, 2018",8/10,"My Rating : 8/10So I read the screenplay (well, most of it anyway) before watching the movie as I wanted to STUDY the movie. And then while watching the movie, I kept going back and forth with the screenplay and the movie playing.It is an absolute delight to see what the Coen Brothers have conjured up. The characters, the actors chosen, the setting in Minnesota/Minneapolis, the dialogues, the attention to detail all work cohesively. It's a brilliant work of creative filmmaking.I was spellbound from beginning to end. I think you really feel like you're there with them in the year 1996. Filmmaking has come a long way since then however a classic piece of filmmaking simply cannot be overlooked.I give this 8/10 for the amount of madness the Coen brothers have been able to squeeze in 1 hour and 38 minutes. Real good then."
bellsa037,"May 14, 2010",7/10,"I feel nobody is smart in this movie. It is different from the crime movies that I have been watched. Normally, they usually have the main character who are smart and fight with bad people. I think the director tries to make the movie is funny by using stupid manner of characters. However, many scenes are cruel, especially the scene that the man kills the police, and many scenes are unpredictable; for example, the scene that kidnapper looks through the window and breaks it out and comes to the house to kidnap. In addition, there is an example of overlapping sound in the scene that the man tries to fix the television. In that scene while the man is fixing the television, the camera is zooming in, and when the television is good, the camera zoom out, but it becomes the different place."
Ben-77,"Nov 10, 1998",10/10,"The Coen Brothers' opus (and they've made some great stuff - everything from Blood Simple to the Big Lebowski was brilliant) is second only to Billy Bob Thornton's incomparable Sling Blade as a fine example of the cinematic arts. Riotous yet subtle black humour, gorgeous snowy locations, stunning and suspenseful action, breathtaking support performances from William H Macy, Peter Stormare and the brilliant Steve Buscemi, and Frances McDormand's charming pregnant Marge Gunderson combine to make this the coolest movie you're ever likely to see. Rent it now, and see why the Coens are the kind of American filmmakers that they take notice of at Cannes."
stefan-144,"Jan 10, 2003",6/10,"Being Swedish, I know of winter. I have come across it in Wisconsin, too. Fargo portrays it well. The snow, the cold, the sort of pause mode it puts on life - and the human struggle to break out of it.The tempo of the film is kind of Scandinavian, and so is the acting - not only from very experienced Peter Stormare, who worked extensively with Ingmar Bergman on the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater, years ago. There's a constrained mood on all the acting, reminding me of the Bergman ideal, also making the characters quite realistic.What happens in the movie seems pretty much unavoidable, in great accordance with the drama ideal cherished by Aristotle. That is very interesting, since it's a story from real life. So life follows the laws of drama? At least when interpreted by the temperament of artists.There's a significant element of parody, too. A burlesque. What makes me hesitant, is that the balance between parody and realism is not set, not consistent. How the characters speak and react, that's close to farce, while their actions and the plot itself - that's very much realism, or naturalism, to use a concept from the art of literature.That is probably the reason for the actors not being able to sum up their characters and lead them to a proper end point. For just about all of them, when they have their last scene in the film, they are in limbo, not rooted at a point where events and their character would lead them. It's like they wait for the real ending.Well, maybe this is an epic, not a drama, but if so, it gives so much a pretense of drama, there is no room left for the epic to flourish. Nor is there sufficient room for significant characters in the story to be exposed.Another half-hour or so might have solved it. Maybe the film was too drastically treated at the cutting board."
toadwon,"Aug 21, 2001",1/10,"It had it all:  bad story, BAD acting, bad edits.....if we could add a badly done 50's monster it could be upgraded to a poor b-class sci-fi film, unfortunately it doesn't quite get there.  Macy didn't help himself with this film as he's a much better actor than what is shown in this film.  The best part of the film is you find yourself watching it to the end since you keep thinking it has to get better....."
kijii,"Dec 9, 2016",9/10,"This movie was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (William H. Macy). It won Oscars for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Frances McDormand) and Best Writing (the Coen Brothers).Fargo is certainly one of the Coen's finest and most famous movies. It claims to faithfully relate a true story that occurred between Fargo, North Dakota and Minnesota's Twin Cities in the late 1960s. The real story is anything but funny. But, this movie has its share of both humor and of black humor.The movie begins in Fargo as Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is making contact with two ""professional"" thugs to arrange for his own wife's kidnapping. Jerry, a car dealer from Minneapolis, with big personal money problems, wants his wife kidnapped because he knows his father-in-law is very wealthy and will pay the ransom for his own daughter.The idea is that once his father-in-law pays off the thugs and his wife is released, and he can split the ransom with the thugs. HOWEVER, once the deal is made and Jerry gives them one of the cars off of the lot, things start to go downhill when the quitter of the two thugs kills a policeman for stopping them to ask why the car has no tags. The killing of the policeman leads to two other passersby being killed.After this triple homicide, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), a pregnant cop is called into the case. As the movie develops—and the kidnapping scheme unravels—we are entertained by both the stories and characterizations of Marge's friends and family as well as Jerry Lundegaard's constantly frustrating and deteriorating predicament(s)."

smaug69,"Nov 10, 1998",10/10,"If more people in Hollywood would follow the Coen brothers', and others'(i.e. John Sayles and Mike Leigh) formula for making movies- no big name stars(read low budget), great script, great direction and focus- then everyone would benefit from movies like this one. This is an absolute gem with perfect casting, performances and the most beautiful photography I have seen in a long time. Frances McDormand is an absolute charm as the pregnant police officer trying to solve a murder in Paul Bunyan land, but it is William H. Macy's character and his performance that elevate this movie to greatness."
benjaminschofield,"Aug 11, 2015",10/10,"The Coen brothers are cinematic geniuses and Fargo demonstrates this genius beautifully. The film blends casual (even mundane) 'Minnesota nice' with the harsh macabre of crime and death.What starts off as a simple crime story slowly adds more layers, becoming increasingly complex as the crime begins to get out of hand. Whilst many films may struggle with such a convoluted storyline, the Coen brothers manage to deal with this in such a beautifully intricate way that prevents the viewer from ever being confused or disinterested but instead the audience can be truly impressed by the Coen's ability to handle such a story and pull it off so beautifully.The success of the film, however, is not entirely thanks to the brothers but credit is also due to the magnificent acting talent. William H Macy and Steve Buscemi both give amazing performances but the true star of the show is Marge Gunderson, played to perfection by Frances McDormand. This film is both great entertainment and beautiful art."
jwave21,"Mar 2, 2001",N/A,"""The greatest film of the 90's."" ""One of AFI's 100 Greatest Films."" Don't get me wrong...i found some parts of Fargo great...but unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't hold up. I highly respect the Coen Bros. I think Barton Fink and O Brother Where Art Thou? are two of the most enjoyable and most visually appealing films I have ever seen. And from their other films, I have walked away feeling good.In Fargo, however, I was bored and in anticipation of something great. That ""great"" never came. I thought Frances McDormand was decent,William H. Macy increasingly nervous, but I felt the real excitement was brought to the screen by Steve Buscemi. A staple of Coen Bros. films, he brought such explosiveness to the screen. He should have been nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar, b/c he does just that...he supports a film that i felt would have otherwise fallen flat on its face. As i said, though, Fargo did have some great parts, like all of their films do. The hotel room fight between Shep and Carl(Buscemi's character) left me laughing and in awe. The same goes for the confrontation on the parking garage between Carl and another character. So, in conclusion, Fargo decent...Steve Buscemi excellent."

Kingslaay,"Aug 2, 2018",7/10,Fargo was an enjoyable film and probably could be best summed up as a comedy of errors. This definitely has the stamp of the Cohen brothers on it with its tangents and side plots. The strength of this film to me is the strong performances from the cast.This film is well put together and culminates in a bit of tragedy for almost everyone. It is memorable enough but I wouldn't go as far to say it's iconic and I know I'm the minority with that. A stronger plot and more focused scenes I feel works better during screen time. A number of people are fond of the various side plots/tangents that kind of lead to nowhere and don't really add value. For example the scene with Margie and person she went to school with trying to chat her up added little to the story. This is a simple and ironic story but it is certainly not of Shakespearean proportions.
tomgillespie2002,"Apr 22, 2014",10/10,"The Coen Brothers' screw with the audience from the get-go with their 1996 Best Picture nominee Fargo, widely considered their finest work amongst a filmography that can be compared to that of any of the greats. Claiming this to be based on a true story when it is in fact anything but, the Coen's cement Fargo's twisted and now highly recognisable quirkiness from the first second, only for us to transported into this strange and oddball world of funny accents, eternal snowfall, wood- chippers and kinda-funny-lookin' criminals. In fact, the movie is not even set in Fargo at all. We glimpse it briefly before moving onto Brainerd, Minnesota, where the tremors of a dangerous arrangement are played out with violence and greed.Car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), in a desperate attempt to make some quick cash to fund a real estate deal, hires two hit men - Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Peter Stormare) - to kidnap his wife and split the ransom money paid by her wealthy father Wade (Harve Presnell). With the deal arranged, Jerry makes a final plea to Wade for investment, only for Wade to accept. Jerry tries to call the kidnapping off, but it is too late, and soon enough Carl and Gaear are leaving a trail of murders behind them. With a triple shooting at Brainerd that leaves a state trooper dead, pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is called in to investigate the crime spree.What the Coen's, cinematographer Roger Deakins and music scorer Carter Burwell created with Fargo is a film like no other, where a giant statue of a lumberjack carrying an axe looms over the film like some unconventional deity, and the characters are equally as mocked as they are warmly captured. With their small-town ways and strange, chirpy Swedish-American accents, not many of the characters in Fargo seem to notice the darkness that has crept into their town, and seem content with planning fishing trips, shuffling along the buffet table, or discussing the weather. The accent works like a character itself, a portal into these character's lives. You've most likely quoted ""you betcha!"" or ""oh, geez,"" in homage at some point if you've seen this movie before.Fargo also treads dangerously along the black comedy line, somehow making a man being blended through a wood-chipper hilarious and throwing us off course entirely with Marge's bizarre and uncomfortable catch-up drink with lonely friend-from-school Mike (Steve Park). But the Coen's have always done that, and probably never more successful than with this. The cruelty that the Coen's inflict on the rather loathsome characters seems somehow just, and offer a truly lovable character in Marge, one of the Coen's greatest creations, and wonderfully performed by the Oscar-winning McDormand. This is a masterpiece, a defining moment for Joel and Ethan Coen, who have created a haunting, strange, dark and very funny noir, and possibly the greatest film of the 1990's.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
kamran_ib,"Jan 6, 2011",2/10,"It seems like the Coen brothers have some uncle up in the Oscar ""distributing"" jury who always comes up to them and says ""Listen, we have a couple of Oscars lying around to give up in next week's ceremony so why don't the two of you make a movie & we'll give them to you""Come to think of it Al Pacino didn't get an Oscar for his role in The Godfather, Morgan Freeman didn't get it for Shawshank Redemption, Robert De Niro for Taxi Driver, Jack Nicholson for A Few Good Men & Frances McDormand got on Oscar for this movie for saying ""Yah"" a zillion times(in a very irritating & intolerable way). I honestly don't get what all the hype is about.Coming back to the topic, this movie very much like Coen Brother's other ""masterpieces""** Burn After Reading & No Country For Old Men, is pointless, boring and extremely overrated. It is an average movie with a week story line, irritating acting with an annoying & excessive use of the word ""Yah"".** I would like to make an appeal to other reviewers to stop calling every other movie a ""masterpiece"".If you are about to watch this movie i would seriously suggest that you do yourself a big favor & for a change not go with what the majority views say & watch something else.

Marwan-Bob,"Sep 27, 2019",9/10,I forgot how much I loved Fargo. It might even be my favourite Coen brothers film. Everything about it is just perfect.
owenpont-70803,"Jun 20, 2022",10/10,This was incredible. The Coen Brothers have made some great films. But this film perfectly sums comedic awkwardness with dark violence. This film is fantastic. The actors all did fantastic. The writing and directing by The Coen Brothers is awesome. And this is just a great movie. The fact that they said this was a true story but wasn't is simply funny and cool. This film could not be done today with the same greatness. Overall this is a flawless film and should be watched by everyone.
daoldiges,"Oct 21, 2022",9/10,"I don't think I'd even heard of the Coen brothers when I first saw Fargo during its original release. I guess that was for the best because I had limited expectations going in is partly why I ended up so thoroughly enjoying. Checking it out recently it's not quite as fresh as it once was,but it's still well done and solidly entertaining. I can see now how it has influenced later films and character development in the industry. McDormand perfectly creates a wacky character that you just can't seem to get enough of. It's more of a dark comedy for anyone who hasn't yet seen it and is expecting a light comedy, beware, but most definitely check out Fargo."
hedin_88,"Mar 25, 2013",N/A,"I've caught a glimpse of Fargo on TV and i decided not to watch it half way through but really enjoy it from beginning to the end. And i loved it. The most amazing thing here are the always lovable characters. You're gonna commiserate with those who are lost and find sympathy in those most crooked. They are all well casted, perfectly played and most importantly real. the dialogue is what keeps this movie witty till the end. The little exchange of words between the characters is amazingly written. what starts off as a well thought out plan spins out of control very quickly but it wont catch you off guard. its a movie definitely worth watching for all its traits- writing, directing, characters, dialogue, the cold scenery. its one of those movies that leave you with a feeling of time well spent and art very much enjoyably consumed."

frankde-jong,"May 25, 2022",8/10,"""Fargo"" was the breakthrough of the Coen brothers to a big audience. In my opinion it is still their best film, although ""No country for old men"" (2007) is their most popular film nowadays.In ""Fargo"" there are no master criminals and an even smarter detective. To the contrary. The criminals are rather amateurish and the crime gets out of hand rather quickly. In this way ""Fargo"" combines crime with comedy.It is therefore not accidental that the Coen brothers made a remake of ""The ladykillers"" in 2004. This film was no success. In the first place the crime element of this film is very subordinate to the comedy element. In the second place the original by Alexander Mackendrick (1955) was very hard to surpass.Another film with rather unprofessional criminals and a crime that gets out of hand is ""In cold blood"" (1967, Richard Brooks). This film doesn't have a comedy element whatsoever. What it does have in common with ""Fargo"" is a lot of violence. The violence in ""Fargo"" is however of such a caricatural and cartoon like nature that it somehow doesn't disturb.""Fargo"" is situated in the Mid North of the United States. The native region of the Coen brothers, but also the residence of a minority from Scandinavia. One can see this from names like Lundegaard, Gunderson and Grimsrud but also from there melodious English (Swedish is a very melodious language). Maybe even there hidden, indirect way of communicating can be traced back to their origin. When her collegue has said something stupid detective Marge Gunderson (Francis McDormand) says: ""I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou."".The quote above already indicates that not only are the criminals amateurish, also the police is all but glamorous. This is further emphasized by Marge Gunderson being heavily pregnant and wobbling through the movie. Also awkwardly holding a cup of coffee in thick mittens (it is winter and there is a lot of snow) doesn't look very sharp. But don't be fooled, Marge may seem a little sheepish at first, her conclusions are sometimes razorsharp. She is almost a female detective Columbo (Peter Falk)."
Gubby-Allen,"Mar 16, 2002",7/10,"A good film but certainly not one worthy of 10/10.It's a good & interesting story, I just can't worship the film like others as it was slow in places, had a main group of characters who though well acted, were all irritating & dislikeable to a degree. That's not a criticism of the film, after all, it was an attempted true account of real life incidents, but for all the exceptional camerawork & scenery, the plot just wasn't strong enough to carry an entire 100 minute film, but ignoring the occasional scenes that served little purpose it was otherwise good.7/10"
atlasmb,"Mar 7, 2023",8/10,"This cult classic was nominated for seven Oscars, winning two.The story is told in two parts. The first is about a car salesman who seems to have a compulsion to win, at any cost, no matter how large or small the stakes. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is terrific in this part, capturing his contrasting moods of an emotionless exploiter and a manic paranoid. The second part centers on a mild-mannered police detective named Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) with an aw-shucks brand of personality that hides an analytical mind.The film is certainly quirky. Like Tarantino meets Monk. Accordingly, there is a thread of humor, but this is a black comedy of errors, and it is definitely not for everyone. But it is filmed well and the acting is genre-appropriate, making it very watchable."
Vartiainen,"Jan 12, 2016",7/10,"An inept car salesman hires two thugs to kidnap his wife in order to get money from his rich father-in-law. Unfortunately he should have hired better thugs as they end up messing the whole thing up, which in turn causes the local law enforcement to become involved. From that setting we get a crime story worthy of being directed by the Coen brothers, full of awkward characters, everyday situations and hilariously dark scenes of blood, gore and rage.The two thugs, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, are what make this film work for me. Usually cinema tends to depict criminals as violent and lethal people, and these two are that as well, but usually these kinds of characters are not depicted to be quite so out of their depth. It is made clear very soon that while these two may have done these kinds of things before, neither is what you'd call the sharpest knife in the drawer. And they're both so idiotic in their own ways. It's fascinating to watch them live their miserable criminal lives and utterly failing at it. And yet they remain threatening throughout the entire film. Not because they're criminal masterminds, but because they're morons with no moral inhibitions.William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, the car salesman, is also a fun character, who contrasts nicely with the two thugs. He's attempting to become a criminal, but he's even worse at it than his associates and every scene where he needs to pull off any kind conviction about his innocence is absolutely hilarious because well, you can guess.Frances McDormand as Marge Gunderson, the Minnesotan police chief in charge of investigations, has also received a lot of praise for her work. Personally I found her to be a touch boring, though I do admit that my expectations we're a bit too high. She's just so utterly chipper and optimistic all the time that it seems unrealistic. It's a nice contrast to her opponents, but it still means that I didn't find her that interesting. Still, I do like her character on a conceptual basis, and the performance itself is objectively fine. Not just my personal cup of tea.All in all Fargo is a nice watch if you're into dark comedy and can laugh at people being dismembered and people giving into their nefarious impulses. If you've liked any of the other Coen films, you're going to like this one as well."
bw92116,"Dec 2, 2006",5/10,"Completely honest viewpoint... I first saw this film in a theater during its initial theatrical run in 1996. A friend picked it out, as I had never heard of it until then. We sat through it, then on the way out, I said to him, ""Well, that was weird."" He looked at me and laughed, saying, ""I was just going to say that."" We then promptly forgot about it and started talking about someone else. It seemed like it would have done well as an extended episode of some bizarre TV series along the lines of ""Twin Peaks,"" etc. Something that you would watch once, and then next week, something different would happen with the same characters. But as a self-contained film, well, it's not enough of a story, not enough of a film. The months later, it was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture. On hearing that, I thought, ""Wow, Hollywood really liked it."" I have to admit I was rooting for Brenda Blethyn to win the Oscar for ""Secrets and Lies"" as I thought hers was the best performance of the year. So I was let down when Frances McDormand won, not that her performance wasn't award-worthy, just that the wrong person won that year. Thinking I had missed something profound about ""Fargo,"" I rented the DVD when it came out, I think in 2003. This time I could hardly stomach the violence in it. I wisely turned it off before one particularly gruesome scene happened. I don't see any point in sitting through it again. I was ready to write off the Coen brothers as filmmakers, until I rented ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" which was brilliant. Sorry, but that's just my honest opinion about ""Fargo."""
rgpaeplrp,"Aug 10, 2025",9/10,"Fargo is one of those movies that somehow manages to be funny, pretty disturbing, and comforting all at the same time. Joel and Ethan Coen take this snowy, quiet Minnesota setting and throw in a kidnapping gone wrong, and it's just a perfect mix of awkward politeness and total chaos. The story follows Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), a car salesman so desperate he hires two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife. Of course, it all goes sideways fast, and the whole mess ends up in the hands of Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), a pregnant police chief who's just about the most wholesome and sharp-eyed detective you'll ever see. The tone is what makes it great - it jumps between dark, messed-up violence and these almost down-to-earth conversations, and it never feels jarring. The characters are so memorable- Marge with her kind smile and subtle wisdom, and Jerry, who's just a walking ball of sweaty desperation. It's gorgeous too - all that endless white snow makes the violence stand out even more, and Roger Deakins' cinematography makes you feel the cold. By the end, when Marge delivers her little reflection on how senseless it all is, you realize you weren't just watching a quirky crime story - you were watching a movie about how greed and stupidity wreck people's lives. Rating- 9.5/10 - snow, crime, and pure brilliance."

Seraphion,"Jul 24, 2014",7/10,"The story claimed to be based on factual true events; it makes it more interesting to see. The basic premise is a rare one, a lying husband decide to con his way to his father-in-law's money turns out of control and claiming many lives. The story and focus dramatization were developed well; it was able to emphasize the thriller aspect as well as at the same time presenting the quirkiness of the story in the characters. We have a contradicting pair of kidnappers, one a foul-mouthed talker while the other one a calm and silent yet sadistic. On the other side of the story we have the easy-going and spirited policewoman. The acting is quite good that it can take you deep into the story despite all the quirks in the story. Macy and McDormand performed their roles well; they managed to keep me interested in seeing what's next for them. While the quirky pair of Buscemi and Stormare can bring a few laughs into the horrific tale told here."
jimguy,"Sep 13, 1998",9/10,"The Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, have created in Fargo their best film to date (and I'm writing this after The Big Lebowski). I've watched it I think four times and each time am again impressed with its outrageous excellence. If you love inventive camera work, intelligent scoring (Carter Burwell), sharp dialog, and a strong female lead (Frances McDormand, winning the Oscar)--and are not put off by occasional violence--then Fargo is well worth seeing (in fact, worth buying!). Just one thing: Take the ""true story"" tag with a grain of salt. Apparently the Coens were having some fun with that declaration!"
Nat-21,"Feb 23, 1999",2/10,"""Fargo:"" has to be one of the most overrated films in history. Academy Award nominations and wins? Breathless praise for Frances McDormand? Talk of it as a classic? One of the best 100 movies of all time?Give me a break! I'm sorry, but the plot was as flat as the landscape, the violence was off-putting and there wasn't enough humor to make this movie a black comedy. I don't have anything against the Coen brothers; ""Raising Arizona"" was great. But this effort failed miserably, in my opinion.Why was McDormand honored so highly? All she did was walk around a little, drink coffee and talk in an exaggerated Midwest accent. Macy, I'll admit, was good. But overall, the film was a miserable waste of time. I guess I'll never understand some people's idea of ""classic."""
jamesrupert2014,"Nov 7, 2019",9/10,"Desperate nebbish Jerry Lundegaard (an excellent William H. Macy) hires an erratic pair of criminals (played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife...and things go wrong, very wrong. 'Fargo' is one in a long list of superlative films produced and directed by the Coen brothers. The film is a dark, almost farcical, comedy with offbeat characters, an excellent sense of place (flat, wide, cold, and bleak), and the famous over-the-top Minnesota accents, especially from Academy Award winner Frances McDormand (""You betcha!""). The clever plot is a cautionary tale about just how hard pulling off a complex crime would be (unlike most 'caper films', few people in 'Fargo' respond as they were expected to) and the psychological strangulation as the noose tightens around Jerry is palpable. McDormand's 'Marge Gunderson', a heavily pregnant, always hungry, Minnesota cop investigating the increasingly bloody kidnapping is outstanding: perfectly blending the character's disarming 'Minnesota-nice' personality with her competence as an investigator. An entertaining and memorable film."
duder-2,"Nov 12, 1998",10/10,"I've seen Fargo probably 40 times, and you know how many times it took me to realize that this film is the mosy utterly perfect film of all time? ONE. Period. After the first time I saw it, I fell in love with it. Completely, head over heels in love. I have become a commonlaw husband to it, and I think I treat my copy of the film better than I will ever treat any woman (if you are a prospective significant other out there, I'm sorry.) This is the film I aspire to someday become fused within, to live with Marge and Norm ""Son of a Gun""derson, or the Lundegaards. This is the movie that made me think of movies as a higher art. THE higher art, I should say. There is never a dull moment in this film, and if you watch it with someone who likes to make talkie during the silences, please kick them in the head, every milli-second of silence is vital. This quiet, every milli-second, is crafted to perfection, and is worth any line of dialogue. Although I must say, the dialogue ain't bad. So, to sum it up, again, Fargo is the most beautiful movie, aesthetically and otherwise, I can imagine."
apsiblauses,"Dec 29, 2022",8/10,"Fargo is a 1996 crime drama film directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film follows the story of Jerry Lundegaard (William H.

However, things quickly go awry, and the plan spirals out of control, leading to a series of violent and tragic events.Overall, Fargo gets 3.5 out of 5 stars from me. The film's unique blend of dark humor and realistic comedy was definitely its strongest point. The Coen brothers have a knack for creating memorable and quirky characters, and Fargo is no exception. Macy gives a standout performance as the hapless and desperate Lundegaard, while Buscemi and Stormare are both menacing and hilarious as the bumbling criminals.However, the film's plot wasn't quite as complex as I was expecting. While the story was entertaining and kept me engaged, it didn't quite have the depth or nuance that I was hoping for. Still, Fargo is a clever and entertaining film that is sure to delight fans of dark comedy and crime dramas. If you haven't seen it yet, it's definitely worth a watch."

I'm not sure if the accents are overwritten for the mid-west during the time period the movie is set in, but the mid-west accent is cranked up to 11.There is a weird cordiality that some of the characters have and some definitely don't that also adds to the movie.Very good. I'd recommend it to anyone."

Having read some of the negative comments on this website, I can only say - you just can't appreciate good filmmaking!  It's brilliant, quirky, blackly humourous with great performances and a memorable score.  Even after I had seen the film I could hear Carter Burwell's memorable music.  The performances of Frances McDormand, William H Macy and Steve Buscemi are all terrific. It's also unusual to see a film set in a part of the US that we in the UK aren't too familiar with.  The complaints I've read about the accents are unjustified - the Minnesota accent certainly makes a change after all the NY, Californian and Southern accents we've heard in the past.One more thing - it's allegedly based on a true story which happened in 1987, but the end credits state it's fictional."
iollann,"Mar 31, 2017",6/10,"Review: 'Fargo' Another film by the Coen brothers, Fargo, starring William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, is about a man in financial problems who devises to hire men to kidnap his wife so his wealthy father in law will pay for her release and in turn pay off his debt. Fargo is a crime, drama and a thriller. It was released in 1996. To be completely honest I didn't really like this film I had seen 'The Big Lebowski' before going into this film and just had such high hopes. I thought 'The Big Lebowski' was far superior. Although I thought that having Steve Buscemi as a major character was better than how he is in 'The Big Lebowski' with him only having a couple of lines, even still he was very funny in 'The Big Lebowski'. His performance as Carl is very good. He plays a very violent, crazy guy. His partner in crime Gaear played by Peter Stormare is also portrayed very well and its actually quite funny watching him grimace at the violence of Buscemi's character. One of the reasons I thought 'The Big Lebowski' is better is because I thought it was far funnier. In 'Fargo' I felt that too many times the comedy was centred on the characters accents. It was funny the first time but it got old quick. Especially for Frances McDormand's character I felt that most of the humour was just the accent. Apart from one scene I didn't really like her character. When she is interviewing one of the criminals and he drives off and she exclaims 'oh for Pete's sake, he's fleein' the interview' I thought that was her standout scene to be honest. I thought she over did the 'Yas' throughout the film. I especially found it hard to relate to her and sympathize with her. I felt the overuse of the accent again was the cause of that. I think the jokes with the accent went over my head because I've never been to Minnesota. One thing that really worked for me was the visuals. For me the setting is the reason for this. The snow really makes everything look great. The contrast between the dark clothes of the characters and the snow looked really good. I think the most iconic thing for me is the scene where the car drives past the statue of the lumberjack. This for some reason just really stuck out in my mind. Whenever I think of Fargo I think of that statue. In conclusion the story is decent, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are excellent along with William H. Macy. Frances McDormand is a bit hit and miss as well as most of the humour in the film. In the end, I give it a 6/10. I found it very hard to like it especially in comparison with 'The Big Lebowski'."
moviewatcher747,"Jan 18, 2002",10/10,"Anyone who's seen ""Fargo"" has experienced something they've never experienced before. The Coens are back and they're better than ever!Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police woman who becomes enthralled in a scandalous kidnapping/murder case involving swindling used car dealer Jerry Lundegaard, who's hiring two buffoons to kidnap his wife so her father will cough up a large ransom.What's so surprising about this film is that it's funny while it's suspenseful. The scenes with the kidnappers have strong language and violence and are usually serious while the scenes with Marge and her husband are quite humorous.I was captivated right at the beginning when I purchased the DVD. It opens to a black screen with white lettering stating that the following film is a true story. Out of respect for the dead, some of the names have been changed. Entirely engrossing but yet entirely not true.Director Joel Coen said later that if you know that the movie is based on actual events, they'll believe anything on the screen, even if it's totally unrealistic.There are so many scenes that are ingenious: the infamous woodchipper scene, Marge and her accomplice Lou discussing the dealer plates on the murderer's car, Marge cracking a joke about a guy changing his name to ""J37-2404,"" and more.Anyone and everyone should see ""Fargo"" some time in their life, whether it be on television or video, see it! It's extremely inventive, hilarious, and still manages to be gratuitously violent.NOTE: When Buscemi is pulling the dead body of the cop after shooting him in the head and the car's headlights are seen getting closer and closer in the distance, this must be a reference to the Coen's first film ""Blood Simple"" in which there's a similar scene."
vampire_cowboy,"May 11, 2004",10/10,One of the best movie of 1990s. Great acting by all the lead players.The snow shown in the movie adds chills to the dark storyline. Peter Stormare wins the show. The steely snakelike stare and cold bloodedness of the character he played in the movie propelled him into limelight. Buscemi is at his best.Funny and witty as ever. The movie is actually a dark comedy. A must watch for coen buffs. The cinematography is superb. Go for it..
TaylorYee94,"Jun 4, 2021",6/10,"Coen brothers are sometimes confused between creativity and bizarreness. Many masterpieces bring in original script, directing, editing, or camera walk, but none of them appears to show off these efforts. It just shows. Coen brothers... I can clearly see what they are trying to do here. 'I'm so cool, so I'm gonna make this movie so unique and original. I will try to bring out jokes and comical air amidst serious crime, deceit, and psychopathic behavior and call it black comedy.' To do this, they need tighter, more developed, and more enchanting storyline. The story itself is loose; many scenes without any meaning just to emphasize the movie's quirkiness; unnecessarily inhumane and disgusting scenes not producing any effects. AND why does this movie ardently claim that it is a true story when it is not? I feel so cheated."
Joe Mama-2,"Jul 11, 2000",1/10,"I've always heard good things about Fargo, and once it made the AFI's top 100 list of funny movies, I decided to rent it. I very rarely rent R-rated films, but this seemed to be worth it.In short, my brother and I did not laugh once, nor did we enjoy the film.First of all, the film is violent and grotesque. I've seen many violent films before, but this went beyond anything I've seen. There are several murders committed. All of them are extremely disturbing in their depiction of blood and guts as well as the complete inhumanity of each killing.Second of all, the film has numerous moments of gratuitous sex which serve the plot no purpose, other than perhaps additional character degradation.In my opinion, this film is the second worst thing to happen to mainstream entertainment in the 90s.The worst thing is that people out there laughed at it. What a blasted hame!"

ConsistentlyFalconer,"Aug 2, 2015",10/10,"The Coen Brothers are in that rare stratum of writers/directors who seem to have formed a genre of their own. (Woody Allen, Hitchcock and Wes Anderson are other examples)The argument over which is their greatest film will never be settled, but Fargo is surely a strong contender. The Coens always manage to create atmospheres that are simultaneously realistic and stylised; rarely comfortable. Here, in the relationship between Marge and Norm Gunderson, there's a rare glimpse of their ""cozy"" side - and it's wonderfully touching. Outside of that, however, the film is unsettling, occasionally vividly violent, and darkly comic.The gradual disintegration of Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy), as his spineless, cowardly plan unravels, and he flails against the ever-tightening net of his own lies, is a sight to behold, with the Macy playing the part absolutely perfectly - you almost feel sorry for him at first, but your sympathy runs out as the film continues.Meanwhile, Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, one of the most admirable police officers ever seen on screen - this is not a bumbling, dull-witted small-town copper. Nor is she the ace detective with a disastrous home life we see so often. An original, rounded character with depth, a history and a future.Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare... well if they've turned in a bad performance between them on film I'm yet to see it.It's a crime drama, a thriller, a dark comedy... but really the best description of Fargo is, It's a Coen Brothers Film.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com"

It's a dark movie but there are so many comedic turns in the story. I really do understand now the impact of ""Fargo"" in modern cinema. I was not sure what to expect and honestly I'm really amazed by the outcome. Frances McDormand is captivating in her performance as the chief of the police. So many layers in her character. William H Macy honestly is the soul of the movie. What a story! The cinematography and visuals wrap these all together to make a perfect picture. I really wish I had seen ""Fargo"" sooner."
Richie-33,"Jan 18, 2001",N/A,"This darkly comic tale from the Coen brothers is arguably their finest piece of work to date. They apply their trademark quirky style to the not entirely original plot of a car salesman who arranges his own wife's kidnapping in order to get the ransom money from his scrooge-like father-in-law. However, the simplicity of the plot allows you to concentrate on the most important part of the film, the carefully crafted characters, each with their own idoesyncrasies that make it a delight to see which strange creation will appear in the next scene.These are perfectly realised by a fantastic cast of actors. While credit must go to the ever-dependable Steve Buscemi as the bungling kidnapper and William H. Macy as the salesman full of frustration and impotent rage, the best performance is by Frances McDormand, who deservedly won an Oscar as the heavily pregnant sheriff trying to solve the crime. The only main female character in the film, she is surrounded by a succession of increasingly more pathetic men, from her househusband, to an old school friend who still lives with his parents. Even the crime itself lurches from one disaster to another as events conspire to make a seemingly straightforward kidnapping escalate into a multiple homicide. The unfamiliar location of Dakota provides some great backdrops and spectacularly barren vistas and the snow somehow adds to the absurdity of the whole situation. Also adding to the comedy element are the unusual local accents which are seemlessly adopted by the cast and if you don't find yourself mimicking a Minnesotan for a few days after seeing 'Fargo' then you really ought to visit a doctor to see about getting that funny bone removed, it's obviously not working right."
dragokin,"Apr 15, 2014",6/10,"When i first saw Fargo it seemed to be very short, which might be attributed to it's 98 minutes running time. In the long run, it turned out to be the Coen brothers' best effort.If you want to relax, simply switch your brain off and enjoy the movie. Fargo is considered to be a masterpiece, but i'd name it an above-average movie. It's might not surpass the notoriety of Barton Fink (1991) or the fame of The Big Lebowski (1998) and the Academy Award winning boredom called No Country for Old Men (2007) yet it is fun to watch.If you want to analyze Fargo, you won't get far.

If your experience is anything like mine, then you will see first articles about the newish (and apparently very good; I should check it out) TV show, then the movie, and only third the actual city.The Coens have a fairly similar tale, though they are by now far more well-known across American than Fargo the city. Because it was their breakthrough into popular culture (and earned them their first Oscar), it was many a film-goer's introduction to them. As such, there are a fair amount of people who think that this is their first feature film when it is in reality their fourth.But enough posturing and preparing. Why did I give this film a perfect score? What specifically makes it so captivating? Why is it regarded as one of the greatest films of the nineties. Well, in one sentence, it seamlessly blends comedy and drama without missing a beat, delivering a film as thought-provoking as it is entertaining, as likable as it is nihilistic, as beautiful as it is gritty.I think if the Rotten Tomatoes review recap were a little more artsy, it would sound something like that.In 1987, a car insurance salesman, played nicely by William H. Macy, is desperate for money. A lot of money. So he arranges for his wife to be kidnapped by some random criminals in return for 80K and a new car. He will then tell his wealthy father-in-law (who owns the chain of car dealerships) about this, say the criminals want a million in ransom, give them the 80K, and take 920K for himself, so he can start his own operation and start making money his way.Now, if he were competent, this would have been a totally different movie. But he's not. No one is in this film. From the time you learn that he's a used car salesman, he feel almost a sort of pity towards him. He bungles around and sees everything crashing down on him, and there is nothing he can do about it. I won't spoil the ending, but it does not end well for him, or for any of the characters.There is nothing more powerful than a comedy-drama done right. Neither contemporary film critics nor general audiences usually like them at first, but history gives them windfall.Just because there is darkness does not mean that the movie has to be miserable. Thinking otherwise is how you get (relative) tripe like The Pianist or The English Patient while some of the greatest films of all time, like Leon: The Professional, a film I was reminded of more than a few times during my viewing of this, are shut out.But of course, Leon, while it has a more vivid, more adventurous tone than one would expect for its subject matter, is not a comedy. This is. We throw the phrase 'dramedy' around a lot to describe a series or movie or game that has a lot of comedic and dramatic moments. But that phrase has never seen more apt than it is here. This film is not just a comedy and a drama, it is a full fledged combination of the two. And it is beautiful to behold. The drama makes the comedy better and the comedy makes the drama better. This approach is hard to pull off, but when it works, oh it works. And it never works has well as it does here.A major theme in this film is imperfection. Think back to the title: they are in the far north, not the bright lights of NYC and Los Angeles. This motif is everywhere if you look for it, particularly in the characters. No one in this film is that confident or assured or smart. They are tragic characters, but not in the sweeping, cinematic sort of way, or even in the way we like to see reality portrayed. Rather, they are clumsy and awkward and angry; but not in an absolute way; they have some good in them too. Even one of the villains does something surprisingly selfless.At the start, we are told that this is a true story, but at the end, we are told that it is not. Right there is the confusion and sense of hollowness that the Coens make so much use of here. Risky conniving and strategy are cool when they are done well, but are tragic for most others, for most of us. And after all our quests and ventures, it so often is empty and worthless, which us all dying. It doesn't lull on it like dramatic films can, but rather weaves it into the dark comedy, which makes it all the more poignant.I do not like this film quite as much as No Country for Old Men, but it is a thoughtful, dark, masterfully-written, stunningly-shot, radiantly-scored film that you would be doing yourself a disservice to not see. You will not realize how invested in you are until half the film is already over."
bohemianmelanie,"Aug 7, 2023",8/10,"The film is set in the cold landscape of Minnesota and follows the story of Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy), a car salesman who hires two criminals (played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and demand ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. However, things quickly spiral out of control, leading to a series of darkly comedic and violent events.One of the standout aspects of ""Fargo"" is its brilliant writing and storytelling. The Coen brothers masterfully blend elements of crime, dark humor, and drama, creating a unique and engaging narrative. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and filled with memorable quotes that have become iconic in popular culture.Frances McDormand delivers an outstanding performance as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief investigating the bizarre and violent crimes. Her portrayal of a tenacious, down-to-earth, and deeply empathetic character earned her an Academy Award and remains one of her most celebrated roles.The film's cinematography and direction also contribute to its overall brilliance. The Coen brothers expertly capture the bleakness of the Minnesota landscape, using it to enhance the film's atmosphere and mood. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the tension to build gradually and culminate in a gripping climax."
x_manicure_x,"Aug 14, 2021",7/10,"""Fargo"" is the quintessential Coen Brothers film, but also their most overrated. It's a quirky dark comedy that essentially sees a cinematic crime story performed by ordinary Midwesterners. We are so used to the dramatic conventions that films follow to the point that realistic characters end up looking goofy and awkward. As usual with the Coen Brothers, plans are made to go wrong, the characters who act cinematic have no credibility whatsoever, and those who are down-to-earth end up looking the most cinematic.It's a film full of memorable, meticulously constructed scenes and unique characters, yet I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. In particular, the humor relied a bit too much on the accent and didn't always click with me. There are also a few dull moments like the Yanagita scenes that brought the pacing of the story down and were not even that funny."
HotTakesAndMilkshakes,"Dec 8, 2025",9/10,"Judging by the title, it sounds unbelievable that a film could be described this way, but it truly is a feel-good dark thriller that can be easily misunderstood.So let's dive into the positives and negatives.Positive:
This is a movie that plays like a thriller, but it's not actually thrilling in the traditional sense. It's funny, and it makes you feel strange for laughing at things that would normally be considered very dark. It's one of those films where you either get the ironic dark humor or you simply don't.The whole movie mocks the idea of greed. Its characters are hilarious in a way you don't see in typical Hollywood films; they feel like random, bizarre strangers you'd meet once and never forget because of how outrageous they are.There are plenty of unexpected, over-the-top moments that still somehow flow effortlessly. It's an exciting, absurd little ride that stands out for being genuinely unique. By the end, you'll laugh, you'll question why you laughed, but you'll still walk away feeling great for having watched something different.Negative:
The only noticeable flaw for me is the pacing at the start. It's slow and a bit dull, although it does match the tone and the place of the film in the beginning. Stick with it, because things shift into absurdity quickly.Another potential issue is the humor. For some people, this style of comedy will feel too unusual or too ironic, and those who prefer straightforward comedies might not connect with it. The characters also lack real depth or meaningful arcs, but I personally never felt the film needed that. They were memorable enough as they were.Overall:
This movie is a unique experience. I can't guarantee you'll fully understand it, but you should still give it a chance to broaden your viewing experience and teach yourself to look beyond the obvious. You might discover something unexpectedly charming that leaves you speechless.This is a must-watch, and afterward you can confidently say, ""They don't make 'em like they used to."""
jackkaniewski-27838,"Feb 10, 2023",9/10,"Fargo is one of the most enjoyable watches in film ever, by the best duo of directors ever, it flows perfectly and has acting so good even background characters deserve Oscar's , it's one of those films where it seemed destined for the actors to play said role, some scenes build up tension very slow and it pays off big, or other scenes the tension builds up so quickly and blatantly it's over before it's started.But, the Coen brothers have a huge flaw present in their films, a drab colour pallet, making it almost an eyesore to watch you would think, but it is fixed by a gripping plot and important objects in every scene that mark something or stand for something, sadly the film has a poor ending and combined with the drab colours, for me it only nets a 9."
berestov,"Jan 8, 2026",8/10,"It's nice to review such classics on a winter evening. Returning to this movie after almost a decade and several thousand movies watched, you rate it much higher than initially. Even the simple scenes of Frances McDormand's character with her on-screen husband look different.In general, the Cohens' talent is striking every year more and more in non-comedic plots to generate so many from just funny moments to whole scenes. That's what black comedies are for."
