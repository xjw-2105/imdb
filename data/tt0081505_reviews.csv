yancyscott1,"Apr 9, 2007",9/10,"Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense ""writing""... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script."
Counterparts42,"Feb 12, 2023",9/10,"One of those films that is a classic for a reason.It's been on my list of movies to watch forever and a day and I finally got to it in 2023.This is an experience, masterfully shot and some of the most intense and engaging performances I have ever seen.Nicholson and Duvall have a complex chemistry that works at so many levels, which is essential to the make up of this story and anchors the first class direction.This is cinematically spectacular, the sets and the the design of this film is isolating, terrifying and captivatingly beautiful all at the same time.Worth all of the accolades and hype, even at 43 years old this film delivers in spades."
FlickJunkie,"Jul 24, 2001",9/10,"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.Rating: 9/10"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Oct 18, 2020",10/10,"Kubrick, King and Nicholson, the writing was literally on the wall, and I don't mean RedRum, forty years on, and The Shining is still a masterpiece.Kubrick takes King's fantastic book, and builds on it, bringing the story to life in his own inimitable way. It's dark, it's bleak, it's terrifying, a masterpiece in storytelling. You watch as the central character's mental collapse is played out in a spine chilling fashion.Gorgeous camera work, incredible visuals, that opening is iconic. So many incredible, visual moments, the twins, lift, barman etc, no wonder it's been parodied multiple times over the years, famously by The Simpsons.An iconic role for Jack Nicholson, he is incredible, well supported by a terrific cast.It's a classic, 10/10."
us012862,"Aug 27, 2000",N/A,"When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing ""The Shining"" was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And ""funny"" because of Jack Nicholson's outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Highly, highly recommended. - Paul"
azemillancy,"Mar 6, 2022",10/10,"Whenever we hear the name Stanley Kubrick, the poster, scene or a shot from The Shining will come to our mind - most probably "" Here's Johnny!"". For a legendary filmmaker like Kubrick who has multiple masterpieces to his credit, would still be fine if he had never even made this film. But still, there would be some great missing which will be felt! That's because of The Shining's ability to penetrate the viewer's mind, even the subconscious, and imprint an influence in its deeper depths. How the movie hooks the viewer with its horror which is created from several dimensions is a remarkable factor that makes this film an all-perfect masterpiece that is thrilling and exciting even after watching it umpteen times.How Kubrick created the horror, just one among the many factors that make the film a great one (still a very important one though), is so deep and mind-blowing, he builds tension in the viewer with enough substance written in the screenplay to showcase on the screen, and perfectly well-tuned and tastefully directed horror. Most importantly, the background music and sounds have immense depth with its structuring crafted to the innermost core and the finely touched upper layers. The actors give performances that are dramatically aesthetic and showcase facial expressions that are realistic to the utmost extent. As the film progresses the anticipation for something scary to expect in the upcoming scenes is created successfully and the anticipation that it created is also executed by scaring the viewer with horrors of huge intensity.One thing that is found in this film is something of a variety. It's the portrayal of the supernatural in a very realistic manner, which is done in a subtle way that doesn't let the viewer know that it's a realistic portrayal of the supernatural he won't even care to notice it. Because that's how successfully it's done. And what's the use of it? It has an impact on the viewer which affects how he perceives the film, and that too which will be something of an advantage for the filmmaker.I don't intend to say anything about the story of the film, whether it's supernatural horror or the breakdown of a madman's mind, is still debated among cinephiles, even 40 years after the film's release. And that's also a thing which makes the film a great one! Rather than just showing what the maker wants to show, Kubrick lets the viewer decide what the film is, by making him analyse the film from his perspective and come up with an interpretation. This is a form of interactive cinema, an indirect one though.The Shining is one of the greatest horror masterpieces or even one of the best films of all time."
b_kite,"Jun 20, 2022",10/10,"While I can understand a lot of Stephen King's arguments over Kubrick's vision, including casting Jack Nicholson who instead of a descent into madness looks insane from the first frame. This is still an absolute classic."
BenjaminPopkin,"Mar 30, 2022",10/10,"The sound, editing, camera and mise en scene are all utilized perfectly. A perfect score, framing, cinematography, camera work, set, production design, acting, storytelling, and not only just a perfect horror movie, but a perfect film. This film is what all great films STRIVE to be. The highest of film standards.The Shining is a masterwork of creating mood, setting tone, and developing an atmosphere. The score is one of the best and most iconic scores of all time. As well as the most eerie.This is honestly my favorite of all Stanley Kubrick's films. The Shining is a masterpiece of cinema *chefs kiss*The only thing that is a negative imo is that if your not completely invested in the movie and ready to sit down and watch, you will get bored. It's lengthy, but worth it once your totally engrossed in the film. Especially for your first viewing. You gotta pay attention."
portraitofaladyonfire,"Jan 6, 2021",6/10,"My expectation were to high. I expected a masterpiece, but in the end I found it just mediocre. Dont get me wrong the acting and the camera work are great. Storywise I couldnt really get invested in it. In terms of horror except the twins it wasn't scary at all in my opinion."
neil-476,"Jan 14, 2008",5/10,"This is a difficult review to write. You see, I've just posted comments on Ella Enchanted where I comment that, as someone who has never read the book, the film is absolutely fine. But it's difficult for me to approach Stanley Kubrick's The Shining on that basis because, you see, I've read Stephen King's The Shining.If I do my absolute best to put the book out of my mind, I suppose that the film must be acknowledged as a tolerable horror, with two major flaws - one, it's overlong, and what should be a slow burn loaded with increasing dread becomes simply boring, and two, Jack Nicholson's established screen persona means that there is absolutely no suspense in his development from decent though flawed father/husband to scenery-chewing maniac - the final madness is there from the first frame he appears in.If you've never read the book and you're a horror fan, then you'll probably enjoy it - no huge surprises, but it ticks most of the boxes. And it looks very good.But what a missed opportunity! Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a film about a man who goes mad in a haunted hotel. Stephen King's The Shining is a novel about an evil entity which inhabits a hotel, and which wants to consume a boy's psychic power: the boy is strong enough to resist it, so it works on the weakest link, the father, and gradually erodes everything which made him a good, decent man. Jack's transition from the decent though weak man he starts out as, to the point where the Overlook is in control of his every action, is absolutely central to Stephen King's The Shining, and it could only have worked on screen if Jack was portrayed by an actor who was initially credible as a decent, gentle man. Not Nicholson - I love him, but he was (in my view) a spectacular piece of miscasting for this movie. Picture Dustin Hoffman, Harrison Ford, or someone similar, and how dramatic and shocking their descent to axe-wielding maniachood would have been.The contrast is essential to Stephen King's story: with Nicholson, there was no contrast.It is also worth commenting that King's The Shining is about a man who loves his family: Kubrick's The Shining is stated, by the screenwriter in one of the DVD documentaries, to be about a man who hates his family. A fairly fundamental difference, yes?Ah well. ""What if""s never got us anywhere. Go and see Stanley Kubrick's The Shining anyway, and enjoy Jack Nicholson chewing scenery. The scenery's pretty good eye candy and, besides, he does it so well."
moviesfilmsreviewsinc,"Aug 21, 2023",10/10,"""The Shining"" by Stanley Kubrick explores the question of who is the reliable observer and whose ideas of events can be trusted. The opening scene at a job interview introduces Jack Torrance, a man who plans to live in solitude with his wife and son at the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns him about a former caretaker who murdered his wife and two daughters, but Jack assures him that this will not happen. His wife, a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict, is likely to be fascinated by the story. Jack, Wendy, and Danny move into a hotel during winter shutdown, where the chef, Dick Hallorann, explains the food storage locker. They are left alone, and Jack works tirelessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny create a routine of everyday life, including breakfast cereal, toys, and TV. The three don't seem to function as a loving family, as they are constantly occupied with their daily routines. The question remains whether people will talk about real tragedies or if Jack will ever tell his wife about it. Danny, a reliable witness, is influenced by Tony, who channels psychic input, including a vision of blood spilling from hotel elevators and two matching girls. However, these visions may not accurately represent the actual events. Wendy, a companion and playmate for Danny, has a matter-of-fact banality similar to Shelley Duvall's ""3 Women."" She tries to cheer Jack up until he abruptly stops interrupting his work. Wendy later discovers the reality of his work, and is reliable at that moment and later when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he becomes violent. The opening shots of Jack wending his way up the Colorado mountains are a sign of what's to come. The eerie Moog interpretation of Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, the mirroring of the landscape against a placid lake, and the breathless whoosh of the camera are all signs of what's to come. With Steadicam mounts, Kubrick experiments with how a constantly roving camera can unmoor an audience. Even in the benign early scenes of Jack heading to the interview or the Torrance clan getting a tour of the hotel, it feels like a game of chicken. As the Torrances settle into The Overlook for the winter and a snowstorm severs their connection to the outside world, the madness that quickly seizes Jack ramps up a whole strategy of disorientation. Kubrick makes a joke out of titles announcing different days of the week, as if time has any meaning in isolation. The geography of The Overlook is impossible to map, with the kitchen, living quarters, Gold Room, upper floors, and Room 237 all distinct spaces that are impossible to connect."
mattlx,"Sep 3, 2023",10/10,"Kubrick totally nails it with the creepy and suffocating vibe in the movie. The Overlook Hotel is like a character in itself, and those twisty hallways add to the mounting tension.Jack Nicholson goes down in history with his bone-chilling performance as Jack Torrance. He goes from normal to nuts in a way that's both horrifying and mesmerizing. He's basically the face of the movie's unsettling vibes.This film is all about messing with your head. It slowly peels back the sanity layers of its characters, keeping you guessing whether what you're seeing is real or just madness playing tricks on you."
jordondave-28085,"Aug 17, 2023",9/10,"(1980) The Shining
PSYCHOLOGICAL HORRORCo-produced co-written and directed by Stanley Kubrick that has Jack(Jack Nicholson) along with his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their son, Danny (Danny Llyod) moving into an expensive abandoned and isolated resort to help him finish his novel, but holding with this resort are some sinister dark secrets turning him into a lunatic! Co-written from Stephen King and adapted from his own novel of the same name, despite not faithful to King's book, the reason is that it showcases psychologically how a normal human being can be driven into madness, incorporated by a past with it's goal is it to destroy anybody who decide to reside there. And by using a lot of brilliant props, such as the maze and the hordes of blood theirs a great a great deal of creativeness that is unlike on any other horror film til this day and of course without Nicholson's performance this movie wouldn't have worked!"
Sfpsycho415,"Feb 28, 2005",8/10,"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10"
tatjanabollen,"Feb 2, 2024",10/10,"The Shining was my favourite horror movie as a kid. Born in 1988 i think i watched this movie more than 10 times. But being a kid i offcourse did not understand the psychological drama behind it in full. I am now watching this after 15+ years again with my 12 year old son, who is obsessed with the horror genre. But is more of the type of horror like Saw. Not even 30 minutes into the movie, with actually nothing really happening, he is scared to death. And even me, who watched this movie so many times, but not for a very long time, have a scary feeling in my stomach. The music is really the best actor in this whole movie. All the time you are wondering what is going to happen next. Even though at the beginning, nothing is really happening. The actors are perfect for their roles. The whole movie you have this uncomfortable feeling, but you can't really place it. The Shining really shows that you dont need a lot of scary stuff and action in a movie to make it scary."
Fella_shibby,"May 18, 2021",9/10,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs, then again in the early 2k on a dvd which I own. Revisited the 144 mins director's cut recently as i am anxious to check out Doctor Sleep n the tv version of The Shining.Everything has already been said about this film n there seems to be little left to say but as a fan of horror movies (especially to do with isolation n eeriness), lemme contribute by praising how good this film is n at the same time why it doesn't deserve a full 10.The film has solid amount of tension n scare factor.The vast isolation, the snow capped peaks, the valleys, the mountains, the narrow, winding roads, the snow covered roads, the eerie corridors, they all add to the film's narration.The start scene wher Jack is driving and the background music, itself gives goosebumps n a sign that something sinister is awaiting.On a technical level this film is gr8, the music, the visuals, the camera angles, etc all add to it except the lead actor Nicholson.Nicholson was already well known for playing unstable characters and his character Jack in this film is shown to be a bit wierd from the beginning.They shud have asked him to potray a normal family loving person in the beginning n later show the gradual transition into madness n possession.Who wud discuss Donner Party in front of a kid?Also the way Jack gives an evilish smile when his kid tells about watching cannibalism on tv.What kinda parent wud approve of that?Also most of the time Jack's behavior is more laughable.Even when he is hit on the head by his wife n he falls down, it is a big lol."
Chromium_5,"Sep 12, 2004",6/10,"This has got to be the most overrated movie in the history of film. I just watched it for the first time, expecting the best of the best, and it was quite a letdown. The sets and music are great, of course, but Kubrick seems to have forgotten one very important thing: to make a horror movie horrifying, you have to have likable characters. That way, when bad things start happening, the audience feels for them.What we have here, however, is a documentary on the most dysfunctional family in the world. Isn't this supposed to be about a loving husband and father who goes insane? Jack Nicholson is brilliant at portraying total insanity, but there's no gradual shift into at all. He looks like he's about to snap from scene one. His wife is a whimpering, nervous wreck who does not seem to trust him at any point throughout the movie. And the kid, Danny, is just a weird little nut. Who can identify with these people?Another major problem is that there is no clear storyline here. The whole first half of the movie is about the kid's psychic abilities, and then it does a total switch and focuses on Jack Nicholson being crazy. What was the point of spending all that time on Danny? It seems like it is foreshadowing something, but it never amounts to anything. I guess Danny is the first one to see ghosts in the house, but that is not a big enough plot point to spend the entire first half of the movie on.Other than some incredibly creepy music and sets, there is nothing really scary in this movie. It is fun to see Jack Nicholson ham it up, of course, but there is no scariness involved when you spend the entire movie waiting listlessly for him to pick up an ax, rather than being shocked when he goes from lovable to psychotic. Instead, he goes from obviously-wanting-to-release-a-ton-of-built-up-aggression to psychotic, which is extremely inferior.6/10 stars, and that is being generous."
alekxandarevlogiev,"Sep 15, 2023",10/10,"The two Gradys
At the beginning of the film, Stuart Ullman tells Jack about a former hotel keeper named Charles Grady, who killed his family with an ax and then killed himself. Later, Jack meets a ghostly butler named Grady. He tells him that he knows about the murders, but he tells him that his name is Delbert Grady. This detail is often associated with the image of Jack himself. How one of his essences is that of a father, a husband, a writer, and the other is actually the man in the 4th of July photo. It is a mistake to think that this shot at the end of the film is proof that the events were predetermined. Jack finds himself in countless situations where how he acts depends only on his choices. However, he makes these choices of his own, driven by fear and weakness, which perhaps leads to the horrific end result. Perhaps even Jack had the opportunity to escape his role as a hotel keeper, not to inherit the terrible fate of his predecessor, but he simply did not make the right choices. This is the tragedy of the whole story. The idea is that Delbert Grady, the 1920 butler, and Charles Grady, the security guard, may or may not be the same person. Perhaps what brought them together was not the supernatural power of the hotel, but their tragic decisions. Here comes the idea that the Jack Torrance of the photo is not the same Jack Torrance of the present, but he is not a completely different person either.The picture
At the end of the film, the camera pans slowly along the wall and stops on a 1921 photograph of Jack Torrance. In his interview, Kubrick said that this was proof that Jack from the present was the reincarnation of another hotel employee who lived much earlier. However, this does not prevent alternative ""readings"" of the film, including one that Jack is ""absorbed"" by the hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney supports this theory by referring to Grade's ghost's words to Jack: ""You're a keeper, sir. You've always been a keeper."" But if Jack's photo from 1921 was there all along how did no one notice it? The effect this question has on the viewer is powerful. Because the inexplicable and unthinkable was before everyone's eyes, and they did not notice it. Right in front of their eyes, yet invisible.The space in ""Overlook Hotel""
The space in ""Overlook Hotel""
Much has already been said about the spatial inconsistencies in The Shining. There are rooms with windows that shouldn't be there. Doors that lead nowhere. Rooms that appear in one place in one scene and another in another scene. Wax figures and furniture appear or disappear in different scenes. Props are moved from one room to another. Because of these details, the overall layout of the hotel loses its physical meaning. Even the ballroom wouldn't have to fit in the space allotted to it. Han Brooks of The Guardian said: ""People say The Shining doesn't make sense. Well noted! The Shining is a ghost movie. It shouldn't make sense.""
Well done to the movie."
elliotjeory,"Sep 13, 2021",6/10,"Watching this after reading the book I can see why Stephen king was annoyed with it.Jack Nicholson looked unhinged from the beginning which means there isn't much difference in his decent into madness.Certain characters from the book are left out, where are the bees? Where are the moving ani mail bushes? The boiler is barely mentioned.The direction is brilliant and I love the blood down the elevator shaft scene."
Chiller7,"Jul 31, 2015",5/10,"Once again, I decided to check out a highly regarded ""cinematic masterpiece"" and was left kinda disappointed. Scariest movie of all time? No, not really. It wasn't even particularly scary.Admittedly, a lot of it was well done. The little girls were the best part. They were great. The steadicam shots through the hallways were pretty cool. There was a good sense of ""What horrors could be lurking around the corner?"" as the camera follows the kid through the halls.But aside from those things, much of the movie didn't work so well. Jack Nicholson was more hilarious than menacing. Was that intentional? His witty dialogue provided many laughs, but watching him slowly stumbling around holding an axe was hardly what I'd call horror.The story was completely nonsensical. What was any of that? There's no explanation for almost everything that happens in the movie! Here's where I'll probably get derided by the movie's fans for not ""getting it,"" but I'm convinced this is really a case where the movie-makers themselves had no clue what it all meant. They just threw all this random imagery at us just to confuse us and convince us that it's actually brilliant (because if we can't comprehend any of it, it must be brilliant, right?) but really it just makes zero sense.I don't get why this is so highly rated."
hanniballe11752,"Jan 19, 2002",N/A,"Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK's Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80's- performs it's duty as a fright flick, and then some.There are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that's completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it's memorable conclusion in the last half hour.Kudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of 'Hollywood talk', which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak 'on the nose', and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as 'Wendy' gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let's face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That's what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast."
cuz,"Aug 4, 1998",10/10,"First of all, I loved the book. It remains my favorite Stephen King novel. Secondly, the TV adaption was well done. Still, I think Kubrick did a great job at creating the atmopshere necessary for a good, scary movie. It's full of incredible visuals, and great tracking shots (especially when we follow Danny riding on his big wheel through the hotel hallways). Sure, Nicholson gives an over-the-top performance but...that's what he does in almost every movie he's in. Have you ever heard of him giving a ""restrained"" performance? Shelley Duvall is okay. Actually, Rebecca DeMornay was a big improvement in the TV movie. I know King fans who absolutely hate this movie. They say Kubrick changed too many plot points and ruined the whole thing. I say there's more than one way to tell a good story. King did it very well, and so did Kubrick...just in a different way. I'd rank The Shining up there with the best horror films of all time, along side ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", ""Psycho"", and ""The Exorcist"", among others. It actually reminds me of another superb haunted house movie: ""The Haunting"", from the early '60s. Both movies create that sense of isolation; the fear of turning the next corner or opening the door everyone is afraid to open. It's also the best King adaption, although ""Stand By Me"", ""Misery"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" are close behind. If you haven't seen it, rent it. If you're one of those angry King fans, give it a second chance. It's worth it."
ttrebonto,"Mar 23, 2022",9/10,"The first time I watched this film, four years ago, when I was like 11, felt very boring. But recently I watched it and watched explanation videos about it and now feel like it is definitely one of the greatest horror films of all time, thinking of the effort it took to make this film back in 1980. Definitely gonna check out some more from Kubrick."
richardchatten,"Oct 20, 2023",9/10,"Stephen King was so horrified at what Stanley Kubrick did to his 1977 novel he felt it necessary to later write his own alternative version for TV. Dismissed at the time as an anticlimax the pendulum of history quickly swung in the opposite direction, where it remains today.Seldom commented upon is the obvious influence on Kubrick of 'Last Year in Marienbad' - already apparent in '2001' - with its endless tracks through an enormous soulless hotel in the middle of nowhere to the accompaniment of a glacial music score, within which Kubrick stages at least two moments worthy of his name for which the film has been carefully preparing us for over an hour: the discovery by Shelly Duvall exactly what her husband (played by Jack Nicholson as if he's auditioning for the role of Richard III) has been labouring on since his arrival and that she and her son are trapped in the middle of nowhere completely at the mercy of a maniac, and the final track into the photograph of Nicholson among the revellers on July 4th 1921 which is quite an ending but - like so much else in the film - to which there is probably far less than meets the eye."
akdjreview,"Dec 28, 2021",9/10,"Horror films are not my cup of tea. But The Shining has gotten me to reconsider this preference. With an incredible performance by Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, I might even say it is one of the best I've ever seen. Meanwhile, considering this movie is a horror film, it always keeps you on your toes. While also being a compact story and with few actors making the film more intriguing and heart wrenching.The Shining is a disturbing film from the 80s. It's not so much scary for the audience, but there's always a creepy feeling luring over you. With Jack Nicholson in the lead role, performing one of the best roles I've seen. Playing a so convincing role It's almost frightening. With so many memorable scenes it's impressive how well the actors performed.Meanwhile, the storyline during the entire film is disturbing and alluring, it also manages to be beautiful. Director Stanley Kubrick managed to create a masterpiece. With beautiful angels, use of lightning and scenes. I can tell you that there is no error in the creation of this masterpiece.I highly recommend you watch The Shining. Truly one of the best horror films ever made. And if you don't like horror movies or fear them The Shining is not so frightening."
benjaminburt,"Sep 16, 2017",9/10,"The Shining is a masterclass in film-making and a staple of popular culture. I, personally, cannot stand horror films. I don't like to feel scared, and I don't like to have my emotions manipulated by scary monsters, scary music, scary lighting, etc. I feel like horror is an easy genre - it's easy to scare some people, and people go to movies hoping to feel something, so why not fear?But, I had heard a lot about The Shining. I decided I would look up the plot and watch some clips so I wouldn't be caught off-guard by anything, and I could just appreciate the characters, directing, cinematography, etc.Despite knowing everything that would happen, the film was unbelievably engaging. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Jack Nicholson, of course, steals the show with one of the most iconic performances ever, and the other actors were decent, but the real star was Kubrick himself. Every shot, every set, the sound design, and everything has his fingerprints all over it, and it is such a delight to watch. When Jack advances up the stairs demanding the bat from Shelley Duval, I grinned from ear to ear because everything in that moment was just perfect in film.The movie, like all others, has problems. In my opinion, the Grady girls and the bloody elevator do not hold up. I knew they were coming from the summaries I had read, so I knew what to expect, so the only reason I could see them as being scary or unsettling is if the viewer was caught off-guard. If you're pretty feminist, you're not going to like Shelley Duval's character, as she is a pretty weak character.All in all, this film is fantastically-made, a cinematic and acting delight, and a gripping horror film that is considered a classic for a reason."
sugarloafersince92,"Dec 17, 2023",10/10,"At this point, this movie is a classic. A masterpiece of ""subtle"" horror.Sure, it's not as gory or ""shocking"" as many modern day horror movies, but it's an effective movie. The haunting music, looming visuals, and overall ambiance combine to make a truly great movie.On a personal note, this is my father's favorite movie. As a child, I remember him watching it in a dark room several times, and every time I entered the movie would go on pause. If you think the movie isn't scary, watch it while home alone, at night time, preferably out in the country away from every living soul you know.I'm a huge Stephen King fan (have read 90% of his novels), and understand his dislike for the movie. Taken as a stand alone movie, or even just ignoring the differences between the movie and the book, it's a great one.PLOT: 10/10, VISUALS: 10/10, AUDIO: 10/10, ACTING: 9/10, OVERALL: 10/10."
minastrate,"Apr 2, 2021",6/10,"It's just okay. Like, nice to watch but, kinda' boring until the last third of the film; by which point it becomes pretty epic! But the whole ""build up"" thing just falls flat on me; just seems kind of unnecessary. And unfortunately I wouldn't consider the entire film worth it after a single watch. But, hey, that's just my two cents."
Oeuvre_Klika,"May 3, 2019",4/10,"I had heard so much about how brilliant this movie was. I finally watched it and I hated it.I give it 4 stars and not 1 because I thought it was filmed beautifully and the three leads gave great performances.But now here's what I didn't like.My main criticism is that this movie does not make sense. The story is incoherent and incomprehensible. There are visuals that look like symbolism, but are not related to anything. It looks like a movie that was supposed to be twice as long and was heavily cut, losing its meaning in the process. Maybe that's what happened?Another thing that annoyed me, especially in the first part of the movie, is the editing. Why so many dissolves? It was seriously making me dizzy. Also, the editing of all the dialogue scenes at the beginning, which are already very slow, got on my nerves. This unchanging alternance of reverse shots was making me crazy. In fact, I even wondered if all of this was a conscious choice to unsettle the viewer. But I was mainly annoyed.Last, but not least, this movie isn't scary! Why did I wait all these years to watch it, for fear of being traumatized? Sure there were very good jump scares. But making me jump is not the same as scaring me. Some of the ""scary"" visuals, as I already complained earlier, were so unrelated to anything that they made me laugh rather than scaring me. And I didn't feel any tension because nothing in the story made sense to me. It was all disjointed and weird."
bob the moo,"Oct 29, 2001",N/A,"When Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is offered a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel he accepts it as an opportunity to work on his novel in an isolated environment. He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn't deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It's only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.This is one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles, his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she's genuinely filled with fear - but doesn't have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy, although he doesn't have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack's show.The story doesn't stick to King's novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick's Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.Kubrick is excellent here, his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It's one of the best examples of his masterful touch.Overall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director."

TheRushmoreAcademy,"Nov 16, 2007",10/10,"When i first went to watch The Shining I was expecting a decent film from what I had heard about it and I liked a lot of Stanley Kubrick's other work but when I started to watch it it was so much better than I thought it would be.At times I seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and I couldn't take my eyes of the screen still there's something very disturbing about everything in the film. Now some people don't like Kubrick's version of The Shining since it doesn't entirely follow Stephen King's book but in my opinion both Kubrick's version,the mini-series and the book are all great.Jack Nicholson gives an awesome performance.If you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch The Shining."
cirlancatalin,"Jan 22, 2007",10/10,"Besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is: 1)Stanley Kubrick 2)God Allmighty 3)the rest... this movie actually is better than the book (and the TV miniseries though this is an easy feat, considering the director). The flawless filming stile, the acting and (Kubrick's all time number one skill) the music - make it THE masterpiece of horror. I watched the TV miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and I had my hopes about this when I got a hold of it. IT BLEW ME AWAY!!! It is far better than I ever imagined it. It starts slow (Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense. The intro scene is a classic by all means and I watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film. Also the film doesn't offer a lot of gore (it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless) a trend that I hate in recent day horror films. Just watch it!"
markmurphy561,"May 5, 2019",7/10,"I'll only really understand praise for this movie of and in its time. I'm not some huge horror fan but I do appreciate a good horror movie. This just wasn't that scary. I'm sure it probably did much for the horror genre but I feel it's been surpassed by some of Kubricks horror-oriented protégés, Jordan Peele for example.Beautifully shot with very eerie, weird and effective imagery and atmosphere and great performances all around. I thought some of the quieter scenes were some of the more effective. The scene with Jack and the apparent ghost of the previous hotel keeper in the bathroom was particularly well constructed, with the reveal of what's going on coming slowly but surely. But that's where the hype ends for me.It's definitely not a bad movie. I just get the impression that there are more people hopelessly nostalgic over it, than sincerely believe it holds up today. Nostalgia from older generations has a tendency to influence younger generations (""Maaan, I wish I grew up in the 80's!"")"
facebookonly-98144,"Aug 18, 2023",10/10,"...about work/life balance and mindfulness.In a world of ever increasing responsibilities, The Shining reminds us to take time for ourselves and our families, while reinforcing the restorative power of time in nature. The beautiful winter landscapes easily makes this movie a holiday classic. Gather up your loved ones and ready the hot chocolate as the heartwarming tale of a little boy and his father reminds us of the special bond between parent and child, without neglecting the significance of the mother and son bond. The subplot of the whimsical life of a creative writer is effectively weaved throughout. So sit back and hashtag be blessed with the Torrance family."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 30, 2023",6/10,"Jack Nicholson gives the best tongue-in-cheek satire performance of his career, as he resurrects his early day role in Little Shop of Horrors, another fine horror satire. His co-star, Olive Oyl, I mean Shelley Duvall, is very good as the clueless wife. The real star of this film, however, is the director and his camera work; very few, if any, directors, could match Stanley Kubrick as a body of work. His camera angles and creation of atmosphere are second to none, in this tale about a man who takes a job he can't handle.Although the plot is mundane, Kubrick raises it out of the ordinary kaka of the horror genre, to a genuinely spooky film. However, despite everyone's fine efforts to make this a classic; it falls short. Not that there is anything wrong with that (apologies to Seinfeld)."
thelazer4000,"Mar 31, 2008",5/10,"Don't get me wrong, the originality of the story is great, mainly because it was done before all of those abandoned but ""haunted"" hotels, motels, houses, whatever kind of building scenario. But I thought the movie moved at a time dragging pace, the whole shot of Danny Torrence rolling around on his tricycle left me wondering...""What was the director thinking?"" A lot of the things that happened in the movie made no sense to me really. The book I thought was much more clear and less abstract on the transformation of Jack Torrence. I also thought the betrayal of Jack Torrence's character was wrong. We essentially knew nothing about him or his family, other than Danny was having bad dreams, then it starts with the Torrence's taking over of the hotel for the winter and Jack has lost his mind.I loved how it was done in the book, you got a good feel for who Jack was and where he had come from and you felt good about him. When they go to the hotel the symptoms Jack experienced where eye widening. He was chewing on the aspirin, losing his temper and getting major headaches, all conclusive to when he was drinking, but he wasn't. I thought the movie missed a little on that. The movie by itself however seemed to want to breath a life of it's own rather than paying homage to the novel it came from. I guess when it came down to it, I really had no care for the wife and child. Danny walking around saying redrum was really one of the most annoying things I have ever had to watch. But because the film was so slow to progress that when the climax finally showed up it failed to make up for lost time and attention.All in all, an O.K. movie, but I really don't see what the hype was all about in the this other than the famous ""Here's JOHNNY!"" line. Watch it if you wish, obviously it has a 8.5 on IMDb for a reason..."
chaos-rampant,"Nov 24, 2008",N/A,"Sometimes all good horror needs is a good idea. But sometimes, rarely indeed, a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a Kubrick, with the adept, elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision, and we know what separates it from all else.Okay, the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. Heck, even Stephen King himself didn't fare so bad. It's how Kubrick perceives King's universe however, how he fills the frame with it, that renders THE SHINING a feast for the senses.Horror that will reach us through the mind and body alike, an assault as it were, tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo, yet curiously not without a delicate lull.Kubrick's cinema is, as usually, a sight to behold. We get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. The geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of Japanese directors of some 10 years before. In that what is depicted in the frame, the elements of narrative, is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.Certain images stand out in this. The first shot of Jack's typewriter, ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball, drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself, an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in a poetry of slow motions. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid's face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the epochal bathroom scene.Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever made. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress. A delicate, detached thing thrown in with the mad."
auuwws,"Oct 15, 2020",9/10,"The film contains many strange scenes, especially at the end"
mjg32,"Mar 19, 2007",10/10,"Horror films are associated with extreme and sickening violence/gore, lunatic killers and mostly focus on teenagers. They are mostly just poor excuses to put extreme violence on film to appeal to younger people, and nearly all, with a few exceptions such as Saw, are totally crap. Violence doesn't make a film good. In making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick has shown the world how horror films should be made.There are none of the predictable bad-guy-jumps-out-of-the-dark scenes to try and scare you. Instead Kubrick builds up suspense with the chilling musical score, and Jack Torrance gradually gets driven insane. Jack Nicholson is perfect to portray the character of Torrance. Not only is he a brilliant actor anyway, but he looks perfect for the part. He isn't your stereotyped perfect-looks actor, I don't think someone like Brad Pitt would be as effective playing his part. Pitt is a great actor, but you can't imagine someone like him going insane in a weird hotel! I think the cast is important to this film. Kubrick cast a proper leading actor and actress, rather than the randomly assembled casts of young 20 year olds you get in most horror films. And hey! The result is way better.There are a perfect amount of genuine horror scenes, such as the famous axe scene, and the scene in the maze, and it never goes over the top. There is also some unique horror scenes, such as when Jack writes about 1,000 pages of the same words, and the visions of the blood from the elevator and the little girls. They are bizarre but very effective in building suspense.The storyline is also much more effective than the usual story of teenagers being pursued by a lunatic murderer. A man stuck in a hotel for the winter with just his family who gradually goes insane is much more original and much much much more effective. Horror films are meant to be scary, and this really is. There are many scenes showing Jack's willingness to give in to temptation, and how he wants to get away from his wife and weird son. The camera-work is also excellent, as it builds up tension by moving along the corridors, and it also emphasises that Jack is feeling confined in the hotel.Stephen King didn't like Kubrick's interpretation of his novel, I can't believe how. Kubrick just made it better! This is a top film and is a landmark for horror films."
andreidreglea,"Dec 15, 2023",10/10,"As a die hard fan of horror movies I gave this movie a chance in 2023 when I was a bit bothered by always having to skip the iconic cover the movie when searching for a new horror movie to watch. I just decided to watch so that I don't have think about it again. Such an AMAZING acting from Nicholson, hands down one of the best acting I've ever ever seen in any movie of any genre. Even though the script could be described as simple and unimpressing, I think this movie stands as the fundament for many movies and many actors that want a masterclass in how to scare people with your good acting. I do believe the lady could've broken the glass of the bathroom, but overall i grew to love the cast choice. 10/10 from me. Thank you."
kareemamgad,"Aug 11, 2025",9/10,"The Shining is an atmospheric and unsettling journey into isolation, madness, and the unknown, masterfully crafted by Stanley Kubrick. From the moment the opening shots sweep across the mountains, there's an ever-growing sense of unease that never lets go. Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail and deliberate pacing create an oppressive tension, making every corridor and shadow in the Overlook Hotel feel alive with menace.Jack Nicholson delivers one of the most iconic performances in film history, portraying Jack Torrance's descent into madness with terrifying unpredictability. His intensity is balanced perfectly by Shelley Duvall's vulnerable yet determined portrayal of Wendy, whose fear feels raw and painfully real. The young Danny Lloyd, as Danny, brings a haunting innocence, making his encounters with the supernatural all the more disturbing.The cinematography is breathtaking, with the Steadicam work pulling the audience deep into the hotel's labyrinthine halls, while the unnerving score amplifies the constant feeling of dread. The film thrives on ambiguity, blurring the line between supernatural horror and psychological breakdown, leaving viewers unsettled long after the credits roll.This is more than just a horror film - it's an experience in sustained tension and visual storytelling. Few movies manage to be as disturbing, beautiful, and unforgettable as The Shining."
cricketbat,"Oct 20, 2023",7/10,"There is no denying the impact that The Shining made when it was released. It's on almost every list of all-time greatest horror films and has been endlessly parodied and referenced in other works. However, I've never been a huge fan of it. I think this movie is well-made, and it definitely has iconic moments of terror & suspense, but some of the surrealist scares just don't work for me. And there were scenes that pulled me out of the story because of the way they were shot. It almost felt as if Stanley Kubrick were demanding people pay attention to him. I just think The Shining is a little... overrated."
BrodyMoazzeni,"Aug 5, 2025",10/10,"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity."
krumski,"Dec 1, 2000",7/10,"It's certainly not a new complaint in relation to this film, but I must register it anyway: Jack Nicholson's acting here is all wrong for the material. Instead of a slow buildup from banality to insanity - which, given the movie's otherwise brilliant creepiness of tone and style - could have been truly horrific to watch, we get Jack Torrance as the nutjob Big Bad Wolf right from the very beginning. It's weird: it's as if Kubrick is indeed making the ultimate horror film, and Nicholson is sabotaging it every step of the way by enacting the ultimate horror film *parody*. Each on its own terms is immensely enjoyable, but they effectively cancel each other out. I've never seen the styles of director and star diverge so emphatically (A minor comparison would be the first ""Fletch"" movie, where Michael Ritchie's taut direction is appropriate to a gritty crime thriller, but where star Chevy Chase waltzes through the vehicle glibly throwing darts into every dramatic setup).However, there's no point in blaming Nicholson for the mess - this was clearly the way Kubrick wanted the part to be played. Perfectionist and control freak that he was, you don't believe for a minute that any inch of a Kubrick film isn't exactly how he wanted it; he certainly wouldn't allow a mere *actor* to steamroll his well-laid plans, not even one as forceful and magnetic as Jack Nicholson. Still, this movie - together with Batman, and even One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - soured me on Jack for a long time; I found in him an actor far too willing to coast on his personality and to ham it up mercilessly, rather than bother to actually create a recognizable human being. Such a technique is fine, even commendable, for farceurs like Jim Carrey or Paul Reubens (either one of which would probably have been just as effective as Nicholson is here at being Jack Torrance) but we should expect more from our so-called Dramatic Actors. It wasn't until I saw some of his more restrained, nuanced work in such films as Ironweed, Wolf, The King of Marvin's Gardens, and even (amazingly) Easy Rider that I realized what a truly fine performer Nicholson can be when he is forced to, as it were, paint in between the lines (by the way, no complaints from me about his Oscar for As Good As It Gets - he's the only actor alive who could have made that part work the way it did). It's just too bad Kubrick didn't decide to use him this way; watching Jack Torrance go from a diffident, restrained man (watch the first part of Wolf to see how surprisingly well Nicholson can play such a character) to a rampaging lunatic would have been truly frightening (even with the extra bit of campiness Nicholson throws in - ""Heeere's Johnny!"", etc). It would have been as if the Overlook Hotel unleashed some primordial demon from the depths of an essentially decent man. The way it plays now, Jack's evil and insanity are loudly telegraphed from the very beginning (those dancing eyebrows of his NEVER stop!) - all that's left is to go through the motions.Of course, there are some pretty startling motions to go through in this movie; Kubrick's technical brilliance and his ability to create an engrossing mise en scene ensure that the film can never be seen as a total failure. In fact, when Nicholson is offscreen, the goosebump factor here is actually pretty high. The long tracking shots of Danny riding his Big Wheel through the winding hotel corridors are justly famous, as is the very design of the Overlook's wide open - yet paradoxically oppressive - map room (where Jack does his ""writing""): these sequences effectively make the Overlook into a character itself. The isolation of it, its stillness and quiet, and most importantly its labyrinthian hugeness serve to overwhelm the tiny family and break down whatever bond they may have (which, again, would have been so much more effective if we felt this family was ever bonded in the first place). Kubrick ingeniously avoids shock devices, for the most part, and creates his spooky atmosphere through an almost inhuman stillness and quiet - which effectively creates an undertow of dread and expectation in the viewer. Quite simply, there are images and flash-cuts in this movie that will get under your skin and that you will never be able to shake - they will haunt your subconscience forever (deliciously). None more so than the truly classic moment where Wendy, the wife, finally discovers what it is Jack has been ""writing"" all this time: I can think of few movie moments in history that are so gut-bustingly hilarious and at one and the same time so bone-chillingly frightening and perverse. For this one moment alone, the film demands a viewing.It's simply too bad that Kubrick felt the need to invade the sanctity of his gothic cathedral like setting with the over the top rantings and ravings of the town lunatic. Not that that lunatic is not one devil of a fun guy to hiss and laugh at, it's just that he belongs in a different movie - the Evil Dead flicks, maybe, or one of Freddy Krueger's opuses. This conflict in styles between star and director ultimately make The Shining, for me at least, a frustrating experience: I keep wishing one of them would just get out of the other's way. The Shining could have been one of the hammiest and most enjoyable grand guignol horror experiences ever, or it could have been perhaps the most finely crafted and subtly shaded psychological thriller of all time. Alas, it cannot be both - and in trying to do so, it effectively undermines itself at every turn."
Jimm7y,"Feb 18, 1999",N/A,"What can I say about the scariest movie I have ever seen that has not already been said by others more articulate than yours truly?  Do not view this film expecting to see a screen version of the Stephen King novel. Rather, this is a Stanley Kubrick film, and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick's entire body of work as a serious filmmaker.  Thematically, THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film's overall technique.In a nutshell (no pun intended), Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall co-star with Oregon's Timberline Lodge - enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel - in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity, but deals with issues of child abuse, immortality and duality.What the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique.  Garrett Brown (the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials), inventor of the Steadicam, chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze, providing magic-carpet-ride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish.  If the film starts off too slow, remember who the director is.  This man likes to take his time, and the results are well worth it: incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel; horrific Diane Arbus-inspired twins staring directly at us; portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets; elevators that gush rivers of blood in slow-motion; Jack Torrance's immortality found via the hotel (akin to David Bowman's journey through the Space Gate); and some of the best use of pre-existing music ever assembled for a motion picture.It would take a book to examine and defend the film's strong points and drawbacks.  If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off, with no interruptions, and make sure that it's raining.  This is a cinematic experience that changed my life at the age of 14.  Makes a great double feature with Robert Wise's 1963 thriller THE HAUNTING."
jellemeijer,"Jan 10, 2025",10/10,"The Shining is a masterful blend of psychological tension, atmospheric dread, and cinematic brilliance. Widely regarded as one of the best horror films of all time, it transcends its genre, delivering an experience that lingers long after the credits roll.Story: The story of The Shining is a haunting exploration of isolation, family dynamics, and the fragility of the human psyche. It unfolds with a deliberate pace, allowing the tension to build organically. Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel is a testament to his ability to craft a narrative that is both deeply unsettling and profoundly compelling. The plot's simplicity masks its depth, inviting viewers to unravel its many layers.Concept: At its core, The Shining is a study of human nature under extreme circumstances, elevated by Kubrick's meticulous direction. The film thrives on its unique approach to horror, relying less on jump scares and more on atmosphere, symbolism, and the unsettling power of suggestion. The setting itself becomes a character, amplifying the sense of dread and unease.Characters: The characters in The Shining are unforgettable, brought to life through mesmerizing performances. Each character is meticulously developed, with their actions and motivations contributing to the film's gripping intensity. The protagonist's descent into madness is portrayed with chilling authenticity, while the supporting characters add depth and emotional weight to the story.Final Thoughts
The Shining is a cinematic masterpiece that goes beyond traditional horror to deliver an experience that is as thought-provoking as it is terrifying. Its story, concept, and characters come together in a way that few films can achieve, making it an enduring classic that remains as powerful today as it was upon its release. Whether you're a fan of horror or simply appreciate exceptional filmmaking, The Shining is an absolute must-watch."
Movie1954Buff,"Nov 16, 2025",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a masterpiece of slow-burn horror, a film that seeps under the skin rather than simply startling. Jack Nicholson's mesmerising descent into madness, Shelley Duvall's raw vulnerability, and Danny Lloyd's uncanny poise give the story its emotional force. The Overlook Hotel becomes a living presence: vast, watchful, and quietly malevolent. Kubrick's precise camerawork, unsettling soundscape, and refusal to over-explain create a dreamlike sense of dread that lingers long after the credits. Beautiful, terrifying, and endlessly rewatchable, The Shining stands as one of cinema's most haunting and enduring achievements."
fredrikgunerius,"Oct 28, 2025",8/10,"The thing about Kubrick, judging from most accounts, is that it was almost as unbearable to be on the set of his films as it is watching the horror he creates. This was probably never more true than with The Shining - a film that has set its own standard in horror and remains the source of numerous interpretations nearly thirty years after its release. Being the one and only Stephen King/Stanley Kubrick collaboration, the story seems to have brought out something very distinct in both, without the end product necessarily feeling as complete or fulfilled as it could have been. Kubrick and King reportedly disagreed on quite a few things regarding the adaptation. Not surprisingly, it was Kubrick who got his way and made the film as he wanted it.One of the things Kubrick insisted on was casting Jack Nicholson in the lead. The effect was predictable but absolutely harrowing, as Nicholson delves into his character with frightening conviction. It's as if Jack Torrance is the real Jack Nicholson, and the actor had just been waiting for the chance to exhibit his demons. This does, of course, take away some of the surprise effect in the character that King had intended, since Nicholson seems ready to snap from the very beginning, but on the other hand it generates even more questions about that famous final shot. Was something in him yearning to go back?What makes The Shining a horror classic are its bold and enormous sets and scenes. They are unworldly and completely uncontrollable - for both the characters and the viewer. This is pure Kubrick: he overwhelms us and makes us completely defenceless against the vastness and endlessness of the Overlook Hotel and the powers it holds. The delicate and stylish way he portrays it makes the film a poetic work of art - in everything from Danny's tricycling through the corridors to the scenes in the vibrant Gold Room and the eerie segments in the incredible maze.All great horror films has something inconclusive at the core of its story - this is what makes them scary. Because the scariest things are what we can feel but not quite define. This is not the same as making something unexplainable or random, as many recent horror films have succumbed to. The Shining maintains a delicate balance between the story's psychological aspects and supernatural suggestions, and it is disturbingly real and unreal at the same time. For this reason, it remains one of the eeriest films of all time.*Review written in 2008."
AncientDaniel,"Mar 10, 2025",10/10,"You all know it, and I'm afraid you don't need me to reaffirm this frankly universal agreement. The Shining, direct by Stanley Kubrick, is a no-brainer among the best horror films. Simple. Frankly, this is such a common agreement that I'm afraid I don't have any new information to present. Overall, the film is such a cinematic mosaic of perfection that I am at a loss on where to even begin.Such undeniably perfect cinematography for such a wacky, novel, well paced, spooky plot is nothing short of fantastic, easily entitling it to the honor of being among the world's best films in general. Obviously, horror may not be for everybody, but it feels insufficient to just call it a ""must-watch for any fan of the horror scene"". No matter your niche, this is beyond a must-watch."
Gazzaman,"Oct 23, 2020",10/10,"One of the greatest horror movies ever made. Stephen King master of horror, his book interpreted into film by one of the most outstanding film directors of our time Stanley Kubrick what is there not to like. Add to that the great acting skills of one of the Hollywood greats Jack Nicholson and the hugely talented Shelly Duvall along with child actor Danny Lloyd and you have a movie that is legendary that has become a benchmark and reference for countless other horror films. Enjoy again and again, it's priceless. ""Come and play with us Danny"" and ""Here's Johnny"" awesome."
Aaron1375,"Oct 7, 2002",6/10,"I liked this movie, but how it is ranked so high is beyond me.  There are some pretty scary images in the movie, but on the whole it is not that scary.  In fact, for the most part it is just watching people putter around a hotel by themselves and one of them goes insane.  The boys powers are for the most part ignored, and it is a major part of the book.  Though I myself would have loved to have driven around on a big wheel through a hotel at that age it doesn't really belong in this movie either, what the kid can't be walking and discover stuff?  Jack though does a great job as the father, though he seems a bit to insane at the beginning so him going crazy is definately not a surprise.  All in all a few scary scenes here and there, but this one to me is just an ok movie, not the scariest movie by any stretch of the imagination."
RM851222,"Oct 29, 2024",9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Shining"" (1980) is a movie made by a legendary and arguably the best director of all time - Stanley Kubrick. Based on a novel written by Stephen King its a chilling story about a family that stays for a long period of time in an isolated place. And lets just say this place is a not a one who wants to stay for a long time in isolation.This is a brilliant film that is mysterious, and just like many Kubrick's films its not a plain and simple as it looks. Performances by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall are exceptional - they sell the movie and situation. Music is haunting, chilling and really sets the mood. All production values are great and set design makes the hotel a character himself.Overall, ""The Shining"" is a great horror movie that is chilling, mysterious, amazingly acted and directed. This is a film i can rewatch nearly every Halloween season and watching it now for the first time on 4K UHD disk - this film really comes alive like never before. A highly recommended."
kingsid911,"Dec 16, 2020",7/10,A good psychological horror. I expected more scenes of the type they had.
simpsons9588,"Apr 15, 2019",3/10,"I'm firmly under the impression that people judge films purely on single scenes and iconic imagery rather than actual depth and storytelling. Case and point: this film.
The imagery is breathtaking. So many iconic scenes and images that leave a lasting impression on your mind. And this is what people remember.
But then, you start to think about the actual story. Jack Torrence's slow decent into madness was neither slow, surprising or influenced by his environment. And that's what really kills this movie. I can honestly say, if the Overlook was not haunted, this movie, as presented, would have had the exact same ending. It is really a look into an imbittered drunk who goes mad from cabin fever. Everything that goes on around him is irrelevant. Is that the point? If so, it is truely a wasted opportunity as now any adaptation that is made in the future will be judged against this and be panned for telling an actual story. There is a reason Stephen King hates this movie, because it has no soul."
Gymnopedies,"Oct 16, 2024",8/10,"""The Shining"" is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel and is considered one of the very best horror films of all time, in 2018 it was selected for preservation into the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being considered ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". It has changed the horror genre in many ways. It introduced more horror of a psychological nature, focusing on internal struggles and anxieties of the characters instead of relying mainly on jump-scares.The plot revolves around a family who head to an isolated hotel for the winter and encounter a sinister presence that influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into destructive violence. The psychic son begins to see horrifying foreboding events from both the past and the future. The film would differ from the novel regarding the characterization and motivation of the characters. Stephen King was a famous critic of Stanley Kubrick's adaptation. He would go so far as categorizing it as ""a maddening, perverse, and disappointing film."" Stanley Kubrick mastery brought a terrific innovative cinematography, extensive set design, brooding atmosphere, and great storytelling regarding the characters. There are many memorable and unforgettable scenes in this influential piece of horror film history. The ""Come and play with us, Danny. Forever, and ever, and ever"" scene literally sent shivers down my spine as a young kid. The elevator doors open and let out a wave of blood is something extraordinary. The ""Heeere's Johnny!"" scene is of course iconic, and perhaps the most iconic in the annals of horror cinema.It's impact on horror cinema is indisputable, so much that it has been the subject of many myths and legends. The Room 237 (2012) documentary would explore the various interpretations of the film. ""The Shining"" is a perfect film to watch on those cold wintery nights coming in!"
KatarinaVlasic,"Feb 25, 2025",10/10,"Definitely one of my favorites! Still so intense creepy feeling. Love how Kubrick is dedicated to the details. Perfectly cast movie too! And I love the sets in the movie. This is without the doubt the masterpiece, and one of the rare movies that I can watch all over again. Whenever someone asked me to recommend good horror movie to watch surely The Shining pops up the first! You may expect blood, gore, jump scares, but no, this is ghoulish thriller that will make you think a lot... The haunted house theme always brings me chills, but not like this haunted hotel for sure! So tensive atmosphere all along the movie, love it!"
stradivarius001,"Nov 2, 2024",7/10,"I know The Shining has a special place in the hearts of many cinema lovers, and I understand why-there are so many excellent elements in this film.While I don't think Kubrick delivers his best movie here, he certainly does a commendable job. Actors like Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall give outstanding performances-in fact, the entire cast is impressive.However, I think the film's biggest weakness is its pacing over the two-hour runtime, especially for those who have read the book. For example, the character of Dick Hallorann feels underutilized; he's so minimized in the movie that removing him wouldn't affect the plot much, which is unfortunate. In the novel, he's crucial, particularly for Danny's development.Is it scary? Personally, I don't find it frightening, but the film does have many captivating scenes. They don't exactly scare you, but they do hold your attention with Kubrick's mesmerizing style. That bathroom scene with Jack, for example-when I was younger, it genuinely scared me. I suppose I've become desensitized after watching so many horror films, so that's possible too.Despite some drawbacks, I still think The Shining is worth watching, even though, after reading the book, the movie can feel a bit slow for several reasons.Oh, and a shout-out to the characters' wardrobe-it's got great style, lol."
yasinhussain-14721,"Dec 26, 2023",10/10,"And that's primarily thanks to the staggering acting of Jack Nicholson, who put in one of the top 10 best lead performances I've ever laid my eyes upon. It's literally the Jack Nicholson show for 2h 26m, and we're all just lucky to be witnessing it. Also, Stanley Kubrick's direction is unbelievably extraordinary. However it's such a pity to hear about his subhuman treatment of Shelley Duvall during filming. It doesn't dock my rating, but it is rather disappointing.Back to positives though, I was thoroughly impressed by Danny Lloyd's performance as Danny Torrance (the child), especially considering he didnt even know he was acting in a horror movie (as the crew had led him to believe they were shooting a drama film instead)! As for Shelley Duvall, I would say that her character wasn't written all that amazingly for this screenplay (which is actually part of the reason why Stephen King doesn't like this picture), but with saying that, I do think she managed to do the best she could, considering both this and the harsh treatment she suffered on set.Finally, despite the fact that this truly is the best horror flick I've watched, I found the ending quite bemusing, so much so that I honestly had to watch an 'Ending Explained' video just to get a grasp on it. Also, I found the climax just before it a little underwhelming, but in saying that, it did make sense to me once I'd understood the meaning behind the final shot. I guess what I'm trying to say is that Kubrick's execution of the closing 5 or 10 minutes was fairly flawed in my opinion.Overall, I was left speechless by this picture. It really is astonishing, and it's understandably a cult classic. 100% a must-watch before you die. 100%."
shakercoola,"Nov 5, 2019",7/10,"An American psychological horror; A story about an aspiring writer who takes a caretaking job at a remote mountain hotel in the off-season, but his sanity is destroyed by visions which put his family in danger. This gothic film has a very effective setting for a sense of foreboding and intrigue, and it is brilliantly photographed with many scenes that can be savoured for their stylish composition. Stanley Kubrick's flawless technical direction calls attention to itself by its slow pacing which results in a Distancing Effect which does not serve the horror genre well; the viewer needs to be totally immersed. The psychological tension is slowly brought to a tautness, but Jack Nicholson's manic and jumpy side is revealed too early for any mystery to take hold. Kubrick aims for a metaphysical statement about evil and primal fear rather than give his audience characters to relate to, which is interesting, but his meaning, and the explanation for the psychological strain of a man's long months of isolation, is left to viewer interpretation with few clues."
ilija-malinovic,"Jun 17, 2020",3/10,"Well, this just didn't work. Like Stephen King once said, it's all beautiful on the outside, but it has no essence (I am paraphrasing).First of all, the cast. No disrespect to anyone, but no one sold their character to me. I've only seen Jack Nicholson in other movies, and he is usually a terrific actor. But his portrayal here, I'm afraid to say, sucked. Duvall actually did a better job here, in my opinion, but her character also needed work.Next, the script. Awful. They took the premise of the book and placed it in their vision of a scary hotel. They didn't even try to make sense of it, they just scrambled a bunch of scenes from the book with a couple of scary scenes, that heavily rely on Kubrick's director skills, and we are left with this mess.This is actually the first Kubrick movie I've seen. And, he is a good director. Cinematography and soundtrack are really exceptional and iconic. But, he lacks talent to make a good story (and believable characters) and connect it with visual masterpiece he envisioned.I'm rating it 3/10 for the cinematography and soundtrack, that really deliver the horror. But, everything else in this movie is simply bad and needed a lot of work. If it was made by someone who is aware of their strengths (visuals) and weaknesses (story and characters), this would probably be one of my favourite films. This way, I'm left with a few beautiful images and disappointment for the potential they wasted."
afmartin-11556,"Aug 25, 2025",10/10,"Genuinely scary because it's something that could easily happen and does happen in terms of domestic and mental abuse, and the fact it's easily the greatest psychological horror film ever made. The cinematography is top notch, the music is eerie, the steadicam usage is powerful, Nicholson gives one of the best performances of his career, and the clever use of symbolism, makes this movie an all time gem."
CruelZV,"Jul 16, 2024",9/10,"Now ive seen the shining multiple times and i love it even more after watching it. The shining has the Best Aesthetic in the movie, ut has such a deep meaning into it and i love both the movie and the book. Yes the book and movie are different but they both do a good job at what they do. I LOVE EVERY CHARACTER. The acting is amazing RIP Shelly. And its just an amazing time watching with its awesome actors, this movie is very wicked at times which is what i truely love about it because of how cool it is. The locations used in the overlook hotel are good, its such a great story with great characters, great acting, decent kills."
DarkZangetsu,"Oct 8, 2025",9/10,"The Shining is the blueprint on how to do psychological horror. This film uses every scene to immerse you into the Overlook Hotel. The Overlook is just as much of a character as Jack, Wendy, and Danny. Kubrick does a great job of showing the viewer the vastness of the Overlook and then making it feel claustrophobic and overbearing. The slow pacing lets the scenes breathe and let's the viewer feel the isolation of the characters. Everything to the sound and cinematography is done masterfully. This film is subtle, but doesn't try to be deep and 'clever' unlike a lot of A24 slop."
greyalloverxx,"Apr 18, 2024",10/10,"Absolutely loved this film, such a classic will never get old 👌🏻 I remember growing up and my love for all the horror movies, I could watch that movie several more times and I'll never get annoyed. Amazing!! Still would be pretty sweet to go visit the hotel where it took place at. Has always been a dream of mine to re-visit these places! Jack did such a great job with his role in the movie. My favorite part I think will always have to be the twins ""come play with us"" and ""redrum"" they got super creative making the movie. Jack Nicholson has always been a great actor and a favorite of mine as well."
ozzytank,"Feb 17, 2023",10/10,"The bad rap this classic sometimes gets is that is doesn't follow the book close enough and that Steven King hated it. My response? Who cares? This movie stands on its own and is stunning in so many ways. A horror movie? Yes, but without the typical low-hanging-fruit gore. Masterfully directed by Kubrick, this flick is enthralling from start to finish. The imagery throughout is both haunting and unforgettable and the cinematography is ahead of it's time. The small cast of actors all do a great job but Nicholson is absolutely mesmerizing. Watching him transform his character is witnessing acting at its best and ranks as one of his greatest performances. I seen this gem countless time but you only need to see it once as you will never be able to forget it - even if you tried."
alexanderliljefors,"Sep 22, 2023",7/10,"Said to be a iconic, masterpiece of modern horror, classic and timeless horrorfilm i finally had the chance to watch this piece for the first time. And i really love all of Stephen Kings work. So i had really high expectations on it.Filming, editing and manuscript is very good! Aswell the original and intense soundtrack that really fits to the film and the great cinematography!Its truly very well acted by every actor! Performances of a lifetime!A very good, unique, surrealistic and original concept of genuine psychological horror that really captures the viewer! The horror is very timeless, good and original!One of those rare movies that really frightens you and give that type of atmosphere you want from a good horrorfilm, especially with the use of a big, lonely hotel with more and more horror moments developing, which makes you feel trapped. Aswell with the continuous heartbeat which makes it uncomfortable and ads to the atmosphere of the film.Its very well put together, intense and complicated, but very well made. One of the best psychological horrorfilms out there!It has moments where it gets a bit too much and exaggerated. But those are very few scenes.Did also expect a more clearer storyline.Very good and interesting ending! Trapped in a cycle of violence that continues throughout generations.I really recommend this great piece! A must watch!"
elasticfrog,"Dec 22, 2023",10/10,"Kubrick the genius, but did the talented Dr Frankenstein create his monster with The Shining? Without Jack Torrance do we get Batman, two oscar winning Joker performances or indeed the whole MCU ... probably ... but either way I love the monster unleashed, even if we get a few kids thrown in the pond here and there! The cold, meticulous direction in this film works in horrific wonderment with the quite frankly silly story. Ghosts aren't scary, for one thing they are complete fabrications formed from the 'unexplainable', so the refusal here to use the conventional stereotypes creates something better, something more! Jack taking a drink prepared by a dead man has, well, an unexplainable terror to it, and I love it!"
deniz_235,"Jan 1, 2025",10/10,"This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Let me start by explaining why I think so. First, the storyline is incredibly well-crafted. With Kubrick's masterful direction, this truly stands as a cinematic masterpiece. The film doesn't just focus on horror elements but also delves into human psychology and social critique, delivering themes that were far ahead of their time and remain relevant even today.As for the production process, it's no secret that it was notoriously challenging. The infamous tales of a single scene being shot 500 times speak volumes about Kubrick's perfectionism and the passion he poured into this film. If someone tried to make a movie like this today, the director would likely face significant obstacles.Moreover, the film portrays chaos and madness so effectively that it offers an experience that mesmerizes, overwhelms, and provokes deep thought. The set design, use of music, and cinematography all contribute to the film's gripping atmosphere. Jack Nicholson's unforgettable performance, in particular, elevates this movie into a true work of art."
unlockjoss,"Dec 2, 2024",9/10,"When I watched this movie totally non-spoiled, I excepted this movie to be a generic slasher taking place on a hotel, but it was way more than that. It is not a easy film to understand, the actor are pretty talented especially Shelly Duvall and Jack Nicholson who put everything in the performance, while it can feel slow at the beginning of the film, it does pick up it's pace as the movie goes on. And it has been analyzed so many times which make sense since it is pretty deep, the cinematography is on point and that all I have to say, but Imbd want me to say more so I report on the fact I have to talk more so that minimum character limit is met."
begob,"Aug 13, 2020",10/10,"A frustrated writer takes a job as caretaker at a deserted hotel, undisturbed at the news of the location's murderous past, and seals himself up through the bleak winter with his wife and son. But the past never leaves the present ...Plenty of comprehensive reviews for this masterpiece, so I'll make just two points.Music makes up about half the effect of a horror movie, but this baby goes even further. Apart from a couple of quiet scenes near the beginning, it never lets up yet never overwhelms. The opening drive through the mountains is full of ominous synth, and the first act is all atonal and unsettling. We switch in preparation for going through the looking glass - Room 237 - when the music becomes orchestral and structured, with multiplying tritones struck in ghastly sequence as Danny first notices the key in the lock. The music returns to atonal, but orchestral this time, as the evil worms its way into the characters. At the climax, we're hit with a satanic choir, and finish off with eerie dance music from the '20s. Add in the sound design, with the wheels on carpet and board, Tony's mutterings, the chilling rhythm of the dialogue in the red toilet and the stairway scenes, and it all works brilliantly.Second, many say this is a psychological horror, but I disagree. It's clear from the off that Jack Torrance is a man with no centre - a pleaser and a conniver and a bully - so it's a question of when, not if, he loses control, and there's no pyschological progression. I imagine Kubrick would have considered that trite, and preferred instead to use the characters as one of many frames to create the effect of evil, so it becomes a total cinematic horror. Essential that we go through the looking glass, and this is where we get the progression, from the music at the moment Danny passes the room, through the sound effect at Jack's falling into a nightmare, to Wendy's close up on discovering the typed pages, and to the point where she herself experiences the visions, not just Danny and Jack. To finish off, we're literally taken into a frame that confirms this is not some guy going off on one, but a circle of hell.Stephen King is said to have dismissed this as a travesty of his work, and I guess we're dealing with two very different views of what makes horror. I dunno about the writer, but the film-maker dun made a horror."
thomasheinrich,"Dec 3, 2019",10/10,"As each year goes by, people realize even more just how brilliant this movie is. The Shining unnerves the viewer in a way other horror movies can only try to; its surreal feeling, hidden messages and terrifying performances captivate you and leave you wondering long after the credits roll. Kubrick made a masterpiece, and analyses of this work of art are continuing to find more and more deeper meanings.ANY horror fan, and really any fan of cinema, must see this gem."
ryangrogers,"Nov 30, 2016",10/10,"The Shining Film ReviewFor many, The Shining is rightly considered the greatest horror movie ever made. The film has so much to offer as an overall viewing experience and goes to show that Stanley Kubrick could make a movie of any genre and execute it to perfection.Kubrick brought something different to every movie he made and the same goes for The Shining. Kubrick uses classic elements of horror such as archetypes but adds his own twist with memorable and iconic scenes, an ambiguous ending, and a story filled with characters that keep audiences on edge the entire time.The Shining takes place in the 1980's during a cold, snowy winter in Colorado. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) takes his family to the isolated Overlook Hotel where he has recently earned the job as off-season caretaker. There, he plans to finish the book he has been struggling to finish during his daily, suburbia-like lifestyle. Once they arrive and begin to settle in to the huge hotel, things start to change. Jack's son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), continues to be negatively affected by the visions in his head and his imaginary friend that goes by the name of Tony. As the snow piles up outside, Jack begins to discover the haunted secrets hidden within the lodge and a strong cabin-fever mentality kicks in. This leads Jack to slowly crack mentally until he becomes obsessed with harming his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and Danny.The film does so many things right and certainly stands out in the horror genre. Artistically, Kubrick showcases single-point perspective, a shooting style that frames a shot so all elements within it point toward a single focal point. This shooting style is ironically used in The Shining because it creates a sense of order in a hotel that becomes increasingly filled with chaos as the film goes on. John Alcott creates establishing shots that look beautiful while also building tension by showing the growing amounts of snow that isolate the family from any form of civilization or help. Kubrick recruited Garrett Brown, creator of the Steadicam, to help film several scenes including the ""maze scene"" at the end of the film as well as all of the scenes with Danny on his tricycle. These are particularly special because of the tension. Since the Steadicam follows behind Danny, the viewer never gets to see what is around each corner of the hotel until Danny actually sees it for himself. The ""haunted house"" and ""werewolf"" archetypes are prominent throughout. Characters in the Overlook constantly try to leave their mark on Jack, staining him in various ways in order to transform Jack into the monster he becomes by the end of the film. Kubrick was always obsessed with the details and this can clearly be seen in the use of costuming as indirect characterization. Wendy is almost always dressed in bright, primary colors that make her seem innocent and worry-free. In one scene, Jack and the bartender, Lloyd, wear the exact same color coat during a conversation which creates a mirror-like effect, a connection between the two men, and a sense of duality. This is appropriate because the film establishes a mirror trope right from the beginning. Jack Nicholson delivers a standout performance, one that is required to play such a dynamic character. He starts off as a loving father and husband just trying to write a book but turns into a ""nightmare come to life"" for his family. Nicholson is able to put himself into Jack's twisted mental position and become a blood-thirsty psychopath by the end. His performance is enhanced by quality, supporting roles played by Duvall and Lloyd that create a believable family being torn apart by Jack. The movie has few if any flaws of significance and is critically- acclaimed for its brilliance. Even if their were minor problems, it would be almost impossible for them to outweigh the seemingly endless list of positives. This Kubrick adaptation should be considered a classic in an otherwise, boring genre where the same thing is seen over and over. If all directors in horror tried to create films up to the standard that Kubrick creates in The Shining, the genre would not be the laughing stock it is becoming in Hollywood today. Those that enjoy slow-burn horror filled with tension or are just fans of Kubrick's work should see this movie as soon as possible and really savor the masterpiece it is. People that like horror filled with pop-out scares or fast-paced action should not. The Shining deserves all of the praise it has received over the years and proves how unique and creative Stanley Kubrick really was. It earns a perfect 10 out of 10 rating."
Regerreellle,"May 22, 2020",6/10,"Unfortunately it did not, but now I know what I don't like most about these movies: it's the terrible pacing. Despite having all the time in the world, Kubrick is simply incapable of escalating the tension gradually. I felt the same thing during A Space Odyssey where nothing happened for hours and then the computer went crazy in a span of 5 minutes.Here, Jack Torrance who is obviously supposed to go crazy gradually during their stay seems to be mad right from the start, so the director basically skips the interesting part. This also means that he can't really take the character any further and even Jack Nicholson's cartoonish overacting gets boring after a while, and you're just waiting for the never-ending chase scene to be over so you can move on to other things.Simply, overrated."
bellino-angelo2014,"Feb 5, 2021",9/10,"I had always been curious about this movie because it's considered by many among the greatest horror movies of all time (even tho some think it has aged a lot) and I have always liked Jack Nicholson as I consider him among the best actors that has ever lived. So on Halloween Night two years ago I saw it, and yes, it both haunted me and made me appreciate the performances and its style.Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a former school teacher that has problems of alcoholism and retired in order to become a writer. After a meeting in an office he accepts the job of being the keeper of the Overlook Hotel for the winter with his wife Wendy and child Danny. Jack sees this as a golden opportunity as being in such a large building all by himself will help him in writing his new book. However trouble is behind the corner as after a while it begins to snow heavily to the point that they will be stuck there for at least 6 months and there isn't a drink in sight as Jack is an alcoholic in recovery. And the entire place is so scary and haunting that it severely afflicts both father and son and especially Jack has hallucinating visions and even can't continue his book. I won't spoil the rest if you hadn't seen it yet.So what I loved about the movie? I loved the soundtrack because it added a lot to the scare factor and it really causes goosebumps in the scariest moments of the movie. The cinematography and athmosphere were quite tense and it's so innovating for 1980s standards especially in the long shots.Jack Nicholson here gives probably one of his greatest performances of his career. For some he seriously over-acted and it looks a bit buffoonish, but for me he was great as a man who slowly descends to madness and I especially loved when he finds Wendy in the living room and he smashes the door with an axe, leading to the most iconic scene in the movie ''Here's Johnny!''. The wife and kid look so frightened about the scary presences that are there (such as the two twins or the river of blood falling down the stairs) and the viewer can feel their sheer fear.I have to point out that this movie is very for adults. The language (with a few profanities here and there) and the disturbing and graphic scenes (like when Jack is in the living room and imagines to discuss with a ghostly bartender) are really something you should consider if you are very young or you have kids and want to watch this movie.So, since I gave a 9, it's clear that I really liked the movie. Sure the scares were at times too much (and I was even having dinner while watching it so imagine the scene!) but the acting was great and I know that many even today are half scared to death after they watch it. I sometimes watch horrors and I have to say it, this really achieves its goal well!Even with its shortcomings, it's one of those movies that has to be seen at least once not only because it has been parodied on lots of TV shows (such as THE SIMPSONS or FAMILY GUY) but also because of its greatness. I recommend it especially to horror fans."

And as I said earlier horror movies are not my thing . But I can't just pretend that this movie isn't a pure masterpiece and appreciate the effort into making it ! Id highly recommend it even if you don't like horror films . Its a must , its a thrilling experience. Watched it twice , would definitely watch it again !"
ronakkotian,"Aug 14, 2019",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick has been a filmmaker whose work has influenced many countless films and set a huge change within the industry. Each and every one of his movies has affected a lot of present and aspiring filmmakers but his most notable work, The Shining, was ground-breaking!To this day people talk about this movie because of how convoluted the storyline is. This movie brings out one of the most tension filled, nail biting and horrifying experiences. Everything in this film is top notch. Kubrick's direction is amazing. His way of visual storytelling was like no other. The film begins with these gorgeous aerial shots of the scenery that make you feel you are there. The shot selection added a lot to the continuous eerie atmosphere. It's saddening to know how negative the reception was when the film initially came out. I mean Kubrick was even nominated for Worst Director at the Razzies.The editing in this film is sharp. Not once do feel bored or have any intention of turning the film off. The film builds up a constant sense of dread and mystery which fully engrosses you and never lets your eyes off the screen. Aside from Kubrick's direction, the other aspect which made me shudder throughout was the haunting score. The music is used in a very meticulous way. Not once does it feel cheaply used to get a scare out of the audience. Each scene involving the music contributes to the harrowing atmosphere and insinuates an even darker feeling to the environment.The performances in this movie are perfect. Words cannot describe how genuine and phenomenal Jack Nicholson's acting is. This is probably the best performance of his entire career. Shelley Duvall is incredible as well. She is consistently devastated. Her performance brings out the right amount of vulnerability to her character that we whole heartedly care for her. Young Danny Lloyd gives one of the best child performances I've ever seen.Even though Stephen King hated Kubrick's adaptation of his book, many consider this to be the best horror film made. The ending of this movie is equally shocking and thought provoking. After 39 years, film lovers still create crazy theories about what the ending might suggest.Thank you Stanley Kubrick for giving us this gem of a film."
nurinurisia,"Dec 11, 2022",10/10,"Perfect movie for Halloween. One of my favourites of all time. Unsettling without the jump scares. Intriguing and mysterious. It's style assures it will always be a classic.That said, it is not a solid adaptation of Stephen King's novel and his fans should be aware of this fact. The movie itself is perfect, but it does change a bit. There is too little time used to show the humanity and struggles of Jack Torrance. Nicholson's acting does not help out. Even if the male lead is charismatic, his expressions alone make him much more of a psycho than what he was in the book. This adaptation should be taken as loosely based on a popular book. It's own twist on the story. In that way it's, as I wrote previously, a real classic."
Shilo_R_A,"Dec 16, 2021",9/10,"""I'm sorry to differ with you sir, but *you*...are the caretaker. You've always been the caretaker. I should know, sir. I've *always* been here.""The Shining just became my favorite Kubrick film up to this date, and one of my favorite films in general.The film (which is based on a Stephen King novel) follows a family who moves into an isolated hotel for the winter (as the caretakers of the hotel for the season). As time goes on, they realize that something's wrong with the hotel. Something is watching, pumping, waiting for blood as the madness starts to crawl in.I'm telling you guys, that's the first time that I'm totally blown away by a horror film. Everything here is just phenomenal.The score, for example, is used in a brilliant, precise way to emphasize moments, draw you into the film, give it an eerie feeling, swells as things are getting more and more intense, synchronized with the movement of the characters at time. It's amazing.Jack Nicholson also blew me away here. His performance may seem a little awkward at first, but don't let that fool you. He delivers every line perfectly, giving life to the father of the family, Jack Torrance.Talking about precision, it's so insane to think about the amount of things to unpack here. You can totally enjoy this film without diving into the little hints in the cinematography, the motifs, the meaning of it all, but when you do dive in - well, that's what makes this film so great in my opinion. Everything is so dense and layered, in the best way possible. The Shining will send a chill down your spine one way or another, but diving into it really made it much, much better.I'd recommend specifically to check out Rob Ager's site or videos, he has some brilliant observations about this film.And also, to be honest, I don't really have any noteable issue with this film. I think that the only thing might be how the pacing is a little weird by the end (cutting between the Overlook to another place), but it's so minor and insignificant that I think I mentioned only to give this film SOME criticism XDBut seriously, this film is amazing. It's a dense, eerie and psychological horror film. And it's a slow, slow burn, but when you feel the heat, the swelling madness, the chill that crawls down your spine again...well. You realize how brilliant it is. I'm giving The Shining a 9.3/10. Do yourself a favor and watch this film, especially if you like horror or psychological films."
morfunkel,"Nov 20, 2018",10/10,"All alone in a hotel for months on end, nothing but you your family and the ghosts of the family murdered there. (The Shining) is known as the greatest horror film ever and it has earned that title. This film is able to get you closer and closer to the edge of your with every second passing and keep you guessing at every turn. Terror seeps from just the title of this not only due to the horror themes but because of the direction, story telling, acting, and imagery.
A recovering drunk is trying to land a job to support his wife and five year old wife, so he gets an interview to be the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. The ensuing months at the hotel turn out to be a little more than the family can take at this hotel. Accompanying the Jack Torrance (the recovering alcoholic) is his wife Wendy who is a typical housewife and their son Danny who happens to have special power. There are a couple other characters in the film but only that plays a role into the story, Halloran. He is the cook of the hotel who happens to share the same ability as Danny.
This movie is not only seen as the greatest horror film but as a great film among all genres. This film is absolutely brilliant it Kubrick hits on every note here. He has a very interesting way of making his films that I find odd sometimes, I like some of his films while I hate some of his others but I love this one and the direction that he took King's story. However the biggest the part of this movie that has stuck with me since first watch and is part of what made me want to be in film is Jack Nicholson's performance. The progression of his character was so perfect and made for such a nail biter. There is in a scene in this movie that made my skin crawl due to his his portrait of Jack Torrance, the ""dull boy"" scene. I saw this movie at a very young age it was never the scariest movie for me upon the first couple viewings but as I got older I started to appreciate the filming techniques used and the acting and the brilliant imagery.
Next to the performances in the movie my favorite part of (The Shining) is the setting. The narrow hallways and open lounging rooms feel very small. Something that I love more anything in horror films is isolation. (The Thing), (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and even (The Exorcist) all of them create such a tight feeling of isolation. This feeling is created here ten fold with the family being in this huge hotel you wouldn't think so but the surrounding snow keeping them in and having someone in the hotel start to lose it as well as the thoughts that someone might be in the hotel with you harming your child, makes the hotel a lot smaller and smaller. Kubrick made the this place so small and awful for the characters. When the characters have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide than the viewers feel the same way trapped and stuck and this was felt very strongly for Wendy and Danny.
There is a lot that kubrick added to this story that made it the film the that it is today. A big thing that Kubrick added that King didn't have in the book was the feeling of suspense, the feeling made by unanswered questions. He leaves so many things unknown as far as the mystery of what is going on and what is happening in the hotel. This is what makes the movie a horror film for me. It leaves so much to keep you thinking then all of the sudden another curve ball is thrown and you have to find out what is going on this time.
There is one message that stuck with me throughout this film and was solidified in the end shot is the message that you can not escape your fate. This feels very strong throughout the film as things progress, and it can be seen in some of the characters. I can not get to much into this message or any message without giving away some of the movie for those that have yet to see it.
Before I rewatched this movie the other day I read the novel, I had always wanted to read the novel to see what all the fuse that Stephen King put up about he film. After finishing it I can understand why there was a lot of stuff that was left out including some of the turmoil that Jack Torrance felt about his addiction to alcohol. So I understand why he was upset but I felt Kubrick enhanced the story to make an amazing adaptation of this film. I have seen the film countless times and I love films So naturally I draw more towards them than books but I have read and watched a lot of the greatest horror stories and have liked a lot of the books more and I do not understand how moving the story to the silver screen could mess it up that bad. Watching this movie and reading the book I get why there is a large group that is lead by King in the hate for the adaptation. With all of that being said I felt as though King was spoon feeding me every little detail that he thought of so I am and have always loved the film more that is not to say that I didn't like book I just happen to love the movie.
This is one of the greats. The shining was groundbreaking for films, not just on the horror side of it. The cinematography in this movie is some of the best I have ever scene and the way we are able to dive into a crashing mind to see what is going on is brilliant in this movie there are some thing that happen towards the end of the movie that upset some people but I loved it and I feel it adds to the feeling of the Overlook Hotel as a character. The acting in this movie was amazing and almost perfect. One flaw I had with the movie was Shelley Duvall as Wendy, she played very well when she was terrified but for the scenes when she is calm and happy I find her acting very out of place and like she has the script in her hands to deliver those lines. That is the only problem I can see in this movie though, it ""Shines"" on every other level for me. With only one flaw it is hard to rate this movie on a scale of one to five, so I would give Stanley Kubrick's (The Shining) a 9.5/10."
KyleW,"Jul 16, 1999",N/A,"This is the classic horror!  Stanley Kubrick's Finest!  The scariest of the ""Kubrick Stares"" has to be Jack Nicholson looking through the door in the classic horror scene.  The camera, music, acting, and scares are top notch! I highly recommend this movie to: Horror fans, Kubrick fans, psychological thriller fans, and even Nicholson fans.  You will love this movie to death! Four out of four stars.  A definative classic!   SEE IT!"
kosmasp,"Nov 23, 2019",10/10,"I have not yet watched the TV version of the Shining. You know the one Stephen King actually likes and prefers to Kubricks version of his novel. But I cannot imagine it being better than this one. And while I have not read the book King wrote (and therefor cannot tell you the differences of how you should feel about King not liking it), I do like this movie very much.Saying there is attention to detail would be one major understatement. There is a documentary who interprets all the details of the film and goes quite far out at times, but more on that elsewhere. The movie at hand has powerhouse performances. Watching some behind the scenes footage, gives you quite the feeling of what went on.Some may have had issues with the way Kubrick went on to do things, the amount of takes he demanded, the way he behaved allegedly and much more. But the results on the screen speak for themselves. You may not like horror movies and yet still find something here. You also may like horror movies and think this isn't a horror movie at all. It's not easy, but he knows what he's doing and he plays the viewer like a fidel - relax and let it happen"
tburke85,"Jun 22, 2009",9/10,"The Shining is a scary horror thriller from the late acclaimed director Stanley Kurbick whose admirable in making this movie based on a book by Stephen King by giving audiences almost everything they could except from this kind of genre. Jack Nicholson turns in a great performance of Jack Torrence a writer who slowly begins to slip into insanity because he's being influenced by the dark evil spiritual forces that haunt an isolated hotel in the mountains of Colorado where he and his family are staying as caretakers during the winter. Nicholson is convincing as Jack playing a man whose losing his mind because of the evil spirits that haunt the hotel. Shelley Duvuall is okay as Jack's wife Wendy but nothing memorable. None offense. The rest of the cast including the young boy who played their son are good in their roles as well. The Shining has enough scares, suspense, creepy moments, and surprises. The music seemed to sync well with the tone of the film. It also added to the suspense and creep factor. The running time of over two and a half hours does make it feel a little long but the rest makes up for the movies few flaws. With it's few flaws aside The Shining is definitely one of the best horror films out there and I recommend this to any fan of the genre if you can get past the long running rime. Overall The Shining is an effective horror thriller with suspense, scares, anticipation, creepy moments, surprises, and good performances by the cast especially Nicholson who make this movie worth the time to watch."
notoriousCASK,"Apr 10, 2020",10/10,"The Shining is a thought-provoking meditation on madness, isolation and paranoia that presents the demanding perfectionist that is Stanley Kubrick in majestic form, as it defies everything that was usually a norm in the genre of horror back then yet puts on screen a cinema that is now regarded as the definitive example of atmospheric horror. Immortal for its contribution to horror, a staple of pop culture, and a classic amalgamation of superb direction, deft writing, innovative camerawork, skillful editing, menacing score and steadfast performances featuring one of the greatest of all time with Jack Nicholson's, The Shining remains one of the greatest achievements of its genre and the cinematic artform in general. It's only getting better with every passing year, and definitely ranks amongst Stanley Kubrick's finest works."
Howlin Wolf,"Jun 1, 2007",10/10,"... This isn't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect, either. In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing (""five months of peace is just what I want... "") and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.Kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you. When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic. If you want a great viewing experience, then this is an example that well and truly shines..."
JohnAbrahms011,"Sep 28, 2019",10/10,You can't change what's perfect. And this film is as close as they come.
charbelelaro,"Dec 22, 2021",10/10,"The Shining is directed by Stanley Kubrick and is a horror movie based on the novel by Steven King. In reviewing this film, there's probably nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece. This movie has stood the test of time and will forever be praised as one of the greatest achievements in cinema. From the production design, to the performances, the movie is unmatched. The atmosphere Kubrick creates in The Shining is in my opinion, the reason why this movie has suck around as long as it has. The Overlook Hotel is a character in itself. The way the music in the opening credits establishes the feeling of this setting whilst the camera travels through nature leading to to hotel, just instantly impacts the audience, immediately immersing them into the world. Once you enter the hotel, you feel as though you are really there living through the characters. Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance is beyond perfect. He presents the slow progression of insanity so authentically, which ultimately leads to one of the most iconic climaxes of all time. His wife played my Shelley Duvall does an amazing job with a performance so over the top is actually works. The son, Danny Torrance is probably my favourite character in the movie. He easily could have ruined the film but he does a fantastic job in delivering some absurd lines which I still genuinely get so creeped out by. The Shining is a film lovers dream. And whilst Steven king didn't like the film, how can one not marvel at all the symmetry, vibrant colour palette and perfect set design. Seriously I know the Overlook Hotel is haunted, but I would check into that place any day. To walk through the ballroom, see the iconic carpet and use that unusually modern red bathroom would be a dream. The Shining is one of my favourites movies ever. And whilst this review probably doesn't mean anything because this film has already seen enough praise, I'm still going to give it a 10/10. If you haven't seen The Shining get off your phone and go watch it right now. Seriously it's a classic how haven't you watched it yet?"
carmelolia,"Oct 19, 2025",10/10,"Few horror films have burrowed into pop culture quite like 'The Shining'. Stanley Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of Stephen King's novel isn't just scary, it's hypnotic. From that ominous opening helicopter shot to the final frozen stare of Jack Nicholson, it's less a ghost story than a slow, unsettling descent into madness.Jack Nicholson gives a performance for the ages as Jack Torrance, a struggling writer who accepts a job as caretaker of the isolated Overlook Hotel. His gradual slide from frustrated father to axe-wielding maniac is so magnetic you can't look away. ""Here's Johnny!"", famously improvised by Nicholson, has become part of cinema legend.Shelley Duvall's terrified Wendy, meanwhile, remains hauntingly authentic, partly because Kubrick pushed her through an exhausting 127 takes of one scene. The result is one of the most genuinely panicked performances ever captured on film. Add in the eerie score, Garrett Brown's groundbreaking Steadicam shots following young Danny through endless hallways, and the hotel itself - majestic, symmetrical, and deeply wrong - and you've got atmosphere distilled to perfection.Whether you see it as a ghost story, a psychological breakdown, or a riddle in film form, 'The Shining' endures because it's impossible to shake. Kubrick's icy precision meets Nicholson's volcanic energy, and the result is pure cinematic folklore. It's one of the best horror films ever made, especially when considering its lasting impact and influence on the horror genre in film and pop culture in general."
Kirpianuscus,"Jan 20, 2016",N/A,"it is his movie. and that fact is obvious in each scene. in tempo, in manner to build the fear, in the outdoor scenes, in the indoor scenes. more than a horror, a not most expected adaptation, it is a film by a clockmaker. each detail, each dialog, each line of terror, the expectation itself are the result of carefully manner to use the book in the best form as tool of personal vision. Jack Nicholson is the cause to remind this horror again and again. but his performance is only the top of a film who has strong, deep roots in social tensions. and that fact does it more than one of the most impressive adaptations of Stephen King."
jschno-10251,"Oct 21, 2023",7/10,"It was a really good movie don't get me wrong, the over all idea of the movie was genius but it just really wasn't that scary. I've always wanted to watch The Shining because I've been into horror movies as long as I can remember but I always thought it would be too scary to watch because that's how everyone made it sound. Then, when I finally decided to watch it, it wasn't even scary like at all. I remember laughing more than actually being scared. If you want to watch it but are hesitant because you think it's too scary, it's really not so I would go ahead and watch this masterpiece of a movie."
beermonsteruk,"Jan 22, 2020",10/10,"What can I say about this film? The first time I saw this was many years ago as a teenager, a few friends and I were up drinking, watching movies, when my friend suggested this, said he heard it was scary, none of us had seen it, and seeing as it was gone midnight, we thought why not, it scared the hell out of us, it was fantastic, I've seen the film countless times since then and while it no longer creeps me out in the same way as a young fresh faced teen, it still entertains me nonetheless.From the opening scenes of the movie, I was hooked straight away, the cinematography and the films score were absolutely hypnotic, really draws you into the whole eerie atmosphere and sense of impending doom.The film starts with Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) being offered a job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel during the winter months, his son Danny already seems to know he has been offered the job, being told so by Tony, his seemingly imaginary friend who lives in his throat.Jack, his wife Wendy and Danny travel to the Overlook Hotel on its last day open before the shutdown, getting their as the guests and members of staff are leaving.
They meet with Manager Mr Ullman and the Overlook Chef, Dick Halloran, who has an instant connection with Danny due to certain abilities they both share, Halloran calls it ""Shining"", they can see certain things, speak to each other telepathically and even sense impending danger, Danny senses something bad in the Overlook and Halloran warns him to stay away from one room in particular.After a short period, Jack himself is starting to become more withdrawn, and his behaviour strange, it seems the bad things Danny sensed are starting to affect Jack, and some very strange and sinister forces are at work within the Overlook, and they don't like Danny's gift.This for me is an absolute cinematic masterpiece in horror, Kubrick's whole style here may not be for everyone (Stephen King himself hated what Kubrick did to his excellent Novel), but it works wonders for me, the music, the suspense, the cinematography, the overlook itself is a wonderfully isolated and creepy building whom no-one in their right mind would want to spend the winter months their amidst all the madness, some complain about the acting but for me it's not a problem, this is a horror film a bit of over the top and hammy is fine by me.This will be always hold a place in my heart, and will always be one of my all time favourite horrors, turn off the lights, and enjoy.10/10. Classic Horror."
jcurtis-27126,"Nov 1, 2023",7/10,I decided to watch this movie for Halloween since it's considered one of the best horror movies out there. I really don't have any complaints on this movie except that it was long and there were no scary moments in it for me.I was expecting more of the weird scary moments that you saw in the middle and kind of at the end. It would have been nice if we could have dove more into the history and background of this hotel because that was the interesting side of things. I just didn't really feel scared I didn't feel like I was watching much of a horror movie.I will agree that everyone played their part well I just think there could have been scarier moments put into it. But then again I wouldn't really know what to consider scary since I can't remember the last time I was scared in a movie.
sydmwswy,"Jun 6, 2022",9/10,"One of Kubrick's best films. I just think the bathroom sequence should have been taken out of editing. It is insulting....
In this film, I learn that grotesque characters are one of the best ways to summarize an adaptation of a long story. That Kubrick has done well....."
TheLittleSongbird,"May 16, 2010",9/10,"Very loosely based on the book, which is very chilling and shocking, this is a great film. Having seen The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and It and liking all three of them, I knew I should check out the Shining. I did feel that Jack Torrence's hallucinations, apparitions and time-warps were introduced a little too quickly and the build up to the ending was rushed too. But it is very stylishly filmed, making perfect use of an amazing set built at Elstree and a gliding Steadicam, and the music is atmospheric. The story is also effective, and there are really nice touches in the script. Kubrick here tries to be different, and I think he does a superb job at it. The Shining is more chilling rather than shocking, the blood flowing from the doors and the old woman in the bathtub made my hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and is constantly discomforting in an eerie sort of way. Jack Nicolson gives a barnstorming performance as Jack, a performance that is both hammy and disturbing, and Shelley Duvall does decently in a somewhat thankless role. Young Danny Lloyd is superb as Danny, his chanting of Redrum especially became increasingly hypnotic and distorted. The film concludes with a fairly suspenseful ending, and is overall a film with one or two problems and a very loose adaptation but it is a chilling adaptation with Kubrick succeeding at being different. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
matthewssilverhammer,"Oct 19, 2016",10/10,"Kubrick spent his 40+ year career proving that no matter what the genre he will, not only do it well, but will dominate it. The Shining is no exception. A filmed nightmare, it's a naturalistically still and insistently surreal mixture of thick mood and rich story. A maze of surprises even after multiple viewings, its terror hovers right under the surface before exploding onto our brains. A masterpiece of hypnotic horror that's as insidiously, mind-bogglingly creepy as ever. At the center is the ever-menacing presence of Nicholson. Presenting a sobering lesson in how to not be a husband / father (and not just because of the violent climax), his dementia begins unraveling from moment one. Despite his iconically villainous turn, I'm not sure he's even the best of the bunch. Crothers brings beautiful lightness when needed, and his darker moments that much more powerful; and Lloyd walks a brilliant tightrope between creepy-horror-kid, average boyhood, and haunting sadness. Above all, Duvall's compelling and deeply broken turn as forlorn wife / mother is beyond perfect. These performers are given a directorial assuredness to play in rarely matched outside of Kubrick. The plight of these characters is captured with such empathy, we're given a personal view of what could easily have been a cold experience. Every detail is so intentionally and perfectly placed to draw us into the growing madness of the Overlook Hotel: The blood-flood, the dead-eyed stares, the symmetry of the twins, the normally-calm camera ferociously following the swinging axe. Meticulously crafted, intellectually provocative, emotionally penetrating, and dementedly entertaining, though Shining may not be Kubrick's best, it would be most filmmakers magnum opus."
UniqueParticle,"Jun 18, 2019",10/10,"Spiraling madness done best in the most convoluted way! Among Jack Nicholson's best performances, so meticulous and sticks with you like molasses in the brain. The long shots are true art in film and Jack losing his mind is one of my favorite things ever! It shakes you to your core every time, I have seen it at least 6 times; it's always shocking. You can't ask for a better experience, I'm glad bits of The Shining were in Ready Player One and it's getting sort of a sequel!"
rneil95,"Mar 27, 2009",10/10,"Stephen King is one of the greatest American novelists in the past century. While he is dubbed a ""horror writer,"" he is much more than that. He is a character writer, and while his novels are intended to scare, characters are the central point of the novels. They rely so heavily on backstory that the characters are practically real. However, this is very hard to do on film and it can result in making the story seem unimportant. So, as you can expect, I was not eager to see how they could ruin The Shining. Well, after reading the spectacular novel, I moved onto the film. After watching the film, I was flaming mad. The film The Shining does not fail from their overuse of backstory. These characters are completely shallow and you don't care about them. King novels are hard to adapt, but they can be done well. Carrie is an example of that. However, this movie is an awful adaptation. Kubrick basically took some character names, some locations, and made his own ""scary hotel"" movie. Why he couldn't just make his own ""scary hotel"" movie, I don't know. The acting is, for the most part, garbage. Shelley Duvall gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen. She's just so awful that you want her to get killed, as opposed to the novel. I just felt that I didn't care about anybody in this film. It felt empty and like there was no point to anything in the end. King said that he doesn't like the film because it doesn't make you feel. I agree completely with that. I felt nothing other than lack of interest when I watched this stinker. It wasn't even passable as a good stand-alone film. I hated every minute of this film. It was supposedly psychological horror, but it didn't make me think at all. This movie is horrible, and I hope book readers never have to witness an adaptation as bad as this atrocity...well, okay, there is the '97 TV movie, but even that's not as bad as this crap!"
dougdoepke,"Apr 11, 2011",N/A,"If The Shining were about camera work and atmosphere only, it would rank with Kubrick's best, which is to say about as good as the movies get. To Kubrick's hand-held camera and cinematic imagination, the hotel's vast empty corridors and adjacent rooms become a labyrinth of horror in which evil of any kind might emerge. Only The Sixth Sense, of recent vintage, comes close to capturing the same spooky anything-can-happen atmosphere of the Shining's Overlook Hotel. If the film were about script only, it would still rate an arguable 5 stars, as Kubrick & Co. substitute mood and spectral apparitions in place of the book's hokier parts, such as flying topiary. Nor do I think the film is overlong, since a leisurely buildup is essential to the crashing, mind-altering climax.But this is not the early Kubrick, the sure-hand behind Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, or 2001. This is Kubrick in decline. A director who either cannot or will not control the wild excesses of his celebrity-star Jack Nicholson in the film's pivotal role. In a part that fairly cries out for sublety and nuance, especially in limning the descent into madness, we get instead a leering, smirking self parody of an actor obviously wallowing in a chance to pull out all stops. And who can believe that that dreadful mood-killing line, ""Here'sss Johnny!"" is actually in the script. Rarely has such a grossly self-indulgent performance been allowed to reach the screen in unaltered form. And for that, there is only Kubrick to ultimately blame.I realize I risk offending Nicholson's legion of fans for whom this ""cool dude"" can do no wrong. But the fact is he traded in his acting credentials soon after Cuckoo's Nest for the easier road of self-parody, in which the silk purse of Five Easy Pieces becomes the sow's ear of the typical Nicholson Role. I care because in more disciplined hands - say an Anthony Hopkins - this could have been a great movie, instead of the artistic irritant it finally is."

So it became #3 on my list so far.Having seen A Clockwork Orange one or two years ago and having taught its a decent movie but way too dragging, i somewhat knew what to expect from this one in a way and it was exactly that.I gave it a 6 because i feel i need to be fair, after all its a 1980 movie i watched 41 years later... it need to be taken into consideration. And the film does have some strong points. The visuals are beautifull and still capture some creepyness despite always being very bright and the sound effects are great. The actors all put a solid performance.But its main problem for me is that it moves at a snail pace. Its a 90 minutes movie that drag for 2 and a half hour. Yes the characters developement is important and we are supose to watch Jack's descent into madness but the issue is LOTS of scenes drag and outside a few couple scenes, there is nothing really ""scary"". The hotel does have a creepy vibes as i said, but its not building tension toward scary if it make any sense.The last act is pretty good but by then i was kinda bored a bit for a solid hour mid-movie going on twitter on my phone and watching the movie with one eye.But as i said due to its age and what it has inspired, i don't want to be too harsh on it. I am ""glad"" i saw it once, but its a movie i will never watch again. Its not one i would say to a friend or a modern kid ""you have to watch this man""."
gut-6,"Aug 12, 2006",6/10,"After ""A Clockwork Orange"" things did not go so well for the great Stanley Kubrick. He was blamed for violence allegedly incited by ""A Clockwork Orange"" so he had the film pulled in England. His pet ""Napoleon"" project got canned after much effort in pre-production, which prompted him to make ""Barry Lyndon"" as a consolation substitute. After many arduous and expensive months of location filming, ""Barry Lyndon"" flopped both critically (not unusual) and commercially (which was unusual for Kubrick). Kubrick badly needed a low-risk hit movie, particularly in America, to raise his stocks again with Hollywood. ""The Shining"" was that movie, and was indeed a hit in America.The trivia section mentions that Stephen King was surprised that Kubrick was sold on the first chapter of the novel, since the first chapter was atypical of the rest of the novel. It certainly contained no real scares. However when you consider the above background, you can sort of understand the novel's appeal to Kubrick as a film adaptation. The first chapter describes in great detail the layout of the hotel, in which almost the entire snowbound story takes place, as well as the seething writer's anger at being questioned about his struggle with alcohol and his personal failures (poignant for Kubrick?). Here was a film which could be shot entirely in the studio (low risk, low cost) using a small, relatively inexpensive cast featuring a well-known star (Nicholson) with whom Kubrick had wanted to work for some time. This allowed Kubrick unprecedented and relatively inexpensive scope for his notoriously excessive re-shoots. It was also based on a best-selling book, thus drawing in the numerous Stephen King fans. The hotel's long empty passageways also gave plenty of scope for Kubrick's trademark tracking/zoom shots down the length of long symmetrical corridors, while Jack Torrance's mental disintegration allows Kubrick to use his other trademark, The Glare.As a gadget freak, Kubrick generally had a technical innovation in almost every movie. In this case it was the Steadicam, to which he had been introduced several years earlier. The stairwells and carpeted corridors provided a perfect opportunity to use the Steadicam on previously ""impossible"" shots, and some shots (e.g. the Big Wheel ride over the carpets, or the staircase ascent preceding the Dog Man) seem to have been included purely to show off the capabilities of his new gadget.Yet in focusing on the technical appeal of this project, Kubrick lost sight of one important thing - he has no understanding of the horror genre, and thus doesn't have a clue as to how to make a scary film. Though the film is reasonably interesting and absorbing, there are only a couple of even moderately scary scenes in the whole film. Nicholson's acting throughout is outrageously hammy, Shelley Duvall is monochromatically hysterical and tearful for too much of the movie, while the child actor does as well as you can expect a 5 year old to do, which isn't very well at all. Kubrick apologists try to claim he wasn't trying to make a scary film, that he was actually commenting on the role of television, or the plight of the Indians (or some other barrow the apologist is pushing) in the guise of a horror movie. However when Diane Johnson was given the job of co-writing the screenplay, Kubrick told her to make it ""completely scary"". So they failed to achieve their goals.The film is justly famous for the ambiguity of its plot. At first Kubrick repeatedly implies that the ghosts are merely imagined for most of the movie, then only towards the end suggests they are capable of action in the physical realm. While this gets the audience discussing the movie, it is also blatantly inconsistent. Likewise with the film's punchline suggesting Charles Grady, Delbert Grady and Jack Torrance may or may not have previously been there and may or may not have been the same person. There is a point beyond which the shifting of perspective turns from tantalising ambiguity and fascinating puzzle into annoying and unsatisfying confusion. Kubrick's extra edits for the 2 hour version seem to remove a great deal of clarifying information, and accentuate this confusion further. I don't know if this was dome out of incompetence or a love of confusion. Either way it's not impressive.In short, this is an unsuccessful Kubrick film, but nevertheless a moderately entertaining one."

Pulpthatsfiction,"Nov 10, 2007",9/10,"I was kinda surprised when I heard that Stanly Kubrick had made a horror film and that it was The Shinning was a big shock to me. Kubrick is one of my favorite film makers and after I saw 2001 and Clockwork Orange I had to see his other movies. I had heard a lot about this movie and kinda a lot of the scenes but I really didn't remember this movie that well. So I rent the movie and watch it as soon as I got home and loved it. This is one of my favorite movies even though I really do not like the horror movies. Jack Nicholson give his best performance(have not seen One Flow Over The Cuckoo's Nest).Sherry Duvall and Danny Loyd do better good but I didn't like their performances. The thing I didn't like about this movie is that the shinning in the story is wear the Danny can do a lot of telepathic things with his head, which I thought was kinda random. Even though that the things I didn't like about this movie really bug me I still love this movie. This is a great movie if like to see another Stanley Kubrick film or just want to watch the one of the best horror films out there."
kevin_robbins,"Jan 15, 2023",10/10,"The Shining (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a writer who agrees to overlook a hotel in Colorado during the winter months when it's closed down. His son has an imaginary friend that helps him see things. When the family arrives at the hotel he tries to warn the family something is off but they feel it's just him adjusting. The hotel brings lies and secrets about the family to the surface. When a snowstorm hits the hotel that won't let anyone in or out the families hope for surviving the winter diminishes.This movie is directed by icon Stanley Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange) and stars Jack Nicholson (Chinatown), Shelley Duvall (Popeye), Danny Lloyd (Doctor Sleep), Scatman Crothers (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and Joe Turkel (Bladerunner).The cinematography and soundtrack for this is legendary. The ability to capture the daunting landscape of the circumstances and portray the intensity of the isolation with background music is magnificent. The acting is out of this world and Nicholson, Duvall and Lloyd deliver all time great performances. Nicholson's evolution as a character is perfectly portrayed. Kubrick had to be very clever with the times and how he portrayed Nicholsons childhood abuses as well as how Nicholson was sexually abusing Danny. It's very subtle but smart simultaneously. There will never be a time that the talking finger and blood elevator isn't creepy and the use of redrum will be a catch phrase for eternity. Every second of this movie is a masterpiece but the last 20 minutes will go down as one of the best finales to any movie ever, in and out of the horror genre.Overall, this is an all time great movie of any genre. Kubrick really put everything into this picture, more than the audience can even capture with the imagination. A true masterpiece and a must see. I would score this a 10/10 and consider it required viewing for anyone who enjoys movies."
imdbfan-335721,"Oct 8, 2025",10/10,"Amazing movie. Stop saying this isn't a masterpiece, the camera shots, the music, the setting, the characters, the plot... I could go on forever and ever and ever. I don't understand people who don't like this movie but then put a 10 review on fast and furious. In conclusion I hope this review helped, I recommend to all people to see endlessly this masterpiece and never getting tired of it, it makes me feel at home."
cclarkalbritton,"Apr 19, 2025",10/10,"Lately, I have watched maybe a dozen YouTube videos suggesting a variety of theories related to The Shining, plot elements, hidden meanings and so on. Most videos posit they have THE defining theory of this film, some nuanced aspect that explains the entire film, sort of a ""theory of everything"" for The Shining. I've even watched reviews of these various theories. Well, here's a twist - I'd love to share with all who are interested. I believe the genius of this film lies in that to a lesser or greater extent, almost ALL of these theories are valid and simultaneously present in the film. Reincarnation, built on sacred Indian burial grounds, that ""Danny"" theory, the ""writer"" theory - there is really no reason to believe all of these are not simultaneously at play. The director used every aspect presented in those theories to grip the audience into what is a strangely compelling impossible to ignore masterpiece. The art of this film is evident in every particular and I'm willing to believe some merged amalgam of most of these theories are all simultaneously intended."
Graeme-5,"Aug 4, 1998",N/A,"This film ""shines"" on Jack Nicholson because of the way Kubrick uses his skill to show how Jack gradually goes crazy. The camara angles and the actors unique ability to give the film a scary, yet suspense filled atmosphere - help to add to the horror of the film.  The special foot - hill of this film is shown in the camara filming, noticeable when the boy is pedaling through the halls, ""Steadycam"" procedeure helps make the boy also ""shine.""  The catch-phrases are wicked - ""here's Johny!"" and my favourite -  ""All work and no play make Jack a dull boy"" which is spoofed in many films and shows like the Simpsons."
moonspinner55,"Nov 16, 2007",6/10,"Stanley Kubrick takes an arguably weak Stephen King literary tomb and possibly reads more into the material than what King had originally cooked up. Jack Nicholson interviews to be the winter caretaker of a mammoth, isolated Colorado hotel and immediately feels at home in the lonely vastness of its eerie expanse; his jittery wife and muted, psychic young son aren't so sure about the surroundings, especially after Dad starts exhibiting uncontrolled behavior. Once again, Kubrick displays his fabulous grasp of film-technique, resulting in some sensational scenes (particularly the opening drive up the mountain, the child's first meeting with the psychic cook, the overhead shot of the maze, and a funny/scary bit with Shelley Duvall fending off crazy Jack with a baseball bat). Unfortunately, the plot is all gummed up; it takes in past and present incidents, characters as mind demons, and a boy's fear of his father and fails to make all the elements cohere. Worse, the pieces don't make this much of a scary puzzle--it's too confounding to be truly terrifying--and the finale (filled with lots of freaky goings-on) releases all the tension Kubrick has worked so hard to build up. Some may see the confusing debauchery and the blood-filled elevator as Kubrick's comment on the horror genre, his imperviousness to the usual scare-movie tactics--he's above clichés--though what he DOES give us doesn't add up. A great deal of screen-time is spent getting help to the woman and her son (in the form of the cook) and also in locking up Nicholson when he becomes too violent--and both chapters end ridiculously. Was Kubrick gleeful at cutting such corners? If so, he shouldn't have been. ""The Shining"" feels like a cheat in so many ways that frustration ultimately mitigates the suspense. **1/2 from ****"
CarinaK91,"Sep 23, 2019",6/10,"I just finished the book and wanted to see the movie after i read it but the movie although Jack Nicholson is a great actor the movie plot was nothing like the book and in fact has disappointed me a lot. I have read great reviews about the movie and was shure it would be more like the book itself but it was only about 40-50%.

Kooozey,"Dec 11, 2020",3/10,"How do you pretend that a movie about a guy freaking out and trying to kill his family is somehow deep and a meaningful piece of art? Just draw out every scene as long as possible and play some weird modernist art-music. Also add a bunch of nonsense that is ""open to interpretation"" but doesn't actually mean anything. This movie isn't scary, there's almost no plot, there aren't any interesting characters and there aren't any good dialogues. It is an empty movie trying to pretend it is ""art"". Which it is not."

tkdlifemagazine,"Jun 26, 2022",8/10,"While this movie version of the Stephen King novel is not exactly pure in its telling of the original work it is still very, very good. In fact, it created a defining and memorable look at horror that has Kubrick's stamp all over it. Jack Nicholson masterfully plays the lead role. The visuals and the cinematography are so eerie and so memorable they are haunting. Kubrick does wonders with images. This film is no exception. The music is eery. This one changed the horror film genre forever."
acidburn-10,"Oct 27, 2023",10/10,"'The Shining' is a horror masterpiece and without a doubt one of the best horror movies of all-time. Directed in meticulous style by the legendary Stanley Kubrick and adapted from the Stephen King novel of the same title resulting in a recipe for success and despite taking many liberties with the book that didn't stop this movie from becoming one of the most influential horror films ever and just look at how frequently it ranks on 'All-Time' bests lists.The Plot = A writer and recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) accepts a job as the off-season caretaker for the secluded Overlook Hotel, along with his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) for the winter. However, the hotel is haunted and soon begins to take its toll on Jack's fragile mind and influencing him into violence, while his son Danny sees horrific psychic visions of the past and future.I always remember visiting my local video shop growing up and seeking out all my fave horror gems and then one day I came across this chilling and visually spectacular supernatural ghost story and well let's just say that it further cemented my love for the horror genre and quickly became one of my all-time faves, even to this day. Terrifying, hypnotic superbly crafted this movie has a way of pulling you into its atmospheric world without you even realizing it and even from the start it instantly engages you into his complex narrative that is also a chilling account of one man's journey into madness. The movie is chock full of memorable yet scary and disturbing imagery and features perhaps the most iconic and instantly recognizable movie locations of all-time - 'The Overlook Hotel' which itself feels like a character of its own with its ominous setting and haunting presence with its labyrinth styled architecture full of foreboding menace that creates a stunning achievement in set design. The skill full direction by Stanley Kubrick is simply outstanding with some of the best camerawork ever displayed on the big screen with such amazing attention to detail.The acting performances are legendary with Jack Nicholson creating a career-defining performance as the main lead Jack Torrence as he creates such a fascinating character that without him this film wouldn't have worked as well as it did. What more can I say about his incredible performance that hasn't already been said, the guy is an iconic and one of the finest actors of all-time. Shelly Duvall delivers an interesting performance going from a supportive and unassuming wife to a downright nervous wreck, she's simply fantastic in this role. Then finally Danny Lloyd gives an impressive performance as the son and contrasts the leading roles perfectly.Overall 'The Shining' is an innovative American horror classic and is something that should be in everyone's movie collection."
Manpreet_S,"Jan 19, 2017",9/10,"I did not have very high expectations from this movie before watching it, as many popular and famous films turn out to be not as good as claimed by their fans. But Shining actually turned out to be as good as most viewers has described it. This is not one of the scariest movies but it still has very unique and eerie atmosphere which it maintains through out the whole duration of the movie. Performances of everyone are quite good, especially that of Jack Nicholson. I also have to praise the performances of two actors Joe Turkel & Philip Stone who played relatively minor roles but both stole their respective scenes through their awesome acting. Script of the film is just fantastic. There are so many powerful scenes that give a highly creepy vibe without the use of excessive blood or gore. This movie can work as both a psychological horror as well as supernatural thriller. Overall, this is a masterpiece by Stanley Kubrick. I wish he had made more horror movies.In the end, I would say, as long as you are not expecting a lot of gore, this is a must watch for every horror fan."
frank_roes,"Feb 5, 2021",10/10,Possibly the best film in cinema history thanks to the armonically flawless Kubrick's direction and the terrifically sublime Nicholson's performance.
Pantalaimon60107,"Mar 23, 2008",6/10,"At the moment, I'm reading the Stephen King novel. I'm a little past halfway through the book. I'd seen fragments of the movie before, including the end, so I thought ""What the hell? I'll watch it while it's on."" I was engrossed for the first thirty minutes, until I realised how little interest I held in the characters. Yes, Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance is amazing, and his descent into madness is one of the most interesting parts of the film, but... How could anyone sympathize with him? Or Danny? Or Wendy? In the novel, you understand what motivates each of these characters. In the film, you're just expected to accept them doing what they do as they do it. I can give Kubrick that he didn't have a whole lot of time for characterization if he wanted to add in all he did, but I'd have liked to see more, which is rare for me after watching a two and one-half hour movie.One thing the film gets completely right is the mood: along with the characters, you actually feel trapped within the Overlook. Even the establishing shots of the road leading up to the hotel are foreboding, despite how amazingly beautiful they are. Each of Jack's hallucinations (if you can call them that) are startling and, for lack of a better word, trippy. His slow descent into insanity is enthralling. Tony's ""appearances,"" though considerably disappointing when put next to the novel's version, are also horrifying.However, as I said before, the problem is characterization. I could have cared less for anyone on the screen, whether they lived or died. I can look past the lack of wasps or firehose snakes (though I would have loved to see Danny call one a ""cheap little prick"") or hedge monsters; I just want characters I can sympathize with, who I can feel something for. I congratulate the actors wholeheartedly for doing what they can with a script that seems sometimes forced, as if dialog was hastily thrown in just for the sake of it. All I want is to care what happens to the characters in the end. That's not to say I wasn't scared or tensed-up when the time came; it's just to say that, after all I've heard of the film, this is just somewhat of a disappointment.If nothing else, Nicholson's performance alone makes the film worth watching."
ebilias02,"Jun 7, 2019",6/10,"It is a great 80's movie, but for today's standards its not well made.

Can't get over the style and the colors of the movie...that sounds dumb but you will understand after watching.
the_professor530,"Jul 6, 2016",10/10,"What makes The Shining so good? Is it the acting? The music? The cinematography? The lighting? The set? All of the above. Horror can be a tough genre to judge because does a horror film have to scare you to be successful? And how do you know if you were truly scared or not? If you jump during a scene, does that make the movie scary and therefore successful? Or is the movie scary and therefore successful because you are thinking about it later and feeling a sense of uneasiness? The Shining fits more with the latter category of horror films. It's not a movie that will likely cause you to jump out of your seat with fear. It might not even cause you to lose sleep or feel a sense of fear when thinking about it later. However, it does make one think. Things like when did Jack start to go mental, did Danny have any part in that, why didn't the chef want to talk about room 237, why did the hotel staff leave a family there over the winter knowing what could possibly happen, and did Jack really exist in that photo from the 1920s? These are all unsettling questions you'll be asking yourself after watching The Shining. One of the major aspects that creates the horrific feel of this movie is without a doubt the music. During the most intense scenes, the music only adds to the hysteria unfolding. When Danny sees the girls, when Jack gets angry with Wendy for the first time, when Jack and Danny are talking about the hotel in the room, when Wendy discovers what Jack has really been typing, when Jack is breaking down the door with an axe, and of course when he's chasing Danny through the maze. The music in these scenes, reminiscent of Psycho or Jaws, is almost a character itself. The actual characters themselves were played with such conviction that sometimes it didn't really feel like they were acting. Jack Nicholson didn't really do anything different from what he normally does. He's known for being an actor slightly unhinged. I mean he played The Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 movie Batman and was a patient at mental hospital in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It was natural that he play an author losing his mind inside a haunted hotel. Shelley Duvall has a stressed out and abused look to her, as if she's constantly fretting about her husband's alcohol problem, money, and food. She's the battered housewife who is soft spoken, meek and she smokes. Danny Lloyd's face said it all. His reactions to the horrific scenes he witnessed were spectacular, and made you sense the fear he was feeling. The cinematography of this film is excellent as well. How the camera follows Danny on his tricycle as he goes through the vast hotel, following Jack through the wintery hedge mazeit was a masterful achievement."
Nicecolourr,"Sep 28, 2023",9/10,"One of the better movies I've seen recently. The combination of Kubrick and King could not have ended in anything other than a masterpiece. The film was well recorded and extremely aesthetic. Interesting story and characters. The ""victims"" characters are written in a great way, finally ""victims"" who think and do not make stupid decisions. A horror classic where you don't need junpscars to feel uneasy. Throughout the entire film, tension is built and emanates from every scene and sound. This film perfectly shows that the line between natural and real evil is thin, and the greatest monster turns out to be man. I think everyone should see this movie at least once."
gustaslietuva,"Oct 23, 2020",10/10,A movie which I've never seen before. It changed my viewpoint to the cinema overall. A masterpiece which inspired me and still keeps doing that. Also introduced me to my favorite director of all time - Stanley Kubrick.
ma-cortes,"Sep 22, 2012",8/10,"A family formed by a father (Jack Nicholson, Stanley Kubrick considered both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams for the role of Jack Torrance but decided against both of them) , mother (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd , first choice to play was Cary Guffey, because Danny was so young and since it was his first acting job, Kubrick was highly protective of the child, during the shooting of the movie, Lloyd was under the impression that the film he was making was a drama, not a horror movie) heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future. The struggling writer named Jack Torrance accepts a position as the caretaker of a great summer resort hotel called Overlook during the winter season . But then the writer becomes possessed by it .Having turned down directing a sequel to The exorcist (1973), Kubrick made his own horror film: The shining (1980) , today regarded as one of the best terror movies ever made. Stephen King (whose novel the film was based upon) reportedly didn't like Kubrick's adaptation . One of 'Stanley Kubrick''s favorite films was Eraserhead, directed by David Lynch , he cited the film as a creative influence during the making of The Shining and screened Eraserhead to put the cast and crew in the mood he wanted to achieve for the film. The director keeps things at a snail's pace , but he carries out scary moments and amazing scenes . Nicholson' s performance approaches high levels . There is a great deal of confusion regarding this film and the number of retakes of certain scenes . According to the Guinness Book of Records, the scene where Wendy is backing up the stairs swinging the baseball bat was shot 127 times, which is a record for the most takes of a single scene. The picture is shot in the Academy ratio (1.37:1) and features shots down the length of tall, parallel walls, the maze and hotel corridors in . And Steadicam operator Garrett Brown accomplished many of the ultra-low tracking corridor sequences from a wheelchair on which his invention was mounted.Excellent costume design by Milena Canonero and magnificent production design by Roy Walker , all of the interior rooms of The Overlook Hotel were filmed at Elstree Studios in England, including The Colorado Lounge, where Jack does his typing. Because of the intense heat generated from the lighting used to recreate window sunlight . To construct the interiors of the Overlook, Stanley Kubrick and his production designer, Roy Walker purposely set out to make it look like an amalgamation of bits and pieces of real hotels, rather than giving it one single design ethic. Kubrick had sent many photographers around the country photographing hotel rooms and picking his favorite. For example, the red men's bathroom was modeled on a men's room in the Biltmore Hotel in Arizona designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Colorado lounge was modeled on the lounge of the Ahwanee Hotel in the Yosemite Valley. Indeed, the chandeliers, windows and fireplace are nearly identical, so much so that people entering the Ahwahnee often ask if it's ""the Shining hotel"". Colorful and luxurious cinematography by John Scott , Kubrick's usual filmed on location in Colorado, Glacier National Park, Montana,Going-to-the-Sun Road, Glacier National Park, Montana,Saint Mary Lake, Glacier National Park, Montana, Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood, Oregon, (Overlook Hotel exterior), Yosemite National Park, California and Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England, UK . Creepy and eerie musical score , Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind wrote and performed a full electronic score for the film, but Kubrick discarded most of it and used a soundtrack of mostly classical music , only the adaptation of Hector Berlioz's ""Symphonie Fantastique"" during the opening credits, a few other brief moments survive in the final version . Rating : Above average , it is considered to be one of the history's best horror films . Despite receiving generally unfavorable reviews upon its initial release, the film is today deeply regarded In 2001, it was ranked 29th on AFI list. In 2003, Jack Torrance was named the 25th greatest villain on the Villains' AFI list. This well produced film by Jan Harlan was named the scariest film of all time by Channel 4 in 2003, and Total Film had it as the 5th greatest horror film in 2004. The motion picture will appeal to Jack Nicholson fans and Stanley Kubrick buffs ."
krmflam,"Aug 18, 2025",6/10,"This film represents a deliberate and exhaustive attempt to amplify every conceivable element of fear. The director appears to have systematically assembled a full spectrum of unsettling components-disturbing faces, psychological isolation, spectral figures, oppressive settings, and erratic behavior. While ambitious, this accumulation occasionally results in scenes that feel overly imaginative, unrealistic, or predictable, echoing common traits of its cinematic era.The pervasive use of dark aesthetics contributes to a distinctive atmosphere, heightening emotional tension. However, this visual intensity sometimes substitutes for genuine narrative innovation. The sound design, in particular, pushes boundaries: melancholic tones, anxiety-inducing layers, and prolonged auditory saturation dominate the experience. Though immersive, this sonic extremity can become overwhelming for the viewer.When measured against contemporary cinematic standards, the film reveals certain limitations in subtlety and formal renewal. Nonetheless, it retains historical and aesthetic significance that partly explains its enduring critical acclaim."
Hitchcoc,"Apr 19, 2006",9/10,"I always try hard not to compare media. Unfortunately, I had read the King novel just before seeing the movie. There are plot elements that could have been included that would have made this a much better movie. One of the things is ""the shining"" itself, the supernatural abilities of the young boy. The character of Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) is used up with virtually no effect on the plot. I don't know why King allowed that to happen, because it weakens so badly the chance of the victims to escape. The topiary could have been used to a better advantage as well. The way things are, it is too one sided. That being said, I think the Nicholson role is awesome. This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It has enough shadows and manipulation of the supernatural to really be frightening. I loved when Jack was telling the man who hires him what a great opportunity this was for him to work. He's about as wolfy and sly as he can be. Of course, when he finally gets there, the hotel takes over and he begins to become that wolf. One of the most terrifying moments in all of film is when Shelly Duvall , the wife, picks up all the pages he has typed and they are just gibberish. Kubrick plays with us in grand style. I saw the movie a few years after my first viewing, and because the book was behind me, I enjoyed it a great deal more, even though I knew the events unfolding. Kubrick seldom disappoints and this is no exception."
glenaobrien,"Feb 23, 2024",10/10,"The Shining is a cinematic masterpiece on every level. There isn't a single wasted line or wasted shot and the set design is incredible in its symmetry. It's almost unbelievable that the entirely convincing hotel interiors were built on sound stages in England and not in an actual historic hotel in Colorado. Jack Nicholson gives an absolute powerhouse of a performance as Jack Torrance and Shelley Duval, as his wife Wendy, does 'terrified face' better than anyone has ever done. Child actor Danny Lloyd (as his namesake Danny) shows an acting ability well beyond his years. Scatman Crothers gives great support as the concerned but doomed Dick Halloran.Kubrick's mastery of the art of cinema is on display in every frame. There is a scene where Jack first begins to unravel. He is working in his cavernous study and we see him from behind. Everything is perfectly symmetrical, except Jack who is seated at his typewriter just slightly off centre. Maybe it's accidental but somehow I doubt it. Kubrick is signalling that the wheels are about to come off Jack's mental state as he begins to give in to the murderous spirit that haunts the Overlook Hotel.Only on this latest watch did the degree of misogyny and gaslighting really come through for me. Jack blames Wendy for his own lack of creative output. Everything is her fault and the descent into violence and attempted murder is tragically an all-too-real one for so many abused women. There really ought to be a trigger warning for any victim of domestic violence. The horror here goes well beyond a cinematic genre to the actual experience of far too many women and children at the hands of violent men. Ironically, Kubrick was one of them as he tormented Shelley Duvall to get the terrified performance he needed to perfect his art.There are so many iconic visual moments in this film that have entered into pop culture to the extent that it's hard to recapture what their original impact must have been like - the ghostly twins, the woman in the bathtub, the cascading blood from the elevator doors, Danny's wild ride on his tricycle through the haunted hallways, and of course, 'Here's Johnny!' as the axe comes through the bathroom door. They have all entered the lexicon of the horror genre and deservedly so. In the final shot, are we to understand that Jack has always been the murderous spirit that haunts the Overlook or is it simply that evil is never short of receptive hosts ready to surrender themselves to their most malicious impulses?Stephen King is famous for letting anyone and everyone adapt his novels, selling the rights to do so for as little as a dollar. It's a risky business, evidenced by the number of truly awful Stephen King adaptations that have made it onto the screen. In The Shining however, it pays off wonderfully, in possibly the finest adaptation of any of his novels."
baileycrawly,"Dec 4, 2019",8/10,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan, first and foremost. I've been reading his books for most of my life now, and I have very fond memories of the time I spent reading most of his books.
Except The Shining. The Shining, although far from being one of his longer works, was so full of unnecessary fluff that I had an extremely difficult time getting through it at all.Kubrick took the novel's best points, added some of his own trademark storytelling flare and made a product that, while vastly different than the book, is a product that still very much satisfies horror fans around the world. And, as a Stephen King fan, I wholeheartedly approve of the changes that Kubrick made to the work.This film, unlike its novel, is a true psychological thriller. It's an examination into the gradual mental deterioration of an individual stuck in an isolated area with only his wife and kid to keep him company... or so it appears at first glance.
There was a lot of tension behind the scenes, particularly between Shelley Duvall (Wendy Torrence) and Stanley Kubrick, but every bit of hard work and anguish that went into the project wielded one of horror's all-time greatest films that will be watched, enjoyed and studied years into the future.
And, in true Kubrick style, there are always some questions left unanswered. It's not for the purpose of setting up a sequel; it's done because i truly believe Stanley wanted his audiences to be thinking all the time. This movie is a major success in that department as well."
ccthemovieman-1,"Feb 17, 2008",9/10,"When this came out on DVD, I gave it another shot, after not being too impressed with the VHS the first time. Wow, what a difference! Now, it's on Blu-Ray and it's really fantastic - the best yet! This is a ""must see"" in high-def.I found it to be very entertaining, very suspenseful and a visual treat. Those visuals were so good that I didn't mind the slow pace. Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role. Shelley Duvall was fascinating with her ""Olive Oyl"" face, smile and soft voice. She got panned by a lot of people, and that was unfair. She's fine. The kid (Danny Lloyd) was good, too, as were the supporting players.The film is typical (director Stanley) Kubrick weirdness but not as weird as some of his other stuff. The only things I personally didn't care for were two blasphemous outbursts by Nicholson and a general unpleasant feeling seeing the innocent Duvall and son terrorized near the end. I did think, story-wise, that Nicholson's character went ""crazy"" a bit too fast. That could have been drawn out more....but I'm not complaining because I genuinely am fascinated with this film."
Michael_Elliott,"Jul 13, 2018",N/A,"The Shining (1980) ****Stanley Kubrick's horror masterpiece has writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) taking his wife (Shelley Duvall) and young son (Danny Lloyd) to a mountaintop hotel where they are going to take care of it for the winter. Before long Jack begins seeing things that may or may not be real.To me THE SHINING is a film that I really didn't care too much for the first time I saw it. In fact, it took several viewings before I'd even call the film good. It took several more for me to love the film and now I'm at the point where I call it one of the greatest movies ever made. I could honestly write thousands of paragraphs about the greatness of this film but I think theories on its meaning and various ideas are already all over the place.For my money what's so amazing about this movie is the sheer terror and atmosphere that Kubrick creates. The entire movie has a very claustrophobic feel to it and no matter how many times you watch it you can sink back into it as if it was your first time seeing it. You may know the story, the twists and what happens but no matter how many times you see it you always feel as if you're seeing something for the first time. That's a huge compliment and I think that's the reason Kubrick's films always work the more times you watch them.I think the film manages to be one of the scariest pictures ever made and especially the scenes with Danny riding around on his bike and running into the twin girls. The creepiness of what Jack finds in one of the rooms is just as good. The various ghostly images that are seen throughout the picture are incredibly effective. Even more impressive is that Kubrick has made a horror film that takes place during the day, in the light and doesn't try to use darkness to build up any horror.Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time and for years people debated his performance here. Many found it to be over-the-top and I used to be one of them but over time I've come to realize that the performance is just flawless. Does it make sense all of the time? No but neither does the story and the two work perfectly together because you mind can go into overdrive trying to find out why things are happening. Duvall, Lloyd, Joe Turkel, Barry Nelson and Scatman Crothers are all very good as well.THE SHINING isn't the easiest movie to watch and there's no question that you must pay attention to it throughout the long running time. With that said, to me it's one of the greatest films ever made and it's one that continues to get richer and better no matter how many times you see it."
riddhimaakaritu,"Aug 5, 2020",6/10,"Really liked the direction, so many good shots. Great performance by whole cast.But the story doesn't feel complete-ish even with such a long runtime. Or maybe I didn't get all the references.And if you want to watch a scary/horror film, then this is not the one. At least for me it was only a thriller kind of film not scary one - as I watched it when I was home alone (like most other movies) without getting scared even once."
labemaster1,"Feb 10, 2007",10/10,"That's right. The movie is better than the book. Don't get me wrong, I love the book. But the movie is just so much better. This film has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I haven't seen Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book. But I already talked about those in my comment on the mini series. But, I missed a few. The film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot. And the REDRUM scenes are creepier than those in the book. So if you're looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But count on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks"
littleredfox-73161,"Nov 12, 2022",7/10,"This is definitely one of the classics. Although, me being born in the early 2000's, didn't really understand how this could be considered horror. It's definitely a psychological thriller. There's no jump scares throughout the movie which I appreciate. The novel I find is a bit more up the horror alley but this is still a very well done adaption. The cast couldn't have been any more perfect.The suspense in the movie is astronomical. And the music thats in said scenes just make the build up even better. Stephen King's books are always some of my favourites. While the movie was slightly disappointing, I would definitely watch again."
emasterslake,"May 2, 2006",9/10,"I'm not a Horror nut.But, ""The Shining"" is one of the few Horror films that I did enjoy watching.Not only is it a Kubrick(2001 and Clockwork Orange)Movie, but it's also one of Jack Nicholsen's best leading role's I've seen yet.The story is about a teacher who's now a writer named Jack. He applied to be the Groundskeeper for a Hotel Resort in the mountains during the Winter. They close the Hotel during the Winter because the place would be snowed in and be difficult for the cars to get out. It would cost to remove the snow all the time so closing the Hotel for the Season is cheaper.Jack got the Job and brings his family along to stay there for the season. Jack feels very honored to get a job like this. His wife is proud of him too. And his son, Danny is looking forward in seeing the place.Danny has a split personality where he has a bitter half named Tonny who live in his mouth. And has some physic powers too. This freaked Danny's mom a bit but a Doctor said it's nothing too serious.When they made to the Hotel they get a tour from the Hedge mazed to the lobby and to the Kitchen. This Hotel however is built over an Indian burial ground. Strange things happen in this type of place. Being trapped in a place like this all winter can make a kind man become a serial killer.I never read the book but I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's one of the few Horror/Thriller movies I consider ""cool"". Has some great moments, great dialog, and a cool ending. It's something I can see again and again.I recommend it to all the Kubrick, Nicholsen, and Stephen King Fans."
danielmullin,"Nov 20, 2020",10/10,Cmon man this a dang masterpiece bruh. The homie Kubrick supplying the absolute goods with this one for sure. Just the hotel gets me rock by itself. Horror movies usually cheeks on da low but this one of the best movies of all time NO CAP.
T-Dawg210,"Dec 9, 2015",10/10,"The movie The Shining is a psychological horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick. This movie is definitely one of the most scariest horror movies of all times! The eerie music always made me tense during the film. Nowadays, there are some good horror movies, but most of them are jump scares and the chills don't last that long. However, this movie gave me so much chills and freaked me out throughout the movie and even after the movie!Jack Nicholson did a great job acting as Jack Torrace and I was especially impressed with Kubrick's determination. Apparently, he made Jack Nicholson do method acting which was why his acting was outstanding! Another interesting fact was that the kid didn't know that this was a horror movie until he was 17! Finally, there was this one scene where an elevator door opened and blood flooded the entire set. And according to an article from MoviePilot, that blood was actually real blood and it took 6 months to completely clean up the set!Overall, this movie was eerie and I recommend this movie for people who are obsessed with horror.96/100"
Bored_Dragon,"Dec 13, 2016",10/10,"I never paid too much attention to directors and in the most of the movies I saw I was unable to recognize them. Besides Lynch and Jarmusch, Kubrick is one of the few that I could never mistake for someone else. All of his movies, however different their stories might be, share that insane atmosphere that simply screams Kubrick. Frames, angles, sound and his particular kind of creepy unmistakably betray him. While watching any of his movies I have flashes from his other movies. Although their plots are not related, this movie reminds me of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and bit of ""Clockwork Orange"", and with those two makes the holy trinity of Stanley Kubrick's heritage. In my opinion, one of the best movies of all time.10/10"
popa-35897,"Dec 7, 2022",9/10,"This movie has lived up to its name and I regret not watching it earlier, but I'm also thankful because I appreciate it better than I would have done if younger. I didn't expect to recognise many iconic scenes from this movie alone. At first I thought 'how bad could it get', but in each scene I noticed how Jack's eyes were glimmering more and more with insanity, and honestly it was so thrilling to watch. I think that's mainly thanks to him isolating from his family, claiming he has to work and so on.Danny is so weird and I don't understand his clairvoyance (?), where he got it and stuff, but it was terrifying watching this child having visions of blood and death, being chased by his own father with an axe, being attacked and etc.I honestly wished the chef had lived, it's crazy how he'd travel through harsh winter just to save them. I was hoping they'd all make it."
tedg,"Nov 25, 2000",N/A,"This movie has not aged well. Kubrick uses a very old-fashioned camera stance and the dialog is often stagey back-and-forth medium head shots.Scatman is apt, but Kubrick asks Jack to be more external, and that's dangerous with his unchecked exuberance. Duvall needs pumping up.The problem is an old one, and one Kubrick knows. Successful storytelling is bound by its media, so a successful print story can be only a starting point for cinematic narrative. He clearly believes it best when a character or device is external, like Hal, the spirit here, or Hitchcock's mcguffin. His handling of the unseen contrasted with and contained in huge interiors is his strategy and it may have worked better when the film was new. But its just too tame now.What's very nice is the selfreference. It is another piece of an obsessed storytelling about an obsessed writer, engaged in creating a story.I gave this film extra points because it tried to use architecture well. But it did a poor job. Part of this is the unimaginative camera eye. But even a better eye couldn't have exploited the set well. If you want the set to be a character, you need to give it soul, and incorporate the viewer's eye into the form. Welles knew how. Why didn't Kubrick?"
guptarhythm-18382,"Jan 15, 2022",6/10,This Movie was just not my taste. It could not scare me enough. A movie perhaps if viewed by a more creative mided person could be better. Definitely it had its scary moments but was just not enough.I ecen rewatched it but still meh.
NokotaMustang,"Oct 7, 2020",10/10,"There is no doubt that Stanley Kubrick was one of the best directors out there, but he was more than that. As an auteur he wrote and created his masterpieces . The shining is a fantastic example of what he achieved, by taking an alright book by Stephen King and turning it into the canonical version of the story... by sheer brilliance and genius I would add.King claimed he hated this movie after the release... I think he was hurt and jealous. Kubrick wrote a better story than he did. In any case, the movie 'Dr. Sleep' that came out last year was set as a sequel to Kubricks 'The Shining', and it was a pretty good follow up I must add. This film is one of my favourite of Kubrick's works, and it got a 10/10 from me as the 6th on my list out of only 8 items.Now then, what can be said that hasn't already? Well I can start with how this film makes me feel. Much like Jaws, this film terrifies me; even more so due to the topic and ghost story aspect of the material. This is one that haunts my thoughts, as it is set up eerily and strange right from the beginning. It has topics of child abuse, ghosts that eat your energy and take the form of the dead, or rooms and buildings. The backdrop sets the hotel on an Indian burial ground, an eerie place to begin with, but even though the movie is created to show the blood of the past, or sins of the founding peoples of the USA, Kubrick leads you to far worse and creepier things.The themes have been explored, and up to 40 years later some people have figured out only some of what Kubrick had encoded into this masterpiece. Even the editing, done over the 5 year production, has been created in such a way that big plot events happen in mirror timecode to each other. It is such a strange thing to see that someone decoded that, but it is elegant and frightening all the same. This genius thought about his imagery of 'mirrors', both physical and literal in the scenes; to mirrors of the physical world and the spiritual world. His mirrors also cross from the cinematic world to the real world as we as the viewers peer into his creation.So many strange things happen in the background of this film, it creeps me out to this day. The chairs that keep moving around, and disappearing and reappearing for one. Chairs in Kubrick's version seem to represent the spirits, or those watching us. They always seem to face the characters; and in the scene with the dead girls, he had the two chairs knocked over in the blood to represent the girls perhaps? Or to link us to the ghosts of the girls? Who knows, but it creeps me the hell out. The TV's that have no power cords, as if powered or activated by Danny's shining, or that the hotel is connected to him.The encoded message that Room 237 is the moon at 237,000 miles away, and that it is filled with horrors and lies is fascinating one; as Danny wearing the rocket ship launches and heads over to the room of horror.Anyway, all this stuff adds to the visual feast of this film. The basic plot itself is a good horror, the acting is amazing. Kubrick was a talented man, and many have a lot to owe him and his works. The Shining represents so many things and 'Dr. Sleep' shows how much love and adoration people have for what Kubrick had created from King's novel."
lomaran-1,"Sep 2, 2013",7/10,"I have seen this movie SO many times (prior to reading the book) and it never fails to scare me each and every time. Jack Nicholson, of course, was born for the part of the lead male but I have found that the Jack of the movie is not necessarily the Jack of the book. On its own, the movie is one of the best in its genre but if you have never read the book, do yourself a favor and do so. Having never read a King novel before, I was impressed. The book was excellent. The depth of characters is so vastly different from those depicted in the film. You actually like the Jack of the book! You 'feel' for him. You understand him. Some of the action of the story too has been altered in the film, and in my opinion, not for the better. I plan to watch Stephen King's The Shining now as I understand it more closely resembles his original story and is more in line with what the author wanted the Stanley Kubrick film to be. The real reason for Kubrick's reinterpretation can be researched, as it too is an interesting read."
preppy-3,"Sep 17, 2004",1/10,"Lousy adaptation of Stephen King's great novel. It's about a family watching over a huge hotel (the Overlook) which is located in the mountains in Colorado during the winter. They're basically isolated out there--miles and miles away from anyone. Also seems the hotel is haunted and starts to take possession of the father (Jack Nicholson). Then the snowstorms hit--they're completely snowed in and the mother (Shelley Duvall) and little son (Danny Lloyd) are at the mercy of the axe-wielding father...The novel was VERY scary and well-done--Kubrick single-handedly trashes the entire book. Kubrick WAS a great director but he just didn't know how to do a straight-forward horror film. He acts like this is an important film--he takes it WAY too seriously. He makes very ill-conceived changes from the book (one character is brutally killed, but he was alive and well at the end of the book, and where are the hedge animals?) and has Nicholson's character act so weird from the get go that we don't really notice any change when he goes crazy. Nicholson IS good however but Duvall is annoying and Lloyd was basically not accomplished enough to pull off his role (but he WAS a young kid). Scatman Crothers is good but he's not in the film enough to really help. Also the film isn't scary ONCE. Kubrick shows all his purported ""shocking"" moments with loud, annoying music--problem is nothing he shows us is scary. Also the ending is REALLY stupid and throws in a reincarnation angle that comes out of NOWHERE (and isn't in the book).My main issues with this is that it isn't scary, is WAY too long and way too serious. Even King himself hated this. But there are some people who think everything Kubrick did was fantastic and even defend this. I hated it in 1980...I still hate it now. I give it a 1."

mehitable_brauner,"Sep 23, 2025",9/10,"The Shining isn't just eerie-it's elegant in its unraveling. This is a film that doesn't scream at you; it hums with dread, like a hallway you shouldn't walk down but do anyway. It's not about jump scares-it's about slow, psychological erosion. The kind that creeps, not crashes.Visually, it's a masterclass in discomfort. The symmetry, the silence, the snow-it all conspires to make you feel watched, even when nothing's happening. And that's the trick: The Shining doesn't rely on chaos. It relies on atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a butter knife-and still not reach the bottom.The performances are sharp, unsettling, and just unhinged enough to make you wonder if the real horror is the setting or the psyche. It's a film that asks you to sit with unease, not solve it. And if you're looking for tidy answers, this isn't your ride.Final thought:
The Shining is less ""boo!"" and more ""what is happening to me?"" It's a slow burn with a cold stare-and if you like your horror with a side of aesthetic menace and psychological spirals, this one's got the keys to the Overlook."

HotTakesAndMilkshakes,"Nov 14, 2021",8/10,"Judging by the title you can say I am a lame guy but you know what is NOT lame ? The Shining 1980
I just had the opportunity to watch it for the first time in my life. Right away I can tell you that this movie truly stands the test of time !It is a suspensful movie that keeps you on the edge the whole time and the backround music just adds even more to that. I swear , sometimes , the music is scarier than the actual scene.Jack Nicholson absolutely steals the show with his performance here. He can just make that creepy look that gives me chills.I honestly feel sorry for Shelley Duvall for having to do so many takes of one scene ( 124 takes I believe ) The performance was absolute masterpiece but it was still brutal. Even the kid did a pretty decent job so overall the acting is satisfying.I also appreciate the fact that everyone is quite smart in this movie. That really makes it stand out from the crappy horror movies we have today so this one did feel like a refreshing watch.Camera work and little details that I tend to pick up made this movie an enjoyable watch. However I can't say that it was all flawless.I don't agree that this is ""The scariest horror movie"" or even in the top 20. The movie is overall creepy and sometimes scary but everything else is just overrating the movie.I like how everything was made , I appreciate Kubricks vision and camera works. The acting and plot made this movie suspensfull enough for me but in my opinion I am probably not gonna rewatch this movie a lot.PlatinumanYT 8/10."

There is absolutely no one that could have done it better. A NO ONE could ever be compared to him. His obsession for details is out of this world.

gregorycanfield,"Oct 27, 2021",9/10,"I have never understood why the film critics gave this movie mediocre reviews. In cinema history, there have been only a handful of great horror movies. The Shining is definitely one of the greatest. Nicholson gave this role his personal touch. He is excellent as a man who enters a hotel, and rapidly starts to lose his mind. Shelley Duvall is good as Mrs. Torrance. However, I've never understood the stupid way she dressed here. Danny Lloyd was effective as the son, especially when he says ""Redrum"" about fifty times. Perhaps intentionally, the movie never makes it clear as to exactly what ""happens"" within the hotel. The hotel seems to be possessed by ""dead spirits"" that gradually take control of the occupants. My favorite scene is when Nicholson kisses the naked lady in room 237. I love when he realizes that she is really a deformed corpse, and she starts laughing like a maniac. Another great scene is the one referred to in my heading. The movie, to its credit, is alternately subtle and ""off the wall."" This is a great American horror film. What other Nicholson movie could have given him the opportunity to say ""Here's Johnny""?!"
Film Dog,"Apr 18, 1999",N/A,"I saw this film in a theater then it was released, and it was one of my more memorable movie experiences.  A rather longish movie, I thought it was moving a bit slow.  Watchable, interesting, but not very scary.  But, without actually realizing it, the tension was slowly building, building, building.  Why do I say this?  Because with about a half hour left of the movie, I suddenly realized I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. I don't think this has ever happened to me before or since, with the possible exception of ""The Exorcist"" or ""The Omen"".  That, my friends, is a sign of a very good film indeed:  it accomplished what it set out to accomplish, which was to jangle thoroughly jangle the viewer's nerves."
simpeton,"Apr 7, 2003",1/10,"AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Lots of brain dead Kubrick-heads will try to tell you that this is the best Horror Movie ever simply because Kubrick made it.  This is a FALSEHOOD.First off, it's not a Horror Movie.  You have to at least try to be scary to be a Horror Movie.  This film never even makes an effort in that regard.Second off, it's not good.  Even if you try to watch it as just a ""suspense movie"" and forget about all this Horror which you are supposed to be exposed thru all throughout this movie, it's still just not a good movie.  There is no plot to speak of.  The Wife and Son, and the Hotel for that matter, who should ALL be treated as equal characters to Jack (and in the case of Danny and the Hotel, MORE important) are all pushed to the side so that we can constantly be treated to scene after scene of Jack Nicholson completely botching every aspect of his character.  How the man ever had a career, much less a successful one, after this travesty is beyond me.Do yourself a favor and try to catch the ABC TV Miniseries version.  Stephen King actually oversaw that one to make sure it came out right.  And it did."
JGKsPSX,"Aug 7, 1998",10/10,"Although it is sometimes considered to be a movie about a haunted hotel; I believe it to be a documentation of the descent of a man and his family into madness. In this it differs from the Steven King novel from which it takes the name, the characters, and the location. Although this has offended many King fans, I, for one, love both, though for different reasons.If you love the book, keep an open mind; it's a tale of madness, not haunting, but it's still quite scary, and incredibly intense."
fh147,"Oct 5, 2025",8/10,"The Shining Is a movie where a father cannot stop making funny faces, and his child has gotten the same illness as his dad, funny faces syndrome.The movie truly is a marvel to watch, it's just so wall directed and has a pacing to it, That is not slow or feel sluggish at all. With lots of long takes, that adds a real caliber of tension to the scenes.Jack Nicholson is the star of the Show, he adds a real feeling of danger to his scenes, even if it's almost become comical, how over the top his acting and facial expressions becomes.The hotel design and music really goes up in a higher unit, to make everything extremely creepy.My only real criticism of the movie would be that the family feels too cold. It's hard to believe there was any love to be had in the relationship.Legendary horror, film that will be remembered long after my death, would recommend."
metalstreet,"Sep 5, 2024",9/10,"Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" stands out for its exceptional cinematography, which plays a crucial role in creating the film's eerie atmosphere. John Alcott, the director of photography, uses innovative techniques to immerse viewers in a world of psychological tension.The film opens with breathtaking aerial shots that set an ominous tone, showcasing the isolation of the Torrance family as they approach the Overlook Hotel. This use of wide, sweeping shots establishes a sense of vulnerability and foreboding right from the start.Inside the hotel, the use of the Steadicam is revolutionary. The smooth, continuous tracking shots, especially those following Danny on his tricycle, create a sense of unease and disorientation. This technique pulls the audience into the hotel's maze-like corridors, amplifying the feeling of being trapped in a supernatural labyrinth.Kubrick's framing is precise and deliberate, often employing symmetry to create an unsettling visual experience. Characters are frequently centered within vast, imposing spaces, highlighting the oppressive nature of the hotel. This meticulous composition contrasts with the unfolding psychological chaos, enhancing the film's tension.Lighting is expertly used to heighten the sense of dread. The interplay between natural and artificial light creates dramatic contrasts and shadows, adding depth to the film's ominous mood. Iconic scenes, such as the torrent of blood from the elevator, are visually striking, utilizing bold colors and surreal imagery to leave a lasting impression.Overall, the cinematography in ""The Shining"" transforms the Overlook Hotel into a haunting presence. Through careful visual techniques, Kubrick and Alcott craft a chilling atmosphere that elevates the psychological horror, making the film a captivating and enduring piece of cinema."
kikilangmore319,"Mar 4, 2022",10/10,"This is a near perfect horror film. The music, cinematography, intensity, all combine so well to create a masterful film in a genre that's so difficult to do well.I don't even need to say anything for the performances, they speak for themselves.Watch this, soon."
ShootingStar82,"Nov 2, 2024",8/10,"There's a lot to love about The Shining. The setting is stunning: a hotel high in the Colorado mountains, with decadent rooms and a wondrous hedge maze. The film is beautifully shot, the scenes with the long corridors are memorable, and Kubrick clever use of different camera angles brings the action to life. The two leads are also great; a crazed Jack Nicholson is menacing as the teacher / struggling writer, and the wide-eyed Shelley Duvall plays the not-quite hopeless victim to perfection.So where does it fall short? Firstly, the story is weak. There are too many questions asked and not enough answers. Secondly, I found it difficult to care about any of the characters, they had little backstory and were one-dimensional. Thirdly, for a horror film I never found myself either scared or on the edge of my seat.Overall, I think the good far outweighs the bad and it's a film all move fans should watch at least once, but for me it stops just short of being a true classic."
s_a_n_d_w_i_c_h_e_s,"Jan 13, 2008",N/A,These writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish.I found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. If I owned a video store I'd put it in the BORING section. This film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.This film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little kid does it too. Round and round he goes and he never stops. What's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish.
ceoflocka,"Apr 22, 2016",7/10,"The Shining The Shining The Shining ....... As at today, one of the highest rated films on IMDb. But honestly i'm surprised. The background music made it terrifying, but often not leading to anything.The movie takes far to long to get going. While there are definitely some great moments and the final minutes are epic, this isn't the best drama or horror I've seen. I noticed that only people who were watched this at 1980 rate it so highly. Honestly it's good, but not the best, or even one of the best ever. I would advice you to watch it though, it is entertaining. Jack Nicholson's performance is totally extraordinary.In Summary, nice movie.......... period."
Xarx117,"Jun 3, 2022",10/10,"This is certainly one of the most well made movies of all time. The subtle details all present trough almost every scene. The camera shots are extremly stunning, from the very first shot of the movie to the very last one. There are so many different elements that support different theory about the real meaning of the film that you can believe any of these explenaitions. The film is thematicly intense and scary at points. Kubrick also understand that you dont need to kill a lot of people for the film to be scary. The real reason why its scary is because of the tension built troughout the movie. The plot developement, the pacing, the soundtrack and all the other elements of the film were perfect. We also have to talk about the acting. Jack Nicholson gave one of top 10 acting performances of all time, from his facial expressions to his incredible quotes he was stunning! Shelley Duvall disapeared behind her character, she played it perfectly. Danny Lloyd! He gave THE BEST child actor performance of all time! Has much has adult actors are really good, he gave probably a top 50 acting performances regardless of the age! Stanley Kubrick always made masterpieces, and this movie is not the exception. I would even say its top 10 movies of all time."
sivadparks-89786,"Apr 2, 2016",7/10,"What is horror? When you're watching a movie you are not at physical risk. Surprise. The two ways you create horror is by putting in danger characters you care about or planting a story that you feel could happen to you. For me this did neither. The first half was absolutely terrifying. The camera work, creepy music and use of desolate rooms was very effective. Seeing Jack turn crazy is horrifying, especially since Jack Nicholson does creepy faces better than anyone. The problem is, they introduce the shining which is essentially paranormal and very poorly explained, two things that don't bode well. At first, the visions are creepy but as the movie progresses they just seem more and more ridiculous, particularly since they can actually move things. Again, the reason why isn't explained at all making this frustrating to watch if you haven't read the book. A lot of these are introduced but have no closure so I can't help but wonder why were they in there? Towards the end, Jack is hunting his son, which was terrifying, but then it cuts to Wendy seeing visions that were so cartoonish I laughed. Way to kill the suspense. there are three characters in this movie and the only one I cared about is the villain. Wendy and Danny were loathsome so at times I was rooting for Jack which should not be the goal of a horror movie. Also, Jack is constantly complaining about how much he works but we never see him work once. Not only does this devalue the character's arc but it also doesn't make sense. He was given several tasks that he never does but there is no apparent effect on the building which raises the question: Why is he needed there in the first place? Ultimately, this movie succeeded at being creepy for the majority of the movie, but it makes hardly any sense and several scenes kill the tension."
petibozsoky,"Jun 23, 2023",4/10,"I get it that a lot of people love this movie, but seriously it was too long, like twice as long as it should've been. It definitely wasn't the scariest or the best horror movie. The acting was pretty good, just as the story, but for me that's all the positives. For me personally needed like almost 2 days to finish, because of it's high dryness. So overall only watch this movie, if you like boring or not that intense movies, but I think it has a pretty low chance. I gave it only 4 out of 10, but only because I'm in a kinda good mood.To be honest, I don't understand the 10 out of 10 reviews, even tho there is a lot of them."
anthonylvasquez-99768,"Jun 7, 2021",10/10,"Filmed masterfully but the late great Stanley Kubrick. It has everything you could ask for in a good horror film, suspension, drama, isolation, scary imagery, creepy but beautiful music, Great character's, and a good story. The movie's story is really sold by the actors the stand out being Little Danny Lloyd and Shelley Duvall, jack Nicholson is also very good in his role as Jack Torrance but lets be honest we all know that already, in conclusion i believe that the Shining is up there with one of the very best films of all time and would recommend this film to anybody looking for a great film to watch."
Kchlemplunk,"Apr 27, 2023",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick one of the greatest directors to have existed in our history. This movie is and will stay as one of the greatest movies in history.Easily one of the biggest horror movies of all time, it's even on the library of congress. I really can't say anything new about this movie. It's probably one of the most dissected and analyzed films.The cinematography is absolutely phenomenal, when the movie begins with the gliding shots of Montana's glacier national park it is very beautiful while the shining's main theme plays, the tune is very creepy and memorable really great music composed by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Alkyne.The acting is also top tier, even though I heard that in the start the movie wasn't very popular among the critics being called a movie with the worst actor/director, at the least over the time it has been reevaluated as how it should be, a horror icon. The performance really does sell how terrifying the hotel is, even Duvall's acting was top notch in making Jack a scary person also who couldn't forget about little Danny for a kid he really did a good job."
thesourkaiser,"Jul 2, 2021",10/10,"Simply the weirdest, most disturbing movie i´ve ever seen."
TrulyOnFilm,"Dec 15, 2025",8/10,"The Shining is one of those movies that I've liked more each time I've watched it, even if it still doesn't fully click with me the way it does for some people. The first time I saw it I honestly found it pretty slow. The second time I started to appreciate it more, and on the third watch I definitely enjoyed it, but it still sits around a solid eight out of ten for me.The setting and atmosphere are easily the best parts. The Overlook Hotel is such an iconic location and the isolation is done incredibly well. Even when nothing is really happening, the movie still feels uncomfortable just because of where it's set. Kubrick really knows how to let the space do the work.Jack Nicholson is great as he slowly unravels, going from a bit off to completely unhinged, and Shelley Duvall deserves way more credit than she gets. Her performance feels genuinely exhausting and stressful to watch in the best way. The score and the long shots add to that hypnotic feeling, even if the pacing drags at times.I completely get why this is considered a classic and why it's had such a huge influence on horror. It's full of iconic moments and it definitely sticks with you, even if it's not one of my absolute favourites."
lucaavram-87129,"Jan 6, 2025",10/10,"This movie is honestly a masterpiece. The Shining isn't just scary-it's the kind of creepy that sticks with you long after you've finished watching. Jack Nicholson absolutely nails his role as Jack Torrance, slowly losing his mind in the most terrifying way possible. Every scene feels tense, and you're constantly on edge, waiting for something to happen.The Overlook Hotel is a character in itself, with its eerie halls and creepy vibe that makes you feel like you're trapped there too. And those iconic moments-the twins in the hallway, ""Here's Johnny!""-are unforgettable.What I love most is how it gets under your skin without relying on cheap jump scares. It's psychological, disturbing, and keeps you thinking. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on one of the best horror movies ever made."
fedor8,"Jan 1, 2007",N/A,"Visually stunning, with a degree of eeriness only Kubrick and very few others could have achieved; some of the scenes are unsurpassed in this respect. Ghost stories are notoriously unscary, so hats off to Kubrick for making all the right choices to elevate this trite genre to very lofty heights.The cinematography is immaculate. Kubrick even makes the toilet look good. OK, bathroom... whatever.Nicholson is incredible and provides much of the entertainment. What he did here isn't overacting: it's precisely what the film and story required. (He has been criticized for his performance here by a small and very clueless group of detractors - who probably consider Rob Zombie the greatest ever film-maker.) After all, he is going insane, right? Should this kind of psycho-lunacy be underplayed? Just as with ""A Clockwork Orange"", Kubrick picked literally THE best actor for the job. Both movies heavily relied on the main-character casting for the movies to reach their full potential.Shelley Duvall is excellent, too, and well-cast. The poor thing really struggled during the filming; Kubrick was merciless toward her. Considering the shoot lasted a whopping 11 months, this is no minor thing.I can't believe they re-did this though; what's the point? Re-doing TS is like sending 23 year-old Helen Mirren to a plastic surgeon and breast-implants doctor. What's there to improve?That vastly overrated bumpkin Stephen King always hated the fact that Kubrick had his flawed original story heavily re-written, and he despised Kubrick for it. The ego on that man! ""How dare he re-write MY words??? They are MY words, the great Stephen King! Blasphemy!"" (This is how I picture an egomaniac hack writer reacting to someone ""messing"" with his garbage.)Stevie should be forever flattered that the best director of all time decided to pick up one of his crummy books and make a movie out of it. In fact, this guy had actually dared to publicly criticized Kubrick's adaptation of his irrelevant little novelette, thereby exposing his ignorance to all. Stephen King criticizing Kubrick is like a guy in a wheelchair criticizing his boxing coach for not making him the WBA heavy-weight champion of the world (with the difference that Kubrick made something great out of ""Shining""). King criticizing Kubrick is like an eight year-old Flat Earth Society member telling Einstein that his theories are stupid. King criticizing Kubrick is like Michael Moore criticizing old BBC nature documentaries for being unrealistic and staged. King criticizing Kubrick is one of the biggest jokes in the history of mankind. If you still want to watch the remake, your problem. There are great Youtube clips mocking it: I recommend those instead.Excellent soundtrack, similar to that of ""2001"". I wouldn't listen to it separate from the movie though...I strongly suggest you find the 140-minute version."
scbohnen,"Oct 2, 2020",10/10,The first Epic Horror Movie! Featuring the best actor of all time - Jack Nicholson!
freezerguy006,"Apr 7, 2001",6/10,"I saw the film about a year ago and thought that it was boring, plot-less and badly acted. I recently bought the novel to see who was to blame, Stanley Kubrick or Stephen King. Before I had gotten a quarter of the way through the book I had the answer, Stanley Kubrick. After reading the entire book I see that the movie was even more lacking in plot, acting and scare factor than I had thought. The first half of the book is more entertaining than the entire movie in my opinion."
kaaffilm,"Mar 28, 2023",10/10,"""The Shining"" (1980) is a horror masterpiece that still sends shivers down the spine of audiences today. Directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the novel by Stephen King, the film tells the story of the Torrance family as they spend the winter caretaking the isolated Overlook Hotel. However, as the days go by, the hotel begins to reveal its dark and sinister secrets, leading to a terrifying descent into madness for patriarch Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson).Kubrick's direction is masterful, building tension and suspense through meticulous attention to detail and a slow, deliberate pacing that allows the horror to build gradually. The film's iconic visuals, from the blood-filled elevators to the creepy twins, have become cultural touchstones, while the eerie score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind adds to the film's haunting atmosphere.But what truly sets ""The Shining"" apart is the performances, particularly that of Nicholson as the increasingly unhinged Jack. He perfectly captures the character's slow descent into madness, making his eventual outbursts all the more shocking and terrifying. Shelley Duvall also delivers a powerful performance as Wendy, conveying both her character's fear and strength as she fights to protect her son from her increasingly unstable husband.Overall, ""The Shining"" is a must-see for horror fans and cinephiles alike. Kubrick's masterful direction, unforgettable visuals, and powerhouse performances make it a true classic of the genre."
gawronski-31115,"Jun 19, 2022",10/10,"I first started watching this movie not knowing at all what was going to happen, but I had seen so many great reviews on that I thought I should give it a try. And I loved it it was an amazing movie with all of the suspense and the not knowing what was going to happen next feeling. I was on the edge of me seat watching this!"
GreenLantern108,"May 23, 2000",N/A,"This has to be Stanley Kubrick's worst film since ""Barry Lyndon"" (sorry I haven't seen ""Eyes Wide Shut""), & certainly the worst adaptation of a Stephen King novel EVER.  Kubrick has changed the entire focus of the story from a ""haunted house"" story, to the story of one man's trip into insanity (especially since Nicholson had just won an Oscar for ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest).  Kubrick's egotistical attempt to make it his story and NOT King's is epitomized by the changing of the room # of the ""lady in the tub."" The topper was the killing of the cook Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), Danny & Wendy's savior, moments after his arrival.  At this point in the movie, my wife had to restrain me from leaving the theater (opening day).My recommendation:  Read the Stephen King novel (one of his best) or see the Steven Webber/Rebecca DeMornay TV mini-series, but AVOID ""Stanley Kubrick's The Shining"" (it certainly is NOT ""Stephen King's The Shining"") AT ALL COSTS."
curiousguy81,"Nov 21, 2000",6/10,"After having just read ""The Shining"" I was jived to see this flick, even though Stephen King didn't like it.And I can see why he didn't like it.First: the good.  This movie has the right look and feel to it.  The hotel that serves as the setting fits wonderfully, and several of the creepy scenes work to full effect. (Interestingly enough, the most chilling scene in the entire movie- the famous 'All Work and No Play...' one- wasn't even in the book!)  So, in that limited way, the movie works.Now the bad: Where are these characters?  Where is there ANY development?? You have Hallorann: By the end of the movie you have to wonder why the even chose to put him in it at all.  Danny: doesn't do anything in the entire movie but mumble a bit.  Wendy: All she does is cry and sob.  Very annoying. Not that it was her fault.  That's all she was given to do.  Jack: This guy is supposed to DESCEND into the madness of the hotel.  He is supposed to be flawed at the beginning of the story, but still be a *good* human being. In this movie, he's very harsh with his family from the start, and we never see him really interact with them before he starts to go off the deep end, so to speak. (Not that there was a chance.  Seemingly, the second he steps in the hotel he's halfway to the end of the movie)The line reading was just that.  READING.  So much of the movie seems forced... contrived...  And though there are nice efforts to alter parts of the novel to facilitate the different medium (such as the doctor scene at the beginning of the movie, which culls elements and plot points from the whole book in mere minutes) there are too many complete changes that don't make much sense. (why the hedge maze?  Why end it like *that*??  I think I know why Kubrick didn't use the same ending/main plot point from the book, but still... could have done better)  Not to mention huge themes and elements from the novel that you would think should have been present.I likely need to watch this movie again in awhile after the book isn't so fresh in my mind, and perhaps I can look at it more as a separate movie and not a movie based on the book.  As it is, I found it it to be very un-affecting for the most part, except for about half on hour towards the end.For now, I give it 5.5 out of 10, based on artistic merit, that half hour, and the best scene that seems like it should have been in the book even though it wasn't. (1= awful, 5= average, 10= perfection)"
MyMovieTVRomance,"Feb 8, 2022",7/10,"Super scary, but without the extra gory special effects of today, and without the extreme jump-scares so common of contemporary films of the genre. What gore there was, was relatively mild compared to what today's audiences are used to, and thus this film is a lot less gross than today's horror, but effectively thrilling and chilling. I don't like being scared, but the intrigue of the tone and story keeps me watching, so this was good.I loved the sweet cook character who talked about the shine, and Shelley Duvall was adorable! And I despised Jack Nicholson's character, which means it was a job well-done by him.All-in-all, a good thriller/horror."
Dead_Mann,"May 2, 2006",10/10,"i think this is definitely one of the best horror movies of all time, thanks to Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence, which i think is one of the creepiest and best performance of all time, all the other acting is great too, except Shelley Duvall as Wendy Torrance isn't all that good, but shes pretty good in the famous scene where jack sticks is head through the door and says, ""here's johnny!"", the kid Danny Torrance(Danny Lloyd) is also very good and Philip Stone, in is 3rd Kubrick movie, is very creepy as Delbert Grady who was once the caretaker, but went crazy and killed his wife and children and then himself, i also liked Joe Turkel as the bartender, the movie was very strange and creepy, one of the creepiest movies ever, and was also shot very well, jack ends up try to kill his own family but doesn't succeed and freezes to death, and then a strange ending, if you haven't seen this movie i recommend you do!!!!!!!!!"

That the experience of profound isolation can be dealt with using methods not necessarily accepted by the justice system, the psychiatric community or society as a whole.It's inspired me to better plan to shall I say handle the isolation I and my family are now faced with up here in Northern Alaska, 180 miles northeast of Nome Alaska.But I will handle it. Be most certain of that. I've been working so hard for so long. Daddy needs a release.Well I must go now. A severe winter storm is moving in and my wife is nagging me about firewood again.

mgoode1110,"Nov 4, 2021",10/10,"The Shining is an outstanding movie. It is filled with an eerie atmosphere that builds as the story goes along. Jack Nicholson gives a mesmerizing performance. He doesn't have to be saying a word to completely hold your attention.The film version of The Shining needs to be considered separately from Stephen King's novel. Stanley Kubrick made too many changes for it to be compared side by side. The outcomes for several characters are different and the ending is different.If you have not read the book or seen the movie, do both. They are both great and will give you two separate and enjoyable experiences."
scottsteaux,"Apr 23, 2002",N/A,"This film is one of the worst screen adaptations of a novel I have ever seen.  Kubrick seems to make the wrong decision at every turn, and the result is a terribly long and incoherent film that does a terrible injustice to Stephen King's terrific original story.First of all, the story is about a man going SLOWLY insane; Nicholson seems more than halfway there at the start of the movie, robbing his character of any suspense.In general, Kubrick has (as usual) ignored his actors shamelessly, with the result that none of them gives anything close to the right performance.Another bad mistake:  in the book, the relationship between the father and the son is an unusually close and loving one; this makes the resulting horror all the more tragic.  In the film, the father and son seem to have no relationship at all.  The mother, a strong and purposeful character in the book, is here something of a ninny.Worst of all, perhaps, is that in the book the boy is the focus of the story; the movie shifts the focus to the father and therefore cuts the guts out of what was a pretty complex story.Also, like most of Kubrick's movies, this one is simply WAY TOO LONG.  There is absolutely no reason for this film to take so much time to say, in the end, so little."
deatman9,"Oct 16, 2012",7/10,This movie will always be one of the best classic horror films ever made. Probably due to the fact that the book was so good. Even though they made many Steven King books into movies and none of them were quite as good as this one. The acting by nickleson was very good the woman who played his wife was no good I thought but the child actor was great.This is about a writer who goes and takes a job as a caretaker for a giant mansion. While inside this mansion weird things start to happen as he starts to lose his mind.This movie was really good. It was made back in the day where horror movies actullay had style and substense. Where are the chills are real built from atmosphere and not just jump scenes. This is a must see for true horror fans.
Pairic,"Dec 14, 2025",10/10,"The Shining: I saw The Shining on an IMAX screen last night, Long time since I last saw it so a lot of the detail was hazy. Stand out scenes were Danny's first encounter with the twins, the elevator of blood, Danny meeting Dick Hallorann, their telepathic exchange, at first Dick seeming sinister. Nicholson as Jack looks faintly demented from the beginning but his degeneration into madness and violence becomes more pronounced as his stubble turned to a beard, eventually looking lupine. Shelly Duvall as Wendy has a ""cotton picking"" accent (I'd forgotten about that), like a female Foghorn Leghorn. Great performance though. Great ghosts in Lloyd and Delbert Grady, the 1921 4ih July Ball is wonderfully imagined and must have been budget breaking. Also the shots of The Overlook with numerous vehicles outside, then the lone yellow Volkswagen. Still one of the great horror films. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, Screenplay by Kubrick and Diane Johnson, adapted from the novel by Stephen King. 10/10."
iftekhar25,"Feb 12, 2005",1/10,"This entire movie could have been viewed with subtitles and everything on fast forward. Low on dialogue and storytelling, and sky-high on Kubrik-Hype, his God-awful long shots were as deadly as Jack Nicholson's axe... they killed the movie and any suspense it attempted to create.I literally watched the last part of this movie on fast forward. The Kubrik-esquire long shots are an absolute drag, and the producers should have worked more on the script to let people understand the story more.Try watching a few scenes on fast forward, and you'll get the joke. Absolutely unacceptable. The story is not served in any way by watching a well-acted freak with an axe limp across a half-mile hallway or an old black guy walk, 6-inch stride by 6-inch stride across the same bloody hallway for five minutes.All movie adaptations worthy to be mentioned should have enough material within the contents of the movie for people who have NOT read the book to understand ENOUGH so as to get the general story right. This adaptation does not do anything of the sort.Unacceptable script-writing and unacceptable direction. I forgave Kubrik on 2001: A Space Odyssey, but after watching The Shining, in hindsight, his clichéd long shots and his awful storytelling puts him in one of the directors whose work I consistently do not enjoy."
mohanhaworth,"Nov 10, 2024",8/10,"Right from the start, it's there. That feeling of unease. It's like the Overlook itself, it's present throughout the film. The feeling of isolation from the start is also ever present. The opening helicopter shot is phenomenal, and just sets the audience up for the rest of the film.Obviously there's the iconic bits, ""Come play with us Danny"" and ""Here's Johnny"" to name a few, but I'll just name a couple of scenes that stood out to me. I'll begin with any of the scenes where Jack goes to the bar. There is something about these scenes that put me on edge, and was something that I loved when I read the original Stephen King book. Jack Nicholson's performance is crucial to these scenes, and I love how the character of Lloyd intensifies as the 'spirit' of the Overlook gets more desperate.Stanley Kubrick's cinematography is both perfect and groundbreaking. I said I was going to try and miss out the iconic scenes, but the ones where Danny's cycling through the Overlook are just brilliant! The whole symmetry of the scenes and use of really disgusting looking seventies style decor complements the film perfectly. Another key element in those scenes is the use of sound. No other sound apart from the rolling of the wheels of Danny's bike. Rooooooooolllllllll Stop Roooooooolllll Stop. Perfection.As is the film's score. Aaaaaarrrggghh!!! From the start, it's iconic. 'Nuff said."
masontullis,"Jan 3, 2026",9/10,Watched this for the second time last night and just had a great time. It's one of those movies where if my wife said she wanted to watch it again tonight I would be excited. It's completely unhinged and intriguing while also feeling weirdly homey.Also it's genuinely terrifying! I feel like on a second watch I shouldn't have felt fear but I really did.I love Shelley's performance I think she is my favorite in the movie. I read a bit about how hard Kubrick was on her which sucks but I think it has immortalized her in film history.Conclusion: a great freaking time.
TheMysteriousReviewer,"Jun 5, 2025",10/10,"The Shining is not just among the best horror film, but also the greatest Stephen King adaptation ever made. I would even go far and consider this as the most unpredictable movie I've seen, as it has some of its best thrills and surprises. The story is at its greatest for a Stephen King adaptation, the cinematography is cinematic, the special effects are some of the scariest, the horror is unpredictable, the characters stand out from the novel it was based on, and the acting really holds up later the first time it came out. This is the perfect movie for whenever you're in the mood for a scary movie. This is the movie that will be all worth your time and will guarantee to present the best experience for a horror film. Not only would I consider this one of the best movies of the 80s, but also a legend to horror movies."
bojopm,"Nov 14, 2020",10/10,"In my experience, every time I've watched this film it's been a really great for my health and reproduction. Every time I've watched this film with an English woman, they've always cuddled up with me for love and protection which eases their screaming and worrying when watching this ancient love making movie. I love the plot because an I often go to an isolated cabin in the middle of nowhere to focus on my work and that makes this film so much more relatable and interesting to me as Jack (the main character) similarly stays in a hotel to focus on his work.This film often makes me jump in surprise and I love that as it's healthy for my reaction times and always puts me on the edge of my seat which entertains me and sharpens my fragile mind. The tricycle that Danny (Jack's young son) has in this film has been fun to watch and given me inspiration to set up my electric powered tricycles specially designed to carry toilet paper and suitcases via the soft jiggly custom rear wheels made with love and affection.Oh I love how Danny wasn't intimidated to say he wanted chocolate ice cream to a black man and I love how interesting the Delbert Grady character was in this legendary film as he really put Jack and the other characters in their place and shows the viewer how to be a successful alpha male."

veryape-887-913905,"Jan 29, 2014",7/10,"Think of the greatest terror imaginable. Is it a monstrous Alien? A lethal epidemic? Or is it this harrowing masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, is it fear of murder by someone who should love and protect you-a member of your own family? From a script he co-adapted from the Steven King novel, Kubrick melds vivid performances, menacing settings, dreamlike tracking shots and shock after shock into a milestone of the macabre. Jack Torrance arrives at the elegant, isolated Overlook Hotel as off- season caretaker with his wife and child. Torrance has never been there before, or has he? The answer lies in a ghostly time warp of madness and murder.This film stars: Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall & Danny LlyodThis film is a scary film, I watched this with a friend and he was literally bricking it throughout the film, In my opinion it is not a great film but it is a film that I can watch and be scared like I should in a horror film, it doesn't deserve 8.5 in my opinion but I can see why people love this film. I highly recommend it, just don't plan on having too much sleep the same night as it will leave you shocked & scared.***/***** good film"
simpeton,"Jul 22, 2000",1/10,"Do not waste your time on this movie.  It is one of the best examples of a botched translation from print to screen ever.  It has been inexcusably ""Kubrickized"" to make it fit in more easily with the rest of Stanley Kubrick's body of work.Kubrick takes the basic idea from the book-- and I do mean the most absolutely basic outline of the story-- and changes it into something that is not even remotely scary. In the book, the Hotel itself is the fourth main character, slowly driving Jack Torrance insane.  In this utter waste of film, Jack was crazy when they got there, and the isolation from the outside world is what takes him over the edge.  In this bastardized version, there is no point in having Danny possessed of psychic powers, nor of making the Hotel itself haunted.  Those two points, which should be the two most important facts of the story, instead take a backseat to a very predictable, very generic story of an already unstable man finally snapping.Do yourself a favor, and instead of this absolute SIN of a film, watch the made-for-tv mini-series starring Steven Weber.  It is much more faithful to the book, and therefore a much better and well worked story."
Omandamati,"Oct 9, 2024",10/10,"Based on Stephen King's novel, This is a psychological horror masterpiece. The film's slow buildup, surreal visuals, and haunting music leave a lasting impression, making it a classic in the horror genre. One of the most iconic aspects of The Shining is its ability to play with the audience's mind, leaving much of the horror to interpretation. Its themes, such as isolation, family breakdown, and the haunting power of the past, are explored in ways that continue to spark discussion and analysis.It's praised for its unsettling atmosphere, ambiguous plot elements, and the haunting performance of Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance. Kubrick's meticulous direction, the eerie setting of the Overlook Hotel, and the tension built through visual and sound design make the film a masterpiece of psychological horror."
drqshadow-reviews,"Oct 11, 2024",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick works a psychopathic father, a child with ESP, an old murder and a haunted mansion into one dense narrative. Or maybe he doesn't, since the facts behind many of The Shining's wildest concepts are left to the viewer to validate. There's no doubting the first point, in any case, as recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) quickly spirals out of control when he's snowed in by a major winter storm. Fresh off a short teaching stint, Torrance has accepted a position as seasonal caretaker for a vast, remote Colorado resort as a sort of off-key working vacation. With a wife and son along for the adventure, he intends to make progress on a novel, but soon succumbs to a monstrous case of the stir crazies and begins taking bad advice from ghosts.It can be analyzed to mean any number of things - contemporary reviewers saw it as an allegory for sexism, the extermination of Native Americans, discarded masculinity or the decline of western civilization - and, while you can find anything you like between those lines, I most appreciate it on a surface level. Even in that more limited light, The Shining might just be the best horror movie ever made. It's a simple, familiar formula for the genre: a flawed man, driven over the edge by circumstance, is confined in an unfamiliar space with helpless victims. As he loses touch with his senses, their panic levels spike. Kubrick mines that for all it's worth, stressing the totality of the family's isolation and the strangeness of their surroundings, and his cast does the rest. Nicholson is spectacular and unnerving as the increasingly broken, duplicitous father who loses his already-tenuous grip on sanity. Shelly Duvall bares stark emotion as a fragile young mother who can't accept her husband's latest psychotic break. Seven-year-old Danny Lloyd speaks in tongues and disassociates from reality, an awful, silent victim of both his father's mania and the supernatural phenomena that have affected his childhood. And the venue, a towering, swollen maze of empty halls and lavish décor, would be a character unto itself, even without its many resident spirits.This is all told in a style and fashion befitting the famous director, not to mention his equally famous dedication to getting everything just right. Many of Kubrick's shots are equal parts beautiful and hideous, expert displays of photographic mastery paired with a deeply distressing subject matter. Jack's famous axe-swinging entry through a locked door, for example, wildly pans and veers to follow each cut while never losing its magnificent sense of composition. At once, we're dazzled, dizzied and disturbed. The soundtrack is even more essential. Each scene leans heavily on its audio cues, which build and peak with such subtlety, I'd often find hairs standing on my neck *before* a scare. A striking rumination on... something, that's portrayed with rich meaning and stirring potency, The Shining is truly one for the history books. Color me hypnotized."
fostrhod,"Nov 9, 2023",9/10,"The Shining (1980) Stanley Kubrick director, Stephen King book.Shock horror at 60 years of age I actually like a horror film, which is surprising as I've never been a fan of horror films or their genre, but this is something else.I've never seen this movie before but I was amazed how much of it I have seen in various documentaries previously, probably about 75% , that said it still shocks.From the opening shots of Jack Torrance driving to the Overlook Hotel there is a build up of tension, Wendy Carlos synth driven score helps with this immensely.. The three principle leads Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall and the great and never to be seen again Danny Lloyd are breath-taking and a special mention for Scatman Crothers, who i know from numerous westerns. Overall the slow pace and slow unravelling of Jack's mind are what gives you the willies. Its a masterpiece. 9/10 PS if your a fan of the soundtrack, search out a musician called the Caretaker, that echoing sound of the haunted a ballroom as been perfected by The Caretaker (he must be a big fan using that alias too)"
lukebennett-84286,"Nov 12, 2024",8/10,"Experiencing ""The Shining"" for the first time was like stepping into a haunting dream that lingered long after the credits rolled. From the moment the iconic opening credits began, accompanied by the eerie score, I felt an unsettling tension that only grew as the film progressed.Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is nothing short of mesmerizing. His transformation from a hopeful writer to a man consumed by madness is chilling. There's a raw intensity in his performance that made me feel both sympathy and horror; it's a delicate balance that few actors can achieve. Shelley Duvall, too, delivers a heart-wrenching performance as Wendy, embodying the terror and desperation of a mother trying to protect her child from the abyss that her husband is falling into.The Overlook Hotel itself is a character in its own right. Its vast, empty hallways and the oppressive silence create a sense of isolation that is palpable. I found myself holding my breath during the scenes where Danny rides his tricycle through the corridors; the sound of the wheels echoing against the floorboards was both mesmerizing and foreboding. The cinematography is stunning, with each frame meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of dread and unease.What struck me most was the film's exploration of psychological horror. It delves deep into the human psyche, questioning the nature of madness and the thin line between sanity and insanity. As Jack descends further into his own madness, I felt a creeping sense of dread, as if I were witnessing the unraveling of a mind right before my eyes. The film's ability to evoke such strong emotions is a testament to Stanley Kubrick's genius as a director.The infamous scenes, like the blood pouring from the elevator and the haunting presence of the twin girls, are etched in my memory. They serve as reminders of the film's ability to tap into our deepest fears-the fear of the unknown, the fear of losing control, and the fear of what lies within ourselves.Even after all these years, ""The Shining"" remains a masterclass in horror filmmaking. It's a film that demands to be experienced, not just watched. It's a haunting journey into the depths of madness that leaves you questioning your own reality long after the final scene. I can confidently say that this film has earned its place as a timeless classic, and I am grateful to have finally witnessed its brilliance."
SteelBlue82,"Jul 14, 2019",N/A,"Stephen King hated it, critics hated it, and I loved it. Kubrick really made The Shining his own. For me it's top 3 horror movies all time. The things that stand out are the crisp cinematography, moody music, and the performance of Jack Nicholson. The supporting cast is weak, but it oddly blends in with the vulgarity of the movie. And the vulgarity of everything was somehow just the right amount."
gbill-74877,"Aug 27, 2019",7/10,"I'm not sure why this one has never resonated with me quite as much as it does with so many others. I like it, and thought I might like it even more on what was probably my fifth viewing over the years, but it still didn't click to the next level. I love the stunning beginning sequence from the air with the car driving through beautiful mountain scenery, the brilliant dreamlike (or nightmare-like) ending sequence in the maze, the classic moments from Jack Nicholson ('Here's Johnny' and all that), and the horrifying moment when Shelley Duvall finds out that all he's been typing is 'All work and no play...' instead of cranking out the great American novel. Probably my favorite moment was when their boy has gone to the room to get a toy, and we see a shot of Nicholson both on the bed and in a mirror, calling him over. It's absolutely terrifying, because we know he's hurt the boy while drinking in the past, we know something evil is going on with this place, and we see him in that mirror, so perfectly placed in the shot. The style and the cinematography of the film are fantastic.I guess what holds me back a bit is either the original story from Stephen King, which seems a little overdone, or the direction from Stanley Kubrick, who gives us little nuance. I think it would have been better if it hadn't had all the backstory about the Indian burial site, the place being cursed, the former caretaker having axed his family, and the chef having a psychic connection with the little boy. He's really going to be out there in Florida, feel a disturbance in the Force or whatever, and then fly off to Colorado and drive out to what is supposed to be an inaccessible place? I know stripping all this out would have gutted the film and had King fans howling even more than they do as it is, but I wish it had just been the guy and his family out there for the winter, slowly going crazy, without all the other mumbo-jumbo. The twins are spooky, but the flood of blood from the elevator? I don't know. As it is, to fit all that in, or maybe because of the choices Kubrick made, the pace to insanity is awfully quick, too damn quick, whereas a slow path would have been more terrifyingly tense and real to me. On top of that, Nicholson's performance is memorable for sure, but jeez if only he would emote a little, you know? He should have dialed it down early, to tell the story of gradual descent into madness better, and to make the scenes towards the end more powerful."
Pixtalgia,"Nov 1, 2023",9/10,"Honestly, one of the best in the genre.While not a short movie by any means, The Shining is constantly building tension and world building around the Torrance family and the Hotel they're secluded in.The movie is filmed beautifully whether it's capturing moments of shock and using camera effects to convey emotion or when they're filming otherworldly scenes that would not be captured in reality.The movie builds layers taking the audience on a journey of interpretation of what they're watching. Something that truthfully I have yet to fully interpret myself.All in all, I think this movie is a masterpiece and a must watch for everyone whether you're a fan of Horror & Thrillers or not. If you're not a fan of long form media, this probably isn't for you and that's probably the only thing bad I could say about this movie."
allerthenry,"Jun 3, 2021",10/10,"The Shining is a complete masterpiece from start to finish and will be looked at as one of the greatest horror movies ever created for generations. While the film could have stayed true to some of the aspects of the book, I think this film contains incredible acting and an amazing plot regardless of its differences to the book. From the opening drive to the hotel to the closing twist at the end, The Shining is a quite cinematically perfect and has stood the test of time for 40 years. Also, Jack Nicholson's acting + this movie as a whole is one of the biggest Oscar snubs in the history of cinema."
peisherman42,"Jun 19, 2022",9/10,"Even thought I'm not a fan of horror movies, I have always wanted to watch 'The Shining' because of how many times it's been referenced in pop culture. And WOW, so many iconic moments here.The movie is very subtle most of the time, but keeps your attention with the dramatic soundtrack and the intriguing camera that always gives you the impression something is about to happen (like when it follows Danny riding his bike from behind).The only reason I'm not giving 'The Shining' a 10 is the fact that they could have utilised more scary elements by the end of the movies, more specifically when Wendy is running through the hotel looking for Danny. Considering how big the 'Overlook' is, there were a lot of possibilities they could have explored to appeal more to the frightening aspect of the story.Nevertheless, is great in every other aspect."

MovieAddict2016,"Mar 4, 2006",10/10,"What a great horror film ""The Shining"" is! It is a well-known fact of film trivia nowadays that Stephen King ""hated"" the adaptation of his novel, and was bothered by Stanley Kubrick's ""creative liberties"" (his main complaint: the lack of hedge monsters). I hate to point this out to Mr. King, but his novel was a rather simplistic horror yarn - a classic of its genre? Maybe, but I feel there is far more depth in the movie -- and we saw the result of a faithful adaptation in the form of a late 1990s television miniseries starring Rebecca Demornay - the result was enjoyable but nowhere near the greatness of Kubrick's vision.In general, I'm not a Kubrick fanatic and I don't devour everything he's done. I consider ""2001"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" to be overrated - but this is probably my favorite film of his (but then again, ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Paths of Glory"" are superb, too). This was perhaps only the second truly epic horror film (the first being Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"") - and the direction is really amazing. The eerie nature of the movie is unsettling all at once without showing anything at all.Simply built on music alone, Kubrick manages to convey so many feelings. He pulls out to an overhead shot of a boy playing on a red rug. Coupled with the soundtrack it's terrifying. This is how all horror films should be. It shows what an impact subliminal terror has - an axe-yielding maniac can only have shock and jump value; seeing something this psychologically mind-screwing is utterly gut-wrenching.See this movie. Honestly, if you haven't watched it yet, please do. And avoid the edited TV version, which omits some of the more terrifying moments (I guess they're considered too ""scary""?). Some omitted scenes are simply too risqué for television. One of these moments happens towards the end - I saw it as a child and it still disturbs me and has stayed with me after all these years. Shelley Duvall is running through the Overlook and she comes to a hallway, and in one of the rooms two party-goers (one dressed up as a lion or something) are performing some strange sex act. You only see it for maybe two seconds, and they're fully clothed, but it's impossible to forget. The TV version simply shows them sitting next to each other on the bed - odd enough, and still freaky, but the uncut version of the scene is even more so.Truly, the only word to describe this movie's vibe is ""freaky."" I'd place it as one of the top five horror films of all time, and in my own personal opinion, I'd probably rank it right below ""Psycho"" as the most masterful and epic of them all."
Dammie-A,"Aug 16, 2013",N/A,"This is Stanley Kubrick's 11 full length film made in 1980 original a Stephen King novel this film stars the brilliant Jack Nicholson and the also brilliant Shelley Duvall. The shining was released as Horror and Mystery with a Certificate of (R), this filming had a budget of $19,000,000 and grossed $44,017,374 making it a very successful film by Stanley Kubrick. The plot for the film states '' A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future''. A very simple but engaging plot to a story.Before I express my love for this film I think it's only right to pen down just how awed I was whilst watching the unbelievable amount of detail put cinematography for this film. The word beautiful does not live up to what exactly I felt about the cinematography in this film, not only was I awed I was almost in shocked almost scarred knowing that someone just as human as me made something so.Immaculate. While trying as hard as possible to actually watch the film in detail I was constantly distracted by the cinematography in this film however when I did manage to focus on the film and the actors I have to say that I was actually very scarred most times while watching the film the other half of my concentration was spent marveling at the magnificence of the film itself.The acting in the was unbelievably authentic, it was recorded in the book ''The Real Stanley Kubrick'' that Kubrick was not so happy that Jack Nicholson made more money than he did for this film and in some ways it is understandable and although it is without a doubt that Kubrick had done a lot of work for this film it ultimately could have been let down by the acting. After watching Jack Nicholson's performance in this film it is now impossible for me to not think that somewhere far, far in Jack Nicholson's mind he has a bit of the personality of the character he played, left in him. I believed that he was crazy and he was going to kill his innocent family and at some points I did feel compassion for him but after questioning myself on why I did feel compassion, I could not find a reason. The main actor would not be able to make any impact on the audience without the help of his supporting actress Shelley Duvall. Shelley Duvall's eyes was probably the saddest eyes I have ever laid my eyes on, it made it easier to show just how scarred she was when her husband was going crazy. Her tears we real, her fear was real and he attempts to save herself and her child was equally as real but sometimes when on screen with Jack Nicholson, his character was so powerful that Shelley was left in the background and all the audience wanted to see was Jack Nicholson going crazy.Before watching this film I believed that it was impossible for a director to explain to the actor exactly what he wanted he or she to do but when I heard that Kubrick Made Shelley Duvall redo a scene in the film over a maybe exaggerated 100 times I believed that the acting in this film wasn't by luck it was something that Kubrick had seen and wanted to be acted perfectly on screen. Although it is recorded that Jack Nicholson improvised the line ''Here's Johnny'' In the bathroom scene, I felt that this so called legendary line did not add anything to the scene for me. Yes that line is a great line and yes it's become somewhat an iconic line but I couldn't understand what I was supposed to feel about it, the line did have a comedic side to but how was I supposed to find a man about to kill his wife and child funny. Even though Kubrick was known for his dark humor this was in no way dark or humorous.In conclusion I loved this film and saying exactly what I loved about this film would result in me repeating myself. This is my second favorite Kubrick film and this film made me have a respect for Kubrick ."
ewang982,"Jul 22, 2004",1/10,"The suspense was ruined scene after scene by bad editing. Jack Nicholson was never credible as a sane Jack Torrence. This should have been billed as ""loosely inspired by Stephen King's The Shining"". Left out the topiary (a very important aspect of horror in the book) and what's with the repeated shots of the elevator of blood? I think the ONLY reason this has gotten decent ratings is because it has Stanley Kubrick's name attached to it. If it had the director as Alan Smithee, I doubt it would have gotten above a 3 rating. If you want to see a very faithful adaptation of the novel, rent the mini-series Stephen King's The Shining. Shelley Duvall (an accomplished actress) was reduced to a whimpering, sniveling extra. And, what's with the finger ""redrum""?!? In the book... Tony lived in the back of his throat, not in his finger. About the only thing worth watching in this movie is Scatman, even though they changed his role quite dramatically from the book. This movie appears to have been made to show how insane Jack Nicholson can act, as he is really about the only thing featured in the movie. Those that rated it well, obviously never have touched the book."
MaxBorg89,"Jul 25, 2007",10/10,"The Shining is a weird example of adaptation: it has very little in common with the source novel, written by Stephen King, yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work. This is due to two factors: Stanley Kubrick's masterful direction and Jack Nicholson's chilly acting.Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, a writer who accepts to take care of the Overlook Hotel in Canada during the winter period, unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place: he claims a nice, isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book. Therefore the Overlook becomes the new home of the Torrance family: Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their five-year old son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong: he has been told by the cook, Dick O' Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy, the titular Shining, which allows people like him and Dick to see flashes from the past and the future, among other things. Because of this ""gift"", the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in Danny, even though he is quite capable of resisting them. That is not Jack's case, however, as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts, triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break.The Shining works as a horror movie because Kubrick, though having never worked on this kind of film before, knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't, hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths. King criticized the director for changing most of the story, omitting most of the Jack/Danny subplot (merely hinted at in the film) that led to the book's emotionally strong climax, and while his disappointment is valid, the omission was actually necessary: the novel dealt with redemption, albeit in an unconventional way, and redemption is a theme Kubrick, one of the most famous analysts of human decay, never had a soft spot for. What he is interested in is the mental, and subsequently physical, unbalance that threatens the characters, and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot (Danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example).Another criticism King raised was about the actors, especially Nicholson: in the writer's opinion, his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate Jack already was insane, thus undermining the rest of the story. Now, it is true that Nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning, but it is equally true that Martin Sheen (King's ideal choice for the role) probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as Nicholson's: from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal ""Here's Johnny!"" scene, it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part, and even though the TV version of The Shining from 1997 isn't bad the Torrance character is indelibly linked to the One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest star. As for Duvall and Lloyd, both add terrific support, the latter especially deserving a place alongside Harvey Stephens (The Omen's Damien) and Haley Joel Osment as cinema's great horror child icons. One might complain about Duvall being completely different from the book counterpart (blonde and beautiful) and not having much else to do but scream and run, but two things ought to be considered: a) back in 1980 the ""scream queen"" cliché wasn't one yet; b) rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera, making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from Wendy's eyes.Irvine Welsh, the author of Trainspotting, once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work (and he should know, given the liberties Danny Boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen), yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad. The Shining proves said point to perfection: very little from the novel, approximately 5%, is included in the film, but in Kubrick and Nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest, most original horror pictures of all time, which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form."
RJBurke1942,"Nov 15, 2007",8/10,"I saw this film in 1981 and, just recently, decided to see it again before I wrote a review.Time hasn't diminished the effect: this is still a scary movie from one of the industry's greatest directors.After seeing it for the first time, I sourced Stephen King's novel and sat down to have good read. Boy, was that a mistake? I gave up trying to read King's dense narrative that seemed to be all over the place, leaving it aside so that I could remember the effectiveness of Kubrick's screenplay. Only much later, did I learn that Kubrick's script deviated markedly from King's novel. Well, I guess that's art...There are many striking features about the film. First, who would expect to see a true horror movie shot mostly in bright daylight and at such an idyllic setting? Quite the opposite to all the Dracula type schlock that had been so common and that graced cinema screens up till then. Recall Psycho from 1960... The effect for me was to make the narrative all the more horrifying.Did I say idyllic setting? More like modern Gothic, in a way. Or maybe Kubrick was subtlety poking fun at prior so-called horror flicks that had the inevitable dark castle sitting on hill, with lightning crashing around most of the time?And then there's Jack Nicholson, one of Tinsel Town's eccentrics, if not crazy, playing a role tailor made for him. How could it not be, after seeing how well he did in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)? Some might argue he was over the top, a caricature almost, of a man who truly goes insane. Watching him for the second time, however, I think his performance reminded me all too well of insane people I've met in real life.As a study in abnormal psychology, I think it works very well  in fact, it's a tour de force. And that's why I'm still also a mite disappointed by the way the narrative turns to use supernatural elements to explain the reasons for Jack's descent into his private Hell. (I suppose I'll have to read King's novel to sort this out.) I'm prepared to accept the idea of telepathy between young Danny (Danny Lloyd) and Dick (Scatman Crothers) because I've come across situations that strongly suggest its probability. I see no need, however, to introduce the supernatural, except to appeal to the gullible.Shelley Duval is well cast as the already nervous wife, Wendy; and, I read that Kubrick made her even more nervous with his need for perfection. Scatman was suitably impressive and mysterious; a fine actor and composer. And, hats off to young Danny Lloyd.If this is a movie you've missed, I recommend it thoroughly."
miljus-2,"May 17, 2008",10/10,"I'm a big fan Stanley Kubrick and this is my favourite movie of him. The Shining is in my opinion the best horror movie ever with excellent atmospheric direction from Kubrick a good score and effective performances from Danny Lloyd, scatman crothers and Shelley duvall though there is who criticizes her but i liked her here even jack is good but sometimes goes a bit over the top and the ending is a bit strange but no one can deny it it's creepy, atmospheric and sometimes scary the best elements with a good score to make a great horror movie the 1997 version was good too though it's not good as this one even if it is more faithful to King's book but it isn't scary as the Kubrick version"
CinemaClown,"Oct 19, 2015",N/A,"Arguably the most aesthetic, artistic & accomplished of all horror films, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is another masterwork of precision craftsmanship that presents the gifted filmmaker at his prime as he smoothly blends the elements of supernatural & psychological horror into one methodically structured & meticulously layered story whose underlying themes & narrative complexity has spawned numerous interpretations over the years and remains a subject of discussion amongst film buffs even today.The Shining tells the story of Jack Torrance, a former teacher who takes the caretaker's job at the Overlook Hotel which tends to stay closed during the winter season. Arriving at the remote location with his wife & son, Jack intends to use the solitude of the hotel to pursue his passion for writing but once the family settle into the hotel, his condition worsens as he begins to act strangely, suffers from writer's block, becomes prone to violent outbursts & is constantly haunted by the supernatural entity that reside there.Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, The Shining is his first stint with horror and yet he exhibits a far better understanding of this genre than most established directors of horror cinema. From the opening moments, the film is able to establish an ominous mood thanks to the eerie score that accompanies its title sequence and the aerial photography that finds its camera hovering over those rocky mountains, lush landscapes & narrow roads leading to the Overlook Hotel, thus already foreshadowing the isolation that awaits the Torrance familyThe technical aspects in almost every Kubrick film is carried out with precision care and The Shining is no exception. Production design team deserves kudos for the meticulously designed set pieces for it provides the hotel an identity of its own. Cinematography makes very inventive use of its camera & follows our characters like a silent observer at all times while the fluid movements, clever angles, steady zooms, perfect lighting & aptly chosen colour tones greatly amplify the whole look & feel of the picture. The real highlight however is how the Steadicam is utilised.Kubrick here pushes the Steadicam to its extreme to achieve a smoothness & stability that hasn't been replicated ever since. The flexibility & sleek flow provided by this new technique didn't just allow the director to stage some of modern cinema's most iconic shots but also brings the viewers into the story by placing them behind the characters as the plot unfolds. Editing is a strong highlight too for almost every scene ends up playing a relevant role in the story. And the background score is in perfect sync with each & every moment and elevates the whole experience by encapsulating the entire film with a highly unsettling mood.With Jack Nicholson in the lead role, Jack Torrance already looks like someone who's just waiting for a little push to descend into total madness which doesn't come off as a surprise when it eventually happens. The stressful experience Shelley Duvall underwent during its production is well-documented but the effect of it all can be felt in her rendition of a broken Wendy, as the entire ordeal only helped her performance. And Danny Lloyd plays their psychic kid and just like every kid in almost every horror film, he's annoying to an extent. All three actors are over-the-top at times but this added exaggeration somehow works in the film's favour.On an overall scale, The Shining is a thought-provoking meditation on madness, isolation & paranoia that defies everything that was usually a norm in the genre of horror back then yet puts on screen a cinema that is now regarded as a definitive example of atmospheric horror. Immortal for its contribution to horror, a staple of pop culture, and a classic amalgamation of superb direction, deft writing, innovative camera-work, skillful editing, menacing score & devoted performances, The Shining remains one of the greatest achievements of its genre that's only getting better with time and is definitely amongst Stanley Kubrick's finest works. Highly recommended. Multiple viewings advised."

Although the novel is a very absorbing story, (me being a knowledgable horror critic) it does not deserve the praise it recieves. In the entire film I don't think I was scared once and certainly didn't have to ""sleep with the lights on"", the downfall however was not acting ability but an inappropiate screen adaption, which didn't force the viewer to think or at any time be in any doubt of what the that his/her perceptions were incorrect. Although it might sound it, I don't hate this film, as films go it is quite good, it is just not one of the top notch horror films that it is made out to be, better screen adaptions of Stephen King Novels are Misery and perhaps IT (bar the stupid ending), which I would much rather recommend.The Shining is a film everyone should see once (no more).7/10."
chessirose,"Oct 8, 2001",1/10,"Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great.  Its really not.  There were two good things that came out of this movie 1.  Jack's performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him.  2.  Danny's performance, he was good.  No other then that it got pretty stupid.  And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy?   She was so bad.  She looked the same every time she got scared.  The problem with this movie was the ending.  I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently.  And, the over all movie was just stupid.  The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better.  So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off.  3/10."
brad_2534,"Apr 29, 2007",10/10,"Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like ""The Shining""? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time.So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and his family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean.This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as ""scary"". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it.Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe.There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R.I.P. Stanley."
Steffi_P,"Mar 25, 2007",8/10,"After his greatest achievement in the sumptuous period drama Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick moved on to make his statement on the horror genre. A massive shift in focus, but perhaps not such a surprise since there were elements of horror in 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange.Kubrick's greatest strength is probably in that he always followed his own muse, regardless of what was going on in cinema at any one time. Of course, he was sometimes influenced by his contemporaries, but he never followed a trend. The Shining is at once bold and innovative, yet also nostalgic and old-fashioned. In a way this mimics the story's theme of history repeating itself and the overlapping of past and present events  a typically Kubrick-esquire mixing of style and content.The atmosphere of The Shining is created through use of space and place. Kubrick shows us two kinds of space at the Overlook Hotel. There are vast, empty spaces such as the grand hall and the gold room, generally revealed to us in slow zooms. Jack is more often shown in these rooms, and they represent his growing isolation from his family and his detachment from reality. Then there are the winding passages like the corridors and the maze, which Kubrick's camera explores with steady tracking shots. More often than not it is Wendy and Tommy whom the camera follows through these passages, and this gives us the sense of confinement and helplessness of their situation.In terms of place, The Shining is in a way a Heart-of-Darkness style journey into hostile territory. The opening credit sequence tells us this right at the start, as we see Jack's car travelling higher and higher into the mountains, a tiny dot from the helicopter shot. The Overlook Hotel resembles its mountainous surroundings, both in shape and colour. Kubrick's construction of space and place combine to create the nightmare situation  a place which is in itself massive and spacious, but which is also a prison, cut off from the outside world.Kubrick is perhaps best known for bucking trends, and rejecting by-the-book approaches, and The Shining does go against the horror grain in several respects. Perhaps most notable is the light. Whereas virtually every horror film prior to this had exploited the darkness, The Shining (as its title suggests) is filled with light and brightness. It's also something of a return to the early days of horror, largely favouring creepy atmospherics over slasher shocks. In fact, there is a very direct and obvious reference to DW Griffith's Broken Blossoms (not actually a horror, but it's still got the axe moment) and even Shelley Duvall's performance towards the end slips into wonderful Lillian Gish-style melodramatics.The Shining is tightly constructed, and it certainly stands out from its contemporaries in the genre, but like many of Kubrick's films it is seriously overrated. For all its supposed sophistication some of the horror moments are terribly camp and corny  for example the old woman in the bathtub does the most ridiculous zombie lurch I've seen outside of B-horror. Those quick zooms and that snare thing on the soundtrack that accompany every shock moment are massively overused and soon become tedious. For my money the supernatural horror elements do not really work  he just doesn't get the creepiness right. It's only the real-life, psycho-killer aspects that have any impact here, and this is mainly down to the intensity of the acting performances. I'm risking flak by saying this, but maybe the film would have been better if Kubrick left out all the ghosts and just told a story about a man's journey into murderous insanity."
alessiocacciapuoti,"Dec 24, 2015",10/10,"""The Shining"" is ""the fist epic horror film"" as had written Jack Kroll on Newsweek. Martin Scorsese argued that was ""one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time"". Billy Wilder said to Cameron Crowe that ""The Shining"" is a ""fluid film"" that does a good meaning to this film. This is the best performance of Jack Nicholson, also better of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" when he won the Oscar on 1975. The other actors have also a good performance as Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers that probably they had a big trauma during acting that movie. This is an important movie. The several meaning continue to be written by the fans. There is a movie: ""Room 237"" that groups some of these hypotheses."
haavard-geithus,"Mar 26, 2007",9/10,"This is another fantastic movie directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick.It was released back in 1980 so you shouldn't expect the overuse of special effects (SE) like in many modern movies. They simply didn't have that technology. And I think the quality of the story sometimes can benefit from that. I've seen to many movies were stories drown in SE. Anyway, Kubrick won an Academy Award for SE. In The Shining he sure knows when to use them and not. Excellent camera-work.Kubrick uses well balanced and clear images. Combined with a fantastic story progression and strong psychological impressions it all sums up to a great movie experience with a great nerve. It is all so clear and so deadly. It really is composed well and it does exactly what a horror movie is intended to do: Scare the hell out of the audience."
crpetersen,"May 31, 2019",10/10,"An unforgettable cinematic delight that puts you on the edge of your seat and haunts you with it's ominous music. Superb acting from Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, and incredible directing from Kubrick, this is truly one of the best horror movies of all time."
paul_m_haakonsen,"Feb 22, 2016",8/10,"Director Stanley Kubrick managed to take a Stephen King novel and turn it into an essential movie for the horror genre, and somewhat of a timeless masterpiece of terror and despair. And despite it being from 1980 then the movie still holds it own by today's standards, both in storytelling, terror factor and as a wholesome movie.The movie is every bit as thrilling and disturbing as the book. And that accomplishment is well-owned by the director, but also to the actors who were in the movie.The story told in ""The Shining"", which I assume that you should be more than familiar with already - and if you are not, shame on you, is about Jack Torrance, a former teacher turned writer, who takes on the responsibility of being the caretaker of the Overview Hotel as its secluded location makes it impossible to reach during the snowy winter months. Locked away at the secluded mountainside hotel, the desolation plants a seed which is fermented by the isolation and the Torrance family find that strange things take place at the quiet Overview Hotel.Running at 2 hours and 26 minutes, ""The Shining"" might be a bit too long for some viewers, especially since this is the type of horror movie that slowly builds up the dread and suspense. So don't expect to be thrown into a movie filled with scares from the very beginning.And it is this slow and foreboding building up of dread and suspension that really makes ""The Shining"" such a great movie, because it is done in a very skillful manner. And the progression of Jack's descent into madness is so amazing to watch on the screen.""The Shining"" is also the movie that really made me open up my eyes to the acting talent of Jack Nicholson. He is nothing short of spectacular in the role of Jack Torrance. And his mannerisms, charisma and physical appearance is so well-cut for this particular role. It really felt like the character was custom made with Jack Nicholson in mind. I can't really claim to be familiar with Shelley Duvall other than her work in ""The Shining"", but she really did a good job in this movie right alongside with Jack Nicholson.The setting for the movie really also adds a lot of depth and atmosphere to the movie. The Overview Hotel is a grand spectacular building in itself both outside and inside. And its secluded location in the mountains just adds so much to the feel of isolation and desolation that permeates the movie.""The Shining"" is an effective horror movie because of the build up of the isolation, dread and terror. And director Stanley Kubrick really cemented himself in the horror history with this 1980 movie. I dare say that he put a timeless horror classic to film with his accomplishment here.I am rating ""The Shining"" a well-deserved 8 out of 10 stars. And I can honestly say that ""The Shining"" is a movie that you can watch again and again with a few years in between."
malllover13,"May 5, 2002",N/A,"Okay, well I am 14 and me and my 11 year old brother decided to rent the Shining and watch it last Saturday night.  My 8 year old sister Rachel and my 2 half sisters Emma, 5 and Ashley, 17 watched it with us.  None of us had seen it and we thought we were in for a big fright!  Throughout the whole movie, Emma and Rachel kept asking us when it was going to get scary!!!! There was not one scary thing in the movie!  We laughed more than anything!!!  When we started watching it we wern't sure if Emma should watch it with us, b/c she might get to scared, but she and Rachel just laughed the whole time!!!!  The movie was not a bit scary!  We watched Urban Legends after the Shinig and it was 100% more scarier!!!  I thought we were going to be in for a HUGH scare with The Shining, and I was SOOOOO dissapointed! Usually, ever more scares me, but not this one!  I even got scared at Alicia Silverstone's True Crime but I was not the least bit frightened at The Shining and neaither was Landon, Rachel, Emma or Ashley!  It was more funny than anything!!!Much Love ** Alexandra"
gennadijmironov,"Jan 25, 2022",6/10,"Stanley Kubrick takes an arguably weak Stephen King literary tomb and possibly reads more into the material than what King had originally cooked up. Jack Nicholson interviews to be the winter caretaker of a mammoth, isolated Colorado hotel and immediately feels at home in the lonely vastness of its eerie expanse; his jittery wife and muted, psychic young son aren't so sure about the surroundings, especially after Dad starts exhibiting uncontrolled behavior. Once again, Kubrick displays his fabulous grasp of film-technique, resulting in some sensational scenes (particularly the opening drive up the mountain, the child's first meeting with the psychic cook, the overhead shot of the maze, and a funny/scary bit with Shelley Duvall fending off crazy Jack with a baseball bat). Unfortunately, the plot is all gummed up; it takes in past and present incidents, characters as mind demons, and a boy's fear of his father and fails to make all the elements cohere. Worse, the pieces don't make this much of a scary puzzle--it's too confounding to be truly terrifying--and the finale (filled with lots of freaky goings-on) releases all the tension Kubrick has worked so hard to build up. Some may see the confusing debauchery and the blood-filled elevator as Kubrick's comment on the horror genre, his imperviousness to the usual scare-movie tactics--he's above clichés--though what he DOES give us doesn't add up. A great deal of screen-time is spent getting help to the woman and her son (in the form of the cook) and also in locking up Nicholson when he becomes too violent--and both chapters end ridiculously. Was Kubrick gleeful at cutting such corners? If so, he shouldn't have been. ""The Shining"" feels like a cheat in so many ways that frustration ultimately mitigates the suspense. **1/2 from ****"
MadeleineM-56,"Nov 23, 2025",7/10,"The movie uses much more psychological methods of scaring an audience. As a pose to just lots of blood, gore and killing. That's not to say it's not very scary and disturbing. And it messes with your mind in a very strange way. So if you're a fan of creepy, strange and psychologically thrilling movies and tv shows, then you'll be really fascinated by this movie! And probably enjoy it!"
TheTheatreKidFrom90s,"Dec 10, 2009",1/10,"Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time and his many movies are excellent, probably because he is perfectionist, despite this is a torture for the actors who worked with him. As I read, he had gotten Shelley Duvall act the same scene 87 times, then Duvall had a nervous breakdown. It seems impossible, but unfortunately, in spite of this effort (perfectionism) there is nothing except for Jack Nicholson. Everyone talks about the bicycle scene with amazement. Yes, it was interesting, but if we think about Kubrick's other movies, it is nothing. The script is seriously mediocre, the direction is a bit better than the script. For example, the development of the story is uninspiring. Nicholson enters the bar of the house and starts to talk to a man, but also he does not react at all as if everything is fine. What a bad idea to mention that the house is uncanny. You think to yourself like what is going on here? The idea of the man who comes a mansion with his wife and children, then he starts to go mad was not well adapted in other words. The movie is in contradiction with Kubrick's coherent direction style. The final was one of the most uninspiring finals of all times and a little bit ridiculous. The characters who sense the danger and try to help are nonsense and unnecessary. Those characters only serve to thrill us, but unnecessary. The child often looks gawkily, he gapes. Those moments are very silly and to me really annoying. The hatchet scene is the best (the only best) scene of the movie. I should count the bicycle scene, too which the child rides his bike through the corridors. Generally, in fact, always, nobody does something to the bad movies which loved and overrated, but The Shining was nominated for the worst director in Razzie awards. When I learned, you can't imagine how I cheered up."
lisagervais-37820,"Jul 29, 2020",10/10,No one will ever make a better thriller film. Everyone is copying this film and they cant make a better one. I love the Shining so much for what it is. Thanks

This movie is such a brilliant classic, that everyone has to experience at least once in their lifetime!! Trust me you won't be disappointed... The Shining also has one of the greatest endings in film history and will absolutely make your jaw drop! This is quite simply a film for the ages!!"
ayubnor-89685,"May 30, 2021",10/10,"The Shining offers an overwhelming sense of dread and insanity as Jack Terrence is in the spotlight front and center thanks to the performance of Jack Nicholson who give it his all. The sets, camerawork, and score fuel the terror in this film which is why is is revered as one of the greatest horror films ever made."
THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,"Feb 1, 2020",10/10,"Chilling, haunting and unforgettable - The Shining is a horror masterpiece that radiates some of the finest filmmaking of all time."
XBateman,"Mar 11, 2025",9/10,"Watching The Shining was my second tryst with Stanley Kubrick's cinematic brilliance, and I must say, it was an experience that left me both unsettled and awed. Kubrick's masterful storytelling weaves a complex web of psychological horror, atmospheric tension, and eerie mystery, making The Shining a movie that's hard to shake off.The film tells the story of Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson), a struggling writer who takes up the job of winter caretaker at the isolated Overlook Hotel. Jack's wife, Wendy (played by Shelley Duvall), and their son, Danny (played by Danny Lloyd), accompany him to the hotel, hoping that the isolation will help Jack overcome his writer's block. However, things take a dark turn when Jack's sanity begins to unravel, and the hotel's supernatural forces start to exert their influence.One of the standout aspects of The Shining is its atmosphere. Kubrick's use of long, sweeping shots and eerie sound design creates a sense of unease and tension that permeates every frame of the film. The Overlook Hotel, with its labyrinthine corridors and ornate decor, becomes a character in its own right, exerting a malign influence on its inhabitants. The film's visuals are stunning, with Kubrick's innovative use of Steadicam shots creating a sense of fluidity and unease.The performances in The Shining are also noteworthy. Jack Nicholson brings his signature intensity to the role of Jack Torrance, conveying the character's growing instability and madness. Shelley Duvall, on the other hand, brings a sense of vulnerability and desperation to the role of Wendy, making her character's plight all the more heartbreaking. Danny Lloyd, who plays Danny, is also impressive, conveying the character's unique abilities and emotional turmoil.If I have any criticisms of The Shining, it's that the film's pacing can be a bit slow, particularly in the first half. Additionally, some viewers may find the film's supernatural elements to be a bit ambiguous or unclear. However, I believe that these elements are intentionally left vague, adding to the film's sense of mystery and unease.Overall, I found The Shining to be a deeply unsettling and thought-provoking film that's hard to shake off. Kubrick's masterful direction, combined with the film's atmosphere, performances, and themes, make it a must-watch for horror fans and cinephiles alike. If you haven't seen The Shining before, be prepared for a cinematic experience that will leave you sleeping with the lights on."
