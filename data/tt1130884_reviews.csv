jackgdemoss,"Jul 22, 2019",9/10,"I originally saw this film when it came out but couldn't remember it well enough to give it a rating or write a review, so a rewatch was in order. I viewed the film through the lens of already knowing the plot twist, which made it a whole different experience. The ending will be remembered throughout film history as one that showed just how viciously a well written script can flip an audience over. This really is a film you should see twice."
napierslogs,"May 22, 2010",9/10,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. He pays attention to every detail in this film, making ""Shutter Island"" one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.Visually intriguing, simplistic and absolutely phenomenal. The story is kept simplistic enough so it doesn't get absurd, but allows for an ending which you probably won't see coming. The film doesn't go for cheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you won't get needlessly scared.The film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film. I loved every minute of it and highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a usual fan of the genre, this film has so much more to it."
stednitzrules250,"Feb 21, 2010",10/10,"Shutter Island. A film that will divide the film community. A film that will leave many upset, and hating it. A film that has already completely split the critics. A movie that messes with you. And no one likes to be messed with. And that is exactly where it exceeds. Think I'm contradicting myself?Shutter Island is one of the most well crafted psychological thrillers to come by since Silence Of The Lambs. And it is no coincidence both were brilliantly written novels. Shutter Island is adapted by a book written by Dennis Lehane (wrote gone baby, gone and mystic river). It is a book filled with twists and turns, that will leave the reader dizzy. And, that is what it's film counterpart does to the fullest. Martin Scorsese helms the director chair, in a movie where he is more free than any before. This is Scorsese at his most unrestrained.Marty takes what he has learned from the great films of the past and puts it into his. The master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock's influence is everywhere you look in this film. And it is no wonder, considering Scorsese even showed one of his greatest works to the crew: Vertigo. And many of those ideas are present in Shutter Island; the cliff scenes scream Hitchcock. This is a film that creeps and crawls, and is filled with dark corners. And it is all heightened by the coming storm that looms over the island. This is classic film noir.The story follows Teddy, a federal Marshall, and his partner Chuck (Played by DiCaprio and Ruffulo). They go to this mysterious island enveloped in fog to investigate an escape. From these opening scenes, Marty has set up a dark and creepy premise.Almost the whole movie incorporates this story as Teddy desperately tries to find the truths he seeks. Teddy is shown as a scared man; a man of war and violence as portrayed in various flashbacks. These will go on to be increasingly important as the story progresses. We follow Teddy on his quest, through every dark corridor and perilous confrontations. Slowly, we are given pieces to the puzzle, but the audience does not even realize it. For we, like Teddy, are blind. For the moment at least. It is because of this that the thrilling conclusion will leave many blindsided. But, you see, that is where this thriller becomes something more. We as the audience are put in Teddy's shoes, and we feel all the things he feels. It is a complete assault on the senses, and it works beautifully.This is a film you must watch carefully. That is another thing that sets this apart, it is a horror film that makes you actually think. In this day and age, I'm not surprised some found it terrible esp. after their brains have been turned to mush by these new gore filled horror films. Scorsese's ultimate goal here is to wake you up. And trust me, you probably wont like it.This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing.Shutter Island. A film that will make you question your own sanity. A film that will leave you breathless. A film that has re-ignited the thriller genre. A film that will leave you, and the main character, searching for answers.10 out of 10-CLS"
NpMoviez,"Jul 29, 2018",10/10,"It is one of the best movies made by director Martin Scorsese. It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade. DiCaprio featured in two movies in 2010, the other one being ""Inception"". Both were excellent. To this day, they are some of the best cinematic experience I have ever had. That being said, I found ""Shutter Island"" to be much more superior, as ""Inception"" feels a little bit of a mumbo jumbo many times.Good.
""Shutter Island"" is simply a masterpiece. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, possibly a thriller. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes bigger and bigger with more and more complexity added to it. The way this happens is incredible. The pacing is really good. That is what makes the movie so interesting. And, even though the movie gets more complex, it is not difficult to keep up with the major plot points. And, the final twist is one of the best plot twists I have ever seen. I did not expect it at all. And, like the main character portrayed by DiCaprio, we are not ready to believe what is being told until a lot of reveals finally convince us. There are a lot of many things that might seem to be pointless before the final twist which are totally relevant with the story that is actually being told. The character of Edward Daniels is superbly written. We get to know where the character is coming from and we can get behind the character - yet another excellent thing about this movie. There are some dream sequences that seems like a filler, but is a major indication to the reveal. There are quite many ""illusions"" which feel very real, but carry no real meaning in the end. There are many additional things which may seem like a diversion from the story being told, but are actually enhancing it. Some dialogues between the main character and an imprisoned character get a very different interpretation after it's all set and done. So much of a complex story, yet no giant inconsistencies at all. It's just superbly written and directed and acted. It's totally different from ""Memento"" (2000) but still, has a lot of similarities. We get into the main character's head and we just get his interpretations, different types though. Towards the end, we don't want to step fully outside his head, but when we finally do, it's mind blowing. The ending moments were conceived by many to be confusing. But, if you keep up with the entire story, it's meaning is quite obvious. The movie is dark and psychologically engrossing. Yet it does have a short lived and very brief happy moment with the tiny plotline involving Dr. Cawley's motives. That's all I can say without getting into complete spoilers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly have given some of the great performances till date. I don't have anything that bugged me. So no mixed or bad aspects of the film.Conclusion.
On the whole, for me, it's the movie of the decade. The decade is almost over, and still I have not got any movie in the league of ""Shutter Island"". It's a very engaging and thrilling movie. It's one of those films I consider to be an all time great.Rating.
Score : absolute 10/10
Grade : A+"
0U,"Feb 23, 2020",10/10,"Visually beautiful, wonderfully acted, and relentlessly gripping, Shutter Island is a brilliantly unrestrained psychological thriller that keeps its audience riveted throughout its entire duration."
bkoganbing,"Mar 13, 2010",7/10,"Shutter Island is a body of land in Boston Harbor which has a hospital for the criminally insane. It's run by a pair of doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow who have certainly essayed roles of some very deep villainy. Couple that with the fact that this film is set in post World War II where America has just been fighting with people who have mysterious accents like Von Sydow and Kingsley. It's a recipe for a Hitchcock like thriller.US Marshal Leonardo DiCaprio has been sent to Shutter Island with his new partner Mark Ruffalo to investigate the disappearance of a woman who was declared criminally insane by the courts and is now confined to the island facility. Though it is a hospital also, primarily Shutter Island is a prison and run by the Federal government and subject to their jurisdiction.Although Ruffalo is content to follow DiCaprio's lead, Leo's not happy with the lack of cooperation he's getting on the investigation, even more unhappy that inclement weather is forcing he and Ruffalo to stay on the island. Something suspicious is going on and DiCaprio's going to get to the bottom of it.Actually something very suspicious is going on there, some very intricate mind games are being played, some experimentation is being conducted by the staff. But trust me, it's beyond DiCaprio's powers of grasp.Shutter Island marks the third film that Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio have teamed as director/star. It's possible Leo is trying to tie Robert DeNiro for times working with Scorsese. This part is certainly one a younger DeNiro might have done. I don't think Shutter Island ranks up there with either The Aviator or The Departed it's still an intricately plotted story and one where the lead has to be convincing or the film goes nowhere. DiCaprio doggedly plods on with his investigation while battling some inner demons that the audience is gradually let it on. A younger DeNiro couldn't have been better.The rest of the cast ably supports Leo, but in the final analysis Shutter Island belongs to him and to Martin Scorsese for putting it all together. Alfred Hitchcock would be proud."
TheDeadMayTasteBad,"Feb 23, 2010",9/10,"There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful. For those of you, like me, who read and enjoyed the novel before seeing the film and felt that the trailers and advertisements for this film were leading you to believe there wouldn't be any narrative surprises in store, think again! Scorsese's film features that one brief piece of dialogue at the films conclusion that results in an entirely different perception of the final act. The rest of the film, however, is very faithful to Dennis Lehane's already great story.Shutter Island represents exactly what one should hope for when seeing a novel being interpreted to film. While it certainly does the source material justice, it also adds small changes that make for a distinctive experience. Even if you've read the novel multiple times, you'll feel like you're reading the book for the first time again while watching. Scorsese perfectly recreates the menacing atmosphere of the island on film. Every location is foreboding and drenched with hints of unseen danger in dark corners. The lighthouse, the caves, the civil war fort housing ""the most dangerous patients,"" and the island itself--every locale seems large yet claustrophobic and isolated at the same time.I often experience claustrophobia myself and there are certain films that really capitalize on that personal fear and make it more relevant and eerie to me. Neil Marshall's The Descent was one such picture, and this is another. An confined island is a terrific horror location and it comes with its own type of fear. The utter desperation to escape from a persistent and confined nightmare is something Teddy (Dicaprio) is receiving in high doses, and so does the audience.As with Scorsese and DiCaprio's previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen. Here they explore the horror/thriller genre with gravitas, with no small part played by Laeta Kalogridis in supplying the screenplay. While most modern pictures of its kind lack character or any real sense of suspense, Shutter Island doesn't go for cheap gags. I concur with Ebert when he says one of the key elements to this film is that it releases its tension through suspense instead of mindless action sequences. That's not to knock a well-deserved frenetic scene of violence every once in awhile--it works to the advantage of some films like Evil Dead II and Planet Terror--but had Teddy and Chuck gone running and gunning through the facility's faculty, the mood this movie keeps in check so well would have been lost.However, that mood isn't sacrificed and ""spooky"" is punched up to full force. A considerable amount of that spooky is generated by a ""best of"" collection of actors that have mastered the art of creepy: Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, and Max Von Sydow just to name a few. Had Tom Noonan been thrown in the cast as well, my ""Top Five People I Would Not Want to Be Left in the Dark with, Especially in a Room with No Doors or Windows"" list would have been completely exhausted. On that note, is it just me or has Sydow mysteriously not aged since The Exorcist? Was there a secret pact made between Lucifer and Father Merrin? Whether he sold his soul or not, he's quite ominous in every single scene he is present in. All of this great talent in front of the camera doesn't mean anything though if you don't have a faithful orchestrator behind it. Luckily you have Scorsese leading the lens and he points the movie in the right direction, even if this isn't among his very best works. His style works amazingly with suspense laden projects and at times he even seems to channel Hitchcock and Kubrick, though there's always something distinctively Scorsese about the presentation. I found the editing in the opening scene, with Chuck and Teddy approaching Shutter Island, to be very odd and frantic, though I think the audience will know why Scorsese displayed the scene the way he did after completing the film.With a body of work so impressive, Shutter Island is among captivating company. The good news is that Shutter Island carves out a place of its own in his resume. While no Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, I have no problem placing Shutter side by side The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. The cinematography is bright and gorgeous. Scorsese doesn't rely on the over-grainy, ugly presentation that most modern horror or suspense-riddled thrillers rely on. He uses lush, bright color during daytime and dream sequences to flush out a distinct feeling of terror.Shutter Island isn't just a pretty face, its also got a great story to boot and this is why I've been anticipating the film for so long. As mentioned earlier, I've been exposed and digested the source material myself before seeing the movie. I was worried the trailers for the film were giving away too much through their spots on television and on the silver screen, but Scorsese has added enough to the film for the story to feel fresh even for those ""in the know."" You are transferred in the films paranoia and phobia once the camera pans through the mental facilities open doors. Lehane is one of the luckiest authors on the planet to have his work adapted to the big screen by talents such as Eastwood and Scorsese, but his work is brilliant and deserving of such treatment.At the risk of spoiling plot points for potential viewers who have not read the book, I'll leave a Related Recommendations section concealed in ""Spoiler"" tags. Discussing this story at any length can be quite revealing."
slothhead54,"Feb 17, 2010",9/10,"I just saw Shutter Island this evening, just prior to its American release. I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewing this film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was going to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when watching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average film-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought required. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and definitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who was never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much range to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is excellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I always enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and where the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer."
hitchcockthelegend,"May 8, 2010",7/10,"US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) travels to an island asylum facility for the criminally insane with his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their reason for being at Ashecliff Hospital is to investigate the mysterious disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. But Teddy has another issue to deal with at Ashecliff, namely a meeting with Andrew Laeddis (Elias Koteas), the man he believes responsible for the death of his wife (Michelle Williams). Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become.Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River/Gone Baby Gone""). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane's novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there's no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be.From the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don't exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn't enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty's want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he's trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times...Yet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there's still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker's cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play.Then there's the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but ""Zodiac"" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson's photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is up to the usual tight standard.It's always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There's also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that's me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5/10"
czavaleta73,"Feb 23, 2010",9/10,"I saw this and I knew what to expect going in to the film as I had already read about half of the book but never got the chance to finish it. But I was surprised at how faithful the film was to the original material.The directing was also masterfully done and pretty cool I saw some cool camera tricks I hadn't seen since Martin Scorsese directed Bringing Out The Dead, Martin Scorsese did one great job and everyone was top notch especially Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio and I never though I would jump out of fright especially in a Scorsese film but I did. All in all a solid thriller with a good story and some great performances and for me it's the best film I've seen in 2010 so far."
MovieGuy1990,"Feb 19, 2010",10/10,"From the look of the trailer, Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" looks more like a horror film This is a dangerous place where isolation rules under fascist control. A U.S Marshall is sent to an asylum to investigate a missing patient but discovers so much more. A demon? A ghost? Something more? Is this going to be as disappointing as I think it is?I was skeptical walking into the theater, wondering if this twist could hold water. The film starts with Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, standing on a ferry. They talk about their assignment. What's suspect here is that there is no additional development. We are bam, smack right into the story without so much as an opening montage. All that we see is the men smoking a couple cigarettes. Though this is what begins as momentous development. As our hero smokes we that this isn't the glorified top lit smoking of a beauty or that of a sophisticated and confident gangster. We see that this is a harsher character with poor posture, someone who doesn't sleep well, someone with a deep pastThey are greeted at the gate by guards whose attitudes' seem immediately suspect. Soon we meet Dr Crawley, a seemingly complex and modern man who runs the asylum. However, he soon turns uncooperative with the investigation. Inmates and staff are hiding something but what? Everyone here seems off. Evidence and clues begin to appear but not before our hero seems riddled by psychosis himself. ""You act like all this madness is contagious."" Daniels says to the guard. Is it? Soon we begin to wonder, too, but not before he uncovers the tip of the iceberg and it's not only painfully intimate with his own past but also a mass conspiracy. The Nazis had concentration camps and the Americans have Shutter Island.Though, it doesn't stop here, but to say anything else would do the story injustice Kingsley is in his finest role in years. Similarly, DiCaprio reaches new levels. Amongst others Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Michelle Williams, all play small but wonderful roles. Robert Richardson captures a world all of its own.While Scorsese is a master of film I'd say that his specialty has been more character than story. This is a fresh balance of both. It's a mix of noir and thriller. It's only sort of a horror movie and could be compared to ""The Shining"" but it makes it look like it's a one trick pony.All this praise being said it's not for everyone. The story is complex. It takes some attention. At times it's a bit bleak and dire. Of course it all makes a little less sense when you actually think about it but then again that's film. There are a couple of moments where the story gets lost within itself. Things become a bit too complicated. At this point you might begin to lose faith in its viscosity, but don't worry because the story has you right where its put you."
Xstal,"Mar 27, 2023",8/10,"There's an island where unstable people go, are they prisoners or patients, we just don't know, some kept in cages, some are free, surrounded by a fierce sea, but the doctors have a plan, a manifesto. Two Marshalls make the trip, investigate, when an inmate disappears from the estate, vanishing, into thin air, no one knows quite how or where, then a storm arrives, events then bifurcate.Wonderful performances all round in a tale that may leave more questions than answers at the end as it twists and turns, writhes and squirms, revealing an iceberg of a story that has a lot more going on beneath the surface than you originally anticipated."
tsquared226,"Feb 16, 2010",10/10,"Really, Scorsese should just give it away for anyone. The man is one of the most brilliant directors of our time. Anyway, let me get to the actual movie; I just saw it at a early screening and have to write this while I'm thinking about how stunning it was. Shutter Island is certainly not a typical film, not even for Scorsese. It is a different take for the director, and he does it, as he does every film, perfectly, so much as to be in his own league of film-making. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this: Shutter Island was completely unexpected, and a great start to 2010. It had all the components of a great film, and then some. The acting is spot on from every character; none of it seems forged or out of place. The script is fantastic; it has one of the most intriguing plots I have seen in a while (exception being Tarantino's Basterds). Everything, down to the set's lighting, was perfectly executed. I will say that not everyone will like this; Shutter Island, again, isn't your typical movie. To those, though, who do choose to see this film, be ready for a compelling, gripping, thought-provoking experience, so much so that you might think to see it again for further clarity (I know I will; it was so entertaining and my mind was blown!). Don't be surprised if you see this at the next Oscars..."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Nov 4, 2023",10/10,"US Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule travel to an asylum on a remote island, aiming to discover a missing patient, there they discover some very strange goings on there.Shutter Island is probably in my top twenty films of all time, when I first saw it I didn't fully understand it, since then I've studied all sorts of theories, and tried to put the pieces together.You may need to watch it for a second time, as some of the pieces mah not fall into place, but when they do..... The twist was brilliant, I didn't see it coming first time round.Gripping, imaginative, clever, twisted, engrossing, I could go on, it's a wonderful movie, one that really does make you think, as an attentive viewer you will be hugely rewarded.I don't know why, but to me it's never felt like a Martin Scorsese film, maybe it's the tone or the actual story itself, but it's just so unlike any of this other works.Scorsese always knows how to get the best our of Di Caprio, and once again he delivers, it's a quite brilliant performance.10/10."
IamtheRegalTreatment,"Feb 19, 2010",9/10,"Similar to my rating for this film, you can argue that 9 out of 10 people who watch this movie, it will not be their first Scorsese film. Most of us know the genius that he is and coming into this showing we should expect brilliance, and gladly he delivers a captivating storyline driven by great acting. Unfortunately with the release of Shutter Island was also a press release that Taxi Driver may be remade, so that news made me hesitant to care, but I'm glad I was wrong.Shutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshall sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.Even to begin explaining details of the plot and how everything comes to fruition causes me to feel migraines alike the ones Teddy gets in the movie, therefore I won't ruin anything for you now. Take my honest word that if you enjoyed any Scorsese movie in the past or have enjoyed movies that include surrealism, Shutter Island combines the two into an intense thriller that boggles the mind and possibly even ""corrode it, rusts it"". Also, if you are hesitant to watch this film because the trailer perceives it as a horror film with a lot of ""jumpy"" scenes, ignore that. I had the same feeling entering it, and there was only one towards the very end, but it was worth the shock. You will miss so much detail trying to cover your eyes for a few minutes sporadically throughout that it's not worth it. Take the risk of jumping out of your seat for once, because it was the best scare I could ask for.9/10. Not Martin's best work, but come on, could you make a better movie than him?"
naman-avastol,"Feb 15, 2010",8/10,"Martin Scorsese returns to film making after winning the academy award for The Departed with his fav star Leonardo DiCaprio.. This time he move to a completely different script which keeps the audience humored and thrilled from the first scene till the last! The movie( which i saw at the Berlin film festival!) blew away the minds of many people, the plot being so strong and thrilling which kept the audiences guessing!When it comes to acting Leonardo lets no stone unturned! The supremely talented actor has once again showed that why Martin casts him in his every movie as he is simply superb! He not only fits into the role smoothly but delivers a terrific performance every time! Sir Kingsley being the head psychiatrist of the asylum has also done a marvelous job!The film is full of flashbacks and haunting dream sequences that range in location from the island itself to the concentration camp at Dachau. The audience is constantly trapped in a world where one questions what is reality and what is dream. Don't miss this one!"
TheLittleSongbird,"Aug 6, 2010",9/10,"I like Martin Scorsesse a lot, and I was interested in seeing Shutter Island. It had a truly intriguing concept and my 17-year old sister was raving about how brilliant the film was. Shutter Island is not Scorsesse's best, but it was atmospheric, clever, incredibly thought-provoking and somewhat disturbing too.I do agree it is too long and that it drags in places, that Shutter Island is still very impressive and gripping. The cinematography is great, dark, expressionistic and Gothic. Same with the scenery which is both picturesque and bleak, while the direction is superb, almost operatic and imaginative. The screenplay is intelligent and the plot gripping and clever, however Shutter Island is one of those films that if you miss a line of dialogue or a plot point you are in danger of missing something important. I also liked the music- admittedly the repeated bass motif which has a knock-on-the-door effect makes us think immediately that something out of the ordinary is going to happen but I have to admit it was haunting, while the Mahler chamber music piece along with the more gut-wrenching images at Dacchau was put to effective use, though coming from a classical music enthusiast I never knew Mahler wrote chamber music.The acting is very good, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are both excellent, and Mark Ruffalo was surprisingly good too. Max Von Sydow is also good, and although I wasn't sure about Michelle Williams at first she was suitably eerie and haunting. Finally the ending, some have said it was clever, others were underwhelmed by it. For me, I found it very clever and it was actually the part of the film that made me think about most. Of course it leaves questions rather than answers, but I think that was the point, it is ambiguous and open to interpretation and I certainly would have never thought of that. There could also be the possibility that there is no right or wrong answer, we are left to wonder for ourselves whether he was sane or not, and I think that was a reason for why the film ended inconclusively- I for one asked myself what did happen to Ted?Overall, very gripping and clever, with an ending that really makes you think. It is not what I consider a perfect film, but the direction and acting makes up for any misgivings. Plus it is probably a film you need to see more than once to completely understand or appreciate it. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
norbertranjith,"Jul 11, 2018",10/10,"I have been avoiding this movie for almost 8 years, since it got mixed reviews when it was released.I loved Scorcese's movies and was looking forward to watching this when it was released. But the trailer didn't impress and then the reviews.Watched it last night, and loved it. Watched it today again and was pleasantly surprised that the second view was more satisfying than the first go round. It's amazing how a different perspective can give a whole different movie experience. Scorsese is a genius!!!"
maureenmcqueen,"Feb 21, 2010",8/10,"Yes, Scorsese's eye is all over ""Shutter Island"" what I din't feel was his gut. And for me a Scorsese film bears his gut. From ""Mean Streets"" to ""The Age Of Innocence"", ""The King Of Comedy"", ""New York, New York"" The presence of his gut, his poetic gut, his Scorsese gut, made those experiences, emotional and timeless. ""Shutter Island"" is extraordinary to look at. It has some bravura shots that will take your breath away. It's no uniquely Scorsesian like, ""Raging Bull"" ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"" It doesn't have the energy and passion of ""Taxi Driver"" or the commitment of ""Bringing Out The Dead"", ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" or ""Gangs of New York"", doesn't have the freshness of ""After Hours"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" Doesn't have the scope or ambition of neither ""The Aviator"" nor ""The Departed"" but I liked it very much."
masonsaul,"Apr 29, 2020",9/10,"Despite some brief but weak CG, Shutter Island is an incredible psychological thiller that's extremely suspenseful, atmospheric and unpredictable. Leonardo DiCaprio is incredible and both Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley are great. It's extremely well paced and the music Robbie Robertson is amazing. Martin Scorsese's direction is excellent and it's beautifully filmed."
brahmjeetsinghnagpal,"Oct 17, 2019",10/10,"'Shutter Island' is perhaps one of the best, if not the best, movies ever directed by Martin Scorsese. One cannot comprehend the experience in one-go. You will have to watch it twice or thrice to understand it enough, which is why Scorsese himself said back in 2010 that the movie would earn double profits because of people going to watch the movie twice.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow. They have, without doubt, given an excellent performance. And since it is directed by Martin Scorsese, you will of course be appealed by the cinematography and direction. But what's the most striking feature of this movie, the thing that makes this movie a real success is it's plot. The movie is an adaptation of the 2003 novel 'Shutter Island' by Dennis Lehane. The first half of the movie is calm and steady, but it is only a setting up for the terrific, unexpected ending which is absolutely shocking and jaw-dropping. There are several clues and intentional continuing errors that foreshadow the twist ending. The film is also filled with anagrams reminding me of which, did you know that the title 'Shutter Island' is actually an anagram for 'Truth and Lies'.The background score is also amazing, especially the one by Gustav Mahler. The background score maintains the rythm of the movie.There is only one inclusion by Martin Scorsese in the film which was not originally in the novel, the dialogue ""Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"", which happens to be one of the most famous quotes in cinema.Overall, 'Shutter Island' is completely watchable and enjoyable. There is a lot to learn in this film while it intensifies you. Personally for me, it is the best psychological thriller."
lesleyharris30,"Jul 25, 2013",9/10,"Shutter Island is an absolute breathtaking movie with a tremendous storyline that will keep you interested all the way through and a brilliant cast that all follow through with their performances in an overall terrific film once again from the great Martin Scorsese.The movie sounded pretty plain to me,I thought it would be an average thriller that I would enjoy but it would be pretty forgettable,but it totally wasn't,the movie had me curious and also confused,and the twist was one of the greatest,most surprising and most shocking twists i've ever seen in a movie,I literally never suspected it,not even once,and when it did happen I still didn't believe it.Shutter Island is a must see for all fans of Leonardo DiCaprio,Martin Scorsese,thriller and mystery.Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio),a US Marshall,sets out with his partner to a mental institution in a quiet island to investigate where a missing patient could have gone.But there's something suspicious about the island that they didn't bargain for."
theognis2,"Mar 13, 2025",7/10,"This show involves such a jumble of the real, surreal, impressions, images, dreams and nightmares that it takes awhile to parse it out. A US marshal (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) visit a mysterious ""island of lost souls,"" seeking a woman, who is a patient in an insane asylum, run by two psychiatrists (Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow). The atmospherics by Director Martin Scorsese are excellent and gradually, we get what's going on, but it takes patience. This clever, unique film recalls Vladimir Nabokov, who in his afterward to his 1955 novel, ""Lolita,"" described this genre as ""He acts crazy. We all act crazy, I guess. I guess God acts crazy. Etc."""
nelson_keith,"Feb 17, 2010",10/10,"I read the novel so I knew the story going in, and I still got chills in several places and really was moved at how incredibly good this movie is. I won't get into the plot, because that could spoil things, but Leonardo DiCaprio investigates a missing patient/inmate in a top-secret island fortress for the criminally insane. He keeps getting frustrated as his interviews with doctors and patients raise more questions than answers. Ben Kingsley, who plays the primary doctor on the island, deserves a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, and we will see how far the rest of the cast and movie will go into next year's awards.The best comparisons for me were the Shining, for the psychological horror aspects of both movies. And a little bit of Silence of the Lambs, when the hero goes into a row of cells to talk with one of the inmates/patients. DiCaprio is good, but not up to the level of a younger Jack Nicholson, who would have been absolutely brilliant in this part when he was in his mid-thirties.I am not sure if someone who hasn't read the book will be confused by some of the story... or simply be blown away at how it unfolds.I have seen all of Martin Scorsese's movies and this is one of his top 5 or 6, better than Cape Fear, Aviator and the Departed but a hair below Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver.This is a very scary movie, the truest horror film Scorsese has ever done. I can't recommend it to my wife or otherwise squeamish viewers, there are too many terrifying moments for them to enjoy it.What a great movie, I will surely see it again in the theaters. Haven't seen one twice since the Hurt Locker, and before that one it's been 10 years."
jethrotroll-30807,"Oct 22, 2025",6/10,"Even in 2025, I went into this movie completely blind. Knew nothing about it other than DiCaprio and Scorsese, so I thought it would be a worthwhile watch. I came away with mixed feelings.Most by now have probably seen this movie, so I really shouldnt care that much about any spoilers, but out of respect for those that havent seen it, I'll refrain from giving the plot twist away. I'll say that I was surprised by the twist at the end, as I thought it was headed a different direction. And things that were confusing earlier suddenly made much more sense. Still, the twist at the end open to interpretation, leaving the viewer grappling with what exactly happened, how much (DiCaprio) knows, and who's playing who.However, I found the movie just odd at times. It's hard to describe, but some scenes seen extraordinarily despotic. And others I found completely unrealistic. How DiCaprio's character suddenly had the ability to scale up and down jagged cliffs is beyond me, but he did. Another thing that struck me at different points in the movie is the feeling that I was watching a James Bond film, especially the scenes around the water, lighthouse and cliffs.All in all, this wasnt Scorsese's best film. I thought it came across clunky and unbelievable at times. Does the plot twist make it a worthwhile viewing? Eh, the movie just didnt do anything for me. It didnt stay with me or deliver any kind of message. It's a long, clunky slightly entertaining and confusing movie. I waited 15 years to see it, and would have been happy waiting much longer."
Legendary_Badass,"Feb 19, 2010",9/10,"A 1950s ward for the criminally insane isn't a pleasantry for anyone. The terror behind the walls has a mystique to the public. It's as though unspeakable acts of torture can exist within the confines of padded rooms so long as the public never witnesses first hand. The isolation, or in the case of Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island the possibility of it, could be enough to drive you insane.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels. Having met up with new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), he's on assignment to investigate the disappearance of Rachel (Emily Mortimer) from the secluded mental hospital on Shutter Island. During his visit, Teddy is plagued by vivid recollections of his days as a soldier liberating a Nazi death camp and visions of Delores, his deceased wife (Michelle Williams). These tie in with Teddy's ulterior motives: investigating rumored inhuman experiments and locating his wife's murderer.I didn't read the book; get used to it. I watch movies and I review them on their own merit. I'm not one to bicker about the source material being wronged when I know full well that a book typically contains an unfilmable heap of situations that need to be whittled down into entertainment in a convenient sub-three hour block. I care about the movie, and in the case of Shutter Island I speculate that fans of the book will have a far different experience since they should have a very solid notion of what happens. For me, someone new to the material, Shutter Island is captivating.When it comes to the plot there is a ton that I'd like to discuss, but can't simply because this is a puzzle film and I don't want to ruin it's intricately woven pattern of suspense. I'll say that some elements are very familiar, but that doesn't stop it from being a shocker. Elsewhere I can say that it's a well-crafted film on technical levels. The visions of the dead wife are often complemented with CGI that's used with discretion. Cinematography is strong, showing the colors reminiscent of a similar era prison film, The Shawshank Redemption. Originally I felt that the theatrical score was beating me over the head, but it didn't take long to assist in providing atmosphere. Editing also plays a role as cuts are made in unorthodox fashion, purposely creating misaligned audio, but this pertains mostly to the dream sequences. The cast even excels as each role becomes deeper than speculated. Leo gives another powerful performance now that he's cleared the hurdle of being typecast as ""the kid"".When it comes to the twisted thrillers, I prefer endings to be less blatant. With Shutter Island the longwinded conclusion spells out every last possibility. I'm not looking for something open to interpretation, but requiring more participation. There's still plenty of evidence to spot that you'd want to view it again for the details or chat with friends. As I think more about it, that's what separates the thrillers from the horrors. The thrillers make you think about outcomes, motives, and twists. Shutter Island doesn't tie itself into a knot, but it gets close. That frustration can polarize an audience, but if you've trusted in me this far then you're ahead of the game.NOTE: If you are playing the Shutter Island drinking game, be sure to take a shot each and every time Mark Ruffalo says ""boss"". That's the only rule you'll need."

JoshuaMoody_GovP_2022,"Jun 5, 2021",10/10,"I was on-edge for the entire duration of the feature. I love psychological thrillers and Martin Scorsese. I feel that this film is highly-underrated and under-appreciated. It may be because of my forensic psychiatric training, but regardless, I understood and loved every bit of it, unlike some other viewers who lacked the ability to relate to the darkness of the film."

Screen_Blitz,"Dec 31, 2015",8/10,"Martin Scorcese has laid many cinematic landmarks in crime genre, and as a result, has earned a spot as one of the most influential directors to ever step foot in Hollywood. He has been met with much critical acclaim with his gritty portrayal of the gangster life in his film such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and The Departed. Teaming up with his frequent collaborator Leonardo Dicaprio, Scorcese takes a more dark and surreal direction in this psychological thriller set with plenty of twists and turns. Leonardo Dicaprio plays U.S Marshal Teddy Daniels, who travels across seas to investigate a mysterious and deserted island along with his partner Chucke Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo). There lies a hospital run by Dr. Cawley (played by Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Neahring (played by Max Von Sydow) holding mentally insane prisoners, where Daniels and Aule are in search of a patient named Rachel who has mysteriously disappeared. Going further into their investigation, the two quickly turn the dark and sinister secrets behind the wretched prison of a hospital, soon to the point where Daniels deteriorating of his mental state and his identity all together.Mixing elements of neo noir and elements of pure horror, this film conveys a dark and surreal plot that unfolds to something truly shocking and well crafted in a unique way. The psychological elements conveyed throughout the story go very deep in ways that may remind those who seen films like 'Seven' or 'The Sixth Sense' as these both deal with individuals who are psychological damaged. This film paces steadily through one spine- chilling thrill after another, and as the story progresses, the tone gets more and more eerie; building up an astonishing plot twist at the end that is likely to leave you startled. Like David Fincher's 'Seven', this film never lightens up in tone, giving you the feeling of hopelessness throughout its run time, yet it's still entertaining. The plot doesn't go without its flaws however. The film has its moments where gets overly convoluted to the point I could leave you scratching your head. Ultimately, the plot picks up not to soon before it reaches its grim climax.Leonardo Dicaprio has been one of my favorite actors for as long I can remember, an actors always shows off powerful performances, yet has never landed an Oscar for his works. His performance as the main character Teddy Daniels is terrific. He is very charismatic throughout, especially when his character go through some spine-chilling changes. Mark Ruffalo who plays his partner also deserves some applause for his performance, playing his role very solid and willfully. Ruffalo is who I believe is an underrated actor and hope garners an Oscar one day (as well as Dicaprio).Shutter Island is a twisted, but stunning piece of entertainment by Martin Scorcese, complete with a terrific screenplay, powerful performances, and a strong narrative that grabs your attention. This is much different than the typical Scorcese fare. Nonetheless, it is astonishingly entertaining."
Ltrgman,"Feb 28, 2010",6/10,"Like any fan of Scorsese, I was very excited to see this film, but left disappointed. The build up of the story was fantastic: Hurricane season. Deary and moody. Epic shots of this huge, foreboding island. Haunting score that puts your senses on alert. Ominous mental asylum. Everything hinted at an instant classic thriller; another Scorsese masterpiece. With the 1950s setting, the U.S. Marshals/detectives, missing person case and the bleak tone the film was establishing, there was even a noir feel to it.As the story progresses, the protagonist (DiCaprio) starts having these off-kilter flashbacks, and among one of them, a story that tells of his time in the Second World War. This is where I think the film hits its highest note. How all these different flashbacks fit into this puzzle that is this mental asylum, Shutter Island, is the mystery you're anxiously waiting to be unraveled. If your history is up to par then you'll know how fitting the WWII plot element is to the overall story of the film, which is also ultimately where I think the movie left me underwhelmed. I understand this film is based off of a novel, a set script, but I wish Scorsese would've explored more of the aforementioned plot element and done away with the tired, cliché story that eventually unfolds.To the film's credit, the cinematography, score, set design, wardrobe and the often forgotten, lighting (very creepy and effective at times), were all marvelously done. DiCaprio, who I'm not a big fan of, was actually quite enjoyable and solid. Often times he doesn't seem to really fit the bill of the role, but in Shutter Island I was a believer. DiCaprio's character was very ""alive"" to me. The acting by the rest of the supporting cast were top notch as well. Mark Ruffalo, who I think is a very underrated actor, was a nice surprise as I didn't know he was going to be in this film.Overall, 6 stars or a B-. Worth the watch but not something I would eventually buy on DVD."

eva3si0n,"Jan 8, 2021",9/10,"Shuttle Island is a great thriller with a strong cast. It may seem that DiCaprio 's acting obscures everything else, so cool he plays. And the climax of the film completely turns it 180 degrees, now there are not many films that manage this moment."
WillWesley,"Feb 25, 2010",8/10,"Shutter Island. The story starts you off with a strong suspense of something really wrong in the so called island. It then develops a very subtle intrigue to the story, which keeps us assuming and guessing repeatedly on what the actual truth is. When the story progresses, just when you've received the pieces of the puzzle to actually delve the story, you then realize that you've been working on the right pieces, but in the wrong puzzle.The acting was very good and well coordinated. You could feel the dramatization of the characters and subtle elements that will keep your mind moving. They also arranged the sound well, with a simple yet chilling heavy bass orchestra to psyche up the moment, and at the same time complete silence to pique in your senses. I was a bit disappointed with some parts of the editing, but these small bricks didn't affect any major enjoyment of the movie.This movie should be watched with great attention to detail, to give yourself a satisfying outcome once all the mysteries unwind itself, leaving you with a repeating portrait of the story in your mind."
chiragrathod09,"Apr 29, 2023",10/10,"Martin Scorsese's *Shutter Island*, is a masterful psychological thriller that intricately weaves suspense and mystery, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Based on Dennis Lehane's novel, the film features a haunting atmosphere, compelling performances, and a labyrinthine plot that delves deep into the human psyche.Set in 1954, the story follows U. S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), who, alongside his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), arrives at the remote Shutter Island, home to a psychiatric facility for the criminally insane. They are there to investigate the disappearance of a patient named Rachel Solando, who seemingly vanished from a locked cell. As the investigation unfolds, Daniels grapples with eerie surroundings and the facility's mysterious staff, raising questions about the island's dark secrets and the true nature of sanity.Scorsese's direction seamlessly blends the palpable tension and Gothic elements, creating a gripping atmosphere that feels both claustrophobic and disorienting. The cinematography is striking, with sweeping shots of the storm-lashed island and dimly lit hallways that enhance the film's overall sense of dread.Leonard DiCaprio's performance is a standout, effectively capturing the character's turmoil and haunted past. The relationship between Teddy and Chuck adds depth to the narrative, as their partnership evolves amidst the growing sense of paranoia surrounding them. The supporting cast, including Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo, deliver powerful performances that further enrich the film's unsettling intrigue.What truly sets *Shutter Island* apart is its ability to provoke thought and maintain suspense. The story invites viewers to ponder the themes of guilt, grief, and the elusive nature of reality. As secrets are uncovered and lines between reality and illusion blur, audiences will find themselves questioning what is true and what is merely a construct of the mind.Ultimately, *Shutter Island* is a cinematic tour de force that captivates and challenges its viewers. Scorsese has crafted a film that transcends genre conventions, creating a haunting experience that lingers long after the credits roll. For those who appreciate psychological thrillers that are rich in atmosphere and complexity, *Shutter Island* is an unforgettable journey into the human mind that should not be missed."
gradyharp,"Jun 10, 2010",10/10,"Too rarely are we offered films that are so well written (Laeta Kalogidis does a marvelous adaptation of Dennis Lahane's mesmerizing novel) that after viewing the audience is almost afraid to leave the theater or home screen for fear they may have missed some important information that will help them figure out why the story is so successfully enigmatic. Such is the case for Martin Scorsese's brilliant film, SHUTTER ISLAND. It is only in retrospect, after the shock of the film is over, that the magic of quality cinematic achievement can be appreciated. Then in rethinking the events the film portrays so well the story is as straightforward as Scorsese's vision.The film opens in 1954 nothingness - from out of the fog slowly appears a ship headed toward Shutter Island, a terrifying prison for the criminally insane, and almost incidentally we meet US Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) emetically cloistered in a ship's lavatory while his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) awkwardly waits for him on deck. The two are on a mission to investigate the escape of a female prisoner. They are greeted by curious wardens who escort them onto the terrifyingly ugly and ominous island to meet with the famous psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow). Curious restrictions are placed on the Marshals who decide to return to Boston because of lack of cooperation from the psychiatrists. A hurricane prevents their exit and slowly the story unwinds: Daniels is haunted by memories of his war experience in viewing the concentration camps in Dachau and delusion of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in nightmares he cannot explain. The various aspects of the Marshals' investigation lead them to all of the compounds where prisoners are kept and treated and surgically altered and the terror mounts. To tell more of the story of one man's descent in to madness would distract from the viewer's own grappling with the conundrum of this tale. It must be seen to appreciate the brilliance of the story.In addition to superb performances by DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, von Sydow, and Williams there are astonishing well crafted cameos by Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, John Carroll Lynch and a very large cast of bit players. The cinematography is superbly crafted by Robert Richardson. The music score for this moody piece is a montage of works by such brilliant composers as György Ligeti, Krzystof Penderecki, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Schnittke, Lou Harrison, John Adams and even Gustav Mahler whose rarely heard 'Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor' plays a significant role in the film. On all accounts this is a superb film. Why it did not do well in the theatrical run is puzzling: perhaps it is a long film that is way ahead of its time. Watch it on DVD and become absorbed by all the bizarre mysteries it captures.Grady Harp"

socklessmenace,"Feb 23, 2010",7/10,"I am an extreme movie goer. So obviously I follow the works of the great Martin Scorsese. I heard this movie was also a thinker and much like an old style Hitchcock film. Considering Hitchcock is my favourite director and is a master at his work and a genius at the art of psychological horror...I was overwhelmed with excitement for this movie.In all I say the plot of this movie was...okay. Don't get me wrong, it's very smart and completely original and as far as I know not done before. However, if you are as much a movie buff as myself this twist ending is a give away obvious one right off the bat. this is why it lost 3 stars for me. However, it touches on many emotions and other aspects besides the main plot of the film and runs deeper then its first visible roots. A truly complex film.Now on too why I gave it the seven stars. Martin Scorsese, Martin Scorsese, Martin Scorsese. If for no other reason, see this film for its amazing directing. Shutter Island truly brings back the psychological thriller and is both beautifully and horrifyingly directed. This right here is why Scorsese is known for being a true dominator of his medium.And so for Performance of the movie by both the actors and director I give this movie a probable 9.5 but for plot and story I give it a probable 6. I recommend it, but for those real film buffs out there who know the layout of how movies work and are good at guessing the twist endings...don't get your hopes up. However 45% of the people I went with said they didn't understand it so I guess that can be taken into account as well."

ComedyFan2010,"Jun 12, 2018",10/10,"I guess when looking at the names of director and the cast one knows that it can't go wrong. And it didn't. I loved this movie through it's 138 minutes and it didn't even seem that long.Now I can't say if the big twist towards the end was very well hidden. Unfortunately I heard it before I watched it. Which is not surprising considering that I waited almost 10 years to do so. So when watching there were moments where I would think ""Now here people should have guessed it"". Especially in the second half of the movie. But this could just be me knowing it and seeing the clues more clearly, just as people who rewatched it did. But regardless, even though I knew the ending I really enjoyed the movie so somebody who guessed it at the very beginning but still was questioning it would as well.The cinematography is great. So much film noir in it. It is a movie that gives one this suspense that keeps one watching. The cast is all great. Including the small parts of guards and mental patients. And the main characters gave so much character to the movie. I won't list all their names because I literally would list all of them. If anyone of them would played by a different actor it wouldn't be the same.And I loved the ending. I am not talking about the twist that I already discussed but the very ending. The final quote that makes us understand the ending better. I loved it. This actually took me by surprise and I think it couldn't have ended better. It gives the movie and DiCaprio's character so much more depth."
gavin6942,"Feb 19, 2010",8/10,"US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are dispatched to Shutter Island, a facility that combines mental health treatment and criminal detention. One patient, Rachel Solando, is missing and has slipped through the walls as if through evaporation. Where on the island could she have gone?DiCaprio and Scorsese are a great team, let's just say that right away. If you've seen ""The Aviator"", ""The Departed"" or -- my favorite -- ""Gangs of New York"", you are aware of the greatness these two can achieve. While I do not feel ""Shutter Island"" is on par with ""Departed"" or ""Gangs"", it can still be counted as a fine film in its own right.The scenery captures the feel of the 1950s and the dank lonesome feeling that accompanies insane asylums of this period. Much like Arkham Asylum, the very building itself comes off as creepy and disturbing as those it houses. Poorly lit, plenty of stairs and mezzanine, and a feeling of oozing insanity. The inmates here are nasty, not least of which is George Noyce (played by the same man who brought us Rorschach and the upcoming Freddy Krueger).Michelle Williams, while only seen in dreams and flashbacks, really captures the viewer with her role of Dolores. This is quite possibly her best role yet, overshadowing her work in ""Brokeback Mountain"". Could we see a Best Supporting Actress nod? I freely admit that tears were brought to my eyes by her performance.I appreciated how closely the film followed the book by Dennis Lehane (author of ""Mystic River""). Unfortunately for those who read it, the twists won't be as shocking, though you might pick up on the clues before your friends do. The film downplays much of the detective aspect, and almost completely removes the code-breaking parts. You could fairly say it has been dumbed-down.Scorsese, or his screenwriter, have also added in plenty of extra violence to turn this into a bit of an action flick. An extra gun shot here, a needle there, a firing squad sequence... this works well to keep viewers engaged. At the same time, the inclusion of the Dachau flashbacks dragged the pace down, and I think this will not work with some audiences. The biggest complaint I've heard yet was about the film's length.After seeing what I felt were disappointing previews for ""Shutter Island"", the film comes out well and on par with the book, a rare event. They use every tool at their disposal to amp up the visuals, and while the final twist may have you recalling other films (it's not the most original), all in all it's a fine piece of cinema. Along with ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" and ""Youth in Revolt"", it is one of the best films of 2010 (so far)."
hughiebyrne,"Mar 12, 2010",6/10,"I went to this movie expecting something intelligent and stylishly executed. I left feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. The story has been done before, so its not clever anymore and i'm not being arrogant when i say it was obvious from the start. Its edited very amateurishly (I don't agree with those saying it was representative of the main characters frame of mind) and there is far too much use of CGI on outside scenes in cars and both. It seemed to me as well that there were some scenes just thrown into the movie that had no actual purpose. e.g the scene in the car with the warden talking about violent. maybe it was too intelligent for me..."

webmaster-3017,"Apr 5, 2010",8/10,"Dark and intense mental therapy...Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor and together with director Martin Scorsese, DiCaprio moves up a notch. It is not an understatement to claim that Shutter Island only works because DiCaprio makes it convincing. It may seem to be one of Scorsese lesser work in first glance. However, the film does not disappoints, with enough suspense and interesting moments to get us through to the finish line. The ending itself is what made this film a cut above genre conventions. The film ends by raising more questions than it answers and in turn allowing the audience to decide for themselves as to what really happened. For me, it works, but for those looking for answers, it will probably just leave you wondering. Shutter Island is like a classic noir flick, its dark, its murky, it's even depressing, but it is also quite a satisfying experience to sit through.The movie goes like this: DiCaprio plays a cop who is assigned to an isolated island with a mental hospital. The year is the 1950s and a mental patient have escaped the maximum security of the Shutter Island. Together with his counterpart (played by Mark Ruffalo), they explore the island and like a haunted house or a horror story, nothing is what it seems to be.Ben Kinsley is what you call a method character actor. He has the unique ability to make even the griminess of smile into something hidden or evil about it. He has the grin and looks of a cunning interior. Kingsley plays a mental health professor, but somehow he is more to it than that. A clever actor in his own right, Kingsley made his character quite an interesting one to watch. DiCaprio as mentioned before carries the film with both of his shoulders. Maturity has certainly passed him by and not for the first time, he continues to impress me with the emotional range that he possesses. His moment of mental breakdown is a joy to watch and if that moment near the end is given to a lesser light, the film may have already been blown off the rails. This is a steady-fast performance that works.All in all, Shutter Island is a departure from the director usual aim of winning awards, but that does not mean that Shutter Island is any lesser of a movie. With strong acting turns from the increasingly reliable DiCaprio and the ever intriguing presence of Ben Kingsley, Shutter Island is convincing enough to be believable. The thought provoking ending may actually be a blessing in disguise. There is a quote that leaves us pondering: ""Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?"" For me, what it means is that DiCaprio chose to erase his memory and die a good man. The reason to it is simple. One of the saddest and toughest aspects of life is to have a good memory. Memories are what shape us, but also is what makes us more cynical and bitter about the world. At the end of the day, Martin Scorsese has created a movie that allows the audience to come up with their own viewpoint of what happens. Whether that is a good or bad thing, it is really the way you approach and think...(Neo 2010)I rate it 8/10www.thehkneo.com"
carteros,"Apr 9, 2021",10/10,Amazing acting! The attention to detail is incredible and the plot was just great overall.
jimbo-53-186511,"Sep 17, 2014",8/10,"1954; US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is investigating the disappearance of a patient who has escaped from a psychiatric hospital on Shutter Island. Once Teddy begins his investigations, he notices strange anomalies such as; Rachel managing to escape from a room that has been locked from the outside, the fact that she manages to bypass all the other patients and security staff without anyone noticing etc. Daniels is puzzled by Rachel's seemingly 'unexplainable' disappearance and is determined to get to the bottom of it.I'll be the first to say that mystery films are probably my favourite genre (when they're done right) and films like Shutter Island help to cement that feeling. Shutter Island hooked me in straight away due to how creepy it looked - this was down to some superb cinematography. Then as the film progressed, I found that I was more and more hooked in. Shutter Island takes you in one direction, but then pulls you in another direction and it's all these twists and turns that help to keep things fresh. I felt a constant sense of paranoia throughout this film. I found that I never knew who I could trust when I was watching this film and this merely helped to increase the suspense. Daniels' dream sequences gave his character an added depth, but also added another layer to the plot. I found that Shutter Island not only kept me in suspense, but also kept me thinking and the two elements combined are cinematic heaven as far as I'm concerned.Acting wise, Scorsese has got lots of big players on board such as DiCaprio, Kingsley and Von Sydow to name a few and all the players on board put in stellar performances. As mentioned, the cinematography was superb and this really helped to give Shutter Island a creepy and mysterious feel.Where Shutter Island falters slightly is in the heavy handed way it dealt with one particular plot twist (which I won't reveal). Suffice it to say, this did lessen the impact when it was revealed. However, just when I was prepared to be majorly disappointed, Shutter Island throws in more twists and turns after the obvious twist was revealed and these added twists did surprise me somewhat.This is an excellent film that will most likely appeal to fans of psychological thrillers or mystery films. I loved it and would strongly recommend that you watch it."
Branz_Reviews,"Apr 28, 2021",8/10,"This movie was great, loved every moment of it definately had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through, I found it to be a little slow starting but half an hour in is where its at.At this point its getting crazy without spoiling any I will only say visions, figures and talent! Such a great story.Definitely watch this movie!"
Elvis-Del-Valle,"Nov 10, 2023",9/10,"Without a doubt, another of Martin Scorsese's best films, Shutter Island is a clever and quite original psychological thriller. It is a story that has not been seen in other films and with an intriguing twist. Leonardo DiCaprio has always been a talented actor and here he does a wonderful job as Detective Teddy who will discover that his reality is not what it seems. It focuses a lot on the psychology of the character with a series of flashbacks and nightmares that are key to discovering the truth about this character. It has a very good atmosphere that knows how to combine suspense with dramatic moments. You can really appreciate the production, the photography and the dark atmosphere that can be felt in some scenes. The script is quite intelligent, giving many key pieces that come together little by little. The editing is somewhat questionable and some continuity errors are noted. The rest of the film is great and the way he handles trauma in a mind disturbed enough to create a different reality in order to bury said trauma is striking. Shutter Island is one of the best psychological suspense thrillers ever made and another great work by Scorsese. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10."
kristyglantang,"Sep 6, 2021",9/10,"I thought I was ready for the ending when my friends recommended 'Shutter Island' to me. I had been connecting the puzzle throughout every scene, without realizing what a mega puzzle it actually was. To sculpt such a giant plot twist was remarkable, and I would put it on my list with similar masterpieces that contain elements of surprises like 'Now You See Me', 'Fractured'.Leonardo wowed me, on how he could portray a character full of questions, only to find even a bigger question! Obviously, his acting in this very movie was the key that opened the doors to his next amazing roles such as the 'Inception', and 'Great Gatsby', because his characters have always left such an impression in his audiences."
Amine_Ltaief,"Jul 14, 2025",10/10,"An extraordinary, captivating, and truly exceptional film, one of the finest I've ever seen in terms of both screenplay and acting.The main characters were perfectly crafted, and the performances delivered with remarkable finesse and creativity.The screenplay was coherent and seamless, and the design, color palette, and visuals were in beautiful harmony with the story.The direction was solid, though I believe it could have been taken to a higher level to fully elevate this work into a complete artistic masterpiece.It would be a disservice not to give this film a perfect score.To those who haven't seen it yet you're missing out on something truly special."
shutupandcolour,"Aug 28, 2021",10/10,"This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over and still find some new subtle clues, messages, and twists. I watch it every few years, since it came out, and I still find things that make me sit on the edge of my seat and excitedly point at the TV. It is so incredibly thorough down to the smallest detail and it keeps you glued to the screen. The depth of feeling and emotion Leonardo DiCaprio played in this is so beautiful and intense. It's infuriating to think of all of the outstanding work he has performed over the years and only just recently won his first Oscar. I believe he was absolutely deserving of one from Shutter Island, let alone his other performances.If you can, pick up the Blu Ray and watch the extra features after the movie. One of the coolest things to me was that they actually brought in the Medical Director from the now defunct, extremely notorious Bridgewater Hospital which was one of the most ill-reputed mental institutions in the United States. The fact that he leant his experience into creating the atmosphere and emotion from his own work into this movie was amazing."
ilkerdogramaci,"Aug 16, 2021",10/10,"I want to start by saying that I found the movie almost perfect and watched it with admiration. It is a film that comes to life with a very original plot and scenario. The story is kept alive by the acting. Consistently, Teddy Daniels' dilemma has progressed quite impressively. These were at a level that could even change the viewer's mind from time to time. It was a classic movie full of mind games that made you think which character is bad, actually there are no bad characters in every aspect. It's one of those movies that I can tell you not to die without watching."
howard.schumann,"Feb 28, 2010",6/10,"Based on a novel by Dennis Lehane and adapted for the screen by Laeta Kalogridis, Martin Scorsese's psychological thriller Shutter Island is set in 1954 on a remote island off the Massachusetts coast that houses Ashecliffe, a mental hospital for the criminally insane. This is where Teddy Daniels, a United States Marshal played by Leonardo DiCaprio, arrives with his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando, a patient who was incarcerated after murdering her three children. The missing woman appears to have vanished barefoot without a trace from her locked cell during the night after leaving a strange note.Backed by production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Robert Richardson, Scorsese builds a dark, foreboding atmosphere that soon escalates into full-blown uncertainty and dread as the story unfolds. Incorporating aspects of different genres, Shutter Island keeps the viewer off-balance and unable to ascertain with certainty what is real and what is fantasy until the very end. As the investigation begins, we soon discover that the marshal has some back stories of his own that are making things more difficult for him. These include nightmare visions of liberating Dachau at the end of World War II and of lining up and shooting Nazi guards as payback. He is also beset with migraine headaches and flashback visions of his wife Delores (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire.Teddy and Chuck question patients and orderlies who last saw the missing woman but things become more interesting when they interrogate the psychiatrist in charge, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). Cawley talks a great deal about his disdain for pre-frontal lobotomies and use of Thorazine and his preference for talk-based therapy but puzzlingly refuses to provide the investigators with important documents they need for their investigation. Also interviewed is Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow) whose Germanic persona causes Teddy to have flashbacks of Dachau and raises doubts in his mind that he is being told the truth. People talk in whispers and everyone seems to be keeping a secret and the attitude of Warden (Ted Levine) and Deputy Warden (John Carroll) only adds to the mystery.As a Category 5 hurricane rolls in, it becomes apparent that no one is going to get off the island anytime soon and doubts begin to arise in Teddy's mind as to whether or not there really was a patient that disappeared or whether he may have been lured to the island under false pretenses. Before long we are immersed in whispers of government experiments being conducted on prisoners in the island's lighthouse, an item straight out of today's headlines where a fully clothed, mutated human body was recently reported washed ashore on Plum Island in Long Island Sound where the U.S. allegedly studies dangerous animal diseases.Fear is ratcheted up even higher when Daniels reveals a personal agenda of his own that sends the investigation off on a tangent. Unfortunately, the flashbacks, visions, and other visual pyrotechnics pile up, and what began as an intriguing mystery becomes an ordeal of repetitive psychological horror with the screen often filled with tasteless images such as those of dead children and holocaust victims. Though the last fifteen minutes brings a degree of resolution, Shutter Island ultimately wastes the considerable talents of its outstanding cast with an overwrought and overblown production whose premise is neither logical nor believable."
neerajpatodi,"Feb 19, 2010",7/10,"Shutter Island is a movie with Martin Scorsese signature all over it. How fantastic direction can made ordinary plot interesting is the highlight of movie? Nice camera movement, shadow photography, multiple flashbacks and capable cast selection made this one worth watching.Even though plot of movie is not new, Scorsese was able to create engaging trill and suspense out of it. On top of that Lionardo once a cute Titanic boy again shows that he can deal with rustic role with same vigor and success. His eyes and facial expression reveals as much as the crisp dialogs do. He is one of the few actors who make acting looks so real.Only if editor kept it shorter than what it is, will make watching movie more pleasant. All in all, Shutter Island did a nice job and after Avatar, it will be another treat from Hollywood to watch this year. 7.5/10"
sidneymelrose,"Feb 10, 2016",10/10,"Shutter Island is one of the most intriguing film , which I have ever seen. When I started to watch it, I thought that is not interesting film at all because I don't like detective stories about policeman. But it amazed me at all .This film is based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane . It is take place in the mid-1950s where a main character, Teddy Deniels and his partner Chuck Aule, are sent to an island where there is a security prison for patients with some methods health disorders and many of them are so dangerous for other people. The plot is very unusual and unpredictable . You want to watch it and to see what happens at the end of this story.This horror film with tons of atmosphere to music ,directions and set to a wonderfully story.I believe that the main idea of the plot is to find your demons inside your own island in your head. Not only Teddy doing it.As for actors, in this film you can see Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Teddy Deniels (main character). He gave one of the best performances hero and showed a man who has their own «demons» and many strange things inside him. He tried to solve the mystery of the island and this situation was really important for him. I'd recommend this film for people who like detective and mysterious stories with unpredictable ending."
kosmasp,"Sep 9, 2010",9/10,"This is a thriller that builds up very slowly. Really slow, so slow, that some people got bored. And got their fangs out for the ending. That's just a matter of taste then. Even the ending is low key and will not be there to satisfy anyone (though it is one clever way to end a movie, which left me with my mouth open).Martin Scorsese might have gone thriller at least once before, with ""Cape Fear"", but this time we really dig into another world. Leonardo DiCaprio pulls out a great performance once again. Even small roles are cast with great actors to really give the whole thing some weight. It's a great psychological thriller ride then."
tedg,"Mar 13, 2010",N/A,"Scorcese is an accomplished cinematic mind. There is no question of this. When he dies, we will celebrate the loss of a talent.But his life has been compromised by limits in the depth of his religion of cinema. This has haunted him, and he will not be happy to die until he conquers this.The problem is simple. I'll call it the curse of the character, and link it to Dante, or even Homer. That it dominates much written narrative is purely an accident of war. This is the idea that humans exist as complete, each one of us carrying a universe within us that some of us are able to project and carry around us.If we build stories, then, the stories are about the nature of the worlds attached to characters. The characters can actually be tragic, manipulated by their own world forces, or even uninteresting. But no matter how you slice it, the narrative follows people and the containing world is an annotation, an effect. I believe this is ""Italian"" in film-making and Scorcese was captured by it. Unfortunately for him, the cult of the actor in Hollywood (and associated market forces that support critics) feeds this. So he adopted deNiro and made films that were at least competent. But the camera could only follow bodies.But all the real juice in cinema is in this idea of noir. It has penetrated everywhere to some extent because it matters. The religious cosmology of noir has a world that exists apart from any humans. It pre-exists, has its own laws and dynamics. Being external to the souls of humans who appear, it blows them around and tinkers with those souls.It has the advantage that the film's narrative can entangle the existence of the world with the viewers and their needs. It brings the film to the viewers in a sort of contract, a dialog that cannot be refused. It also allows the camera to exist in a world apart from the characters. Thus, the filmmaker can inform us of the situation. Space matters. Texture, color, light all have their own lives.Scorcese has been bothered by the fact that his films did not do this; could not. Here he was with the craft, the skills, but not the vision. So in one of the most intriguing inner stories in Hollywood, he attempts to escape his own limits.He shifts from deNiro-like actors to deCaprio style. He tries, really hard to discover. His ""Gangs"" was a noble attempt, but a failure because of problems with funders. ""Aviator"" was his first noir success, helped by the influence of Cate (playing Kate). Check out the story, which mirrors Marty's plight. Marvel in that cool scene where the room is filled with strings.The rat movie was a retreat. And now this. It is a pure victory, an personal achievement. Some of us have been rooting for the man in his encounter with himself and are doubly rewarded with this film.There are elements in the story that reflect this quest of the filmmaker. I wouldn't want to focus on them too much here, because the reader may think that the story itself matters more than it should. But see the references to Spielberg's similar quest with ""Close"" and ""List?"" See the imposition of the noir narrator and the notion of slippery trust? See the folds in the anagrams? Look how at the end, we have shifted truths but the ambiguity remains. He could indeed still be the investigating cop, now compromised. In fact, this could be a flashback to the episode we learn happened nine months previously. (Note in particular how the tie changes toward the end.)Those story elements would have made a good comment. I'll do that elsewhere. Here the point is to look at how Marty has a new eye. Look at how the camera is almost never anchored to a person. Look at how it always — always — starts with some focus on an element of the world then slips to catch a person (always Teddy, then his focus). Look at how well we understand the importance of location, architecture, place, space, situation.Look at how for the first time ever, Marty shows space: flying paper, ash, dust, hail, leaves, trees. Look at how he even explores the architecture of water a bit. Watch with admiration as he announces his love for Thelma (his editor), and allows her some rubato in how the thing is paced because she owns the clock of the world, now hers.My immediate context: I saw this in a theater with a pride of chattering young Marines. They could not follow the story and left laughing at themselves.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Teddy is veteran WWII soldier traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Duchan concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that his investigation is obstructed by the management by the Federal facility. Teddy has severe migraines and when there is a storm, Teddy and Chuck find that they are stranded in the island. Teddy interviews the internees, discovers that one is missing and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery about the sixty-seventh patient of the Shutter Island.""Shutter Island"" is a good but predictable psychological thriller. The production has a high budget and consequently a great cast, costumes, locations and special effects. However, the major twist when Teddy Daniels finds the truth about the Shutter Island and himself is not a surprise. In this regard, ""Identity"" and ""Haute Tension"" for example, work better and better and really surprise the viewer after the plot point. Further, the IMDb Rating Top 250: #246 is absolutely overrated. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ilha do Medo"" (""Island of the Fear"")Note: On 05 September 2023, I saw this film again."
MovieZoo,"Feb 19, 2010",9/10,"The trailer had me wondering if the movie would miss its mark. I was expecting the haunting atmosphere with a mystery to boot. I kinda wondered if there were going to be ghosts or evil creatures. But I left that in the back of my mind. I opted more for the mystery and atmosphere.Unfortunately, I expect DiCaprio to disappoint me because he just doesn't have that ""quality actor"" appeal for me. I am also aware I am probably not in the majority. But as it goes, I am slowly coming out of my cloud of negativity. This was one of DiCaprio's better roles. I liked him best in The Departed but Shutter Island is going to stick in my mind for a long time.Ben Kingsley was at the top of his game here as the mysterious Dr. Cawley. He was an easy man to be suspicious of thanks to his squinty eyes and devious smirks. Thanks also to the implications and direction of the movie. While DiCaprio and Kingsley easily filled the bill for leads, all the actors did a great job of keeping this viewer's attention.The atmosphere and scenery provided satisfactory background while the action and actors merged well to make this such a great, void-less movie. Yes, the sea was angry that day my friend, but actions, icons, trinkets and memories kept the restless mind rolling. Push came to shove when doubt tried to overrule belief. ""Up"" and ""down"" had no meaning or relevance when it came time to analyze. What did have meaning was the love for the mystery and love itself.Once again, Scorsese puts it altogether in such a beautiful way. You sir, are the boss! And I mean that in a good way. Thanks! 9 of 10"
Simon_Says_Movies,"Mar 10, 2010",7/10,"I often enjoy it when what some may call 'prestige' directors forte into what some may call 'mainstream' move-making for a film or two. You get the best of both worlds; a film palatable for a Friday night, and as well as weight behind the camera. Few would argue that Spielberg's War of the Worlds or Ron Howards Angels & Demons are their respective best work but I'm not one to throw on Citizen Kane over Bad Boys II when I simply want to relax after a day in the grind.The same can be said for Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. While I don't want to make unfair assumptions about how other filmmakers would have handled the material, his prowess behind the camera certainly adds some pizazz and gravitas to the material. Shutter Island is the third successful instance of a Dennis Lehane novel, after Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone, being brought to the big screen and here's to hoping this streak of winning adaptations continue. This time around we follow U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) as they investigate the disappearance of a mental patient from a stormy island penitentiary off the coast from Boston in 1954. The shifty resident doctor (played deliciously by Ben Kingsley) does not make things easy for the two as Teddy is haunted not only by the facility itself, but by past demons of his wartime traumas and the death of his wife years earlier.Revealing much more than that regarding the plot would an injustice to the viewer so I shall say no more. What I will reveal is that DiCaprio turns in another star performance and while I feel it may be lost in the shuffle of the year to come, it is an award worthy exploit. His character complexly navigates between instances of professional integrity and unhinged paranoia. Ruffalo is by all means good in his role but it is, to be blunt, unmemorable. Not for his acting but for how the character is written. The real star is the set design and art direction which never release its grim grip for the length of the film.There is nothing overtly terrible about Shutter Island only that there is nothing outwardly remarkable about it either. The middle portion sags before its fantastic conclusion and there are a few too many flashbacks and dream sequences all of which add up to a solid, but not great genre exercise. Contrary to the ominous aura of the film, the score utilized is far too brash for its own good; clanging and banging its way through the Gothic atmosphere. While I would not go as far as to create a direct comparison, it recalls the disastrous score from 2008's Blindness. It could have gone a long way to use more Drag Me to Hell style acoustics, which utilize everyday objects and sounds to eerie effect.As is the unfortunate case with many thrillers and horror flicks, I cannot see Shutter Island standing up to repeat viewings with much potency. I will not deny however its sinister mood and great performances kept me more than entertained for 120 minutes and with its complex and rewarding twists it is still the best movie of this young year.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
JohnDeSando,"Feb 17, 2010",N/A,"Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island reminds me of Hitchcock's successful Vertigo, Psycho, and most of all, Spellbound, without the success. The mentally unstable characters who provided Hitchcock hints of utter depravity in those classics in Shutter Island mainly serve facile plot twists.Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal marshal who, with his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) goes to Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane in 1954 to investigate the escape of a notorious murderess of her own three children. Almost everyone at that Boston harbor institution besides the patients seems a bit off center, even Teddy, who brings some psychological baggage to the job.While the cinematography is appropriately claustrophobic and the 19th century industrial brick insane asylum and its accompanying Civil War fort reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs with a touch of Alcatraz, the plot twists are indiscriminately telegraphed while Teddy's recurring visions of his deceased wife are too many and annoying. As the resident shrink, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) is much smoother than Lambs' Dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald) but not half as fun. Nor is there a villain who can come close to Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. Although Teddy is the center of the film, Scorsese spends too many frames on tortured close-ups, as if he were making sure that DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar next year.The film should have expanded the role of Dr. Naehring, head of the hospital, because the estimable Max von Sydow could have saved the film from boredom as the twists are telegraphed obviously and way too bluntly. In its favor, Scorsese plays deftly, if not a bit too obviously, with different camera angles such as bird's eye and visual images such as bright red blood, reminiscent of the stunning work in Sam Mendes' American Beauty.When you've directed Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull, you have a tough time topping yourself. Shutter Island is not a film to be ashamed of; it's just not as good as his greats."
thinker1691,"Jun 19, 2010",8/10,"The Second World War was one great big mess and those who survived a visit to the Concentration Camps were doubly affected. Famed film director Martin Scorsese and novelist Dennis Lehane teamed to bring his book to the big screen. The movie, like the novel is called "" Shutter Island. "" The year is 1954 and two U.S. Marshalls Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent from the mainland to an offshore island for the criminally insane. The reason is simple, a violent and dangerous inmate Dolores Chanal (Michelle Williams) has somehow escaped the maximum prison and remains at large. The two Marshalles are introduced to Dr.Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) who seem very reluctant to divulge any pertinent information on any aspect of the place, patients or their protocol. With the warden (Ted Levine) watching their every move, it's difficult to proceed. However, with dogged skill, Daniels finally discovers much more than he's suppose too and finds himself the target of what he believes is a monstrous conspiracy involving Nazis, illegal experimental drugs and murder. The movie begins suspensively driven, shifts quickly into a dark mode and then flings the audience into the realm of the diabolical. All in all, the fast paced drama is another triumph for the team of De Caprio and Scoresese. Easilly recommended. ****"
Pouria511,"Apr 16, 2023",8/10,"I've seen this movie several times, and it never gets old. It gave me a mix of emotions - excitement, fear, anxiety, sadness, and even happiness. I especially enjoyed the sense of mystery, and I remember that the first time I watched it, I completely misjudged what was really happening.The soundtrack was an absolute masterpiece. If you're a fan of the mystery genre, this film is one of the best choices out there. The pacing is so smooth that you barely notice the time passing - I actually watched it twice in a single day!There's only one small issue: in one scene, a supposedly dead character clearly blinks. It's surprising to see such an error in a movie of this quality. Though to be fair, I didn't notice it the first time.Some people who've read the original book say that key details were left out. I personally think it was done intentionally, to make the film more layered and mysterious."
Laura_Ratings,"Apr 11, 2022",9/10,"If I could go back and pick a movie to watch again for the first time, this would definitely be in my list of picks. It's quite confusing at times when you first watch it, but it will all make sense at the end, and probably more even when you rewatch it later. It's definitely a psychological thriller in all it's right and meaning. Great performance from Leonardo DiCaprio again too.Definitely recommend watching it!"
dicksosa,"Mar 19, 2010",7/10,"A fresh attempt to make a story with an unexpected twist to keep the audience guessing until the end is just what this films attempts to do. Attempts but doesn't quite succeed as well as others have before. The film does leave the audience wondering what really is going on. We have two detectives that arrive at shutter island and must figure out the mysterious disappearance of a patient.The set design and production values are well accomplished. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo are accompanied by Ben Kingsley and perform outstandingly through the film. The acting isn't over done and is spot on for each character. The acting really brings to life the story. Although in parts the plot is quite disturbing and can make one look away and cringe for the most part it isn't full of holes and does all tie together.This film falls short however in the fact that it's so much of a tale about trying to figure out exactly what the real story is that you already guess what the real story is and then have to sit and wait for the picture to tell you what you already know. It's like watching the DaVinci code and knowing what the solution to the puzzle is, the intrigue loses something when you already have the answer to the riddle.All in all the film is something fresh and tries to be new, It's acting is superb and story line flows fairly well. It simply falls a little boring once you know the punchline. The ending line of the movie however does bump up the score one point just simply because you don't really know how it ends even after you know how it ends."
naregian,"May 1, 2011",10/10,"This is, without a doubt, easily in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. There are light parts of this movie, but the most of it is definitely a dark piece of art. This psychological thriller should thank the wonderful talents of Mr. Leonardo. The whole story was incredibly well thought out and wonderfully acted. If you love movies that make you want to watch it again, you better see this. Shutter Island will leave you shuttering for days. Just writing this review makes me want to watch it again...I think I just might. 10 stars, easy A++. Movies like this shouldn't be passed up.

fallyhag,"Mar 13, 2010",6/10,"Either I am very clever or this was rubbish. I had the so called twist sussed within 5 mins of the film starting. It was just so painfully obvious that it had me doubting whether I had it right or not. But sadly there was no clever story writing...it really was that obvious. Don't watch this and expect a Sixth Sense ending.The editing was awful and the scenes were choppy. This movie was a blooper fest...full of scenes that just didn't join together.This is probably the hardest review I have written on IMDb because the film bored me. I just didn't care about the ending. From the very start til the end I pretty much knew I had it figured out so I didn't really care about all the pointless scenes in-between.When the end finally came I was glad I didn't care because my intelligence had been assaulted by another ""Bobby waking up in the shower"" ending mastered by the cult TV series ""Dallas"". All my watching was pointless because you were hit with a dumbed down ending that was partly explained by some poor dialogue.Some scenes were done OK (concentration camp) but some were just so green screen (rock climbing). If you are a fan of Cluedo then have a look at this but if you want a great film with a original ending then stay clear.As for the IMDb rating...another example of this website being managed by the film PR hype team. Never in a million years does this film deserve such a high rating. Probably the worst over inflated rating yet.Cant recommend...there are better things to spend your money on."
jessicareid,"Jul 31, 2013",9/10,I had been wanting to watch this film for a while and when I finally got round to doing so it did not disappoint. Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect in the role of the marshal Teddy Daniels and he really brought the whole film to life with his performance. Mark Ruffalo was also memorable for his portrayal of the supporting character and their relationship was a crucial part of the story so it was important that they both played their parts convincingly.What I loved about this film was the whole psychological aspect of it which makes it extremely gripping. It's the type of film which constantly makes you wonder who is telling the truth and it pushes the viewers to try and figure out what is really going on. As the film progresses and reaches the final stage there are more and more twists revealed. Even after having seen the big revelation at the end of the film I still know I could watch this film again in the future as it would be interesting to view taking into account the truth at the end.Even though this film is over 2 hours long it certainly didn't feel like it and the thrilling scenes and build up of suspension throughout made it go so quickly. This film is definitely worth a watch and some people may have mistaken it for a horror from some parts of the trailer but it was simply a good psychological thriller.
derekrankine,"Apr 5, 2010",8/10,"The less you know about Martin Scorsese's latest, the better. The film opens in bright white light, which is gradually faded to reveal Leonardo DiCaprio's character, a senior investigator from a US Government agency, suffering seasickness on a ferry crossing. He is en route to the eponymous Shutter Island, to assist with efforts to find an escapee from the island's prison-cum-hospital; a facility that is home to some of the most notorious mentally deranged criminals of 1950s America.Immediately, we are hooked. The car journey from the ferry to the facility is filled with foreboding and intrigue, melding eerie sound textures with dark, bleak images of the unwelcoming island. Once we arrive, the curious behaviour of the accompanying police officers and the local staff, in addition to the more understandable actions of the patients/prisoners, further builds suspense, paying homage to classic Hitchcock techniques.The most impressive achievement is that the storyline is consistently riveting for a running time in excess of two hours, seemingly without a single wasted scene, shot or line of dialogue as the plot unfolds in lavish, cinematic scale. DiCaprio's mature and compelling performance, in a character not too dissimilar to his undercover police officer in The Departed, is complemented perfectly by Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo and the wealth of heavyweight acting talents playing minor characters. A couple of minor plot contrivances aside, this is a robust and stimulating addition to Scorsese's canon; albeit one that it is unlikely to reach the same high plateau of critical acclaim as much of the director's preceding efforts.The film is based on a novel by the increasingly impressive Dennis Lehane, whose Mystic River and Gone, Baby, Gone were also translated for the cinema, and who was also a writer for The Wire. The themes and settings of Shutter Island represent a diversion of sorts, but it transcends the B-movie genre in the same way as the TV/movie adaptations of his other writings were much more than just crime stories."
jodiegorman_x,"Dec 10, 2010",10/10,"I watched this movie a couple of months ago and am still baffled by it. I had a preconceived notion that it was another horror because of the trailers for it. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance is outstanding from start to finish. His portrayed his character with such immense emotion and skill. At the start of the movie you believe that you know the way it will end. This could not be further from the truth! The storyline was gripping, controversial and had my attention from start to finish. You will either hate or love the ending as it is not expected. I personally loved it and it was a jaw dropping moment. I highly recommend this movie to all types of people. A must see!"
rchalloner,"Mar 1, 2010",8/10,"I think this is just about as good as it gets within the psychological thriller genre. The whole cast are first rate and this has to be one of DiCaprio's best performances. Max Von Sydow is superb as always.The atmosphere is wonderful, Gothic and distinctly unsettling and the setting just perfect. The photography is beautiful and never over fanciful and the plot keeps the viewer engrossed for the whole two and a quarter hours, which is the sign of a great film. It is a return to the old fashioned thriller style, with relatively little in the way of special effects, which is one of its great strengths in my view. The detail is exceptional and not a frame is wasted. I can't say I like all of Martin Scorsese's work, but this is top stuff."
Matt_Layden,"Feb 20, 2010",8/10,"After the disappearance of one of the patients on Shutter Island, two Marshalls are assigned to the case and figure out what's going on. The only problem is that the people working there aren't really helping, and weird things start happening.Scorsese and my favourite genre? Instant win. The film is so masterfully crafted and well shot that it almost feels too good to be a part of this genre. Yet the script and theme fits perfectly. Yes, I knew the ending when they first showed the trailer ages ago, but that did not spoil the intrigue and suspense this film had. There were even a few surprises added on which was nice.Dicaprio is again, on his game. He pulls out crazy very well. It's not a spoiler that he goes a little crazy while investigating, it's all over the trailers. Added to the cast of characters if Mark Ruffalo, he does his best as the sidekick, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as eerie doctors , Elias Koteas in creepy make-up in one scene and a scene stealing Jackie Earle Haley.The film has it's Kubrick feel here and there, but it's Scorsese's stamp on it. It doesn't reach the heights of his previous efforts, but it's still better than 90% of the stuff that's out there. Scorsese knows this genre well enough to know where to pull the strings. The music is a key part in this and the restriction of jump scares shows that this is a well done film that wants to focus more on it's story, than to scare the audience.That being said, the film is not scary, but it does make you feel uneasy at times. When they go to Ward C, you can't help but feel the hair on your neck stand up as they search the halls.The twist is obvious, but the unravelling of everything is interesting enough to keep your attention. At times I did question myself, but in the end I knew I was right. Scorsese is able to chip away piece by piece the lead character's sanity to make the film work. Some people may feel cheated, others will like it. I found myself liking it, even if some of it is a bit out there.Shutter Island is one of the better films you'll probably see this year, it's no masterpiece and it tends to be a the long side of the running time, but it works."
Doylenf,"Feb 22, 2010",7/10,"Relax. This review won't give away the ending which comes as somewhat of a surprise, although many will admit to guessing the overall situation pretty early on.If you like your mysteries drenched in atmospheric surroundings, look no further than SHUTTER ISLAND. Director Martin Scorsese starts out with murky skies and a foreboding of doom as two men (a sheriff and his partner) approach a rocky coastline on a ferry as an ominous looking island looms into view. The plot, although keeping the viewer in a sea of confusion as it unravels, only becomes clear toward the last thirty minutes--but until then, the less you know about the outcome, the more you will enjoy the satisfying ending.None of the exposition is direct. Instead, we see the story from the viewpoint of a man (LEONARDO DiCAPRIO) who is obviously very troubled about tragic incidents in his past and who only gradually begins to see things in a different light. His journey is compelling right from the start, thanks to the marvelous performances of DiCaprio and MARK RUFFALO who begin their investigation into happenings at the island housing the mentally insane--some of them very dangerous cases.Director Martin Scorsese has the benefit of an excellent cinematographer, ROBERT RICHARDSON, whose camera work makes every frame of the film captivating. All of the exterior scenes along the rocky coastline of Maine have a sinister look. The story is told in a leisurely way but there is always an air of mystery in the relationships between the main characters, including BEN KINGSLEY as the psychiatrist in charge of the institution and MAX VON SYDOW as a suspicious looking German doctor.It's best not to dwell on the final outcome--but let's just say it probably won't come as a complete surprise to everyone. Nevertheless, it's the sort of thinking man's psychological thriller that any mystery fan should be able to savor."
Rindiana,"May 1, 2010",4/10,"Flamboyantly silly and long-winded psychothriller/psychodrama that tries hard to say relevant things about mental conditions, memory and trauma, but in fact is nothing more than pulp without the necessary entertainment factor.Scorsese's lamentable attempt to inject his (admittedly gorgeous) visuals with an unnerving quality falls flat, while DiCaprio has always been the least successful in striking puzzled and worried poses.In the end, all the narrative twists and impressive set-pieces prove to be ineffective due to the lack of sympathy towards the wooden characters.And about that ambiguous story-line: It doesn't matter which version is true, both are ridiculous.4 out of 10 mental breakdowns"

The info is not spoon fed to you like other movies.Do not go in thinking you are seeing a horror. I left the theater with people saying, ""Wow, that wasn't scary at all!""

kevinjr16,"Feb 19, 2010",6/10,"The main question going through my mind after seeing this movie was, Really? The whole time it seems rather obvious what is going on and i kept waiting for the big twist where i was wrong, but the end had no twist whatsoever and it ended exactly like you think its going to from the start. It dispels any illusion of terror or foreboding when you know exactly what is happening the whole time. This is a sad sad movie for the legendary scorcese. It wasn't a horror movie in the slightest and while it tried to be a phsycological thriller it never once pulled it off. Ben kingsleys character basically told you in the first 10 minutes how it would play out. I was hoping this was going to be good but i left very disappointed. Not recommended unless you can netflix it."
drexlespivey,"Feb 21, 2010",N/A,"Was looking forward to seeing this yesterday and thought the set and music at the beginning meant I was in for a good ride. Boy were we disappointed. How this movie is getting all these accolades and rated so highly is a mystery. I guess if Scorsese is directing and Caprio and Kingsley are in it its automatically a winner, not this time. The movie isn't really boring, its the type of movie where you keep expecting something to happen and it never does.Just one scene after another leaving you with that unfinished feeling. Nothing really strange ever happens, which you would expect in a forensic mental hospital, its not particularly violent and the twist is really obvious. Too bad because Ben Kingsley is one of my favourite actors and his role as head Psychiatrist could've been a real scene stealer in a more interesting movie but his role was very pedestrian."

lars-viebrock,"May 2, 2021",10/10,"Probably everything that can be said about this movie, has been said about it.One thing I want to add:
Shutter island does 2 things well (and everything else, too).It builds an incredible amount of suspense and tension, keeping viewers on the edge of the seats throughout its run time.But what is more impressive though, is that the movie delivers on it. The ending is extremely satisfying, makes loads of sense, was hidden well enough to be surprising, yet be set up well enough to be believable.The only other movie that I know, that has done this as well is Seven, and I'd say shutter island is even better.Wow, absolute masterpiece. 10/10."
ElMaruecan82,"Oct 14, 2011",5/10,"Guess who praised Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island""? Roger Ebert! The cinematography, the spooky atmosphere, the film noir's overtones, the whole psychological torment, the ""buried trauma"" to quote him, as so many voices speaking in favor of ""Shutter Island"", another great achievement from the greatest director of his generation.Marty might be the greatest as the most consistent director of the New Hollywood generation but I hate how 'great Marty film' started working like a pleonasm, as to underline a tacit rule that any movie made by a great film-maker automatically deserves the benefit of the doubt, in other words: if you hate it, you didn't get it. I'm sorry again, but the director who committed this cinematic piece of unoriginality is not the passionate artist who enriched cinema with so many masterpieces, like ""Mean Streets"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and such delightful little gems like ""The King of Comedy"" or ""After Hours"". I'm sorry but Marty didn't gain in maturity, not even in craftsmanship, he purely and simply  lost his touch.I have the biggest respect for Scorsese, and also for Ebert, and the reason I mentioned the latter is because he's certainly Scorsese's number one fan, but he's also one of these privileged persons who've seen so many movies in his life that he would be the least likely to get so easily impressed by a film, that blatantly exploits every single cinematic cliché, considering the story's material. The movie is so 'obvious' that it would be tragic if it wasn't so laughable. And it's obvious because it works on that reverse effect, as movie fans, we know that whatever seems obvious in the first act will probably be contradicted. True BUT whatever seems obvious is exactly the opposite of what is shown during that very first act, because we know we're being tricked by the director. In that case, it's like Scorsese was the 'sprinkled sprinkler', and Ebert's implicit denial of the script obviousness says a lot about his recurrent loss of subjectivity whenever it concerns Scorsese.I don't want to number all the clichés: the two detectives investigating, the entrance in the island with a haunting atmosphere emphasized by an ominous music, begging you to be scared, or impressed, a weird feeling of unrealism in some backgrounds that made me question what the artistic approach was, let's just call it 'homage' to old-school cinema, this one never gets old. But I wouldn't have expected this emphasis on the tone, screaming ""Beware  danger"" not even from old-school directors, and certainly not from Hitchchock. Okay, we got the idea that something will go wrong; it doesn't even trust our patience as Di Caprio acts weirdly from the very first scenes. I was pleased by Ben Kingley's performance as the charming head doctor, but it's getting old since Nurse Ratched and I didn't mention Fritz Lang, because there are less risks that he might be known by the targeted audience.And I'm not even implying that the movie is not worth watching, but it plays like an overlong build-up for a weak climax, a build-up, during which nothing very pleasing happens. And I mean 'pleasing' in the pleasing meaning of the word, seriously. What happened to Marty's sense of entertainment? Why such a constant need to be dark, Gothic and gloomy? Is that Cinema's new emotional trend? Are we supposed to endure this atmosphere during the whole picture? Can't we have a break? a distracting element, not necessarily a comic relief, but I don't know, a subplot, an interesting character, even Hitchcock did itno, again, the time-filler relied on the guilty trauma, the good old theme so cherished by Marty, and that provides the best alibis to rationalize his films. And we discover his wife played by a beautiful Michelle Thomas, and some horrific flashbacks featuring the Nazi's atrocities, always a good taste to combine the supernatural horror with the real one, that's what the movie needed in case we thought we would cheer up at the end. Or was he just surfing on an opportunistic wave introduced by Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds""?The weaknesses of the plot canceled out all the cinematographic attempts to justify the movie's cinematic merit. Nothing special happens, nothing really happens, and again, it's so damn hard to feel sympathetic toward Leonardo Di Caprio! Yes, I have a big problem with Di Caprio in Scorsese's film, because of that same constipated face he has to display, to remind us that he's playing a tough guy. Did Bogart look tough? Di Caprio is a good actor, even great sometimes, but this is becoming one of his most annoying trademarks. I miss the young, lively Di Caprio with sparkling eyes and youthful look, because tough he isn't, and he doesn't fool anyone, and this is probably why the only Marty's movie I thought he delivered a great and flamboyant performance was ""The Aviator"". The first thing I see in a Di Caprio film now, is the poster, tough-guy-constipated-face? I avoid.An indigestible film with a risible attempt to scare us, I will stop here because I'm tired of being so critical about the director whom I praised most of his work from the 70's to the 90's. But he just doesn't do justice to his glorious filmography, Scorsese is a man of gripping realism of psychological torture and it doesn't need a supernatural flavor to taste good, it's scarier when real and more than that, Scorsese is a damn entertainer, with a unique talent of storyteller, and not only the story isn't told well, but it's not even a good story, as far as originality is concerned.And when comes the final scene, with the final line, supposed to summarize the whole message of the film and justify the whole build-up, my only reaction was : ""so, we got from that  to that?!"" and this is my exact feeling when I compare between Marty's earlier and later works."
bob the moo,"Jan 23, 2011",N/A,"When a dangerous patient/prisoner manages to escape a secure and remote mental institution, US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his partner are sent to investigate. Arriving on the island they begin their investigation but find oddity and suspicion everywhere. As their investigation stalls and is hampered by those in charge, Daniels starts to realise that not everyone is who they claim to be, and that not even he has been honest about his motivations for leading the investigation.Shutter Island came and went and it got mixed reviews. My girlfriend watched it on a plane and disliked it, so it took me longer than normal to get around to watching it. What I found was a solidly enjoyable b-movie thriller which treads a familiar path but mostly keeps the viewer guessing right to the end. Those who have seen more than one film involving an investigation in a mental institution will not be surprised to learn that things are not what they seem, and the film does well to buy into this tone and embrace the rather OTT sense of reality or unreality. The soundtrack is full of heavy horns that compliment this atmosphere further. So in terms of what it is doing it all works really quite well but the problem is that it is overly long and needed to be tighter with a shorter running time. By being in excess of two hours, I was still held by it but at the same time it felt that it was a bit excessive and the longer it took to get to its destination, the more likely the audience were to be pulling at it to move faster.The performances are good. DiCaprio marked quite a 2010 with this and Inception, both roles that are genre films but with which he was able to do a lot more in terms of his character's psyche. Here he keeps the mystery alive and he takes the viewer with him really well. Support is strong from Ruffalo, Sir Kingsley, Levine, Mortimer, Clarkson, Koteas and others – all playing things close to ensure that there is this air of menace and mystery maintained. Scorsese directs with excess in a good way – striking images are used and I liked the way that there are no obvious visual triggers between reality and hallucinations/memories, this works well and I enjoyed the blurring for the viewer.Shutter Island is not a perfect film by any means; for what it is it is excessively long and takes too much time at the risk of the viewer getting impatient with its pace. However it does engage and it does work well with the material thanks to strong direction and performances. Well worth a look as a b-movie thriller despite the big names involved."
chowdhurymonif,"May 22, 2024",10/10,"Shutter Island grips you from the start with a relentless sense of unease. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a powerhouse performance as Teddy Daniels, a US Marshal investigating a disappearance on a remote island. The suspense is masterful, constantly shifting between a classic detective story and something far more unsettling. Just when you think you've grasped the truth, the film throws a mind-bending twist your way. Forget a standard whodunit - Shutter Island explores themes of memory, delusion, and the fragility of sanity. The final act is a masterclass in escalating tension, culminating in a phenomenal display of acting that leaves you speechless. This is more than just a psychological thriller; it's a haunting exploration of the depths of the human mind."

Coventry,"Mar 6, 2010",7/10,"Perhaps I should better begin this user comment by underlining that I'm primarily a horror fanatic and, moreover, that I have a specific exaltation for genre movies taking place on (A) remote inescapable islands and largely set in (B) mental asylums. I've seen numerous cheap horror movies, ranging from astounding to abominable, featuring one or both of these keywords and I personally think they are fundamental components to help determine the creepiness impact of a certain horror movie. ""Shutter Island"" features both these key ingredients as well, so normally this should have been one of my most anticipated movies ever, but instead I was quite skeptical ever since I first saw the trailer. First and foremost I'm annoyed again that everybody seems to avoid labeling this as a horror movie. Like it's still common to think horror is in an inferior genre that acclaimed directors and actors don't even lay their hands on. If you look on the main page on this website, ""Shutter Island"" is categorized as drama, mystery and thriller. I assure you, given the subject matter and the scenery featuring here, this is a horror film. It has everything to do with atmosphere and nothing with bloodshed or ax-wielding maniacs. Secondly, I tend to be very tolerant and easygoing on those aforementioned cheap horror movies because they're often low-budgeted and struggling movies from aspiring and hard- working directors. However, in the case of ""Shutter Island"", where the budget is practically unlimited and all the involved people are highly respected and critically acclaimed names, I feel I'm entitled to be extra demanding. I expect everything to be impeccably perfect, including the plot, the atmosphere, the set pieces, the acting performances, the directing, the continuity and the tension level.The greatest news to announce is that ""Shutter Island"" lives up to most of these expectations, especially when it comes to atmosphere and choice of locations. Right from the opening seconds already, you can tell this will become a thoroughly ominous and gripping film with a professional eye for detail. A ferryboat appears from a thick cloud of fog, there are clear signs of an approaching hurricane, there is recitation about an ""asylum for the criminally insane"" and the first long images of the titular island are brought under the guidance of excruciatingly sinister musical tones. The intensity of the opening sequence promptly grabs you by the throat and you want the two main characters – Federal U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule – to get away from the island as far as possible before they even set foot on it. ""Shutter Island"" first unfolds as a compelling mystery set in the paranoid and depressing post- WWII era of the early 1950's. The island is a controversial governmental place where the Doctors Crawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max Von Sydow) are running a mental institute facility for ""normal"" male and female cases as well as incurably dangerous patients. The Marshals are called to the island to investigate the inexplicable disappearance of a female patient, but there's obviously a lot more brooding underneath the surface. The doctors and wardens deliberately boycott the Marshals' investigation and Teddy Daniels has a personal and much more critical agenda to fulfill. He's looking for the pyromaniac patient responsible for the death of his wife and he intends to expose the island as a place where the American government uses mental convalescents as subjects to experiment upon. Teddy also suffers from painful War traumas, like the sights of frozen cadavers in a German concentration camp, and he still has conversations with his deceased wife Dolores. When the hurricane vanquishes the island, Teddy and Chuck see an opportunity to sneak into the infamous C-Block, where they lock away the worst cases and presumably the experiments, but the revelations where Teddy stumbles upon as from that moment are certainly not what he expected or hoped to find out.""Shutter Island"" is the type of film that overwhelms and deeply impresses you with plot twists, subliminal themes, red herrings, convoluted conspiracy theories, character drawings growing increasingly complex and intriguing but ultimately irrelevant sub plots. The script feels like a solidly structured and tightly woven wholesome for as long as you're watching the film, but it's definitely worthwhile to analyze the movie afterwards. Unfortunately I can't elaborate too much without revealing some essential plot elements, but I urge you do it yourself. Once you leave the cinema or take the disc out of the DVD player, starting thinking back about the little things that were done or said throughout the entire film. Movies like this deserve to be discussed and analyzed rather than to just walk away with a feeling of overall astonishment. You'll notice that some minor details fit in perfectly with the denouements revealed at the end, whereas other story aspects will suddenly become illogical, senseless and implausible. And also, if you've seen a lot of grim, obscure and long-forgotten horror movies (the kind I talked about in the first paragraph), well than you honestly won't be surprised at what you see that often. You won't hear me claim that ""Shutter Island"" is unoriginal or predictable, but like so frequently the case, it does incorporate many little facets (whether just a certain noise, bizarre characteristic or tiny plot detail) that I spotted already in other movies. That really isn't a complaint; merely a footnote. I don't intend to say that ""Shutter Island"" ripped any other films, simply that horror fanatics are likely to be slightly less impressed than the more mainstream audience. My only main complaint is that I personally found ""Shutter Island too long. Admittedly I have a bit of an aversion towards long films, but I really felt that some of the sub plots and repetitive hallucination sequences could have been cut shorter. The filming locations, set- pieces and scenery are tremendous and particularly the re-creation of the 50's atmosphere is admirably accurate."
ofumalow,"Feb 18, 2010",N/A,"Of course this is impeccably produced and acted (though DiCaprio here might be a matter of taste), but it's a pretty long slog in which not enough happens and the resolution isn't worth the wait. The supernatural elements hinted at by advance materials turn out to be nonexistent.Worse, this is a throwback to 1940s/50s Hollywood feature in that (HERE COMES THE SPOILER) various action and intrigue happens for the majority of the film...then the final reel is spent with some psychiatrist or other figure of authority explaining at length ""Well, what REALLY happened previously was just an elaborate and implausible charade designed by us to induce a healing repressed-memory catharsis in our patient! Now all is well! Blah blah blah blah...."" That ending NEVER worked (even in ""Psycho""), usually coming off as a con job and turning everything before it into one big red herring. Which is just what happens here.There are good performances by Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley (the latter two just getting one big scene each). Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams and Max Von Sydow are in a fair number of scenes yet get pretty much wasted in generic narrative-device roles. The movie is of course well produced, designed, shot, et al. But you know something is wrong when you're watching a supposedly terrifying thriller and midway you think ""Gee that 'creepy' island setting is attractive! I'll bet that would make a nice vacation spot!""I realize even Martin Scorcese has to do one for the box office every so often, but this uninspired genre piece (with a story more contrived and less resonant than the prior Dennis Lahane ones adapted for ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"") feels like a marking-time exercise for everyone involved."

kadextar,"Oct 10, 2025",10/10,"For me, this film is not about madness, but about how a system can manipulate a person into doubting their own reality.I don't believe DiCaprio's character was insane. He was a real marshal investigating a real case - until they started breaking him down with drugs, cigarettes, and hypnosis.The woman in the cave wasn't a hallucination, she was a warning. The lighthouse wasn't a psychiatric center - it was a lab for mind control.And that final line - ""Which would be worse: to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"" - wasn't spoken by a lunatic. It was said by a man who fully understood the truth but realized he would never escape.He wasn't crazy - he was conscious. And he chose to die as a human being rather than live as part of the system.For me, Shutter Island is not about insanity. It's about freedom - the last, inner kind."
brentn,"Feb 15, 2021",9/10,"More psychological and atmospheric but no less effective, practically brilliant. Leo and Ruffalo are great as the leads and all the other players are very effective at bringing a secretive and haunting feeling with powerful realism. The setting is made to entice pure dread and is so effective that by the end you really do feel for the characters and are totally immersed. I have never been a huge Scorsese fan, not since Goodfellas but this got my attention and will stay will me. Great film."

A plot of sensational details, an atmosphere out of the ordinary, incredible soundtracks, a crazy direction by Scorsese, more than perfect interpretations of Di Caprio and the rest of the cast, incredible costumes, a beautiful setting, an incredible plot, continuous twists, a huge writing. Everything in this film is perfect, nothing excluded, indeed, in my opinion there are things that surpass perfection. It is impossible to talk about and discuss this film without spoiling everything that happens during the film. This film is about Teddy Daniels, a federal agent who goes to the asylum on Shutter Island with his new colleague Chuck. Everything that happens then.... I let you find out! The characters are incredible and the evolution of the story and suspense are incredible. The soundtracks make all the scenes tense and full of suspense, even if they would be normal scenes. The special effects present are perfect, they seemed real. This film is a continuous interweaving, you have to be always careful to every little detail, especially in the end, otherwise...you are out of everything: this is just the beauty! I think this film has one of the best twists in the history of cinema, I was shocked. For now it is in my opinion the best of Scorsese and it is one of the 3 best movies I have ever seen.Crazy..
Rating: 10/10."
MannyCastro,"Feb 16, 2010",N/A,"A hurricane is approaching and patient Rachel Solando escapes from an insane asylum that's located in an island. She didn't try to swim away because the current would have killed her and washed her ashore. So, where is she? That's what U.S. Marshalls Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are trying to find out.Throughout their investigation they begin to wonder if Solando really did escape. Does a Rachel Solando even exist? Perhaps it's a trap. Someone wants them on that island and isn't going to let them escape. And with the hurricane nearby they couldn't even if they wanted to.That's the mystery in director Martin Scorsese's first film since 2006's The Departed, the movie for which he finally won an Academy Award. Like The Departed and even his 1991 film, Cape Fear, it's a thriller that'll have audiences on the edge of their seat. However, it is the weakest of the three. If this movie has one flaw (and it's only ONE flaw) it's that it relies too much on the mystery. Once you know the ending there's no reason to re-watch the film. It's two hours and twenty minutes of DiCaprio running around a mental institute. Aside from two or three humorous scenes nothing distracts the plot. It's on autopilot. So, it's a really good movie but a B-plot away from being great."
ylings-86636,"Jul 25, 2020",8/10,"Being mentally ill is one of the most terrifying things in the world. In fact, the legitimacy of the existence of mental hospitals has always been questionable. What kind of talents are normal? Who has the right to judge? Do people who are different from most people have to be segregated in a compulsory way? From the beginning you can be caught dead, but the final answer is not satisfactory, let me not feel relaxed at all."
gelmcchristop,"Feb 15, 2021",8/10,"Classical Scorcese movie right here. The directing served the plot just right (though the flow was somewhat off at times), the cinematography too, while the scenario is a masterpiece, making the viewer question their own sanity. The vfx and acting are on-point, doing their part to drive you even more crazy."
TheRealDarkFang,"Jul 14, 2025",10/10,"What an experience! I never thought the movie would get to so much depth, as I knew nothing about it. I was confused and bored, as the story didn't seem to progress, but the plot they revealed and the turns that this story takes are absolutely marvelous. I don't think AI movies, if possible in the future, can get to this level of perfection. A perfect movie! Even now it's on my favorite movie list!! Hands to Martin Scorsese for giving us a dark and edifying experience.An absolute masterpiece. Definitely deserves your time; it's worth it!The whole setting of the movie, the place and all is still amazing and still better than newer, higher-budget movies."

ma-cortes,"Jun 23, 2024",7/10,"'Shutter Island' is a tough and gritty movie with thrills, tense, suspenseful and a lot of twists and turns. 1954. Bailiffs Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffallo) are sent to a remote island in Boston Harbor to investigate the disappearance of an unsettling murderer (Emily Mortimer) held at the Ashecliffe Psychiatric Hospital, a penitentiary facility specializing in dangerously insane people and disturbed criminals run by the sinister doctor John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) . Teddy has lost his family in an apartment fire years before. There are frequent flashbacks to Teddy's time in WWII as a soldier, and Teddy has internal talks where his dead wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), gives him advice. McPherson (Ted Levine) is the deputy warden. Males & females are in different buildings with the most dangerous patients in building C and the marshals are told not to go without McPherson & Dr. Cawley accompanying them. They will soon discover that the penitentiary center keeps many secrets and that the island hides something more dangerous than the patients. Someone is missing !. Some places never let you go !.This exciting film with interesting screenplay contains psychological characterization, intrigue, grisly triller, tense situations and is pretty entertaining, though overlong . It's brilliant , atmospheric and slickly developed , almost a masterpiece . Major asset are the continuous suspense and marvelous acting though at the ending becomes into an predictable thriller film. Casting is frankly awesome with exceptional interpretations along with a glamorous cinematography by Robert Richardson. Martin Scorsese directs this complex and somber psychological thriller with a twisted script by Laeta Kalogridis, based on the novel of the same title by Dennis Lehane, author of ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone baby Gone"" both of them brought to the screen by Clint Eastwood and Ben Affleck respectively.Shutter Island (2010) includes tension, emotion, violence, guilt, and the ghosts of the past as a backdrop, this story of madness and paranopia features excellent performances by a cast of the best Hollywood actors led by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is followed by Marc Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, and others more secondary as Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, John Carroll Lynch, Robin Bartlett, Christopher Denham, Elias Koteas, among others.This gripping motion picture filmed in budget enough was professionally directed by Martin Scorsese, displaying some of his trademarks and characteristics .This prestigious filmmaker has made a lot of notorious and successful movies with the greatest actors delivering terrific acting, such as : ¨Boxcar Bertha¨, ¨Alicia Doesn't Live Here¨ , ¨Color of money¨, ¨Last Waltz¨ , ¨King of Comedy¨, ¨After Hours¨ , ¨Taxi Driver¨ , ¨New York New York¨ , ¨Gangs of New York¨ , ¨Raging Bull¨ , ¨Shutther Island¨ and many others . Scorsese has directed five films that have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically"" significant: Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), Last waltz (1978), Raging Bull (1980) and Goodfellas (1990). With Raging Bull and Goodfellas, he is the only director to have two films that were selected for the registry in their first year of eligibility. Rating Shutter Island(2010) 7.5/10, a notable and decent film. The flick will appeal to Martin Scorsese's most ardent fans, who some of them have hailed as a masterpiece."

thunderfoot1812,"Feb 23, 2010",1/10,"Summary: This is bad movie. Don't waste your time or your money on it. There was not a single convincing, or memorable, scene in the whole two-plus hours. There was not a single character to care much about. Most egregious is that this is a suspense film with almost no suspense. The movie was full of clichés -- but virtually every one of them was handled without the grace that made them clichés in the first place. The ending was predictable. The plot was stupid. The music was not the least bit memorable. On the good side? Hmmm, I suppose the cinematography was very nice, and there was a lot of technique (mostly ineffective) with the cameras. Oh, and I liked the double-basses playing the fog-horn motif.In the elevator in the garage on the way back to my car, a couple was complaining about a movie they had just seen. ""What the h..l was THAT?"" ""I don't know dear. What a stupid movie."" ""I can't believe what a mess it was!"" and so on. I asked them what movie they had just seen: Shutter Island. We agreed with each other as they left the elevator: ""Hitchcock, except without anything good in it."" I will now do my best to pan this movie without producing any spoilers. However if you want to be *absolutely* certain to enjoy the ""suspense"" in all possible aspects then don't read any farther.Suspense? This movie certainly falls in the category of Suspense. Except, er, the movie has almost no suspense to it. There was no rhythm to the sequencing of shots, no building of tension, no small releases. The whole movie was flat, like watching a collection of skits pasted together. Alas, despite his success with Cape Fear (which was much more literal), Scorsese just seems to have no feel at all for Hitchcock-style suspense.Plot? The plot for this movie is both trite, and baroque. As narrative fiction goes it is about on the level of movies made from video games, except they don't bother to pretend. (Hey, for that matter, Silent Hill had a better plot than this movie did.) No part of this movie, not even a single one of the scenes, was believable. Most of it was just absurd. In the interest of no spoilers I have to tread lightly here. Scorsese might argue that he was trying to represent a particular plot device, but boy did THAT ever fall flat. Don't expect to make much sense, either, of the bits and pieces snatched from the real story in the original book. Plenty of scenes could have been dropped without the slightest ding to THIS mess of a plot.How trite? Nazi doctors, concentration camp memories, ""mysterious"" psychiatrists, ghostly presences, all of the most hackneyed and ineffective type. Let's see: the spiral staircase from The Haunting of Hill House, the Boogey-man from Silence of the Lambs, the shower from Psycho... need I go on? And, too bad, the list of trite / iconic references here is more interesting to ponder than the actual boring manifestations of them in the movie.Horror? I am not sure how, but Scorsese managed to make eerie, dripping, insane-asylum corridors not the least bit eerie or menacing, violent, criminally-insane killers on the loose not the least bit scary, or interesting, menacing psychiatrists with drugs in syringes not the least bit terrifying.Character? Sorry. Not a single character was convincing or interesting. There was no chemistry between DiCaprio and Ruffalo, no sparks flying between DiCaprio and Kingsly. The great love of DiCaprio for his wife was entirely cardboard. The ooky prison-guards looked great for about five seconds and then went absolutely nowhere. What a disappointment from the guy who brought us all these rich characters in, say, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, and Taxi Driver (""Stop a car at a hundred yards -- put a bullet right through the engine block!""). The actors had nothing to work with in this movie.Engagement? Hmmm. If you can't manage to involve your audience with Nazi death-camp images, and children being murdered, you've got to admit that is pretty lame. But, this bomb manages to make both of these devices and many others sterile and void of any emotion. You also don't care about the wronged do-gooders locked away in an insane asylum, the hero of the story, or his side-kick...O.K., so maybe it gets two or three stars out of ten, but the hype is just too annoying for this weak effort from an excellent director.This movie was just dumb. If you believe the hype and go to see it anyway before word gets around, don't say I didn't warn you."
HabibieHakim123,"Oct 22, 2023",10/10,"Once you know what really happened, Shutter Island was such a great movie to rewatch and not only to enjoying the master work from the master himself, his craft, his direction, the style, the score, the tension, and of course the performances, but also to study the character and how it all works, in some way Scorsese's first horror movie because it have that atmosphere and the score of the film and one particular long sequences takes place in Ward C, overall Shutter Island was a very engaging and cleverly execute Psychological Thriller that fills with incredible performances, great directing, great score, and great writing, it's another satisfying Masterpiece from the great Martin Scorsese."

chris_norrissr,"May 26, 2024",9/10,"The best movie I've seen in years! I am disabled so I watch movies every single day, and this is certainly the best I've seen in years. No matter how much I thought I saw each twist coming, I never really did. This movie kept me guessing, and on my toes, every minute, all the way to the end. And when the movie was over, I was still left wondering what was real and what wasn't. That goes for both inside the movie and in real life. It left me hungry for a sequel. Is this a true story?? I will definitely be watching this movie again and again! Once again, this is one of the best, if not the best movie that I've seen in years!"
danielmanson,"Jan 8, 2021",9/10,"Boy oh boy. What a film this is. This is a film, for some reason, I never got the chance to watch and I'm kicking myself that I didn't. I mean this film literally defines what a thriller should be.Twists after twists, moments where you go ""so that's why this happened earlier"" and you think you have it figured and it throws a curveball. I promise you however, it's not confusing at all. It's still a plot that's easy enough to understand and the twists and turns aren't overwhelming or overdone. The ending is just a masterpiece as well, I can honestly say I never once expected it to end in that direction and I'm so glad it did because it was a perfect end to the whole viewing experience.Special mention to the performances of Leo and Mark as well, both did superb and I can't imagine anyone else doing as well as they did.I know it sounds like I'm just brown nosing the film and nothing else, but personally I don't see any real negatives in the movie. Please watch if you haven't already."
matheusramalhoo,"May 14, 2020",6/10,"The Movie itself is a good piece of art. It has a great technique, good direction, reasonable plot, high end cast...However, it just doesn't get you. It develops without making you feel it. DiCaprio acts properly, Scorsese is there but the movie doesn't have a soul, sadly. It's possible to watch, but I wouldn't recommend it, though."

melaina-01202,"Jul 26, 2018",9/10,"This movie is better than most people realize. Only after watching it a second time is the true brilliance of the movie revealed. This movie is about perception and the way the mind chooses to see/ things. At the beginning, unknowing of the facts, we follow along with Leonardo DiCaprio's character, believing and seeing as he does. Eventually we reach the end and the twist is revealed to us as it is simultaneously revealed to DiCaprio. While watching the movie the second time everything its very obvious what's going on. The viewer is able to see the movie from the perspective of everyone else. I have to say the actors did a great job creating duality in a single experience. I would highly recommend."
cdjh-81125,"Jun 9, 2016",9/10,It's always a delight to see directors have a variety of genres in their careers that's one of the reasons a love Shutter Island so much it's something completely different from Scorsese. The editing and directing in this movie is fantastic Scorsese keeps the suspense and tension he was able to achieve with The Departed and uses it even better here adding a lot of mystery leaving the viewer guessing to the very last second. This became apparent in the dream sequences as they could have come across as pretentious and melodramatic but they fit in perfectly.This is definitely a movie that's best experienced knowing as little as possible because this first and foremost is an investigation movie and you want to be able to experience that investigation with the characters. Leonardo DiCaprio returns for his fourth collaboration with Martin Scorsese and he is fantastic in this movie not only is he a character the audience can get behind he is also very complex and makes sure DiCaprio can give it everything. Mark Ruffalo was also very good in this movie he was likable and subtle. Ben Kingsley isn't in the movie much but he definitely makes the most of that screen time. This was one of the best movies of 2010 and Scorsese' most underrated movie. 96% from me would absolutely recommend this movie.
barryrd,"Sep 18, 2016",8/10,"Martin Scorsese has delivered a controversial piece of dark filmmaking with the movie Shutter Island, set in Boston Harbour during the 1950's. The film holds the viewers in its grip with Leonardio DiCaprio playing a federal marshall with his subordinate Mark Ruffalo, who are investigating the disappearance of a patient (prisoner) on the island, a horrible place of infamy contrasting with its beautiful green landscape. It becomes clear that the condescending and smooth doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow are conducting experiments in eugenics, something he has despised ever since his wartime experience with the Nazis. Or so it seems. Then a series of traumas and flashbacks into his personal life cast doubt on the whole plot. We witness a series of exploits, family related tragedies, a cliffhanging on Shutter Island and a visit with a mysterious woman in a cave. The trauma of a troubled man on a mission casts a heavy doubt on the entire plot and his own personal sanity. A movie well worth seeing."
GabesGuizi,"May 16, 2018",10/10,"If you're looking for an intense thriller that holds you on the edge of the seat, this is perfect for you. A truly outstanding movie from its genre, mixing police investigation thriller with accurate psychology studies. The acting is also on point for the main characters, DiCaprio portrays the man haunted by his past in a very realistic and twisted form, making you feel the emotions of the main character. The story is unique and amazing, you won't find any movie alike, specially with such a twist."

Vincentinus98,"Oct 22, 2021",10/10,"I missed the cinema, I remember who the plaza was with the pictures on the cover, but I had a different headache about mystical films. As I dropped, I picked up more and more of Martin Scorsese's films and I have to say I wasn't disappointed in either it or me. In the 1950s, we will have eyes and ear witnesses to the miserable life of a mashall who is unable to accept what has happened in the past. Those around you may not be on your side or you can trust them at all."
MLDinTN,"Feb 5, 2012",6/10,"I'm usually not very good at predicting twist endings, but even I could see this one coming from a mile away. I mean, when Teddy keeps seeing visions of a dead woman, and we are told there is a missing patient, it doesn't take much to put two and two together.The gist of the film is 2 federal marshals go to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient from a mental asylum. The boss, Teddy, asks a lot of questions, but doesn't get a lot of answers. The story he is told makes it seem impossible for the patient to have vanished from her cell. We soon see things aren't what they seem and there is an even more dangerous patient on the lose.FINAL VERDICT: It's OK, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out what is going on."
myerschristopher,"Apr 22, 2018",10/10,"I truly had a journey with this movie as I could not predict the events from beginning to end. What's most exciting is that the mix of history and shocking events begin to come together like a puzzle. A truly suspenseful movie where the main character is so certain with his partner his duty to visit an island full of secrets which belong mainly to him, begin to piece together with facts of his life and changes his perspective about his gritty past. The more the main protagonist attempts to reason himself into leaving, the more dangerous and unlikely it becomes to staying. Definitely one of my all time favorites!"
BanjaZe,"Jan 31, 2016",10/10,"One of the best Movies by Martin Scorsese. If you are looking to mind-blow yourself this is definitely movie for you. Keep attention to details and you will be highly satisfied. I recommend watching this movie more than once to realize just how great it is 9/10. Not as horrific as trilling. On my opinion the only think that is scary here is the story. Leonardo is on top of the game, and supporting roles are just perfectly selected as Ben Kingsley(keep an eye on him) performed very well. Shutter island is very underrated, and it will only get more appraisals as time goes by. One of the best movies of new millennium. I enjoyed watching it, 138 minutes of constant build up of attention."

undeaddt,"Apr 4, 2018",9/10,"Leonardo is one of the best, if not, maybe the best actors this 21th century has ever seen. His range of roleplay is beyond limit. He dwells so deep into his acting roles that he lives with them, he becomes one with the story. He deserved an Oscar so much, that people disliked the fact that he got one with the Revenant, but in fact, that Oscar was won because of all his previous masterpieces, it was a long waited and deserved victory. This movie is something else, it is beyond your average movie and beyond the average plot twist. It plays with your mind the way his mind plays on Leonardo in the movie. The story is phenomenal, it is beyond beautiful, but the ending... oh, how good that ending was, those last 20 seconds. 9/10"

You're trying to find aN explanation and to put the pieces together, but at the end, you're just wrong.For the people who read books; I can say that looking to this movie is kinda like reading a book and wanting to finish it in one night. You just want to know what happens next, what is the explanation and how will it end?Perfect, just perfect."

Films that make you think and truly feel the thrill of not knowing which way the characters and/or story will head, are the sorts that are written and directed beautifully. DiCaprio and Ruffalo do an amazing job. Like in most their movies, you feel the characters and go on a literal and mental journey with them. This is a film that may at times appear slow if you do not get into it. You must be paying attention to detail and attempting to understand all the characters are trying to tell you. The thrill and mystery will keep you on the edge of your seat, intrigued to grasp the full understand of the mystery the movie hides from you."
sme_no_densetsu,"Jul 24, 2016",8/10,"Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" is based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, author of ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone, Baby, Gone"", among others. The story revolves around a missing persons case at an isolated hospital for the criminally insane circa 1954.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshall sent to investigate the disappearance. However, he has already formulated his own hypothesis about the incident, one that involves secret government testing. The clues steadily accumulate, often creating more questions than answers, all the while ratcheting up the tension until we reach the final, climactic revelation.DiCaprio does a good job of carrying the film in what develops into a challenging, multi-faceted role. He is given strong support from the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Williams among several other notables in smaller roles. All in all, a talented ensemble cast.Scorsese's direction is as sharp as ever and he creates a number of memorable scenes. Frequent collaborator Robbie Robertson (of The Band fame) supervised the music, selecting existing pieces, some of which are quite striking. Multiple Oscar winners Dante Ferretti (production design) & Robert Richardson (cinematography) were also key contributors to the movie's atmosphere & authenticity.Having watched ""Shutter Island"" a couple of times now I feel that I have a better appreciation of the film's intricacies. Subtle touches that went unnoticed the first time around now take on new meanings with foreknowledge of the mystery's resolution. I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed by the story's conclusion on my initial viewing but the fact that the movie stands up to repeated viewings is a testament to the quality of its construction. Ultimately, ""Shutter Island"" certainly deserves to be seen once but I feel that a second viewing is key to experiencing everything that the movie has to offer."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Feb 24, 2010",10/10,"I knew I had to watch this the moment I saw the trailer, I went in with high expectations, and this still blew me away. Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York... OK, not Cape Fear, but that was a mistake from day one(it didn't need a remake), the talent involved notwithstanding... I've loved everything(with the one aforementioned exception) that I've seen by Martin Scorsese, and this, while it might at first appear excessively mainstream, is another example. This is beautifully shot and edited, and the lighting is just astonishing. The look is amazing. This also has outstanding FX, though they are clearly not the focus, only a tool to tell the story, which is rather brilliantly put together. In general this is immensely well-written; the dialog is clever and there are numerous memorable lines, the script is smart and every character is credible, well-developed and psychologically accurate. The acting is flawless. Levine gets an unforgettable speech that he delivers impeccably, Lynch does his ""there's something funny about that guy..."" thing perfectly, and the entire principal cast are spot-on. The score is grand and really helps set the tone and the mood, if it is arguably over-dramatic in a place or two. This is quite creepy, terrifying and exciting. There is plenty of bloody, at times gory, violence and disturbing content, relatively infrequent strong language, brief nudity and a sexual description. I recommend this to any fan of the director and thrillers that mess with your head. 10/10"
joecarroll-632-588318,"Feb 20, 2010",9/10,"Visually, Martin Scorsese is unparalleled. But, if you know anything about cinema, you already knew that. This film isn't a masterpiece, or a storyline we haven't seen before (think along the lines of Identity [2003]), what this film is, is a beautifully crafted thriller. If you enjoy thrillers, you will enjoy this movie, period. I'm not just referring to the twists and turns in the plot either. When you deal with Scorsese, you get quality, and this film is no different. The acting was phenomenal; DiCaprio, Rufallo, and Kinsley delivered, big time. This flick reads like a great novel, and yet, it refuses to take on that distinctive and predictable Hollywood style (that we have all too often been gratuitously subjected to.) In addition, this film has such a realistic quality to it, that never once did I feel as though I had been cheated out of my money. If anything, the previews for the film don't do it justice, they have promoted it as a ""scary movie"", and that couldn't be further from the truth. I can assure you that Mr. Scorsese isn't looking for the cheap ""Boo! I got you!"" moment. It's just simply not one of those kinds of movies. He realizes he is dealing with an intelligent audience, and thus, he provide us (the audience) with a clever intellectually stimulating film..I commend Mr. Scorsese for not electing to go with a conventional ending, and although some people in the theater went ""aaww"" (in a bad way), I went ""aahh!"" (in a good way), because I understood the reasoning behind it. With so much humdrum useless junk in the theaters these days, and in particular so much junk in the thriller genre, it is truly a delight to witness a talented director like Martin Scorsese take on a project like this. As you can see, this was definitely my kind of movie, but I have a hunch that I'm not alone, and I have a hunch this thing is going to catch on very very fast.One last thing, I urge you to see it in theaters, your really missing out if you decide to wait until DVD for this one, trust me on that."
Troy_Campbell,"Feb 19, 2010",9/10,"In the space of a week we have been given two very distinct examples of how to (and how not to) generate genuine scares. Joe Johnston's The Wolfman exhibited cheap, shallow attempts of frightening the audience, mostly consisting of lazy ""don't look around the corner"" moments that relied on loud noises and sudden movements to make you jump. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Martin Scorsese - as you would expect from such a virtuoso director - demonstrates an innate knack for producing goose bumps, combining atmospheric sound design and terrifyingly vivid images – most notably during Teddy's dream sequences – that get under your skin to brilliant effect. Shutter Island is not a horror flick mind you. It is more akin to Hitchcock's The Birds; eerie, chilling and deeply disturbing. You'll probably not jump out of your seat once but, like Scorsese understands and Johnston needs to learn, it is what stays in your head after the credits roll that is of greater significance.Based on Dennis Lehane's novel, Shutter Island's narrative doesn't hold its punches back. Dealing with murder, corruption, alcohol abuse, mental sickness, genocide and torture; no dramatic stone is left unturned. Occasionally it feels a little heavy-handed, but what else can you expect from the guy who penned the source material for Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone? Screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis commendably keeps Lehane's story moving, never allowing it to be bogged down with one particular issue ensuring the thriller aspect of the film – arguably what the majority of audience members will be seeing the movie for - gets plenty of room to develop. With a handful of twists here and there and information drip-fed methodically, you'll never be wholly confident in what you think is happening or, more importantly, what is going to happen.Regular Scorsese collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio (he's starred in the director's last four films) is in top form yet again, adding clout to the ever-increasing opinion of this reviewer that he may well be one of the best actors of our generation. Willing to give himself over to the material completely, the onetime Romeo embodies his character with such verve and preciseness that he's never less the entirely convincing. Meanwhile Michelle Williams is quietly carving out a niche for herself as the tormented soul, her eyes able to convey so much emotion that words almost seem unnecessary; old-timers Kingsley and von Sydow provide their psychiatrists with the perfect amount of ambiguity; Haley is gruesome and sympathetic in a cameo role whilst Ruffalo plays the unfussy part of Teddy's partner with more subtle cleverness than initially noticed.Due to the class of Scorsese throughout his illustrious career this may not even make his top five, however 99% of directors around the world would gladly call this their masterpiece.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
wizardofroz13,"Feb 19, 2010",8/10,"This film was a traditional Scorsese picture. The cinematography was fantastic, acting excellent, music emotional and direction superb. That being said, I have trouble saying that this film is an instant classic. The technical elements were sound. If I were to go through with a score sheet, ""Shutter Island"" would receive a perfect 10 in each category, yet something about the film left me wanting more. I don't blame the ambiguous ending. On the contrary, I enjoy an ambiguous ending. (""Gone with the Wind"" anyone?) I can't put my finger on what it lacked for me, but I can safely say it was missing that something that I was hoping for. Perhaps, it was the hype that surrounded the movie. Well, say that's what it is...for now.Onto the positive aspects of the film, the first thing to strike me was the fantastic score Scorsese compiled. Classical music was used sparingly and effectively. Also, the use of silence in this film was remarkable. As Teddy (DiCaprio) is walking through the terrifying halls of the mental hospital, the silence scares the audience more so than the darkness and prison-like cells patients are thrown into.The cinematography was also fantastic in this film. I loved the switch in color palette between life on Shutter Island and the recesses of Teddy's mind. This plays a huge part in the story line, helping the audience decipher what is real and what is clearly a hallucination though even that can trip you up.The acting was wonderful. DiCaprio is at his finest. He is believably and charming. You can't help but empathize with his character, no matter what. Ben Kingsley is intellectually terrifying. Though not the same, his performance hearkens to Christoph Waltz in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Mark Ruffalo is overshadowed in this film but does a nice job. Emily Mortimer is quite convincing as a mental patient and Michelle Williams' depth was a pleasant surprise. I didn't think she'd play quite as large a role as she did.Scorsese directed. I think that's all I have to say. He is a master. He knows what he wants and how to get it."
andreas-sellfors,"Apr 10, 2018",N/A,"It's just as well that I recognize this directly - I'm a real ""sucker"" for stylistically strong movies and in Shutter Island there's a lot of it. It are also going to make people happy (at least from my point of view) who read the book by Dennis Lehane that the movie are based of.. Yes, the film follows the book very carefully. So If you then agree that the film must follow the book, the director Scorsese is a pure genius in how he treated the material. His constant photographer Robert Richardson does a great job of getting that rainforest island to look magnificent and Teddys dreams and flashbacks are nothing but adorable beautiful.Yes, there are ghostly shadows, rain that goes down from gray-tailed clouds and weathery men in trenchcoats with troubled ankle dragons. Tortured by all, is the agent Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio). Not only does he hate water. Now he is going to investigate a strange escape from a prison hospital for mental illness on an isolated island. With staff members who is not particularly cooperative and a doctor with strange Nazi connections, police work much effective. He also have to fight against his nightmares and increasingly annoying migraines. It is really great characterized by Leonardo DiCaprio, which has really made evelopment from the breakthrough in ""Titanic""."
danialpoorjafar,"May 24, 2010",9/10,"Every body has it's own imagination, dreams, fears and etc. But what makes us to get lost in our imaginations? What makes us to cross the line? What makes us to look crazy as much as we seem normal?I think this movie has answered some of those questions. I realized that when you have nothing to believe in, no one to trust in and you suddenly loose every thing you have, you have no way but going through your imaginations.By a survey at Scorsese's movies we see that most of them have a kind of apocalyptic atmosphere. ""taxi driver"", ""The departed"", ""The gangs of new york"" and the last one ""Shutter island"". And the best term to describe their hero's situation is this; ""when you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?""[1][1]: ""the departed"""
meeza,"Apr 10, 2010",9/10,"Welcome to my Punner Island where all your pun dreams can come true! Of course I am going to punhabit my review of Director Martin Scorsese's brilliant ""Shutter Island"" as I do to all of my reviews. ""Shutter Island"" is not associated with the documentary based on every time that Paris Hilton opens her mouth, that one is called ""Shut-her Island"". OK, I will focus on ""Shutter Island"" before you guys think I belong on ""Shut-him Island"". Leonardo Dicaprio, collaborating with Scorsese for the fourth time, stars as Teddy Daniels; a 1950's U.S. Marshall who travels to Shutter Island to investigate a case of a missing patient. The island is primarily comprised of a hospital for the criminally insane. Sounds crazy ha? OK, sorry. Moving right along Teddy's marshall partner is Chuck, played by the reliable Mark Ruffalo. Teddy was a soldier in World War II and played a big part in rescuing Holocaust victims in a Nazi concentration camp. He is a recent widower whose wife accidental death still haunts him as he keeps having hallucinations of her. In the hospital for the criminally insane, they are met by numerous peculiar characters who do not help Teddy & Chuck much with the investigation; and I am not primarily referring to the patients also. I really cannot indulge more in providing you plot lines of ""Shutter Island"" because that would have me institutionalized in the hospital for the spoilerly insane, they have that? It is not insane to state that Leonardo DiCaprio's masterful performance should garner him another Best Actor Oscar nomination. The supporting performances of the film were also sanely proficient. Besides Ruffalo's fine work, I was psyched with the stellar performances of legendary actors Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as the hospital's primary psychiatrists, Kingsley playing the head mental honcho. The up-and-coming Emily Mortimer and the always stupendous Patricia Clarkson were scene-stealing in their brief performances as a couple of zany Rachel patients. Michelle Williams was not spectacular in her work as Teddy's deceased wife Dolores, but I would not say she was ""dead in the water"" also with her moderately commending performance. Kudos also goes out to veteran character actors John Carroll Lynch and Jackie Earle Haley for their powerful supporting work; Lynch playing a head guard and Haley playing a loony patient held at the hospital's ""critical psyche condition"" ward. The film's cinematography and art direction were vivid enough to also be called as Oscar nominees at next year's show. Laeta Kalogridis' twisting screenplay based on Dennis Lehane's novel made me ""twist & shout"" with literary pleasure. But who is crazy and daring enough to put all of this together- the one and only highbrow eyebrow maestro, Mr. Martin Scorsese. His daring direction of ""Shutter Island"" does not depart from the fact that Scorsese is still at the top of his game. So take that surreal cinematic voyage to the bizarre but worthwhile ""Shutter Island"". ***** Excellent"
cmoitze,"Jan 3, 2011",9/10,"Shutter Island is a breath of fresh air. An Intelligent and thought provoking film, that had my attention from beginning to end. Leonardo Dicaprio is on top form here, turning in a very credible performance as the troubled lead character.Wonderful musical score and atmospheric sets make this film extremely entertaining. The movie has a surprising ending that will make you ponder exactly what did happen.Some nice subtexts flowing through the film which will leave the viewer with questions to ponder and reflect on, long after the movie has finished.In summary, this movie can be recommended as a thinking mans horror film. Entertaining for sure, but with a depth and gravitas so often lacking in the horror genre."
VO1D_Reviews,"Apr 10, 2023",9/10,"After watching 'shutter island' all I could say is wow! The twists and turns of this incredible detective movie are amazing and I'm sure it's a movie you can watch twice, and see it differently both times. The end left my jaw hanging in surprise and it's the first movie or TV show to ever make me do that! I applaud the main character as the wide range of emotions shown are incredible! The movie creates a sense of eeriness throughout and kept me on the edge of my seat! The tension and eeriness created are just fantastic and really immersed me into how the characters were feeling. Overall you should definitely watch 'shutter island' and I promise you, you won't regret it."
e5312,"Jan 15, 2012",9/10,"I got myself to watch this movie since a lot of people kept saying how much better this was than Inception. It's hard to compare the two movies, since they both do amazing at their own kind. I'm a true fan of Inception, but the great psychological content made this film absolutely unforgettable to me.Just to start with, we're in 1954, on an isolated island where an asylum for the criminally insane takes place (in other words, they have put some of my very favorite subjects together, nice). Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) visits the island on the purpose of investigating the disappearance of one of their patients (or as he calls them ""prisoners""), but from the very beginning he knows that something is wrong with the place. As the events go on, there are more and more weird things happening, and all together with Teddy's tragic memories as a war hero and from his personal life, he's starting to see hallucinations and feeling worse about the whole situation. Time passing by, he seems to be losing his sense of reality, and becomes more and more aware of that there's something the staff of the mental hospital won't tell him. He continues on with his investigation, but there are dark things awaiting him to find out. One question which is up during the whole movie: is there really conspiracy, or is the reason of the unreasonable oddity something more obvious, which he can't see through the veil of his past blinding him? The atmosphere of the movie is magnificent, and the acting was great as well. I'm not one big fan of DiCaprio, but I must admit that he did an amazing job in this movie, probably the most amazing act of his I have seen so far. The movie had its scary moments, and it was really exciting so it's nearly impossible to get bored of.I recommend Shutter Island to everyone who likes films that makes the audience think after watching them, or even read a couple of film analysis to fully understand what they have seen. In short, a beautiful masterpiece of modern cinema."
FeastMode,"Jun 24, 2019",7/10,Kinda dragged but very good story with good emotion. awesome acting and some unique scenes (about 2 viewings)
tha_mongoose,"May 24, 2010",10/10,"Scorsese's genial work needs no introduction. Every full-feature film he has made in the last twelve odd years has been brilliant in some way or other. Shutter Island, his latest installment, is an instant classic. Having read a few reviews that chastised the film this reviewer feels the need to give the work the praise it deserves.Set in the 1950's, an age when, regarding attire, people dressed in much more stylish fashion than we do nowadays, Shutter Island pits the viewer with the usual trench-coats, police uniforms with flappy raincoats, tweed suits, hats, flowery female dresses and the rest that have now gone out of wear. Another aspect that brings the 50's back to life is the automobiles – we also get a shot of such a vehicle in Shutter Island.But the visual experience we are treated to with this movie does not end with the car and wardrobe, or the beautiful asphalt buildings of the penitentiary. The Island itself is worthy of mention. It possesses an air of insanity that is prescient from the very beginning, when the viewer's ear is invaded with overtly melodramatic insertions as the camera approaches the Island and DiCaprio and Ruffalo are arriving. Soon enough, however, we will begin to comprehend the significance of these details.Shutter Island is in much reminiscent of Hitchcock's work. While the movie is not set in black-and-white, it is more Noir than many Noirs were in their heyday. Not only does the music fit in with this assertion; as well as the shots of the cliffs and island, and of the surrounding water; but the progression of the story, that goes from mysterious to incomprehensible soon enough, transcending the real and reaching hallucinatory plains, aids in creating a masterpiece of an ethereal, ephemeral thriller.To be sure, such an ambitious project would not have been feasible had the director not only been intimately involved with Hitchcock's and other master thriller-makers' work but also without the aid of a stellar set of actors. DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, the incomparable Sydow, as well as the female cast all stand tall and play their parts to full effect. This could be one of the trickiest parts DiCaprio has approached in his whole career, and he has succeeded. It is a pleasure to appreciate the development he has undertaken since his frail days in 1999's Titanic.In summary: screaming Hitchcock, Shutter Island is an assault on the senses, an epic psychological journey into the most elusive, extreme confines of the mind. It deserves a place among the best such films being made in recent years. 10/10"
benjameshodges,"Mar 16, 2012",7/10,"Opening with some rather amateur special effects to create a ferry trip was an unusually, off-putting experience, especially from the likes of Scorsese. But as 'Shutter Island' progressed, I was soon immersed into the mystery of the missing suspect.Leonardo Dicaprio played an engrossing detective with an unbridled drive and determination that often clouded his judgement, but with the reluctance of Mark Ruffalo was kept sensible.The first half never dragged as it introduced new and interesting characters that added to the curiosity of the island which was also helped with typically Gothic set design.Unfortunately the second half became slow and confusing with an unambitious push towards the disappointing and predictable ending.I would have preferred to watch the first half of the film, stopped it and left the ending as a mystery for my imagination."
parker1177,"Apr 4, 2010",N/A,"For probably the first time, I was very excited about a Scorsese film. I have been left cold by nearly every film I've seen of his, either due to subject matters that I just cannot bring myself to care about or I'm generally unimpressed by the film. There are exceptions of course as Gangs of New York was flawed but very powerful and The Last Temptation of Christ is a masterpiece, but despite a blip here and there over the years, Scorsese generally makes films that don't speak to me.Well, with Shutter Island he had me. I have a weak spot for psychological thrillers set in historical asylums. I gravitate towards these films, and when they work, they quickly find their places among my favorites. I found myself comparing the trailers for Shutter Island with Brad Anderson's Session 9 and the detective films of Kiyoshi Kurosawa (i.e. Cure, Retribution). i assumed that Martin Scorsese was influenced by the amazing atmosphere of the Japanese detective thrillers and was making his own. If Shutter Island hails from those influences, it doesn't succeed in duplicating the tone or attention to setting. Sadly, Shutter Island instead tries to be a M. Night Shyamalan film without the tension and unlike, Shyamalan, Scorsese gives away the twist immediately. Calling Shutter Island a disappointment is an understatement.Stop reading now if you want to avoid spoilers, because I'm about to give away everything.My biggest issue with Shutter Island is that nothing holds together and the more I think about it, the more annoyed I get. I hate movies that depend upon a big reveal at the end that finally explains everything. The biggest problem is that they almost never hold up to repeat viewings. Well, if Shutter Island had worked up until the lame and blatantly obvious reveal that Teddy Daniels is criminally insane, then I'd just be annoyed with it in the way that I am at the filmography of Shymalan, i.e. I was entertained the first time, but it completely falls apart with any scrutiny . If one could say the same for Shutter Island, it was be a complement.The problem is that the whole premise of Shutter Island is completely retarded. I realized to my disappointment very early on that Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) was not on the island to reveal a conspiracy, but as a patient. But are we really supposed to buy this plot? Would a mental hospital allow a delusional patient to wander about their facility for a few days playing detective in order to determine if he can be cured? Shutter Island's biggest failure is that it didn't make a lick of narrative sense. I enjoyed some of the dream sequences, but again, they allowed the truth of Teddy Daniels' crime to be so obvious as to made the last 30 minutes of the movie unnecessary for anyone who was awake during the first half-hour. In fact, the second half of the movie bludgeons you with Teddy's actual story, which was evident from the not so subtle clues throughout.However, there was one completely unforgettable part of the reveal. The moment that Dr. Cawley (Sir. Ben Kingsley) brings out the visual aids to show Teddy that all of the names in his conspiracy plot are anagrams, was the best bit of unintentional comedy that I've seen all year. But then, what could have been a downright cool detective thriller investigating the very horrific practices that happened in asylums during the first half of the 20th century, we get another movie with a non-nonsensical plot that is simply explained by the protagonist being insane. Yawn. My advice is to watch Quills, Session 9, or The American Experience: The Lobotomist for some intense, horrifying stories of mental institutions."
tburke85,"Jun 12, 2010",8/10,"Shutter Island is an excellent suspenseful thriller with some flaws which I'll get into later but the good more than outweighs that bad in this one. Director Martin Scorsese is admirable in making Shutter Island giving audiences nearly everything they could expect or want from one of these films. Leonard DiCaprio is great as always as Teddy Daniels a US Marshal on route to a remote island for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a murderess who somehow escaped from her locked hospital room. Or as Ben Kingsley's mysterious head Dr. Crawley explains; ""We don't know how she got out of her room. It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls."" Leonardo DiCaprio brings an intensity to the role (like in Blood Diamond and The Deaprted to name a couple) and at times vulnerability. He continues to show audiences and critics his talent as an actor. This film is no different. Well done. The rest of the talented cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, and Max von Sydow in a small role are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Particia Clarkson, Elias Kosteas, John Carroll Lynch, Ted Levine, and Jackie Earl Haely are also very good in their brief extended appearances since most of the story's focus is on DiCaprio which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Shutter Island turned out to be much better than expected. It has an interesting story, suspense, an eerie mood, and atmosphere with strong performances from the cast. The movie also has some nice twists and surprises. One I sort of did suspect and others I found surprising to say the least. So it's better to avoid spoilers and watch this film without knowing too much about the plot for you to truly enjoy Shutter Island. I found this film to be much better than others who disguise themselves as suspense thrillers (The Grudge, The Happening, and Shutter to name a few). I enjoyed that Scorsese didn't heavily rely on CG except for some and instead used for the most part realistic locations and atmosphere to create the suspense. The location they chose for the island was a perfect setting for this story to take place and it added a lot to the movie. The flashback sequences of Teddy's time in World War 2 were an interesting touch that give us some insight into his traumatic past which continues to plague him while on the island. The pace of the movie was a little slow in the beginning before the suspense really started to kick into high gear but overall I can't think of all that much I didn't like about this film. Sure it might have some tiny flaws including a surprise I sort of saw coming but I thought Scorsese still did a good job with the execution of the twist none the less. In some ways Shutter Island reminded me a bit of the Shining because both films used actual locations, surreal images, and atmosphere to create suspense build up instead of relying on CGI. I was impressed with this movie and I plan to watch it again sometime because second viewings I think are needed to fully understand the story so it makes sense. Not that the story itself is very complicated but I believe Shutter Island's worth watching a second time even with a 138 minute running time because the film is that good despite it's few flaws. If you're in the mood for a suspenseful thriller or you're a fan of the genre, you can't go wrong with Shutter Island. It has an intricate story, suspense, twists, surprises, and solid performances by the cast (especially DiCaprio, Ruffalo, and Kingsley) who make this thriller worth the time to watch."
jread-5,"Jun 18, 2010",10/10,"A few random observations that don't really add up to a theory of the movie:Some odd clues in the movie: 1. Dachau was liberated in the Spring of 1945, not the Winter. 2. Dachau is a town near Munich, so the weather was warm in Spring. 3. The sign ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" was over the entrance to Auschwitz in Poland, not Dachau. 4. Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet army in January, 1945, so it would have been cold, as shown in the movie. 5. The guards at Dachau were not executed by U.S. troops. Who knows what happened at Auschwitz? 6. Why does Teddy speak German so well? 7. Dr. Naehrung's name means ""nourishment"" in German.According to Ebert, much of the flavor of Film Noir was a depiction of the PTSD suffered by G.I.s in WWII.It is well known that the U.S. military conducted very dubious research during the 50s into the use of drugs to affect behavior.Is this the Dark Side of ""Men Who Stare at Goats""?"
alexsnower,"Jun 26, 2021",7/10,"I am very confused on why exactly this has an 8.2/10 but whatever. Don't get me wrong this is a decent film. DiCaprio phones it in a little which sucks especially compared to Mark Ruffalo's overacting. Ben Kingsley does a great job though. Same with Max Von Syndrow who played the German doctor. He was clearly inspired by Casper Gutman in the 1941 noir ""The Maltese Falcon"" starring Humphrey Bogart and directed by John Huston. Just listen to the way he talks. ""My sir, you have excellent defensive mechanisms"" compared to Gutman's ""My sir, you are a most headstrong individual."" As far as neo-noirs go, their are many better ones. However, I would probably recommend Shutter Island."
akg1249,"Jun 17, 2019",6/10,"At the end of this movie, there are going to be only two kinds of audience: one, which will feel cheated because it watched in incredulity as one of the characters in the film shamelessly reveals the mystery flat out within the first 10 minutes, as if the director, sick with fear that the audience would feel betrayed, couldn't help himself; the second kind which would not notice the above and go on to watch the entire flick trying to assemble and reassemble the puzzle pieces, only to let out a groan in self-disgust for not having paid enough attention in the beginning.Whether you like this movie or not will depend on which of the above two categories you fall in. I watched this movie with my nephew. As the suspense was revealed, we both looked at each other and uttered almost together, ""What the hell...!?"" Movie itself is not so bad and has some decent performances and atmosphere, but it will all be meaningless if you are the first kind of audience."
smid-exe,"Mar 26, 2010",9/10,"If you read why some people don't like this movie, it's often because of the twist - the predictable, foreseeable twist.To those critics I can only say that this movie doesn't even need to have a twist.Shutter Island builds up a surrealistic, dream-woven, poetic atmosphere. Since the whole story is imaginary and spins around and around in a single mind, having a twist means nothing else but coming back to our point of departure.So, to some, this movie has a twist. To others, it hasn't. It's relative. But that's not the point.Why are you looking for a twist anyway - what actually are you looking for? I don't get it. You never watch movies twice? You never read a story twice?Shutter Island is a very good movie because it works like a poem."
christian-mcleer,"Feb 19, 2010",9/10,"First off, if you are a fan of Scorsese' previous films (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, The Departed), you need to know that Shutter Island is a whole new style for this director.Shutter Island is a psychological thriller, starring Leonardo De Caprio as Teddy Daniels, that attacks our fears on an entire new level. The overall dark tone and bleak state of mind we are in builds and builds, never letting go through out the movies entirety. The film is thrilling, captivating, and most importantly, extremely entertaining. I was not once asking myself when the film was going to be over and found myself so engaged in the story that, at times, was unaware I was even watching a film, but that I was living it.Some have complained that they are dissatisfied with the ending and saw it coming from miles away. Yes, you may think you know where it is going, that you anticipated the right turn when in arrived, but no one will be expecting the sudden left turn it makes in the films conclusion.While Shutter Island was made by a true master of the film trade, one thing you will find unpleasantly delightful, is the director's ability to genuinely creep you out in several terrifying scenes. The film doesn't rely on loud bags in the silence (although a few do occur, and will make you jump) but more on dark imagery and even darker dialogue that never lets up and brings the tension to a painfully disturbing level. This one will not escape your thoughts so easily.The only major flaw I found in the film was within the ending. Not to say it wasn't terrifying or original, but the mystery revealed, in my opinion, is one that has become quite overplayed and generic in recent years. That being said, Scorsese adds his usual twist and craft to it, dressing it up in an entirely new way.I found Shutter Island to be a fantastic film and encourage everyone to go see it. Ol' Marty hasn't lost his touch as a truly talented film maker and seeing this film puts you in store for a great ride."
mike-adly5,"May 23, 2010",9/10,"Shutter Island..A journey from darkness to revelation.Highly anticipated through the vibe of Here's-another-Scorsese-DiCaprio- collaboration, Shutter Island delivers what's expected and more. It is an acting-directing masterpiece that won't fail most of its viewers. Set in 1954, this is a story of Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio), US marshal, who's called for a special investigation of the disappearance of a psychiatric patient from an island based asylum for the criminally insane. As Teddy steps foot into grim Ashecliffe, he's disturbed by the looks of the patients on the outer grounds of the hospital, but he has no idea that what he's about to encounter is out of his wildest expectations.Based on a novel with the same name by Dennis Lehane, writer of ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""Mystic River"", this story needed a great ensemble of actors lead by none other than legendary director Martin Scorsese to live up to its viewers expectations, and luckily it did. Scorsese had also chosen his all time buddy Film Editor and 3 time Academy Award winner Thelma Schoonmaker, the lady behind editing movies like ""Gangs of New York"", ""The Departed"" and ""The Aviator"", to become his editing mastermind. I say, since Marty chose to employ flashbacks, visions and short intervening scenes to help reach the dramatic climax of the story, he needed the helping hand of such a remarkable editor.In this picture, not only is your mind captivated by the thrill of the story, but also your senses by its absorbing setup and its powerful score. Throughout the movie, you can tell that a great effort has been exerted in the art direction especially in scenes of Teddy's dreams, visions and flashbacks. And it's all only backed up by a brilliant choice of music that serves achieving no less than the desired emotional state of the audience.And just as if you aren't satisfied with brilliant acting of DiCaprio, Ruffalo and Kingsley, Martin Scorsese presents a triple serving of spectacular short appearances by Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley. Each with a story of their own, they not only deliver dazzling performances that may very well earn them supporting role nominations, but they also push the story forward toward its ultimate revelation.In Short, apart from a rather limited hype of negative criticism towards the similarities of the story and an old silent film called The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Shutter Island has had a great reception worldwide and had been very well appreciated by the book readers and those who just saw the movie. I say if a movie is the highest grossing and the most financially successful in Martin Scorsese's career, you should see it if you haven't already."
ahmed_joey_10,"Mar 11, 2010",10/10,"I went today to see 'Shutter Island' with so many reasons and worries that would make me hate it, cause first of all I've read the novel (one of the best novels I've ever read) and I've never seen a movie before that was better than the novel it's based on and also due to some of the bad reviews this movie has got..but I have to thank God that I was wrong!! Every element of Shutter Island was top notch...Leo does it again and shows to everyone who questions his talent how brilliant he is by his performance as Teddy Daniels. Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo and Michelle Williams all gave superb supporting performances too. Cinematography and Lights had a major role in keeping the atmosphere of the movie as mysterious and uncomfortable as possible, it made you feel what Teddy Daniels is going through..and finally, the direction. Mr. Martin Scorsese, the king of masterpieces, gives us again another masterpiece of his. It's not only that he knows how to control all of the cinematic equipment he's got the way he wants, but he also puts the viewer's mind exactly where he wants..Through his image, this plot had more depth, more passion, more subtlety and much much more tension that made this movie literally surpass it's novel by all means..I read some reviews that complained about the predictability of the movie, which I didn't feel while watching it, but even if it is a predictable movie, this won't lessen anything from it's value..you can watch it for it's great performances, character development, the mysterious and tension filled atmosphere, the well thought and written dialog and an original score that helped keeping the tension for two and a half hours. All in all, an unforgettable experience and a must see thriller, from an all star cast and the best director out there."
ferguson-6,"Feb 20, 2010",8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh yes, the psychological thriller is my favorite movie genre. Not sure what that says about me. There are so few good ones, at least since Alfred Hitchcock passed on. Director Martin Scorsese often includes some psychological warfare in his films, but with ""Shutter Island"", he leaps feet first into the world of the criminally insane.This is a very difficult film to comment on because it is crucial that the viewer watch with a clean slate ... in other words, don't let someone toss out some spoilers if you plan to see the film. All I will say regarding the story is that it's fun to watch and my brain was working non-stop the whole time (that's a good thing!). Scorcese uses many different camera angles, close-ups and bright red to go with the island storm. The film has some of the style of his Cape Fear, but even more darkness to the story, as here, EVERY character is a bit off center.Scorsese has, as usual, assembled an excellent cast. Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead as Teddy. His partner is played by Mark Ruffalo and they ""investigate"" the disappearance of a patient from Shutter Island - a treatment center for the criminally insane. This is no vacation island and at the center is a civil war fort that houses the worst of the worst. The creepy place is run by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, who could both make afternoon English Tea seem downright ominous.The cast is so strong that Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson are basically limited to one scene each and Jackie Earle Haley continues his resurgence with a wicked one on one scene with Leo. Michelle Williams makes her appearances via flashbacks, visions and sweaty, late night dreams. By the end of the film, her ugly yellow dress was itself a frightening prop.To cap off the mental and emotional turmoil, Scorsese adds an unusual score that at first seems overbearing at odd times, but later reveals itself to have been ""right"" all along. My favorite shot of the film is at the very beginning when the ferry first breaks through the fog. Funny enough, it was ME in a fog for the next 2 hours!"
Juan-in-South-FL,"Sep 3, 2021",6/10,"This is a major Scorsese so it's worth seeing but fails to cohere fully, which could be ascribed to the very large cast and complicated plot. I am still trying to find out who played 'Dr. Sheehan' but If I ever do, it probably won't help sort out the whole film. However, DiCaprio is stalwart, as the film needs him to be, and there is an abundance of filmic pleasures."
evanston_dad,"Jul 28, 2010",6/10,"Martin Scorsese's Gothic thriller works overtime to wring chills from its creepy setting (an institution for the criminally insane) and mysterious plot twists. But despite, or maybe because of, all of the obvious and heavy-handed directorial flourishes (moody film noir lighting, constant rain and thunder, a screechy score that announces every emotion you should be feeling before you're allowed to feel it), the film is surprisingly unengaging and, even more surprisingly given its stylish director, fairly pedestrian.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a federal marshal who travels with his partner (Mark Ruffalo) to the eponymous island to investigate the disappearance of an inmate. They butt up against uncooperative administrators (Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow) and uncover a possible conspiracy that involves inmates being used in mind-control experiments similar to the ones inflicted by the Nazis on concentration-camp Jews. Throughout, we're treated to dream-like flashbacks in which we learn things about DiCaprio's past and help us understand the personal vendettas driving his behavior. Everything builds to a surprise plot twist that's meant no doubt to make us question everything we've watched up to that point in the film but which frankly didn't come as that much of a surprise.The film is chock-full of recognizable faces in brief cameos: Michelle Williams, Jackie Earle Haley, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine and most notably Patricia Clarkson. But despite the film's high production values and A-list cast, it's hard to believe that someone as talented and capable as Martin Scorsese made this. It's not a bad movie, but it's an awfully mediocre one. There's a reason a film by such a high-profile director was dumped in theatres in the dead of winter.Grade: B"
moonspinner55,"Mar 15, 2011",5/10,"Once director Martin Scorsese attained widespread acceptance from moviegoers (and mainstream critics) with the commercial success of ""Cape Fear"" in 1991, he quickly turned into a 'blockbuster' filmmaker, one who had his pick of top-rank collaborators. The Scorsese name became a brand--like Spielberg's--however, the movies he has chosen to work on since do not always echo the interests of the young, raw Scorsese. With ""Shutter Island"", an adaptation of the novel by Dennis Lehane, the stamp of Scorsese becomes interchangeable with that of Shyamalan, De Palma, Polanski...even the ghost of Stanley Kubrick, whose ""The Shining"" seems to be the inspirational starting point for this thin, shuddery yarn. Leonard DiCaprio plays a US Federal Marshal in 1954 investigating the disappearance of a female mental patient from a locked-down asylum in the Boston Harbor. Elements of other films keep turning up in Laeta Kalogridis' mediocre script, which incorporates (at various intervals) concentration camp detail with a triple homicide that is both exploitative and distasteful. The large cast is solid; for the most part, Scorsese has retained his uncanny ability to bring out the best in his actors, though I'm not sure how deeply DiCaprio is feeling his role. The star's frequent scowl doesn't reveal anything but a petulant nature which, when coupled with his youthful appearance, doesn't lend much conviction to a character who is alternately a soldier, a family man, and a government employee. DiCaprio is making a career out of seeming miscast and, since this entire house-of-cards plot rests on his shoulders, the denouement isn't the heartbreaker it should have been. The picture is vividly atmospheric and features excellent technical detail, yet it is a glum undertaking burdened with overwrought profanities ill-suited to the era. This is what Martin Scorsese wants to bide his time with? ** from ****"
freemantle_uk,"Mar 17, 2010",9/10,"Martin Scorsese has proved time and again that he is one of the greatest film makers ever to have lived, with even his not so good film are still better then most of the films that come out. After winning his long awaited Oscar for The Departed Scorsese took his time before delivering us Shutter Island.Set in 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are assigned a case to go to a mental institute on Shutter Island, off the coast of Boston. A patient, Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer) had escaped from her cell and it's clear that there was no way she could have done it alone. Teddy starts to suffer dreams and flashbacks involving when he helped liberate a concentration camp in Germany, and messages from his dead wife Dolores (Michelle Williams), offering him guidance. Whilst investigating Teddy becomes paranoid, believing there is a wider conspiracy, with patients being coached, and that the leading psychiatrists Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) were conducting experiments on the patients and that Teddy's arrival on the island was a trap. Teddy also plans to find the man who torched his apartment building where his wife died. He too was an inmate on the island.Scorsese shows once again his skill behind the camera, giving the audience a stylist, neo-noir story with a very eerie atmosphere throughout. He keeps the mystery going in this fast paced film. He tells a very compelling thriller with good horror moments in what must have been a complex novel. It is stylist, but also has a lot of substance. He give justice to Laeta Kalogridis' screenplay.Once again Scorsese turns to Leonardo DiCaprio for the lead role and DiCaprio gives one on his best performances, and a very mature performance as the guilt ridden officer. He has proved like Brad Pitt that he is more then just a pretty boy but also a very talented actor in a long career. Ben Kingsley has finally performed in film where he can give a more understated performance which he is better at. He offers a sly performance as the main antagonist of the film. Mark Ruffalo is an actor who has made his career in supporting roles, and again he does a good performance as Ted's main ally.Despite all the positives to the film, everything did not add up and by about the two thirds of the way through I guessed the big twist. However, that does not diminish the quality of the film.Shutter Island will easily make my Top 10 for 2010."

horrorreviews123,"Jul 14, 2010",8/10,"Shutter Island is an example of a horror film that doesn't require any distracting action sequences, pointless side-storys, token characters, or useless nudity to draw its audiences in.Shutter Island is Scorsese's psychological horror film. Obviously the star is Leonardo DiCaprio, but the supporting cast stood out as well. There wasn't really a misplaced actor in the entire film. Every character stood out as necessary, as did every particular scene with those characters. The movie moves at a solid pace and doesn't let up from the start.The movies atmosphere starts as the opening scene begins, and doesn't let up until the credits. Shutter Island is a movie that starts out good and doesn't let go. An intriguing storyline and genius film making make Shutter Island a highly recommended film for fans of the genre. It isn't your typical popcorn horror film, as it starts out slow and builds itself without any flashy special effects. This doesn't stop the effectiveness of the movie, as scenes are disturbing and the twists work well"
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Oct 1, 2017",8/10,"'Shutter Island (2010)' is a film entirely about perspective, and the first time I watched the picture I was so immersed into the perspective of the protagonist - whose point of view is intrinsically inseparable from the narrative and integral to the success of its various reveals - that I was totally swept up and taken along for the ride, made to dance like a marionette to the thriller's tightly-timed and twisty tune. I was completely in sync with DiCaprio's increasingly disheveled detective and experienced all the same emotional beats that he did, ranging from fear and confusion to sadness and even denial. As such, I was captivated and totally on board no matter how outlandish or somewhat confusing certain aspects may have seemed. I've now seen it twice, however, and the second viewing was a very different experience as, while our perspective isn't entirely out of sync with that of the protagonist, the knowledge of what's to come provides a slightly different point of view which transforms even something as simple as a sideways glance into something altogether more monumental. While the second viewing inevitably isn't as impactful as the first (in fact, it exposes a number of issues such as some second act pacing problems), it holds up remarkably well under the scrutiny of examination afforded by the separation of audience and character that occurs once you know the flick's final hand. It's still surprisingly emotionally resonant, too. 8/10."
ngiuphobia,"Apr 9, 2010",9/10,"Bite me for watching it only to fill my Loe-hunger! haha. And...for the fact that Leo paired with Martin Scorsese always made a good movie. Since Gangs of New York to finally set an Oscar in The Departed. Now another psychological thriller, breath-taking journey in an asylum scenes. Leo plays U.S Marshall Teddy Daniels who was in 1954 went to Ashecliff Hospital with his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Rufallo) to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient who vanished from a locked room. The hospital itself located in a cluster island called Shutter Island. There they meet the head psychiatrist, Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who's suspicious enough to make our Marshall suspect him of doing something unusual to patients inside the hospital. Later soon they claimed they've found Rachel, but Teddy insisted they must have hid something else inside the place. So he continue his investigation, along with his strong will to find his wife's killer who was said already sent there, but nothing related to him was ever found in the hospital. Emerges to uncover the conspiracy, along with fear and the urge of finding his wife's killer, bring Teddy to the edge of his sanity itself.At the end, Scorsese rewarded you with a beautiful twist which I already guessed ^^'. But as an adaptation from a famous novel of same title by David Lehane, this movie sure worth to watch. Leo's act, as usual, never failed me. He plays this fragile Marshall even more than just 'very well'. And Mark Rufallo as a sidekick isn't bad at all. In fact, almost all casts played beautifully here. One thing, I admire how Scorsese put the first person point-of-view into a great visual adventure for us. He even successfully made us questioned our own sanity, like it could happen to any of us is many ways. But I think it will be just perfect if he also develop its mysterious surrounding area a lil'bit more, or bringing even greater thrill to our throat by taking a little attention to the doctors and workers around them. But I guess since it is indeed Teddy's own journey to follow, I can take it nicely.In the end, I suggest you to bring extra food as the movie is a bit slow and action-less. You who doesn't like drama or psychological thriller might get bored. But trust me, it's definitely worth the sacrifice. He's Leonardo DiCaprio afterall ^.*"
h-60890,"Feb 2, 2022",10/10,"What a Sophie's choice! To live as a monster or to die as a good man? Huh!It is just so damn true that the reality is so hard to be accepted that some of us cannot help but create a different self or a whole new fantasy to make ourselves feel better, as if the whole incident never happened. Once this kind of avoidance-esque behavior goes to the extreme, one might lose their sanity and live out the terrifying lie despite what everyone else says.Life is a journey where anything could happen at any point. Maybe my friend is right about learning to pick up things real quick and to foresee the trajectory before making any moves. Teddy might also be guilty of not tending his wife before she became a total whack job. Sigh. You can never connect the dots until you look backwards, as Steve Jobs rightly said so.Sybil."
johnbell-667-93818,"Feb 21, 2010",7/10,"This is a very uneven movie: It has a sappy story, and is drawn-out in the telling, and it has sensationalist references to Nazis and the Holocaust; but these references can't be taken too seriously and thus seem exploitative, even though they are possibly important in understanding the main character. But there are some brilliant surrealist scenes and shots in SHUTTER ISLAND. The use of colour was very effective and involving.I'd read the book, so the suspense wasn't as great; the friend I saw it with, who had not read the book, liked the movie better than I did, and thought it was deeper than I did. The acting was good, particularly by Mark Ruffalo, and by actors who have only one scene, among them Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas."

eddie_baggins,"Oct 13, 2019",10/10,"In a career littered with cinematic masterpieces and beloved gems, Shutter Island sometimes appears to be one of the more forgotten about Martin Scorsese films, living in the shadows of granddaddy's like Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed but there's no doubt this pulpy, over the top and entirely great thriller is one of the living legends most accessible and enjoyable rides.Adapted from Dennis Lehane's book of the same name, Shutter Island is a rained drenched and atmospheric mystery with more intrigue, suspense and twists and turns than you can count, as Scorsese and his favourite leading man Leonardo DiCaprio get caught up in a missing persons case on the haunting lunatic asylum island that houses the Ashecliffe Hospital, run by its potentially devious boss Dr. Crawley, played with gleeful intensity by Sir Ben Kingsley.Filled with stunning shots by DOP Robert Richardson, a moody and nerve rattling score and fantastic supporting turns from the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley, Shutter Island is a complete of a picture as one would expect from a filmmaker of the caliber of Scorsese with the bonus being Shutter Island feels almost like three films in one.At first a more straight up mystery that morphs slowly into a horror like battle against the mind and potential nefarious forces that then becomes a haunting examination of trauma and grief, Scorsese ensures that Shutter Island is jam-packed with memorable imagery, unexpected detours and contemplative questions too become so much more than the film the synopsis or narrative might at first suggest.It's a wild ride and one that the first viewing will take many by complete surprise that's enhanced by a terrific DiCaprio performance that must surely rank amongst some of the best work the leading man has ever done.Great in other Scorsese efforts Gangs of New York, The Aviator and The Departed, for my mind DiCaprio's turn as the traumatized widower and war veteran turned U.S Marshall Teddy Daniels is one of the actors most assured performances.Tasked with inhabiting a range of different emotions and character traits, DiCaprio's transformative turn as a man battling his own demons as well as the demons of the island is awards worthy and a main reason why Shutter Island is still so regarded by casual viewers to this day.A unique film in both a genre sense and in Scorsese's career sense, Shutter Island may not get the plaudits that its other Scorsese relatives get but there's no reason to suggest this isn't as good or even better than many of its other highly regarded bloodline.Final Say -A seriously enjoyable and deeply haunting experience, Shutter Island sees Scorsese and DiCaprio on the top of their game, having fun, exploring important themes and making movies like only the best of them can dare dream to do.5 magic glasses of water out of 5"
those_who_dig,"Jun 16, 2015",6/10,"'Shutter Island' is a Martin Scorsese film about a federal officer, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who visits a high-security hospital for the criminally insane, and this facility is located on a remote island. This setting immediately establishes a feeling of bleakness, isolation and dystopia, which amplifies greatly as 'Shutter Island' progresses. I think that Scorsese's maintenance of the grim atmosphere is one of the strongest qualities of the film, but this hard exterior belies the hollow psychology of 'Shutter Island'. The dark exploration of the mind doesn't hold a candle to 'Taxi Driver', nor do the twists live up to 'The Departed'. I felt as though the portrayal of insanity in 'Shutter Island' was a little too cartoonlike, seeming to resemble something you'd find in Gotham City. This discredits the film, in my opinion, and makes 'Shutter Island' feel very hollow and superficial at times. There are one or two satisfying twists throughout the film, but I don't think that they sufficiently compensate for the tedium of the first half. DiCaprio's objectives in the film seem ambiguous at times, and, combined with the barrage of flashbacks and hallucinations, 'Shutter Island' often feels like a video game played inattentively. The film isn't a disaster, though, as the editing is very enjoyable at times, and Scorsese's creation of the cold, dystopian landscape has to be commended. I just wish that this film was a little more 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' or 'The Silence of the Lambs', and a little less 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'."
brandon_lee420,"Jul 13, 2010",8/10,"While the film was in theatres, I took my chance to read the book that made this film come alive. The book was fantastic and puzzles and twists were very surprising. When the film reached my local video store, I took my chance to grab it off the shelf and view it. The film does a good job of having the same atmosphere and dialog as the book while also staying true to it, as well. The cast did an excellent job of portraying the characters in the book and their performances were over the top. If I hadn't read the book, I would've given this film a perfect ten but that could, sadly, not happen since I already knew what was going to happen and it made the film a bit more boring. The dialog in Shutter Island is mostly what you read in the book but the people who say those lines do a really good job. Two particular lines that were used in both the film and books were, ""Thorns as big as my d*ck."" and ""Pull yourself together, Teddy."" and I remember them a bit more than the others because one was funny and the other one was cool. So cool in fact is that I wake up every morning and splash water onto my face and stare at the mirror and exactly say that line. The acting was top notch in this motion picture with Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, and Jackie Earle Haley taking the top four spots. Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion, did a superb job of portraying Teddy Daniels and my vision of Teddy was what Leonardo gave us. He plays a U.S. marshal who is investigating the disappearance of one of the patients from the Ashcliff Hospital for the criminally insane. Along the way he discovers puzzles and finds out that everybody is keeping a secret from him. He really gave a convincing act. Ben Kingsley does a well done job of Dr. John Cawley, who is the somewhat mysterious, and his accent is really cool. Mark Ruffalo plays the partner of Teddy, Chuck Aule, as they are sent to the hospital where a mystery plagues the entire hospital. Ruffalo impressed me a lot in this film and he does a good job of knowing nothing when he really does. The best and by the far most impressive actor has to be Jackie Earle Haley for his wonderful role as George Noyce, a mental nutcase who speaks in riddles. Haley knows how to act in a good, realistic way and that is what separated him from everyone else and made him the king of Shutter Island. A lot of people are saying that this isn't one of the Scorsese's best works but I have to disagree and say that this his second best film after, of course, ""The Departed"". I suggest that you stop listening to these remarks and just be immersed into this complex yet fascinating mystery/thriller/horror. The wardrobe for this film matches the year it was set in and it does give the film a 1954 feeling. The makeup is quite good as well from the hairstyles to the facial makeup.In 1954, Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, from Seattle travel to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient there, Rachel Solando. She had been sectioned at the institution for dangerous criminals at Ashcliffe Hospital, because she drowned her three kids. Teddy is a veteran WWII soldier, traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Duchan concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that his investigation is obstructed by the management by the Federal facility. Teddy has severe migraines and when there is a storm; Teddy and Chuck find that they are stranded in the island. Teddy interviews the internees and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery about the Shutter Island.Roger Ebert wrote in his review, ""the movie is about: atmosphere, ominous portents, the erosion of Teddy's confidence and even his identity. It's all done with flawless directorial command. Scorsese has fear to evoke, and he does it with many notes."" and I have to agree with that. He awarded the film 3 and a half stars. People on IMDb who wrote negatively about the film mostly complained about the ending and how they would have liked it to go in another direction. Well, I have a message for them: LIVE WITH IT! The ending was as perfect as it gets but in the film you don't get as much shock form it like the shock you get by reading the book. If anyone is reading this review make sure that you don't read any reviews that contain spoilers because most of them ruin the surprise ending and with a delicate film like this it is easy to say, ""Sh*t! I wish I could go back in time!!AHH!"". The flashbacks that haunt Teddy are portrayed in a mean, nasty way from the war, his life, and his wife. This film should be recommended to people who love Scorsese's works because this is one of his masterpieces that you have to feast upon. I also strongly suggest is that, if you can, read the book before you watch the film because it will make you want to view the film more. I watched it so I could compare this with the book and I was very happy as a result. 8/10 - Shutter Island is a film that you can't miss out on and that is a rule!""Over and Out."" 13 July, 2010."

tpaladino,"Mar 26, 2010",9/10,"I had heard that this movie was a disappointment... I even had the ending ruined for me about a month before it came out. Both of those things kept me from seeing it until I could catch it on PPV.I have to say that not only was this film not a disappointment in any way, but the fact that I 'knew' what the ending was didn't detract from the experience at all.Scorcese was really masterful at weaving a story that is absolutely engrossing and thrilling without resorting to creepy effects or obvious scare tactics (which would have been the cheap and easy way to tell this story). It was wonderful and refreshing, to say the least, to watch a genuinely interesting thriller that takes place at a secluded mental institution and not have to endure shock scenes of ghoulish creatures or other overused devices like that.I've read some of the bad reviews and critiques, and I honestly have to say that I don't understand what they're on about at all. Its a great movie."
Ruskington,"Feb 4, 2021",6/10,"Undoubtedly stylish and unabashedly Hitchcockian, Shutter Island is brewing with promise in its early stages. However, as the story progresses it becomes clear where things are heading and everything feels a bit derivative and obvious. The reliance on stark brutality to provide meaning and motive is unrelenting and the final act is much more gruesome than captivating. A long way from Scorsese's best work."
david-phillips-4,"Mar 30, 2010",8/10,"Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River), Shutter Island tells the story of 1950's US Marshall Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) as he and his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) as they head to Shutter Island, a mental institute for the criminally insane, to find an escaped in-mate.All is not what it seems on the foreboding Shutter Island: the staff, led by a particularly creepy (SIR!) Ben Kingsley, seem almost reluctant to help the case progress and are seem almost conspiratorial with the inmates to cloud the investigation. On top of this, Daniels himself has another agenda for being involved involving his murdered wife.All of which weaves a tangled web that really get the grey matter working, especially if, like me, you are inclined to enjoy the challenge of keeping pace with the detective in a detective story. The movie is very much in a similar vein to Scorsese's Cape Fear remake, complete with a seriously imposing score, sweeping camera moves and scene compositions that comfortably straddle Film Noir and thrillers from the 50's stylistics.Whilst the cast are adequate in what they do, the movie really belongs to Scorsese. The look and sound of the movie is entrenched in Cape Fear territory, but the atmosphere of the movie is much more akin to Polanski's paranoia classics Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. It is credit to Scorsese that this side to the movie is the most apparent and helps entwine the viewer in the tangled web that is Shutter Island. There seems to me to be a real focus on Scorsese's vision for the movie and the result is indelibly stamped as a Scorsese movie much more than it will ever be a DiCaprio movie.DiCaprio does cope well with his role and one thing that DiCaprio does so well that many of his contemporaries cannot is show genuine vulnerability. Although, I personally find him to still look a little too young-looking and not grizzled enough to play characters such as Daniels, this reservation was lost once Shutter Island came into view.The movie will have you revisiting themes and scenes long after the titles roll and it is certainly a movie to discuss afterwards rather than file away as 2 hours of escapism. The movie also invites a second viewing, although I think a DVD/blu-ray with a director's commentary would be my own viewing choice.www.writeronthestorm.wordpress.com"

TreyLovesMovies,"Jul 8, 2010",8/10,"Martin Scorsese is one of the last living legends of film-making. His latest offering Shutter Island once again stars his current muse Leonardo DiCaprio and continues their tradition of creating quality cinema together. Though the film doesn't reach high tier Scorsese, this effective mystery story proves that the director is still very much a master of his craft.The story weaves a web of intrigue surrounding an escaped prisoner on the mysterious Shutter Island, home to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. DiCaprio stars as US Marshall Teddy Daniels, who, along with his partner played by Mark Ruffalo, is sent to assist in the investigation and re-apprehension of the patient. They are met with underscored hostility and reserved answers from the staff, which leads Daniels to believe that there is more to the island and its facility than the staff are letting on.Scorsese presents his audience with images that instill a sense of uneasiness that never lets up. His use of a hurricane, decaying buildings, and disturbing nightmares prove incredibly effective in drenching the film's atmosphere with uncertainty and confusion. With a haunting score and lovely, dreary cinematography by veteran Robert Richardson rounding out the sense of impending doom nicely.The movie's themes are hard to discuss without spoiling the shocking finale, but know that they deal with the power of our mind and how easily we can use that power to deceive ourselves, preventing us from having to accept the truth, especially when it is ugly and unbearable. Such dark themes make the overall affair rather depressing to witness, but this is also its greatest strength.The film's biggest weakness is that it is billed as a thriller, and though Scorsese is obviously trying to draw viewers to the edge of their seat, he often fails, obtaining a strong level of uncertainty rather than fearful anxiety. This makes the film work more as an intriguing mystery.If you are in search of a thoughtful, adult film that is loaded with subtle chills and superb performances, Shutter Island is a place you want to visit. Just beware that what you see there is not always reality."
TamPalm,"Feb 21, 2010",6/10,"I was ambivalent before going into this movie. I read some great reviews on IMDb and I love Leo Dicaprio as an actor so that made me excited to see it. However, I am not a big Scorce fan--I thought ""Departed"" was overrated--so that made me kind-of leery. Unfortunately, just like ""Departed,"" this movie was overly morbid and the r.o.i (return on investment) was insufficient.Like others have stated, you keep waiting on the big twist in this movie, but it never comes. I read that this movie is for ""smart"" people, but not really. It didn't require a lot of thinking at all. If you've ever seen one of the many movies about the criminally insane, then you've pretty much seen this movie already--only chances are this movie is not as good as the ones you saw.So I fell asleep...and when I woke up only to see that I really didn't miss much--this movie is sooo slow--I tried to make myself go back to sleep again. But to no avail. This movie is a sleeper in the literal sense. It, like ""Up in the Air,"" is over-hyped maybe based on its cast or something. But you will leave with a ""what did I just see?"" feeling and you'll wonder what more constructive activity you could have been doing for that couple of hours. A real blah of a movie experience. Lift me up (with all the hype) then leave me hanging...just hanging there in thin air waiting...waiting...roll credits. *sigh* My six rating is generous and given mostly because the acting is good. That's about all that's not blah (and even it couldn't save the film.)"

Playing Teddy Daniels required him to portray multiple characteristics that changed with the circumstances in the story. His keen understanding of the role and submersion into the director's vision enabled him to deliver such a stellar performance. Mark Ruffalo is commendable as Chuck while Ben Kingsley delivers the right amount of composure that looks convincing as a Doctor of the criminally insane patients. Watch them all together in the lighthouse where the truth is revealed through some very powerful performances. The rest of the cast that played Dolores, Rachel(s), George Noyce and Naehring leave quite an impact that blends with the film's turbulent theme of misdirection and evil.Shutter Island is a chilling thriller. The surprises keep coming and even if one has read the book or knows its suspense, Scorcese's direction can easily hold you to your seats with a great screenplay by Kalogridis. The cinematography brilliantly captures the essence of 1954 while portraying nature's wrath on the island during the hurricane. This is one of the rare adaptations of a novel that is executed page-by-page with the same depiction of every character, building, structure, plant, color, storm, cave and cliff that was visualized by the reader. To that, Scorcese adds his distinct style in Teddy's recurring flashbacks during the war and his last moments with his wife. Scorcese's display of blood looks artistic compared to the screen splattering in Tarantino's movies. Certainly there is a reason why the 40 film old director has a Golden eye behind his black frames.8.508 on a scale of 1-10."
