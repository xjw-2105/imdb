Loving_Silence,"Aug 12, 2010",10/10,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10"
rc_whittle,"Dec 19, 2002",10/10,"It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of ""Smeagol"" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for ""The Two Towers"" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. ""Definitive"" is not strong enough of a word.If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings ""The Two Towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.Go, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat."
Mithrindir,"Dec 30, 2004",10/10,"From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made."
justinrsko,"Dec 8, 2002",10/10,"The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers."
docmonster,"Dec 18, 2002",N/A,"Every great adventure story worth telling has a solid hero - someone who puts others before themselves and uses their talents to do their best at keeping the forces of evil at bay even if it means the loss of life and limb. At its core, this movie has eight such heroes and each one lives up to the call. From Pippin and Merry, the lost hobbits who aid the Ents in battle, to Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas who held back the hordes at Helms Deep to Frodo and Samwise who continue to make their dangerous and arduous trek to Mount Doom. All of these characters are heroes and they're played with love, respect and meaning.Though the acting in this film was top notch throughout, I found myself amazed by Gollum's (motion captured body and voice by Andy Serkis) overall performance. Though obviously CGI, there was so much emotion in this character that I couldn't help believe he was real! Though ""Final Fantasy"" was the only movie that created the most realistic CGI characters that dominated an entire film, Gollum is lightyears ahead with the simple fact that this deformed li'l hobbit seemed human. He had the spark of life behind those eyes that the FF ""cast"" lacked.As a film, this movie has it all - action, drama, comedy - but none of it would've worked without characters we cared about, villains we despised and heroes we cheered for. With the obvious success of the first two installments, the release of the final film next December may prove this to be THE BEST trilogy ever made!"
joe_unander,"Dec 18, 2002",10/10,"Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring ""actors"" not ""stars""; ""Oscar-worthy"" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute.Highly recommended, 10/10."
auuwws,"Sep 28, 2020",9/10,Great movie I really enjoyed watching and better than the first part
joe_hill,"Dec 21, 2002",1/10,"The problem with this movie is that Peter Jackson seem to believe that Middle- earth is somewhere in the Star Wars galaxy or on board James Camerons Titanic. Therefore he has re-written the story from the book in an attempt to make it ""bigger and better"". In the original text there where no fun side-kicks with good one-liners and there where not enough cool toys so Peter had to throw in some Orc wolf riders and dwarf jokes. Then he find Frodos meeting with Faramir to be a bit too boring in the book, so he ""spice it up"" with a ""dramatic"" scene where Frodo stands in front of a ring wraith trying to give it the ring. Yeah baby! There are also plenty of not good enough acting from the extras. Extremely theatrical lines like ""Look it's the king!"" are a bit too common. If you thought the books where boring then maybe this is a film for you. Now there are plenty of ""fun"" side-kicks in it to save you from embarrassing seconds of silence or non-action. If you actually liked the books, stay away from this movie."
tfrizzell,"Mar 25, 2003",N/A,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs, Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment (""The Return of the King""). Many view ""The Two Towers"" as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5."
JohnLennon1985,"Dec 18, 2002",10/10,"Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto.The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time.The scale is broken. 10 is not a capacity sufficient enough to hold this movie... my movie... my... precious..."
TheLittleSongbird,"Mar 8, 2011",10/10,"I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
jasonmg99,"Feb 10, 2004",10/10,I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well made. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy should receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action as is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you see movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything. That alone surpasses all movies.10/10 (actually more than that)
Xstal,"Apr 3, 2023",8/10,"The quest to melt the ring in Doom continues, as two Hobbits and a Gollum lacking sinews, crossing marshes full of dread, towards the Black Gate's where they head, and then they're captured by the brother, of one once dear (although he was somewhat affected by the ring before expiring). After fleeing from an evil band of orcs, another pair of Hobbits sit with stalks, of an Ent known as Treebeard, who gets annoyed when friends are sheared, summons brethren, and against the foe they walk. Helm's Deep provides the backdrop for a battle, where sabres, swords and axes are all rattled, but walls come tumbling down, as the Uruk-hai hit town, when their hoards stampede and charge like crazy cattle."
EVON1TY,"Mar 2, 2023",10/10,"As you know Tolkien did a great job with creating the world. Also did a perfect job with writing the battles. Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.I think The Siege of Minas-Tirith sequence is also pretty good and flawless. But the horror and darkness is so effective in The Helm's Deep Battle. You may predict the Rohan People are going to win, they're the good guys after all. But even if you are watching this movie second time, you will feel that hopeless times again.The first half of the movie feels slow, I think that brings realistic style to a fantasy movie. Of course there is too important scenes in the first half of the movie, I'm saying the most important scenes are in the second half of the movies. This goes for all three movies.Tell me how can a movie achieve this much? Costume Design, Makeup, Art Direction & Set Decoration, Film Editing, VFX, SFX, Scores. The Trilogy manages to be revolutionary nearly all of that. At least it is Revolutionary in 5 of them. Some movies made me love some genres, The Lord of the Rings made me love the Cinema."
dcastor,"Dec 18, 2002",9/10,"I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazgûls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.I rate the movie 9/10 (my highest so far)."
stakes,"Dec 21, 2002",7/10,"The Two Towers is an enjoyable, and sometimes very good movie, but was a dissappointment to me in the wake of the sheer masterpiece that was The Fellowship Of The Ring.Director Peter Jackson was able to fill the FOTR with a variety of well-developed characters, a sweeping cinematic landscape, a tense and intriguing storyline, and an overall depth that the book itself possessed. I am no expert on the books, but I do know that FOTR truly delivered the spirit of the book.Now having said that, one could just take all the battles and action, and hordes of armies and violent characters that exist in the books, plunk them into a bunch of fighting sequences, and make great action movies.  The FOTR went beyond that, and captured the true heart of the original book, which is why it was so good, and will go down as a cinematic classic, much in the same way the books will go down as litterary classics.Being Peter Jackson more or less filmed the trilogy of Lord Of The Rings films back-to-back, I figured that the sheer brilliance put forth in FOTR would be present.  That is not the case.Instead, Jackson has delivered the aforementioned action movie.  There's epic battle after epic battle, swordsman after swordsman, but little else. The centerpiece of the books and the first film -- the Hobbits -- are something of an afterthought in the TT, while swashbuckling swordsman Aragorn and bow and arrow marksmen Legolas take the spotlight.  These are characters who are embody the standard action movie hero in every sense, but again, don't begin to scrape the depths of the book, which is so much more than what is on display here.There's word that Jackson did a lot of re-shooting and editing to the TT in the last 12 months.  Perhaps he felt the pressure to follow up to the mammoth success of FOTR, and decided to take the safe way out.  But what he may have failed to realise is that what made FOTR so great and popular was it's depth beyond your standard action flick.  In the wake of the downward spiral of the Star Wars films, which suffer from the same condition plauging the TT, movie fans were looking to latch on to a new fantasy epic, that could provide the great effects and all of that good stuff, but also deliver the goods in terms of story, charachter, and overall depth.Complaints aside, this is still a fun movie.  For starters, you know that you enjoyed a movie when it clocks in at 3 hours long, and you don't find yourself getting restless, whcih I did not.  Additionally, The CGI is ultra-impressive, there are lots of incredible visuals (though not on par with the first film), and the action sequences are truly amazing.  I just came out dissappointed because one year ago, I went into the theatre to see FOTR not knowing what to expect, and I was given a completley unexpected masterpiece.  This time, I went into the TT expect to see another classic, and instead I was delivered a big-budget action flick.  Fun movie?  Yes. Great special effects? Yes.  Another classic?  No.On a closing note, I think Roger Ebert's review of this movie hits the nail right on the head, and he is able to articulate many of the thoughts I have on this film very successfully."
ChainsawDaveandMisterShoop,"May 17, 2003",1/10,"I was greatly anticipating viewing this film after all the hype and enjoying the first one at the cinema. Unfortunatley I thought this was the biggest load of nonsense I had ever seen. I kept waiting and waiting for the story to get interesting ... and then the film finished. Gollum was rubbish, the scene when he was talking to himself was so bad I had to laugh out loud. Why did the Ork/Human hybrids have bad Cockney accents "" I'm haangry, meats back on the menu"" ??? and what was that tree all about. Am i the only person who gets bored by constant close ups and continued Aragon, son of Bagagon, King of Caragon, Ruler of Daragon etc... type dialogue.It made The Phantom Menace look like Seven Samurai"
MinorityReporter,"Jun 13, 2006",10/10,"The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.The acting is, like in the first film, very good and at times even brilliant. Viggo Mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable Aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release, this was remedied in the extended cut). Also Elijah Wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. This provides for some interesting exchanges between Wood and his faithful companion played by Sean Astin. Bernard Hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor, Brad Dourif. Both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in Hill's character compared to the character from the book. These changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. Ian McKellen's character, Gandalf, has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. Likewise, Hugo Weaving's character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies returns as well and I have to comment on the choice to make Gimli into comic relief, because while I understand the necessity given that Dominic Monaghan's and Billy Boyd's characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension, I found it a shame that Gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. Fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. Among other characters introduced are Faramir, played by David Wenham, and Gollum, played beautifully by Andy Serkis. I'll get back to Faramir but for now I have to comment on Gollum. Gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also Serkis' performance, which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an Oscar nomination. Overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable.The effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. The Gollum character and the battle for Helm's Deep seem to be excellent examples. Gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created CGI character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. As previously stated The Battle for Helm's Deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. Well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in Star Wars: Episode II). This gigantic battle isn't the only battle in the film. There are many other interesting battles but I'm not going to spoil them so you'll just have to see the film yourself. The battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale.Some people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but I completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. Especially David Wenham's character has been criticized and after watching it the first time I was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. There are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of David Wenham's character. Dramatic purposes.Overall The Two Towers serves as an excellent link between the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. One of the very best films of all time.10/10 - On my top 10 of best films"
bopdog,"Dec 18, 2002",10/10,"I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years, including the recent reversion to Tolkein's ""original"" manuscript, edited by his son. I'm a fan. There, I said it, and I'm glad, I tell you!This second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very ""literary"" Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages--- 1,000 to 1,400 pages, depending on the edition your are holding. And that time--- weeks and weeks of pouring over pages, re-reading certain passages, pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs, and histories Tolkein concocted--- allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you, in 2-1/2 hours, that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!Therefore, the movie's focus on action--- and FYI, it is dead-on accurate and faithful to the books--- is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book, and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it--- how could a movie, ANY movie, capture all of the sylvan reverie (including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash, etc.) in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy book-world stuff would be great to see on the screen--- but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screen-time. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many ""festive"" people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.Maybe if we were wishing, we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV mini-series. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously--- I'd have enjoyed it. But then, the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts, else the drama and peril (etc.) would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing, then, I'm wishing for them to have made two projects--- the 3 theater-release movies, AND a 30-hour TV mini-series for all the ""literary"" vibe. But then, instead of a $300 million triology, we'd have had a $1 BILLION dollar (but memorable!) TV mini-series.  Oh well--- if wishing were having...Overall, ""LOTR Two Towers"" is an excellent movie! A ""10"" out of ""10""!!!"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Sep 23, 2023",10/10,"Frodo and Sam continue with their dangerous journey, desperately trying to reach Mordor to destroy the ring, aided by Gollum, who is still conflicted about helping the hobbits.Where do you even start to unpick and comment on a film such as The Two Towers?Epic in every sense, this brilliant film will entertain and thrill you, astonish and move you. This one had me gripped from start to finish, I love the journey, but it's the ending that makes this film so incredible.The battle scenes are astonishing, some of the visuals even now are jaw dropping, the assembled armies look phenomenal. It is pretty much non stop action, for a long film, your attention will be held.The acting, as good as it gets, McKellen, Mortensen and Hill are all considered tremendous, and rightly so. I have to give credit to the magic of Christopher Lee, his very presence and delivery still give me chills, what an actor.Andy Serkis, off the scale, every single Gollum scene was flawless, the voice and visuals are tremendous, what an interesting and successful realisation.10/10."
FilmCreature,"Jul 7, 2007",10/10,"You'd think you can't improve on a 10/10 movie, but this one does, with great action and characters. There isn't much else to say about the special effects that I didn't already in my first review, they're still fantastic. Peter Jackson doesn't treat this like a sequel, it's just the continuing story of heroes battling the forces of evil.Frodo, now alone except for his buddy Sam (Sean Astin), is on his epic journey to Mount Mordor to destroy The One Ring. He'll encounter Gollum, a wretched creature who's definitely up to something.And meanwhile Aragorn and friends are trying to protect the little country of Rohan from imminent destruction from the newly-bred Uruk-Hai, vicious monsters crossed with man and elf.4/4. Wish I'd seen it in theaters."
Barky44,"Aug 5, 2004",9/10,"Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship, but is still outstanding.All the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. All amazing, all brilliant, all Oscar-worthy.The performances are terrific, too. Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, all did great jobs. The supporting actors, too.It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film, I think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is ""brooding"". Such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for ""epic battle sequences"" for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul.A great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers)."
Steven_Hibs,"Aug 10, 2005",8/10,"Peter Jacksons' first major task was to make Lord of the Rings into one film. ""Impossible"", Peter Jackson said, there was no way he could fit all the information into one film. But one of the producers in New Line Cinema said why not make three films because there is three books. It was exactly what the crew making the film wanted to hear. So then the scripts were re-writ to fit three films. After the theatrical release, director Peter Jackson wanted to create an extended version for each film. This was because Peter Jackson wanted to capture it for posterity.The Lord of the Rings was a cinematic masterpiece, the greatest book of the 20th Century was made into the greatest film trilogy of the 21st Century.""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was probably the hardest to adapt,"" admitted director Peter Jackson. It was also the longest and most frustrating experience of Peter Jacksons directing career. But the two Towers is not a failure but it does not match up to the quality of the Fellowship of the Ring.The Two Towers continues the adventures of the fellowship as they separate and take their own routes; Frodo makes his way to Mordor with Sam, and his guide Gollum, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli head to find Merry and Pippin and to defend Helms Deep from Isengard. The film struggles to make an impact, although the film is good enough to keep your interest high for the concluding part in the trilogy, the Return of the King."
j30bell,"Dec 20, 2004",7/10,"In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli  a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10."
recrdman,"Dec 27, 2002",1/10,"My least favorite Christmas treat for my family was the film Lord of the Rings-Two Towers, which I found excruciatingly too long...the fanny factor kicked in after the first two hours and except for the scenery and special effects, I found this just plain boring - the one with the most charisma in the film was that talking tree!"
aayanshmathur,"Nov 28, 2020",10/10,This movie is very good.I watched it more than once and very time I feels like I am watching it first time.One of the best films
John_Mclaren,"Mar 6, 2004",10/10,"Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for"
Person555,"Feb 13, 2005",9/10,"Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9)The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an amazing movie that any Tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better."
caseyt-48511,"Jul 18, 2018",9/10,"Along with The Godfather Part 2 and The Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers is the perfect middle chapter. While not a perfect film, as a movie with no concrete beginning or ending, it tells a masterful story and keeps the audience wanting more.Some characters are severally underdeveloped (mostly new ones) and it's a bit slow at times. But besides these more major complaints, the film is a masterpiece. As with the last film, the acting is great, the effects are groundbreaking (Gollum changed CGI), and the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting. The dialogue works really well to. The movie is simply filled with iconic moments.Some complain about the battle of Helms Deep being to long but let's be honest, it is really one of the best battle scenes in cinematic history. I believe that the Lord of the Rings trilogy are the greatest films of this century. The Two Towers is a grand adventure, epic war movie, compelling drama and overall, an amazing movie."
CharlestonNole,"Sep 1, 2003",9/10,"First off, The Two Towers is an amazing achievement.  As with the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers is one of the best films ever.  However, the only problem I find with this film is that it is too short.  Yea, you heard me right! The new characters needed to be fleshed out a little more. The Fellowship of the Ring IMO is superior because of the interaction between the core players.  We were there when they made their journey, we were not hopping back and forth between their individual adventures.  Yes I know that is the way the book is written, but I just prefer the Fellowship's  more intimate look at the characters.  This withstanding the Two Towers is an amazing achievement.  WETA Digital truly deserves all of the kudos that have been bestowed upon them.  They have supplanted Industrial Light and Magic as the preeminent digital effects company.Bottom Line:10/10!!!"
pied,"Nov 8, 2003",10/10,"I don't know Peter Jackson, and I've never been to New Zealand, but after the experience of this film, I don't need to.THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS is one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, movies ever made.Jackson wisely does not attempt to duplicate the books--that would be artistic suicide because Tolkien's trilogy is unfilmable.  Jackson captures the essence and the excitement of the film with unbelievable integrity.The Lord of The Rings is a story of good and evil, of dark forces battling the light, of heaven and hell.  J.R.R. Tolkien had a profound Christian vision.  Every character is a prototype.Frodo is the hero on a great quest.  Samwise Gangee represents everyman, essentially good and an unsung hero.  Gandalf, a Christlike figure, dying and returning again to serve Middle Earth.  Gollum is a tormented soul, evil, but an object of pity just the same.  Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Woodland elf, all have their place in this tale.  The Orcs are the human/elf form corrupted beyond recognition.The battle scenes in The Two Towers are exciting and some of the best every filmed.  Computer animation works wonderfully with the Ents and Gollum.I am thrilled that Two Towers had been so popular and has made money.Bring on The Return of The King."
otisfirefly2001,"Sep 17, 2004",N/A,"What a great movie. Through the first movie, we already had the whole story set-up, so in The Two Towers in really pick's up.There is not one thing about this movie that I would change. Maybe one or two of the extra scenes could have been cut out, but they only are there to lead into the sequel.This movie really shows the wonders of CGI in full effect. And isn't afraid to use them. The battle of Helm's Deep is a blend of live action and CGI(computer generated imagery), which works so perfectly and just comes across as astounding.The scene's with Aragorn being lost, were not too bad. The lead up into the scene's were great. The scene's show the connection between Aragorn and his horse who finds him near the river.The further downfall of Frodo as the ring slowly takes hold of him is very well done. Along with this, we also get to see the first more of the attempts of Sam to help, and protect Frodo.The breaking into different stories was a cool idea. Showing the progression of the characters from the first film to the second. Orlando Bloom's character is givin a larger part. And he proves to have much to do with the plot this time.All in all, this is a fantastic movie. Rivaled only by The Return of the King."
amelbourne95-43-3421,"Dec 10, 2012",7/10,"This somehow did not work for me. If this was supposed to be serious, it was verging on the ridiculous. I could excuse the first one for a little low-brow humour considering it didn't get right into the journey at first, but it was too overdone to at least lighten the mood in a serious context. It also had massive pacing issues, as it either brought everything to a standstill or hurried everything on, and it's suddenly strange how they stray off and bring to your attention scenes of no point whatsoever.On the positive side, the acting wasn't affected too much. The scenes with either Legolas, Aragorn or Frodo were beautifully done, so I have come to terms with the fact that the acting can still be good even when the pacing isn't. Despite that, they should have taken a few of the characters out, because they were kind of pointless. I liked Gollum (or Sméagol), but I think he was just there for the crazy factor.Overall, it was good, but was not as good as the first one. This could definitely have been better. Maybe they should just have done two films if there was going to be such a big gap in the middle."
harly900,"Dec 18, 2002",1/10,"I am a LOTR fan, but I nearly walked out of this movie. The acting was good and the scenes were well choreographed, but the plot failed to flow. This move ignored the book it was supposed to be about. The timelines in the book were ignored; the character development for new characters (such as Faramir) was bastardised and ruined for 'dramatic purposes'; scenes were added that did not exist in the book. I can [barely] accept the whole 'Arwen as Frodo's saviour' from The Fellowship Of The Ring, but what Jackson has done this time made me feel nauseous - I actually felt the desire to vomit while watching this movie. The movie started and seemed to rush forward without any sense of coherency or sense of timing, and then they started on the action to blind the audience to the significant gaps in the plot. The action was good, but the gaps in the plot made it hard to follow. This WAS 3 hours of my life I will never be able to get back."
MaxBorg89,"Dec 12, 2005",9/10,"Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002."
Justin Chan,"Dec 18, 2002",N/A,"We have been waiting an entire year for this one!!! The Two Towers picks up right where last years Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring leaves off. The director, Peter Jackson, did not include a recap of the last movie, so if you don't remember what happened in the first movie you better rent it and refresh your memory before you head off to the theater.When we last left our fellowship, it had splintered apart. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue there quest to return the all powerful and evil ring to Mordor where it can be destroyed. They take on the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis) as their guide to Mordor despite Gollum's obsession with getting `his precious' back. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) begin by trying to find the kidnapped Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), but end up getting caught up in a battle to save a race of humans. The evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), controlled by Dark Lord Sauron created a grand Uruk-hai army that is sent to destroy the race of Humans at the fortress Isengard. The presumed dead Gandolf (Ian McKellen) also returns to lend his assistance in battling Lord Sauron's troops.This film was better paced than the first in the trilogy. There were still some breaks in the action that were a little dull, but the dialog was necessary to further the story. With three separate stories going on simultaneously between the three groups of the splintered fellowship, the film kept the action moving quickly. Clocking in at 179 minutes, it is just one minute longer than the first film. This time, I didn't mind the length. The battle for Isengard comprised about a third of the film, and it was very intense.The rest of the film had a lot of the same excellent cinematic shots as the first movie. The shots tracking the actors from above (done by helicopter) with the beautiful New Zealand mountains and countryside in the background were just amazing.  The landscapes helped to keep me involved with the story when the action slowed for dialog intensive scenes.The creature Gollum played a very key roll in this movie, and the computer-generated character was very lifelike and amusing. He reminded me of Dobby the `house elf' in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Gollum and the Dwarf were the two main comic relief characters in this very serious film.To conclude, we had to wait a year for this film, and it lived up to expectations! A final reminderthis is the middle film in the trilogy so you can expect another ending that leaves you wanting more! Not to worry though, the third and final film is due out next Christmas."
OriginalMovieBuff21,"Apr 27, 2004",10/10,"The Two Towers is another masterpiece of returning after Fellowship of the Ring. This had excellent and brilliant action. Like the Helm's Deep battle which made the 100 best battles of all-time. There wasn't much of a story but who cares, it's Lord of the Rings!!! I loved the sword-fighting and the orcs too. This movie gave me chills down my back from the fighting and the unforgettable lines. Gollum was so cool and funny. Andy Serkis did so well in doing Gollum's voice and the CGI was amazing! The landscape once again was superb. This is another one of my favorite movies. It's not better than the fellowship and Return of the King but was very close and is still a smoking brilliant film. Go LORD OF THE RINGS, BABY!!!!!!!!!10/10!!! Highly Recommend!!! You better go see this movie!!"
Dereksdontrun,"Aug 29, 2003",8/10,"...not as good as Fellowship. Loved Smeagol - more expressive than most of the human actors in the film. But I was reminded of watching the Baski animated version - this section of the saga suffers from cutting between gripping stuff and tedious stuff, especially Merry and Pippin on bloody boring Treebeard. Loved the addition of the warg attack but it did have the effect of making Middle Earth seem tiny and, if Saruman's forces could reach Rohan so quickly then why didn't he head straight for Helm's Deep and stop them getting in? Eh?Also, the battle left me cold. Compared to Boromir's last stand, all these computer-generated t**ts running about were just unconvincing. And why is Gimli nothing but clumsy comic relief? All that 'toss me' stuff - terrible.But, by far the worst crime here is Legolas skateboarding down the steps. I expected Huey Lewis and the News to kick in.That aside, I will watch the DVD over and over but I'm hoping the extended version, as with Fellowship of the Ring, will iron out the pacing problems and give us more character study to balance the action."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 21, 2024",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is not merely a sequel; it is a bold crescendo in a grand symphony that echoes with the trials and triumphs of good against evil. From its breathtaking landscapes to its profound character arcs, this film is an immersive experience that cements its place in cinematic history.Peter Jackson's masterful direction takes us deeper into J. R. Tolkien's rich world, exploring themes of hope, betrayal, and resilience. The unparalleled visual effects transport viewers to the depths of Helm's Deep and the lushness of Fangorn Forest, creating a visual feast that amplifies the emotional stakes of the story. The battle sequences are nothing short of monumental; they're not just displays of brute strength but a testament to camaraderie and the sacrifice of countless souls-blurring the lines between victory and loss.At the heart of The Two Towers lies the evolution of its characters, especially Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Frodo. Viggo Mortensen embodies Aragorn's internal struggle with destiny and leadership with nuance, while Orlando Bloom breathes life into Legolas, his agility and wisdom perfectly complementing Gimli's boisterous bravery, played by John Rhys-Davies. And then there's Gollum-a hauntingly complex figure brought to life with groundbreaking CGI and Andy Serkis's brilliant performance. His duality captivates and evokes sympathy, representing the darker sides of desire and obsession.The film intricately weaves the threads of hope amid despair. As our heroes face insurmountable odds, The Two Towers reminds us that the bonds of friendship and courage shine brightest in the darkest of times. The emotional depth is heightened by Howard Shore's sweeping score, which resonates long after the credits roll, evoking a lingering sense of wonder and reflection.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an extraordinary cinematic journey that transcends the conventional sequel. It captures the essence of Tolkien's work-an enduring struggle against the shadows that linger in our hearts. Masterful, monumental, and truly unique, this film is not just a chapter in a saga; it is a revelation of the indomitable spirit of Middle-earth."
Kiddex,"Dec 27, 2002",1/10,"The only redeeming quality of this film was the epic battle sequences.  A pornography of violence is the only thing that saved this film from being terribly boring.The characters were very flat.  Interaction between them was predictable (predictable, even without having read the books).  For example, the undeveloped subplot between Aragorn and that princess was cliche.  From the moment a hint of her liking him came out, I could see what was going to happen.The only interesting character was Golum.  He symbolized the external battle for good and evil through an internal struggle.The dialogue in this movie offered nothing.  It was mostly about one group's plans, followed by the enemies plans.Well.  I don't want to think much more about this movie.  I think it was terrible.  The fighting scenes and animation were cool.  Perhaps the ""acting"" parts should be cut and the remaining scenes should be edited as cut scenes into a video game or something, because this definately doesn't stand as a film on its own."

Sources of my frustration: * Choppy editing * Lack of fluidity * Is this movie a CGI showcase to sell new programs to perspective movie makers? * Axing central book events in favor of unecessary sub-plots * Lack of geographical reference (anyone who's read the books knows about the maps -- but what about those who have not read them??) * Uneven pacing * Forced emotional manipulation (instead of the authentic emotions that FOTR produced) * Sacrificing the thematic nuances of Tolkien's writing in favor of cinematic cliches to please a modern audienceI make no claims to being a ""purist"" or expert... like I said changes in adaptations are necessary, but man, I half expected stormtroopers to be riding on the wolves of IsengardCan anyone understand what Treebeard is saying?What's with these sudden cockney accents from the orcs - Oi's a-gonna ate yo (Meestah Scroooge/Fawvah Krees-mas --oops wrong movie)Ok - enough, it's done, I said it, it's out in the cosmosI'm praying for ROTKFor the other 98% of you -- please disregard this, you've already been convinced."
Cristofer Seven,"Aug 24, 2003",9/10,"Thank You Peter Jackson.  These films are absolutely magical.  The Two Towers has flaws, but is still a great experience of a movie.  I looked at some of those who post to slam this film.  One said that when he buys the movie he would use scene selection to skip over the parts he didn't like.  I suppose the irony was lost on that one.  I also saw a lengthy slam where the poster stated that on the two viewings he had of the film people were laughing at golem.  I love this film, but I have only seen it once.So do you see...  this is a great movie.  Even those who hate it can't look away.  Even though it betrays their personal take on the books, there is magic on the screen that keeps them coming.I will buy the DVD promptly Aug 26th."
dromasca,"Dec 23, 2002",8/10,"Reading the comments of my fellow viewers I remark that having seen the film in the first days after the release I shared the experience with the hard core fans of the series. Not being one of them (until now at least), I can just comment of the quality of the film making. In my opinion, it is an extremely well directed film, superb camera work, and greater effects I have ever seen. If anybody doubts that computer effects became an art of its own, her/his doubts will be dissipated by this film. The complexity and perfection of some scenes looks like a big work of art, and the comparison coming to my mind is to Brueghel's or Bosch's paintings.However, the story is very complex. The director decided that the whole film will be just one piece of art, broken into three slices of three hours each only by commercial reasons. This median series starts and ends in the midst of the story telling. Well, having been busy the last year with a few other things - among them seeing many other movies - and not having read the book, I had problems in getting much of the action and characters development. A short recollection of the previous series action would have helped, and I recommend it to distributors for the next  time. They can of course, take it out for the big nine-ten hours screening in cinematheques of the future times :-)People who read the book were mixed in their reactions. Some say that the book is richer in characters and philosophy, and the movie loses something. Well, this happens with most books adaptations. I think that in this case, there is a lot the screen adaptation has added as well. But I will certainly buy and read the book now!It is still a good movie, one of the best of the year. I said good, but not great - only 8/10 on my personal scale, which I think will end being close to the real and deserved average mark of this film, after the initial fans enthusiasm cools out."
croatiansensation29,"Dec 28, 2004",9/10,"Peter Jackson has done it again, with the second movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Two Towers"". An excellent film, but it is my least favourite in the trilogy.Sam and Frodo continue their journey towards Mordor to rid Middle Earth of the One Ring, while Aragon, Gimli and Legolas prepare to do battle with the armies of the dark. Also, we get to see Gollum for the first time in this film, in all of his CG glory! Pure screen magic. Amazing special effects, a great storyline continuing the tale, this is a film that should definitely not be missed! The end battle is pure CG magic! Peter Jackson has done it once again! I recommend the extended edition, which shows us more in this wonderful tale.I say that this is my least favourite in the trilogy for the simple reason that it jumps from Sam and Frodo, to Aragon and Legolas, to Merry and Pippen, and back and forth. It can get somewhat confusing and hard to follow if you have not read the books.Despite this one minor flaw, the film is eye-poppingly beautiful, from the beautiful scenes, to the amazing special effects. Definitely not a film to be missed!"
jpc8024,"Oct 30, 2003",10/10,"This movie is a first rate epic.  From start to finish, it delivers the essence of Tolkien and his world.  From Gollum to Helm's Deep, the special effects are innocent fun and spectular.  I think Helm's Deep is unbelievable though.  Peter Jackson knows what he's doing.  He has a vision of Middle Earth, that none of us could've imagined.On one hand this is a fantasy, and it's totally not real.  That's why I think it's unbeliveable.  How could this happen?  I don't know. But all I care is that at least it's good.The movie will utterly be remembered years from now."
Al_The_Strange,"Apr 5, 2014",10/10,"In The Fellowship of the Ring, the film saga of the Lord of the Rings was kicked-off in an endearing and faithful way. It meticulously established the groundwork for a cast of iconic heroes, settings with palpable folklore, and a grand journey that would stagger the imagination. The adventure continues in The Two Towers, with all the same flair and attention to detail that was established before. Only now, it's a return to familiar territory, and the film uses every opportunity to expand the narrative and present an even stronger fantasy experience.Picking up where the first film let off, The Two Towers wastes no time in tracking each character's tangent and showing what happens next. The film's opening, showing Gandalf confronting the monstrous Balrog, is an awe-inspiring sight as it is. Then we continue to follow Frodo and Sam on their quest to Mordor, and it is touch-and-go for them as they evade enemy forces and consort with the villainous Gollum. At the same time, the film tracks Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they trek into Rohan, to inevitably confront the threat of orc invasion head-on. All these plot threads build up to a magnificent climax, including the Battle of Helm's Deep (a lengthy and awesome siege), the marching of the Ents (an imaginative and inspiring sequence), and the skirmishes of Osgiliath (providing the emotional climax to accentuate the action). It is a consistently engaging film with plenty of awesome spectacle.The story branches off into multiple directions with quite a lot of characters. You'd think it would be hard to keep track of everything (a complaint that made Cloud Atlas so inaccessible to audiences), but this film somehow manages to juggle everything perfectly, giving each tangent just enough time so that it never fades far from memory. It's easy to keep track of the characters and their movements across Middle-Earth, even with the addition of new characters, taut political drama, and even more folklore thrown in. The characters remain as endearing as ever, and the plot is manipulated with expert precision. Tolkein purists may be quick to point out the changes from the source material, which become more numerous in this film than in its predecessor, but the basics of the story remain intact. Most changes are made to accommodate the story's events across the three films in the most presentable way. While the film continues to utilize the classic epic-journey plot structure, it digs up some relevant themes concerning war, industrialization, and courage throughout.As before, the film is crafted expertly, with excellent photography and editing. Acting continues to impress from the whole cast; Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Orlando Bloom, John Rhyes-Davies, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchett all continue to inhabit their characters aptly. Andy Serkis steals the spotlight, while Karl Urban, David Wenham, Brad Dourif, Bernard Hill, and Miranda Otto offer welcome additions to the cast. The writing is great. Locales are beautiful. This production continues to use top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Howard Shore's music score is still impressively magnificent.The Two Towers is a thrilling continuation of the events laid forth in The Fellowship of the Ring, and it builds up to one impressive climax. It's still a great story told with great style, and with good attention to depth and detail. As strong of an experience as it is, it's still only building up to an even grander experience...The Extended Cut of this film includes about 45 minutes of new scenes. Some of it includes extended action and battle scenes, which are cool. There's also a great flashback scene involving Faramir and Boromir. There are also a bunch of really neat smaller scenes, many of which adapt specific scenes from the book, or offer more to the characters. It is a really cool cut of the movie that's well worth seeing.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect <> Story: Perfect <> Film: Perfect)"
mfarmer1,"Dec 23, 2002",6/10,"My wife did, and she was the one who dragged me to this thing against my wishes. Ok, I'm admittedly not a fantasy fan, and I'm probably the only person back in my high school in the 70's that didn't have any desire to read the novels, and still haven't to this day. With that said, the special effects were brilliant, and the cinematography superior. But for the life of me, I cannot understand the affection for the main Hobbit characters, they're boring, boring and more boring. The only thing I found entertaining besides the effects was Smeagol, or whatever its name is, that thing stole the show. I was also forced to see the first movie, and I thought that one would never end. Ditto for this one. Can hardly wait for the next one in a couple of years. Then again, I'm still waiting for a sequel to Killer Clowns from Outer Space."
sol-,"Jan 14, 2005",4/10,"The second part of the movie adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' books, this is a good-looking creation albeit not much else. It is a CGI showcase, and features good film editing and make-up, however ultimately it is pretty much on par with the first film in terms of virtues and vices. Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects. The visual and audio effects both won Oscars, and out of the three films it is the only one that deserved Best Visual Effects."
mstomaso,"Nov 30, 2007",10/10,"The Two Towers is the second book in Tolkien's masterpiece trilogy of invented English mythology and the second film in Peter Jackson's film trilogy based on the original mid-20th century novels.The Fellowship has physically disbanded, though through its bonds of purpose and friendship, remains intimately connected. Two Towers follows the members of the fellowship through their continuing, and increasingly dark and dangerous, adventures as they each do their part (whether accidental or intentionally) to try to save all that is good in Middle Earth from the power-hungry eye of Sauron, Lord of Mordor. Frodo (Wood) and Samwise (Aston) are lead by their captive Smeagol/Golem (Serkus) to Mordor, but Golem's intentions are, at best, suspicious.The ring has begun to taint Frodo's mind and soul, and rage and hate make fleeting and uncharacteristic appearances in this previously innocent and light-hearted Hobbit. He has already begun to recognize that he and Golem have more in common than anybody would care to admit. His profound friendship with Sam is very nicely portrayed in this film and is as central in the film as it is in Tolkien's original work. Smeagol/Golem is also treated sympathetically and his ambiguity and the polarity of his personalities are key to his role as an unpredictable element.The story also introduces three major human characters- Theodin (Hill), Eowyn (Otto), and Farromir - all of whom will play important parts in the Fellowship's mission as the story progresses. Two important, but less often present characters are also introduced  Grima Wormtongue (Dourif) and Eomer (Urban). As I discussed in my review of the Fellowship, the casting and acting are perfect, and the new additions are no exception.Andy Serkus' and the animation team's Golem becomes a major character in The Two Towers. Serkus' contributions to the character are profound, and very nicely reflected in the special features for the Two Towers. I look forward to seeing more work from this performer and I sincerely hope that he does not go over-looked or remain type-cast.In the first film, during a valiant and successful attempt to prevent harm from coming to Frodo, Merry and Pippin (Monaghan and Boyd) are carried off by Saruman's army, narrowly escaping into Fangorn forest when the Uruk'Hai party is slain by an exiled band of Rohirim lead by Eomer. The hobbits manage to wind up in the hands of an Ent  a wise old walking tree and steward of the forest, who they try to convince to join in the fight against Saruman and Sauron.Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas continue their dogged attempt to rescue Merry and Pippin, and an old friend unexpectedly re-enters the story as several components of the Fellowship come together to devise an improbable defense of the land of Rohan against the overwhelming force of Mordor.Like The Fellowship, the Two Towers manages to capture the essence of Tolkien's story and characters while rearranging portions for better cinematic continuity and emphasizing interpretive connections which are not wholly obvious in Tolkien's writing. Two elements keep Frodo from the brink of abject insanity  Sam and Smeagol. Smeagol's addiction to the ring allows Frodo to sympathize with him in a way that only an addict can understand. Sam's pure and clear-headed love for Frodo offers a sane and reliable anchor. Other members of the Fellowship help each other in similar ways as Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas prepare for battle and Gandalf works hard to repair the damaged bonds between Rohan and Gondor.The darkest and most uncomfortable of the three movies, The Two Towers is also, in some ways, the most powerful. The themes are morality, sacrifice, friendship and, as always, the nature and just use of power. Many have commented on Tolkien's religious beliefs and their permeation throughout the LOTR, but it is worth noting that the great scholar uses components of many different cultures and belief systems to create the world he portrays, and  from a strict Roman Catholic perspective (Tolkien's religion of choice) - there are many more blasphemies in LOTR than there are catholic metaphors and symbols. In the Two Towers, the internal power struggle between good and evil gains momentum within the fellowship's principal protagonists. As with the fellowship, the art direction, score and soundscaping subtly add great depth to the entire experience.The story and its themes are in no way subordinated to the technical merit of the film, but its methods are still very noteworthy. Golem is not an animated insertion who intrudes in every scene, but rather, a fully developed central character around whom Frodo and Sam's story arc revolves. The sets and landscapes, just like the Fellowship before it, are immersive and in every way as sensually real as if they had been built thousands of years ago and weathered by exposure to the elements of Middle Earth. The battle scenes are exciting, dramatic and believable. And the special features on the Special Edition box set explain how all of this was accomplished with lucidity."

It was a lovely film and was much more moving than I expected. The effects were great but never distracting as many films are. And the story was faithful. The stars were all perfectly cast and it wsa beautifully adapted. If MGM and the old studios were still making great costume epics today they would have been proud to have made this one!"
mcpkone,"Sep 13, 2003",10/10,"I want to really thank Peter Jacksson and all the actors for sharing their talents so heartfully. Peter Jacksson has really put aside all qlichees and easy going fooly and created a movie true to the books and the author him self. I think Mr. Tolkien is smiling to see what they have created together. Actually I also want to thank the sponsors for not making a commercial stunt of the movies, like e g the first Bat Man movie. There is also no feeling of intefearing with the movie or even the casting of the characters. No playing it safe, just tying to make the books come alive. I have seen first two movies and so far top-notch, I hope to see the extended version of the Two Towers soon  :-)"
largentabrewer,"May 1, 2014",10/10,"In every way, even after reading all 6 books, i love this adaptation and the way it was brought to life. Peter Jackson deserves all adoration and praise for the way he made all, but especially this movie. There is a lot that is missing, but I can Understand how it would be hard to adapt to film. Even though i would not complain on bit if they made a 32 hour movie of all of the events that happened in all of the movies. This movie deserves all 10 stars and much respect. LOTR forever!!! Thank you, Peter Jackson, for all you have done and all you will do. Except for the last 20 min of the latest Hobbit Movie... Garbage."
cartman0082,"Feb 21, 2004",6/10,"A decent movie, worse than the first in the trilogy and equally not deserving of the hype it has gotten. Visually alright the effects are not a good reason for a Lord of the Rings fan to attempt to draw in non-fans or undecideds as I was. All of the matrix movies still dwarf this if you are going to talk Computer animation."
moore031,"Dec 19, 2002",1/10,"After the wonderful realization of ""The Fellowship of The Ring,"" I was greatly anticipating the next installment with ""The Two Towers."" As a writer I can understand that some changes need to be made to adapt a book to a film; however, I think the title given to this movie should have been ""Peter Jackson's Two Towers."" The plot changes and additional scenes with Arwen were absolutely unnecessary for translating the book to film. These changes simply represented how the director wanted the books to go and the heck with Tolkein.There was much to like about the movie in terms of art direction and special effects. Unfortunately, so much attention went to creating digital characters (and I'll say that Gollum was nicely done in large part to Andy Serkis' work) that the real actors were left to stand around and watch, or react to what the virtual characters were doing, which was the downfall of ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace."" Thankfully Gollum was no Jar Jar Binks, but it still created a similar issue. The relationships between the characters in ""Fellowship of the Ring"" were beautiful and moving, and now all of a sudden everyone's emotionally disconnected with each other - except for Arwen and Strider, and Arwen never once set foot in the ""Two Towers"" book! Ugh.I'm no purist where Tolkein is concerned and I would have been able to live with small changes necessary to make a movie. For example, I can understand why the film didn't end at the same place that the book did and that didn't bother me too much. Nevertheless, there were some very rich scenes in Tolkein's novel (from the growing friendship between Legolas and Gimli, to some very moving moments between Frodo and Sam, one of which awakens the best out of Gollum for a moment) that were ignored and replaced by Mr. Jackson's own ideas. This I cannot live with and makes me very angry.  I hope he gets back to Tolkein's world when he finishes the last movie because I don't like Jackson's."
WaltuhRed,"Nov 18, 2021",10/10,"I decided to only make a review on Return of the king because it's my favourite in the trilogy, but Two towers and Fellowship are masterpieces aswell and alot of people seem to agree with me so im just gonna give it a 10/10 score and like i say in my review on Return of The King, the Lord of the rings trilogy is an unbeatable trio of films."
Steffi_P,"Apr 7, 2012",9/10,"Of the three pictures in Peter Jackson's epic treatment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one probably takes the most liberties in adapting JRR Tolkein's book. Middle sections in a trilogy are often problematic, especially in the movies. Tolkein would have expected his readers to work through the books chapter-by-chapter, the split into the three volumes being mainly to keep the actual tomes to a practical size. A movie however is more of a stand-alone thing, and it needs a satisfying beginning and ending even when it's the middle of a larger story.Jackson, along with his co-writers Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair have done a neat job. The Two Towers has an added problem in that the characters get split into three groups, and three separate narrative lines. The novel devotes half a book each to the different sets of characters. The script for The Two Towers must find more fluid ways of integrating the different story lines, and there is some canny balancing of pure action and 'human' themes. They insert a little episode of the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, which is a bit dull in itself but provides a brief moment of tranquillity to build up tension before the next burst of action. There's also an implication that Eowyn slightly fancies Aragorn, which as far as I recall was not in the book, but it actually works far better than the official romance because it is tied into the sense of danger at the battle. Finally, the writers leave off some of the book's material for the third movie, to put more focus on the Helm's Deep climax and wind towards satisfactory conclusions for each of the story's strands.Peter Jackson is very much a craftsman of his generation, with all the pros and cons of modern filmmaking. As with The Fellowship of the Ring, the movie is over-edited, with shots never lasting more than a couple of seconds. But this is Jackson's style and he knows how to do great things with it. He's especially good at switching between the inside and the outside of a situation. When Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas encounter the Rohirrim, the riders surge into view over the hillside, and Jackson really gives us a feel of the power of this army with breathtaking shots from above and then ones inside the throng with horses towering over the camera. Later he creates a mighty ""wow"" moment when the black rider appears, a gauntleted hand at first, before pulling back to reveal the massive winged steed. And the detail in Jackson's close-ups is if anything more meaningful than his massive CGI crowd shots. When we see Frodo's hand moving for the ring round his neck, his fingers are rough and dirty, just as they would on someone who has spent weeks travelling in the wilderness.The breaking of the fellowship into smaller groups in The Two Towers allows individual characters to come out a bit more, and it's the better movie for it. As before though there are a few problems with the acting. Elijah Wood makes a dismal and unsympathetic Frodo, moaning his way across Middle Earth with a perpetually forlorn look. Andy Serkis's Gollum is certainly a spirited little fellow, but I feel he's just a little too pathetic, and not convincingly cunning enough – or perhaps that problem lies more in the way he's been animated. Once again it is Ian McKellen who brings most dignity to the proceedings, but this time he is aided by solid turns from the likes of Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto. Alongside the development of characters, most of the players from the previous movie perform a little better this time around, and John Rhys Davis is particularly good as a loveably comical Gimli.Perhaps what really makes The Two Towers is Jackson's deliberate tendency to be somewhat silly. Who else would come up with a Tolkein adaptation featuring an Olympic torch-bearer orc or Legolas surfing down the steps on a shield, unless it was a deliberate parody (which it never for one moment feels like)? Above all, he seems to be having fun with what he's doing. I don't think the oliphaunts were supposed to be quite that big in the books, but Jackson clearly wanted the Imperial Walkers from The Empire Strikes Back in his movie. It's his ability to adapt the material with dignity but without taking it too seriously, that means generally the audience is having as much fun as he is."

Mediatation,"Jun 4, 2025",10/10,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is the first film in the trilogy to showcase a large-scale battle, featuring in-depth details added by Peter Jackson that go significantly beyond J. R. R. Tolkien's original description. Tolkien's understandable reluctance to extensively describe battles gave Jackson the artistic freedom to translate them to the screen in the epic style now synonymous with the franchise.The motion capture CGI used to bring Gollum to life was groundbreaking upon release and remains impressive today-thanks largely to Andy Serkis' dedicated performance. ""The Two Towers"" shifts the series away from the first film's adventurous tone and sets the stakes for upcoming grim tasks ahead."
TrulyOnFilm,"Dec 9, 2025",10/10,"Rewatching this after going through the trilogy again this year honestly reminded me how perfect this movie is. The scale is bigger, the stakes feel heavier and everything that was set up in Fellowship fully comes to life here. It takes everything the first film built and pushes it to another level.The characters all grow so much in this one. Aragorn steps into that leader role, Sam and Frodo's journey gets darker and more emotional and even the smaller side stories feel important. And obviously Gollum steals the show. The performance and the way he is written still hold up unbelievably well.The world feels even more alive this time. The battles, the locations, the creatures, the tension building across every storyline, it all comes together so naturally. The Helm's Deep sequence is still one of the greatest battles ever put on screen. The music, the atmosphere and the way it all ramps up is unreal.This is the point in the trilogy where everything clicks. The emotion, the action, the storytelling and the scale all hit perfectly and it cements why this series is considered one of the best of all time."
real_hide,"Dec 13, 2025",9/10,"In my opinion, the second part of ""The Lord of the Rings"" is even better than the first one. The first part primarily sets up the story for the upcoming battles, which are fantastic in the second part. In this sequel, we experience multiple wars and see further character development for Aragorn, Frodo, Samwise, Gollum, and other key characters, although those are the main ones. Additionally, there are stunning scenes and impressive use of CGI. It's astounding to see how well the action sequences are executed, especially considering it was made in 2002."
ANGRYSPNGGAMER55,"Oct 26, 2025",9/10,"This is one of the best movies of all time and definitely in the top 10 action movies ever. The first movie was already amazing but in my opinion Lord Of The Rings: The two towers is a crystal clear upgrade. It basically takes every piece of foundation that has been laid by it's precursor and vastly improves it (at least to my eyes). The action, the character relationships (which is something the previous movie gave a lot of emphasis to as well) everything is fantastic. The characters are so interesting, so well written and well acted that you can't really define a clear protagonist. It could be Frodo in one's eyes, it could be Aragorn in another's and there really does make no difference because the movies purpose is to tell a story. A very enormous and epic story where everybody works towards the same goal and through difficulties, disagreements or tricky situations try to fight it together. That is the message of the movie and I love it. Absolutely recommended to fetuses, newborns, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults, midlifers, senior citizens and nonagenarians."
Koncorde,"Aug 29, 2003",N/A,"Problem with LOTR films is that they are always going to be compared to the books and peoples imaginations - and those of us with better imaginations than others often think of cooler things they'd rather have seen in the movie than others, or shown in different ways.Getting away from that what you have isn't worth a film.  It's a slice of a slice of a slice of a greater whole that was never going to be perfectly encapsulated into 12 movies - let alone 3 and let alone 3 with sum total of 3 years planning taking place prior to making the first film and then a continuous sequence of production.  That doesn't lend kindly to perfection by any stretch of the imagination - and it shows.  Because it's only a slice if you watch it and haven't got the background to fill in the gaps then all you have is a mediocre story, mediocre emotional value and very little that you can actually get your teeth into.  You never get any kind of attachment to the characters - Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are getting on my nerves already and I was banking on Jackson straying completely from the book and bumping those two off - meanwhile Frodo and Sam look destined to lead a clandestine homosexual arrangement, because that's what it is - a big boys book of camping in woods and fending off mystical beasties.Maybe if you watch all 3 films end to end it'd make sense - but right now the first film stands alone as an excellent piece of work, almost worthy of Tolkiens words whilst the second film goes back on the principle of 'enlightenment' and filling in background gaps by throwing everything in quickly and with little or no care for the people who haven't read the book. It sooooooo desperately needed a voice over, a few more historical flashbacks, a little more time introducing and attention paid to rather important characters such as Boromirs brother etc.Anyway.  CGI scenery is 'good' so long as you ignore the glaring wobbly bits (such as the Big Gate scene closing on the ranks of filed evil men) dodgy editing and inability (Still!) to get shadows and depth right.  Sometimes matte paintings are the way to go if you can't realistically do it using a computer.  I know that doesn't allow for big panning motions across mighty castles on hilltops etc but quite frankly I don't care much for this scenic extravaganza, I'd rather them cut the wasteful 15 or so minutes of watching people run, or horses slowly ride etc and have some background info - or at least give us a voice over with some pointers in the meantime.  CGI creatures are on the whole well done, but again look like plastecine (or is plastacine?).  Gollum stands apart in this respect as he is actually surprisingly well done.  However, the artists could have done with actually ""looking"" at the effects the lighting in the scene had on the actors. Too often you'd see Sam or Frodo with their face half in shadow, then Gollum sticking out like a sore thumb because his 'shadow' doesn't come from any source within the scene.Oh - and with all this CGI going on, nobody thought of fixing Legolas eyes. If we're going to see them so often in the film as he stares off into the middle distance and makes some profoundly obvious statement - then the least they can do is make them the same colour throughout.Despite all this - it ranks as probably the greatest Sword+Fantasy type film.  Unfortunately considering it's only up against B-Movie Conan and the hit'n'miss Legend and the lacklustre Dungeons&Dragons this isn't much to brag about.  However, it does go an awful long way towards making Sword+Fantasy movies respectable.  Hopefully someone will now be brave enough to take on the far more movie friendly ""Dragonlance Chronicles"" (Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Winter Night, Spring Dawning etc) and do them proper justice.It's an 8.  But only because I have an odd taste in movies admittedly, which would put Spaceballs as a 10.  I apologise in advance for this travesty of judgement."
adaon,"Dec 22, 2002",1/10,"I didn't realize when I watched Fellowship of the Ring exactly to what degree the whole ""men are weak"" modification would snowball out of control. Faramir is the latest sad casualty to this overall change to the original story.Also the Ents could have been better handled.I could go on with this line of criticism but why bother.  If you haven't read the books (heck, even if you have...) and believe that the Lord of the Rings is your typical superficial, without a shred of subtelty Good vs. Evil story and that the upshot is that some short people need to throw a ring in a volcano, and that entertains you, then you may enjoy this film.If your looking for something more transcendent you will be disappointed. The screenwriters, which ones I don't know, have done a poor job of translating Tolkien to the screen (and no, capturing Tolkien's spirit is difficult but not impossible in a movie so don't throw out that straw man), and contrary to what Peter Jackson stated on the special edition DVD of FoTR, they have not stayed as close to the original story as possible and HAVE thrown their own spin in.  Why aren't they more up-front about this?Oh well."
dkncd,"Oct 5, 2007",10/10,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is the second installment in Peter Jackson's fabled adaptations of Tolkien's novels. Once again the costumes, scenes, sets, models, effects and epic score of Howard Shore work together to create a great atmosphere.The core cast from the first film is back and once again proves adept. Several new characters appear in this film and are once again well-cast. Bernard Hill is authoritative and inspiring as King Theoden of Rohan. Miranda Otto is notable as Eowyn, though her best moments would come in the third film. Brad Dourif was a perfect choice for the conniving Grima Wormtongue. David Wenham and Karl Urban are effective as the warriors Faramir and Eomer. John Rhys-Davies, in addition to playing Gimli, is memorable for providing the voice for Treebeard.Like with the first film, this film streamlines Tolkien's work but largely remains faithful to it to create a well-paced film. The conflict at Helm's Deep is spectacular and the second best fantasy battle ever filmed next to the battle in ""Return of the King"" (2003). My only complaint with this film is the alterations to Faramir's character. The ""Two Towers"" book made a clear distinction between Faramir and Boromir's personalities, but in this film they are homogenized. However, this is a minor blemish in what is otherwise an outstanding film. As with the last film, I found that the added scenes for the extended edition were interesting but didn't add much above and beyond the theatre cut."
marianstelian,"Dec 25, 2020",10/10,"In my opinion, this is the second best movie of this amazing trilogy."
NoahS-81,"May 29, 2025",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers often finds itself in the shadow of its siblings-The Fellowship of the Ring, which introduced the world to Middle-earth's sweeping beauty, and The Return of the King, which claimed Oscar glory. Yet The Two Towers is arguably the most underappreciated masterpiece of the trilogy. It masterfully deepens the emotional and philosophical themes of Tolkien's work while delivering some of the most iconic sequences in cinematic history, such as the Battle of Helm's Deep. This battle alone is a triumph of pacing, tension, and scale that has rarely been matched, and it represents a turning point not just in the war for Middle-earth, but in the genre of fantasy filmmaking itself.Beyond its technical brilliance, The Two Towers is where the soul of the story truly begins to shine. Gollum's internal conflict adds a complex psychological dimension, turning a once-side character into a tragic mirror of Frodo's struggle with power and corruption. The character arcs in this middle chapter are profound-Aragorn's reluctant transformation into a leader, Sam's quiet heroism, and the Ents' righteous fury against Saruman's destruction. It's a film that dares to slow down, to meditate on loyalty, despair, and the cost of hope-all while keeping you on the edge of your seat. The Two Towers isn't just an underrated film in the trilogy; it's one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time."
marcusedenellis,"Feb 27, 2005",10/10,"If you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess whether or not you should watch this film then please read no further and just go and slip in the DVD and let the sights and sounds of Middle Earth wash over you. Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the ""yes, I have read the books"" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as ""they left out too much"", ""its not what I imagined"" or ""Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich"". Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve. Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil."
ccthemovieman-1,"Aug 2, 2006",9/10,"I didn't really appreciate this second installment of the LOTR trilogy until I watched this for the second time. The key was how I looked at the key character of this film: ""Gollum"" (Andy Serkis.). Once I began to appreciate and marvel at this weasel-like character, my opinion of the film went from bad to good. That doesn't mean I like that slimy creature: I don't, but I am more fascinated by him rather than totally annoyed as I was with the first viewing. A big reason was that I put on the English subtitles, so I was able to understand everything he said. I recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his dialog. Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic creature was.Anyway, this second installment, as in the first, offers a lot of fascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action scenes and wild characters. For younger kids, I am to happy to say there is absolutely nothing, language-wise, that would offend anyone but the violence is heavy and brutal at times.This is a solid, highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy. It's epic film-making. No, it may not be equal to the first - The Fellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is?"
JanieBW1939,"Feb 16, 2003",6/10,I saw Two Towers yesterday with my 9 yr. old and 12 yr. old.    It was visually stimulating and action-packed.   But... I would have liked a bit of editing in this film.    Too Long!   Especially too many fight scenes.   I know it was in the book... but made for quite a boring time.   The trees were cool and so was Gollum.
armo-1,"May 23, 2003",5/10,"I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Fellowship' and was eagerly awaiting the release of 'two towers'. I have never read the books but was informed that the 'Two Towers' would be even better than it's predecessor as the plot thickens and action really gets going. However, on leaving the cinema after watching this film I was left somewhat disappointed.I have read review after review saying this is peoples favourite film. I mean come on, be serious. It takes an age to get going and if it was not for the climactic battle of Helm's Deep would have been the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first two hours of Titanic. Even in this ground breaking climax it is constantly interrupted by Treebeard, the character that personifies the slowness of the rest of the film. Also the attempted romance between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler's characters seems just to be in this film because Liv complained of lack of screen time because there certainly doesn't seem any need for her character in this instalment apart from this pointless sub-plot.The creation of Gollum was simply brilliant and deserved the Oscar but I was pleased to see this film ignored in the other categories. One thing is for sure, I will not look forward to the next sequel as much as I did this one, following this film's disappointment."
bzb2001,"Feb 12, 2005",8/10,"So the journey continues with 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.' This review will assume you have seen the first film, 'The Fellowship of the Ring.' Which is fine because Peter Jackson, at the helm of this massive production, assumes you have seen it as well. Intelligently, Jackson does not begin with a redundant and unnecessary prologue. He dives right into what the filmmakers considered the hardest of the trilogy to make.When we left the fellowship, they were in shambles. Gandalf had fallen; Merry and Pippen were kidnapped by the evil forces; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek their smaller comrades without the help of Boromir, who has also died; this leaves Frodo and Sam on their way to Mount Doom, the one ring still in their grasp.'The Two Towers' is more successful than 'Fellowship' because the storytelling becomes more complex without drowning us in information. The first film introduced us to the many characters of Middle Earth (too many, I believe). 'The Two Towers' isn't quite as concerned with exposition, though new characters do come on board. Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, a large, talking ""tree herder"" who is concerned about the plight of his forest's future since the destructive orcs and their masters, Sauron and Saruman, burn everything in their path.Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli enter the kingdom of Rohan and cross paths with King Theoden and his people. Theoden has been under Saruman's spell as part of he and Sauron's master plan to take over the separate kingdoms of Middle Earth. Eowyn, the king's niece, develops a special liking for Aragorn. However, as we understand from the first film, there is still a deep love between Aragorn and the elf Arwen. Along with the rest of the elfs of Middle Earth, Arwen is persuaded to leave for another world entirely. She does have reservations leaving her true love Aragorn, though mortal and she is not, for distant lands and never see him again.Frodo and Sam are introduced to the mysterious Gollum, who attempts to attack the hobbits in their sleep to regain the ring. Instead, Gollum and Frodo kindle a special relationship since they both harbor a certain addiction to the ring's power. Frodo's Elijah Wood is the most effective actor in 'Two Towers' as he is gradually taken more and more over by the ring and it's awesome strength. Gollum becomes Frodo and Sam's guide to Mordor, as he has been there before. Gollum's intentions, though, are never clear to the hobbits - neither are they to Gollum.These three strands of story form a massive, thoroughly effective, epic tale of nature vs. machine, creature vs. creature and, through Frodo, man vs. himself. The encompassing story leads to a heroic battle sequence fought on two fronts, while all the time we wonder how long Frodo can hold on to his sanity as the ring slowly takes power over him.The pacing, which was an issue with 'Fellowship,' is not problematic at all the second time around. The three stories are told in a manner that flows right through the three hour+ tale. One problem that persists is that 'Two Towers' is largely unaffected by the humanity other than Frodo's saga. There is love between Aragorn and Arwen, Eowyn also shows up as a romantic character. Her father, Theoden, is a courageous man but flawed psychologically. There exists connections between these many characters and more but they all feel half baked and cast aside to make more room for fighting.Still, 'The Two Towers' is enormously successful as a narrative and even more ambitious than 'Fellowship' visually. The score, by Howard Shore, is among the very best ever composed. The evil orcs and uruk-hai never look fake and evoke terror in the characters and in the audience. I still yearn for a more personal story, but in other realms of film-making, Peter Jackson and those under his command have outdone themselves. ***.5 out of ****"
LeRoyMarko,"Mar 21, 2004",9/10,"The epic saga of Middle Earth continues in this very good sequel to Fellowship. In fact, I think it's the best of the trilogy. I enjoyed it even more because I knew a bit more about the characters and the story. I must admit that I haven't read the books.The special effects are once again great and the battle scenes are spectacular. I wouldn't say this is one of the 10 best movies ever made, but it's still very entertaining. And I think it really has to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. I also liked the humor brought by characters like Gimli. But Gollum was a bit too present in the movie. My favorite characters: Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Too bad that the Arwen and Galadriel characters are not more important.Out of 100, I gave it 88. That's good for ***½ out of ****.Seen in Toronto, at the Famous Players Paramount Cinemas, on January 19th, 2003."
atomicm0nk,"Nov 8, 2003",10/10,"This movie was simply amazing. Great casting, great acting. The way this movie stuck to the book is hard to match by any movie. Although there were some differences this movie still stuck to the plot immensely and there can be no complaints. A must watch for all ages"
lee_eisenberg,"Oct 21, 2005",10/10,"With the fellowship in splinters, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue on their quest to destroy the corrupting ring. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) has his own duties to attend to, as does Gandalf (Ian McKellen). Peter Jackson's midpoint of the trilogy is as great as its predecessor and successor. Every shot is beyond impressive; there isn't any adjective that I can use that would do the movie justice.And Gollum? Now there's an intriguing character, precious. An awe-inspiring, if pitiful, being, he makes you really want to see part 3, just to see what will happen. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is truly one movie that will continue to inspire people for years. A masterpiece."

acmulvey,"Jul 23, 2019",10/10,Helm's deep is one of the most exciting moments in film history.
lasse-uk,"Nov 6, 2004",10/10,This film is one of the best films ever made. This film is almost as breathtaking as the first film but in the end the minor flaws it has makes it worse than the first film. What I consider to be the biggest flaw of this film is the character of Gimli. John-Rhys Davies is a wonderful actor and I do not blame him for the way the character turned out. I blame it on the directing (shame on you Jackson). Being that Merry and Pippin are not as much in the second films they were in the first they could not act as comic relief. Thus the choice was made to make Gimli the comic relief. While the things he says are both funny and well timed it becomes to much by the end. A second flaw that pulls the film down a bit is the fact that they deviated too much from the original book. The Theoden character is very different in the book as is Faramir. These flaws were probably necessary to make the film but the hard core Tolkien fans such as myself were disappointed to see Faramir drag poor Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath which is only mentioned in the book but never seen. This far I have only focused on the bad things in the film but there are very great film historic moments as well. E.g. the battle for Helms Deep is aside from the battle on Pelleanor Fields the greatest film battle ever conceived on screen. The acting in the film is generally on a very high level. Especially Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen do very well in the film but also John-Rhys Davies and Elijah Wood are very good. Aside from the fact that their roles were not as well written as they could have been Bernard Hill and David Wenham do very well. The effects in the film are flawless and on a higher scale than in the first film and the attention to detail is overwhelming. All in all a worthy sequel but ultimately the worst out of the three.
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Dec 26, 2009",10/10,"This might actually be a little better than The Fellowship of the Ring. There is less annoying comic relief, and, as you probably already know, we get to really *see* Gollum, in all his fully rendered, entirely CGI glory. This was probably one of the first times such a large role was so successfully entirely digital, and definitely that it had such an impact. You feel for him, and you frankly forget that he's not ""really"" there. He can also be kind of funny. The humor in general is good. This picks up where the first one left off, and with several nifty surprises(for those not familiar with the novels, or who haven't had it spoiled) along the way, the plot progresses nicely. The pace is smooth, and this doesn't seem as if it actually is the three hours long that it is. This creates moods well, being creepy, light, gloomy, etc. at different points. The action and battle sequences are exciting and awesome, not to mention well-choreographed. Every acting performance is spot-on. Even baby-face Wood and dull Bloom are impeccable. The effects are astonishing. This has an epic scope, and has a magnificent, grand score. The characters are interesting and credible. This leaves you wondering what will happen next, and I'm very much looking forward to catching the last one. There are scary scenes in this, and it might be beyond what some children can handle. I recommend this to anyone that can imagine liking it, and who have watched the first one. 10/10"
TxMike,"May 18, 2004",N/A,"Almost two years ago, after I saw the first of the trilogy, I wrote in summary...""As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect. However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the ""Ringheads"" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the installments. ""I've not seen the last installment yet, but my opinion has not changed any. First off the movie is entirely too long. Not that length itself is bad, but in an apparent attempt to follow the books faithfully, much of the story drags badly. Wise producers and directors realize that movies made from books must exclude much material, to keep the story interesting and the running time reasonable. People who read novels often do so over weeks. Movies are normally watched at one sitting. So, while this long movie may be just what the ""Ringheads"" want, for the rest of us it is simply too much of the same, and too long. Still, it has remarkable production values and is a joy to watch.  Just too long and boring in spots."
paul_m_haakonsen,"Jan 27, 2020",7/10,"First of all, I must say that ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was significantly more easy to sit through than ""The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"", as this movie had more action, and wasn't as slow-paced with as much storytelling and setting the mood as the first movie did.Needless to say that you need to watch the first movie prior to watching this 2002 sequel, unless you want to be missing out on a great deal of information about the characters and the storyline.As a direct continuation of the previous movie ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was a nice upscale in pace, and I must admit that I was enjoying this a lot more than the previous movie.While ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is driven by a solid story and character development, much like the first movie, then ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" adds a much needed element of action and fantasy battles.It shouldn't be necessary to say that you are in for a grand adventure when you sit down to watch ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"", especially if you are a fan of the sword and sorcery fantasy genre, which I happen to be.And it was marvelous to have the original cast return to perform their roles again, making for a wonderful continuation of the storyline, and not having to adjust to a new face on an already established character.Definitely well worth taking the time to sit down and watch the extended version. Just keep about 4 hours free for it. I am rating ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" a well-deserving seven out of ten stars."
chaosduck,"Jun 22, 2003",1/10,"The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers, simply put, is a travesty of monumental proportions. This may sound like a tired cliche but so is the production of this movie. The sheer arrogance to mess around with the greatest story put to print is unbelievable. The changes in the story and characters go far beyond interpretation and seem to suggest that Mr Jackson simply feels that Tolkien got it wrong. Peter Jackson's movie embodies all the disdain that Tolkien had for Hollywood, but I guess the money makes it easy to live with, and he claims to be a fan. Read the book, miss the film. LONG LIVE THE REAL FARAMIR!"
preppy-3,"Jan 21, 2003",10/10,"Actually, it's better than the first!First off, see ""Fellowship of the Ring"" or you won't be able to make heads or tails out of this.  It follows the fellowship being divided and facing evil on all sides.  There's battles galore, tons of action, incredible sets and special effects, breathtaking scenery and the usual great direction from Peter Jackson.  The acting is just so-so except for (surprisingly) Viggo Mortensen.  I wasn't impressed with him in the first movie but he improved vastly in this one--a very subtle but physical performance.  His scenes with Liv Tyler were especially moving. It runs for 3 hours but it flew by and I was never bored.  The battle at Helms Deep is easily among one of the most incredible action sequences ever caught on film.  A definite must-see.  I can't wait for ""Return of the King""!"
Godofcomics,"Dec 23, 2006",10/10,"The people who vote against this movie or didn't see it, or just hate it for hatred. This is the movie that changed the movie industry and set foot for the digital actors (3D Animation). This movie is a living legend, a god, and will rule for a century in my opinion.Seriously, if you have not seen this trilogy, go and see it as soon as possible, as it is not just a movie about medieval times, it has everything a real movie should: Beautiful people (not a single ugly face), amazing art, incredible places (looks like heaven with skies of many colors, water and so much more). The acting is superb, the best in the world, they really hired the BEST out there, and as far as I can see, the movie was awesome because they did not allowed the motion picture to be corrupted with ""political"" reasons, so, all the actors, Post-production, sound, effects and everything else was really the BEST, no corrupted piece!!!!The story is immortal, will get you in tears no matter what you are made of. The characters... so well done!!!Do you know why this movie is so good? I will tell my opinion on it: I think it is THAT good, because Peter Jackson worked on it for more than 10 years (was forced to wait 10 years because no one wanted to give him the green light to shoot), that is why, it is a good way to ensure a good quality."
claudio_carvalho,"Sep 1, 2003",10/10,"This sequel of the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made can not be seen as another movie, but the second part of a splendid film.

Vartiainen,"Sep 14, 2015",10/10,"The Fellowship has been broken, Frodo and Sam travel towards Mordor alone, Merry and Pippin have been taken by orcs, Gandalf and Boromir have fallen and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must make haste to save at least some of their comrades. And at the same time the threat of Mordor grows as war comes to Rohan, the land of the horselords.It is an epic in the every meaning of the word, and possibly one of the best second parts of a trilogy in the history of cinema. Sure, all three of the movies were shot back to back, but the fact still remains that middle parts of any kind of story are often the hardest. You have already established the setting, introduced the main characters, yet you still have to hold back until the end finale.The Two Towers solves this by giving us one amazing opening battle in the War of the Rings. The Battle of Helm's Deep, still considered to be one of the greatest battles put on film, and for a good reason. It is cinema at its finest. The huge scale of it, the special effects, the practical effects, the pacing, the score, the fury and the stages.But we also have other good stuff to tide us until the end of the film. The movie jumps around quite a bit, juggling various plot lines, and they all work very well. And, most importantly, this movie introduces some great new characters. Bernard Hill plays the role of Theoden, King of Rohan, and he is a very fitting counterpoint to Aragorn. He's an aged monarch, a warrior past his prime, and thus frailer, but also possessing pride in his status as a ruler. Very good performance, one of my personal favourites. But it's Gollum (Andy Serkis) that everyone always mention, and for a good reason. In many ways he's the most important character in the whole story. He's the tragedy under all the heroics, noble sacrifices and great deeds. He's the dark shadow, the weakness of mortals made flesh. Without him Frodo's struggles wouldn't mean half as much. And Serkis plays him perfectly. He's a marvel of special effects and man's ability to slip into a role. Especially considering that he's essentially two characters molded into one.The Two Towers is a great film on all levels. It transitions us from the origin stories of The Fellowship towards the grand battles of the Return of the King, all the while keeping the story flowing smoothly and keeping us firmly in the mood for Middle-Earth. Masterfully done, Mr. Jackson."
tsangaridesi,"Sep 6, 2014",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings does not fail to impress. I loved it all. I don't have as much to say for this one as the last one, because it's a continuation of the same story, but I will try. The acting, once again, was phenomenal. The comic relief, even though it appears in the midst of serious dilemmas, is still really funny, and well done. The tension comes and goes when it is needed, and when it is necessary. The camera work is great, and the final battle scene is just super epic! You know a battle scene is good when it lasts half an hour and you don't get bored of it. I can't wait to watch the final movie of this trilogy, but I'm also shocked at the fact that it's four hours long! It's really impressive how a single trilogy can be eleven whole hours long."
Movie-Dood198027,"Apr 21, 2025",8/10,"I've Seen The Lord Of The Rings: The fellowship of the ring in February 2024 , i've waited More than a Year to watch The Lord of The rings: The two towers which is cool since it allows me to ""mimick"" what a real release will feel to me as an audience member.The movie is an Action adventure fantasy epic , with a Very Very grand scale that scatters around the middle earth and all of the power to go and defeat Sauroman , who is a helper of the mighty Sauron , the moral of the plot is seperated into parts, Frodo & Sam , and the rest , And i'm very glad that Gandallf (Ian Mckallen) Is back as Gandalf ""The White"" instade of the grey which i assume is that he is purer than last time , because he won a big fight Versus Balrog , which everyone thought he died to him but NO , Gandalf is a very wise very intellegent very strong dude and that really fits him because he deserves to win battles.The movie's grand scale is indeed great but it tends to be boring or slow at times , It definitley does not feel stretched because the story Definitley needed this runtime but some aspects tend to be focused more than what's better/important , and sometimes the movie is just straightup bland , yeah i get the build up but there was a porpouse for The fellowship of the ring right? Anyway it was great.Overall I do prefer The first one but what makes this one great is how it EXPANDED the story to a whole new level and Peter jakson definitley adapted this book very well , The battle of Helm's Deep was Very cool and overall great movie i wouldn't say i loved it but it was definitley a long experiance. 8/10."
seruanyre,"Jan 22, 2023",10/10,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is a cinematic masterpiece that surpasses all expectations. The film, directed by Peter Jackson, continues the epic journey of Frodo, Sam, and their companions as they fight to destroy the One Ring and defeat the Dark Lord Sauron. The acting is top-notch, with Viggo Mortensen delivering a powerful performance as Aragorn, while Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are heart-wrenching as Frodo and Sam respectively. The special effects are truly stunning, with the battle scenes being particularly breathtaking. The film also manages to deepen and expand on the characters and themes introduced in the first installment, making for a more emotionally resonant and satisfying experience. Overall, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is a must-watch for fans of the genre and for anyone who appreciates great filmmaking."
mpopham,"Dec 14, 2002",N/A,"My wife and I saw this film at a Carleton College benefit in Minneapolis December 13 (one of the executive producers, Barrie Osborne, graduated from Carleton in 1966).  We saw ""Fellowship"" at a similar fundraising event last year.  Like ""Fellowship"" the attention to detail on this film was exquisite and the whole affair was masterfully produced and directed.  I was never a big fan of the books, but I would say that ""The Two Towers"" was in every way a better film than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  When the battle of Helm's Deep began, I was certain that the film would end there; and that we would end up with  a ""cliff-hanger"" ending, and a film that was only a come-on for the next installment.  But ""The Two Towers"" was, on its own, complete and satisfying.  The Battle of Helm's Deep was an astonishing cinematic achievement all by itself; and that is only 1/3 of the movie.  If you liked the first one, you'll love this one.  If you loved the first one, get some friends to go with you so they can carry you out of the theater.  You'll have the time of your life.  This is grand, epic filmmaking.  This is why they invented movies."
panouli,"Jan 15, 2003",6/10,"Major deviations from the book. The sad thing is that most of them take plot out of the film instead of adding to it. There was no need for instance for poor Theoden to be mentally substituted by Saruman himself (does that mean Saruman could multitask?). A mere plot by his treacherous consultant, finally exposed by Gandalf would do (as in the book). What about this semi romantic and semi metaphysic scene with the elven woman? How does it stick to the plot and what's the relevance with book 2? Nor was it necessary for Gimli and Aragon to anihilate hundreds of orcs, just on their own. And where was that huron tree intervention to save the Helm's Deep? Frankly, I had this feeling I was watching a set of visually impressive video clips, due to the very loose plotline. And that can get tiresome after an hour. Especially since I was waiting for much more.In a nutshell, visual effects got better, film got worse (Gandalf looks much worse too).I wonder why second sequels are often worse. Let us hope third gets better."
jewelthrone,"Nov 7, 2010",5/10,"Some of us may know the back story of how Tolkien himself never wanted his books to be made into a film and I have to say that I agree with him, much of the magic of his books were in the finer details and these could never be conveyed well in a film. Here we have a film that's well done in some ways yet in the grand scheme of things it was never needed, the books stand alone and this trilogy of movies are a perhaps selfish project? -that are essentially a compromised vision of the books, this big budget 'action' movie would serve those looking for a feast of CGI effects and action sequences, thankfully there is some subtlety and the interplay between characters is the films saving grace and I appreciate the tasteful selection of dialog used for the most part. One of my big beefs with The Two Towers and the other 2 movies is just how nonthreatening Sauron is in these films, I think this aspect weakens the movies a great deal, even the ring wraiths come across as impotent compared to creatures such as the Urak Hai. Another is the abrupt transitions between scenes, and the movies lose much of the 'glue' that the books had tying everything together. Finally 'some' of the CGI effects don't do justice to the imagination - Sauron's eye, and the faces in the dead marsh seem to suffer like Gladrieal did in the previous movie - a little bit too overly dramatic and washed out - I am only mentioning this as a comparison to the majority of effects in this movies which are actually very well done. Also the costumes are excellent, I especially thought the depictions of the orcs were excellent. Overall I can only give this 5 stars."
knkwhitaker,"Dec 30, 2003",10/10,"Of all three movies in this illustrious trilogy this might be my personal favorite.  This is an incredible film.  IMHO the opening and closing sequences (Gandalf Vs. Balroc & Helm's Deep) are unmatched in their greatness.  The middle isn't too shabby either with a few great action sequences, some interesting character development and some of the most breathtaking settings ever put on film."
Kademan-02092005,"Mar 8, 2025",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a masterful adaptation in continuing to deliver the wonders and horrors of J. R. R. Tolkien's fantastical saga.The returning cast are all great, with character dynamics allowing more development, especially between Dominic Monaghan's Merry and Billy Boyd's Pippin, who feel more relevant to the story this time around. The new additions to the cast are all also very good with notable mentions being Karl Urban, Brad Dourif, and Bernard Hill. But now, with the increased budget to do so, the execution of Andy Serkis' Gollum is nothing short of remarkable, as the special effects really enhance the expressions without ever coming off as cartoonish or silly, and feel completely necessary in bringing such a starved and deformed creature to reality. Moreover, the set design and landscapes are all still breathtaking, the cinematography continues to capture the utter scope of every scene and sequence, and the score is still just as powerful, especially in the battle scenes. And on that note, the battle of Helm's Deep makes for an excellently thrilling and captivating climax that not only delivers part of what the story has been building to, but ends in a way that neatly sets up the third and final chapter.In short, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a fantastic second part that leaves both those familiar and unfamiliar with the source material eagerly anticipating as to if Jackson can now cap off what could be an epic trilogy."
jace_the_film_guy,"Sep 24, 2022",9/10,"The Two Towers is a great movie. Is it as good as the other two films in the trilogy? I personally don't think so. I found myself less invested in some of the story elements, particularly when they involved the human characters (which occupied much of the runtime). Though not as strong as Fellowship or RoTK, this movie is full of spectacular moments.The Battle of Helm's Deep might be the best battle in cinematic history. From the driving force to the action to the gravitas, everything about that sequence is jaw-dropping. Though incredibly dark and serious, the humor is spot-on and adds a needed layer of character development.On top of the action, what this movie does well is develop relationships between characters. Frodo and Sam, Legolas and Gimli, Frodo and Sméagol, Aragorn and Éowyn, and beyond. The relationships in this film are superb and help push the story forward.When I want to watch incredible action and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a great movie in an amazing trilogy.Best Character: Gimli
Best Moment: The Battle of Helm's Deep (the entire thing)
Best Quote: ""Toss me."" - Gimli."
theteamavengers,"Jan 24, 2021",10/10,"Literary no words. Perfection. Bravo to the cast and crew. The battle of helms deep was amazing. Amazing performances , cgi, and score"
gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Dec 25, 2022",10/10,"(Merry Christmas, everybody!)Taking place where The Fellowship of the Ring left off, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor together to destroy the One Ring before making an alliance with Gollum later on. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli follow the orcs who took Merry and Pippin while also making an alliance with the Riders of Rohan. Later on, they would make plans to escort the people to Helm's Deep were they will fight against them.The story in this movie is not only a very faithful adaptation like the last film, but it's also effective in it's emotional gravitas and world building. That way, it helps you learn the situation the broken Fellowship are into and their plans to fight back against the Orcs. Plus the themes of family and overcoming their prejudices are well executed. Howard Shore continues to make haunting beautiful music that enchanted the action and atmosphere of Middle Earth.The production design and costumes are as beautiful as ever, the direction and editing are very sharp, and the action choreography is superb especially in Helm's Deep. And then there's the strong acting from everyone involved.Elijah Wood and Sean Astin go great together as did Andy Serkis as Gollum (in his solid motion capture). Viggo Mortenson, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys Davies, Ian Mckellon, Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan also did great. Other actors like Karl Urban, Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, and Bernard Hill did very superb job.Overall, The Two Towers is a great continuation of the cinematic trilogy and still holds up after 20 years."
lavgeber,"Dec 29, 2024",10/10,"There is not much to say. All 3 movies are the definition of a perfect fantasy trilogy, the pacing, each scene, the characterw, music, symbolism.Show it to your children, they might not understand but will feel it. And later on will eant to re-watch it.Nothing later has come even close, and all the new series and movies did was show how gigantic these movies are.Its about hope, valor, love and making a difference. You will cry, laugh, be saddened and feel as thoigh you ate a 5 star meal for your soul.Watch the extended editions, if only because they add even more to the fantastic lore and story."
earlynr,"Nov 2, 2003",10/10,"I got bored in the theater watching the first movie in this trilogy, ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" to the point where I didn't bother to see ""Twin Towers"" until it came out on DVD.  Boy, was I glad I did.  I was so moved by the characters in the second installment -- especially that hero(!) Gandolph.  And I was so moved by the battle scenes that I actually cried. Great flick!  The trilogy definitely redeemed itself with the ""Twin Towers."""
ericjg623,"Feb 24, 2003",N/A,"And that's saying a LOT, seeing as how I rated that a 10+/10. And I normally have little interest in the whole ""Sword & Sorcery"" genre, so my high praise means even more than usual. They were wise to film all three LOTR movies at the same time, for it means the 2nd follows the style of the first seamlessly. These are truly labors of love, every aspect of these films are crafted with exquisite care, it is obvious that all the people involved, from the producers, actors and directors on down wanted to spare no effort to pay full homage to Tolkien's classic works. There are virtually no flaws, and to point out what tiny ones exist would come off as churlish, so I simply won't bother. The acting is uniformly solid, and that's no small praise considering there are well over a DOZEN major characters here. And, just as with the first, the sheer amount of detail, the vastness of the story, is almost overwhelming, these clearly are movies that can be seen many times because there's so much to be absorbed. It's a shame this (like its predecessor) will probably be snubbed for Best Picture Oscar because it's obvious to anyone other than a complete dullard that these are landmark films whose appeal will long outlast the other Oscar contenders10+/10"
perfectbond,"Mar 12, 2004",7/10,"Even after seeing Fellowship, I still haven't read the books but after just seeing Two Towers on the beautiful extended edition DVD I am now motivated to see the end of the trilogy before it ends its theatrical run. The story progresses nicely in this the second chapter which is in my opinion the most difficult of the three to execute. Once again director Jackson impressively conveyed the scope and grandeur of Middle Earth mostly through state of the art computer animation and special effects. Speaking of that, Gollum the CGI character, while a technical marvel, became extremely annoying. That's just my individual opinion. By the way, I think Jar Jar Binks is brilliant comic relief in The Phantom Menace (I'm not prejudiced against CGI characters!) The acting from the cast was also spot on though frankly I don't think the material was that challenging (ie. no one deserved an Oscar nomination). The costumes, props, and beautiful location photography were also uniformly excellent as befits a production of this magnitude. 8/10. I should note that I haven't seen the original theatrical cut of the film so I don't know what else besides background on the Boromir (?) character was added. I look forward to the conclusion of the trilogy!"
MovieLoonie,"Oct 18, 2005",2/10,"This is about one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I suppose if you read the book, you might be able to enjoy it, referencing back to characters thoughts and emotions etc. But for those of us who didn't read the book, it was a bunch of scenes of people walking. A wide shot of people walking. A close up of people walking. and not much else happening. I'm trying to figure out why everyone in these books has two names. (As if the plot isn't complicated enough for those of us who haven't read the book.) The only redeeming thing in the whole movie is that goblin thing that calls the ring 'precious'. (even he has two names) Hence I gave it a two, instead of a one. Sure the special effects were great. But great special effects does not mean the movie is great. I liked the first LOTR movie, quite a bit more than I expected, actually. I would rate that one much higher. But as a follow up this one was a disappointment. So much so that I didn't bother to see the third one. Thats how boring I thought 'The two towers' was."
drakeking1,"Apr 21, 2025",10/10,"It's almost impossible to discuss The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers as a standalone entity. It's so deeply woven into the fabric of this epic trilogy that separating it feels like trying to isolate a single, breathtaking vista from an entire mountain range. This isn't just a sequel; it's a vital, beating heart connecting the familiar warmth of the Shire's memory to the looming destiny of the final chapter. If pressed to rank these cinematic titans, my personal preference would place The Return of the King at the summit, followed closely by The Fellowship of the Ring, with The Two Towers holding a respectable third position. However, please understand this isn't a reflection of quality, but rather the nature of its place in the grand narrative. To even consider it a ""lesser"" film would be a profound disservice to its monumental achievements. The Two Towers plunges us deeper into the fractured journey of our heroes. While the Fellowship has broken, the weight of their quest intensifies. We witness the harrowing separation and the diverse paths they must now tread, each fraught with peril and demanding immense courage. The film masterfully juggles these parallel storylines, building tension and showcasing the individual struggles that contribute to the larger conflict.Visually, The Two Towers is nothing short of breathtaking. From the sweeping landscapes of Rohan to the imposing fortress of Helm's Deep, the artistry on display is simply stunning. The sheer scale of the battles is awe-inspiring, immersing you in a world teetering on the brink of war. The creation of Gollum is a groundbreaking achievement in visual effects and character animation, bringing a complex and conflicted figure to life with remarkable nuance. This film serves as a crucial intermediary, a bridge that expertly expands upon the foundations laid in The Fellowship of the Ring and expertly sets the stage for the climactic events to come. We see profound character development as our beloved heroes face new trials and make difficult choices that will shape their destinies. The narrative threads, though separated, are expertly woven together, creating a sense of mounting urgency and anticipation.Despite its position as the middle chapter, The Two Towers stands tall as a magnificent piece of cinema. It's a testament to masterful storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and compelling character work. It earns nothing less than a perfect score and remains an indispensable part of a truly legendary cinematic experience."
kaaffilm,"Mar 25, 2023",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a stunning middle chapter in Peter Jackson's epic film trilogy, bringing to life the second book in J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved fantasy series with breathtaking visuals and heart-stopping action. The film picks up where its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring, left off, with the Fellowship broken and scattered and the forces of darkness closing in on Middle-earth.As the film unfolds, we follow the separate journeys of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) as they make their way towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring, and of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) as they try to rescue Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) from the clutches of the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the orc army.The film is a masterclass in world-building and visual storytelling, with Jackson and his team of talented artists and designers bringing to life the breathtaking landscapes of Middle-earth and the terrifying armies of orcs and uruk-hai. The film's action sequences are thrilling and intense, with standout moments including the epic Battle of Helm's Deep and the tense confrontation between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the Balrog.But what really sets The Two Towers apart is its exploration of themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the power of friendship. As the characters face impossible odds and grapple with their own doubts and fears, their bonds with one another are tested and strengthened, creating emotional moments that are both heart-wrenching and uplifting.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a riveting and unforgettable chapter in one of the greatest film trilogies of all time. With its stunning visuals, thrilling action, and powerful themes, it raises the stakes and sets the stage for an epic conclusion in The Return of the King."
hansbearnl,"Nov 24, 2002",10/10,"Who could ever imagine that the audience in Indonesia would be the first to watch The Two Towers? No one, including me. I have no idea why, maybe by mistake, maybe on purpose, it played this weekend on screen in one theater in Bandung, Indonesia. Walking around the shopping mall, I noticed that 3 movies were on for the nightmovie: Harry Potter, The Chamber of secrets, Treasure Planet and yes, The Two Towers. Impressive...hardly any words for this movie. Fans of Tolkien can be satisfied, again, a great masterpiece has reached the theaters around the world. In number 2 of the trilogy, the tension and excitement builds up. The separate journeys of Frodo & Sam, their friends preparing for battle, never fighting for the attention of the watcher. The characters come out better in this movie, although I still miss the singing as described in the books of Tolkien. Hobbits like to sing, so why is this not an important part of the movie? maybe cause the actors can't sing? The new introduced caracters are not to many, and it feels as if you know everyone personally. The producers as well as the actors of ""The Lord of the Rings"" do a magic job. The armies are impressive, and you feel almost emotionally connected with the forces who try to win over evil. Actually, there are no words to describe what is happening here. After years of watching movies, this is the first time ever, I was reluctant to leave the theater...... I think in general, The Two Towers is slightly better than ""fellowship of the ring"" and I already voted for 10 points there. Please, can I give 10+ this time?"
pensive_englishman,"Jan 14, 2023",10/10,"To be quite honest I did not believe I could watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy twice, not that I don't like it. On the contrary it's one of the films that strike me the most. Only problem is that each episode runtime is well over 3 hours and that stretches over 4 hours if you count the TV commercials in, which means an enjoyable movie has become a huge commitment as well as a physical challenge. However, given I was in New Zealand a couple of months ago for a second time and Hobbiton and Wetashop were part of that journey, I have been inspired to watch this show again and re-review it.LOTR - what an all-age, all-gender and all-culture silver screen sensation for its generation! From storyline to metaphor, costume to makeup, background to scenery, sound to music, cast to crew, cinematography to acting, there's not a single box it doesn't tick.Storyline has rugged layers (often interpreted as conflicts) which movies rely on. A journey to Mount Mordor is fraught with dangers, perils and treachery. All these are amplified by each and single character's struggle and pain, which are finally overcome by love, trust, courage, determination, friendship and companionship.Seasoned and accomplished actors have undoubtedly demonstrated those traits. Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving and many others have all played an exceptional role in living their characters, so much so that the strong cast in LOTR trilogy has made its The Hobbit trilogy sequel a lackluster.Costume and makeup are well toned in that they fit perfectly with the characters. Women's dresses, men's armors, cookware and even the cute lembas bread all resemble those in ancient Roman Empire times. The acoustics of its sound and music and the grandeur in fighting scenes are simply breathtaking, striking a remarkable resemblance to Troy (2004), making it literally a legendary ancient war movie.As usual I would like to touch on the metaphor of each movie simply because good films should always do more than just describing the story. They need to convey the underlying message. Human's greed and craving for power is demonstrated throughout, not just by the evil spirit but also by those with a good heart. After all we live in a real world full of deceit and temptations. Yet it is those characters like courage, determination, caring and compassion that see us through. A lot of people say Samwise Gamgee is the unsung hero and I totally agree with that. His unfailing loyalty and faithfulness to his friend Frodo Baggins unchallenged bring a tear or two to his audiences. He just has an adorable chubby face I want to pinch - in a fond way of course.Once again I must mention the filming locations that inspired me to re-watch and re-review this show. I want to give special thanks to Hobbiton Movie Set Tours for showing me the cute Hobbit village. The Hobbit houses, the hills, the trees, the grasses, the bridge, and the water mill are all fondly reflected in the movie. That is probably one of the reasons for traveling the world to stamp those filming locations. One goof I must point out though - in the closing scene when Samwise Gamgee walks back to his house with his family, the actor actually bends down over the door frame because the hobbit houses are quite low while the actors are in real size..."
bob the moo,"Dec 30, 2002",N/A,"The quest of the ring continues with the fellowship broken up.  Aragon, Gimil and Legolas pursue the orcs who took Merry and Pippin.  However they lose the hobbits when the orcs are attacked and killed by Eomer, nephew of King Theoden.  Merry and Pippin escape into the forest, meeting the keeper of the forest, Treebeard.  Aragon et al follow their trail into the forest to meet Gandalf the White who leads them to defend Rohan where Saruman's forces are preparing to attack and wipe out man.  Meanwhile Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, addicted to the ring and corrupted by it's power. They reluctantly allow Gollum to lead them to Mordor despite Sam's mistrust. Gandalf frees King Theoden from Saruman's spell and the King takes his people to the fortress at Helm's Deep where the armies of man and orc will collide.The plot sounds plain confusing.  And looking in the film magazines at the various maps and family trees that they published I did fear that the film would be even more demanding than the first and would almost require me to start ploughing through the book's appendices to follow it.  But no, that's the first thing Jackson has done well.  He has stripped down the detail and has made the relationship easy to see and the characters easy to understand. I'm sure much of the text has been lost but it works better.  On top of this the film's pace is much more even.In my review of the first film I disliked the stop/start nature of the talking/running plot and found it tiring and hard to enjoy.  Here the film manages perfectly with a good level of action and story that is consistent and builds to the battle for Helm's Deep as it's climax.  It makes for an enjoyable film rather than the pacing of the first.  Even the fragmented story line is dealt with well - it could easily have pulled the plot in 3 different ways and affected how the film hangs together but it really worked out well.  All three stories are told but none is lingered on longer than needed (with the possible exception of flashbacks of Aragon's love).This made it much more enjoyable to me - that the film was fun to watch and not hard work.  Also the comedy was inserted nicely.  Again the first film felt like it would be rude to enjoy this sacred story - but here we have nice laughs that don't cheapen the story or the characters.  The action is less chaotic than before and only the odd scene is a blur.  The special effects are excellent despite looking computer generated beside real things. The riskiest effect is Gollum - he could easily have been another Jar-Jar Binks in the way he didn't work well as a real character.  However the animation is superb.  Sure he doesn't always LOOK real beside Frodo and Sam but that's cause he's not!In terms of character Gollum was the best addition to the cast.  He is a real character - pathetic yet dangerous, funny yet treacherous.  After a few minutes I forgot that he was an effect and was as involved with him as with any of the others.  In fact the extent to which Serkis made Gollum watchable was shown by how held I was by his scenes with Frodo.  I found Wood to be too serious and worthy and hard to watch - Serkis' Gollum changed that and I was gripped.  The other good character is Astin's Sam who appears minor but is really the honest heart of the fellowship thus far, he is well acted and not allowed to be just a clumsy sidekick.  Pippin and Merry have minimised time which is good but their scenes are better this time round. Mortensen, Bloom and Rhys-Davis are all great and any scene they are in holds the attention effortlessly.  Mortensen is especially good and I can't understand why people prefer Bloom over him!?  Generally the acting is very good.  In the first film everything felt very tight, like the actors were afraid of upsetting anyone and read every line like it was gospel. Here they fit their characters better and seem to enjoy it which in turn helped me.Overall I pretty much enjoyed the first film but had big reservations about it - having to work to enjoy it and finding the pace tiring and ill-judged. In this outing all my reservations had been dealt with.  Sure it's not perfect but it is a very, very good film.  Epic in every sense but yet enjoyable and (thank God) fun to watch.  Just like Lucas improved Star Wars with Empire, so too has Jackson done much better second time around.  Lets just pray that The Return of the King doesn't turn out to be his `Return of the Jedi' - nope! It's unlikely - I can't wait!"
vga123,"Dec 27, 2002",6/10,"SLAUGHTERED! Tolkien would sue from his grave if he saw this film! This is an exact description of what the filmakers did to J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece! In order for the film to become liked from the general public, the film was made in to a typical action love story. Poor Aragorn became a punching bag by adding all the extra action with the woolf riders! The book had a nice flow of events that was disturbed by the extra footage on the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen. The battle of Helm's deep was a tragedy since the director thought that it would sell more if the elves sent reinforcements while he increased the orc force to 10,000. Another deviation from the book was Frodo's trip to Osgiliath. This was totaly unnecessary ( i think they did that to increase the film's length) and as an effect it had the total destruction of Faramir's character ( HE didnt try to take the ring away, instead Frodo offered it to him and he denied). In the book, Faramir was meant to right the wrong his brother made ( i see him as a good version of Boromir). I think that you had enough of my wining so I will talk about the film's positive side. The Ents where GREAT! The film caught their characteristics perfectly! The gate of Mordor was GREAT! And finally the oliphant was nice! After measuring all the facts I decided to give this film a 6."
sungwon444,"Dec 25, 2002",4/10,"To all the obsessed Lord of the Ring fans who keep raving this movie as if it were the best movie ever made...I'm sorry, I can't get over it. I""m just so disturbed with yall voters. I can't believe this movie is at the top of the TOP 250 list, with a 9.1 voting average. That's crazy, that's insane. I mean, I could understand that yall obviously loved the movie, but why such a high rating? This is crazy...it's not that good of a movie ( I personally didn't like it and suffered for three hours), but do you people realizing what movies yall are putting Lord of the Rings  ahead of?ahead of the....Godfather Trilogy Shawshank Redemption Braveheart Star Wars Original Trilogy Memento and other fantastic moviesI mean, these movies that I have just listed surpass Lord of the Rings by far, and to say that Lord of the Rings is better than movies such teh Godfather or Shawshank Redemption is atrocious, an insult to humanity.Here are the reasons why I didn't enjoy Lord of the Ring- The Two Towers....1. We don't get anything out of this movie...it's just a lame adventure fantasy sequel, nothing more. I mean, I understand there are symbollic elements in this movie like Good vs. Evil, the light and dark, and all that other crap, but after seeing this movie, I said to myself, ""Did I gain anything from watching this movie?"" The answer is no2. shallow characters- once again, we don't get to understand or get into these chracters. Peter Jackson does an absolute horrible job of character development and we don't get to know anything about these people! I mean, because he failed to do so, I simply do not care if Froto or any of his hobbit friends die...3. A showcase of graphics, nothing more- Peter Jackson concentrates too much on Computer graphics and cinemotagrophy that direction is lost...and the storyline just kinda rolls on without any real direction. The audience sees nothing but a bunch of random trees going around, a bunch of water gushing...blah blah blah, and a bunch of random slash- and tear battle scenes. I mean, I admit, the CGI and the cinematography in this movie was amazing, but the movie can't expect those to satisfy movie goers like me.4. Crappy character interaction- Once again, like my comment #2, this movie displays poor and artificial character interaction. I just can't feel any sense of connection between the characters. I mean, I could really feel the interaction between Red and Andy Dufraine in the Shawshank Redemption, and the interaction between the Star Wars chracters...but the interaction and dialogue in the Two Towers really stink.5. Too long, too boring, drags too much- Is this movie actually fun and entertaining?....no!!!! final answer. It's 3 hours for heavens sake! And it's too slow....and drags too much6. Why do we get bombarded with annoying characters? - um, I don't even know his name, and I don't care to remember, but that bulgy eyed skinny mutant creature was so freaking annoying! 10 X more annoying than Jar Jar Binks, now that's an insult!7. No humour- When a movie has absolutely no humor in it, it has a small chance of being good. Man...how stupid were the punchlines in this movie....really stupid!! It's sad when the only guy that's attempting to be funny is that dwarf dude with the ax. You notice that I don't even remember the character's names?...(that's because I don't care). Well, i do remember the names Froto, and Aragon, i think.8. pathetic romance- man....what pathetic romance. Why can't the movie be more detailed about Aragon's romance. That's sad.9. 10. 11. .......I could go on and on...but there's no use. You Lord of the Rings fans are just too crazy and hyped about this movie, that it's no use. I wish you could appreciate deeper movies like Brave heart or the God father, or more creative and aesthetic movies such as Memento, but no no no, you people think it's the best movie all time (that's pretty sad, I still can't believe that it's the #1 movie in the top 250).i suffered through this nerdy pointless movie, and i give it 3 out of 10 stars, just for the cinematography... yes, that's the only thing good i can say about this movie, the nice scenery."
PennyReviews,"Mar 21, 2013",10/10,"There is one word that can describe 'the lord of the rings: the two towers' : incredible. The best epic movie of all times. The stories blend in with each other, forming the scenery of Middle earth in war. The characters, tempted by the power of the ring, straggle between the good and the bad. The battle of Helm's deep is one of the highlights of the movie, as well as the transformation of the gollum, who is one of the most interesting characters. The scenery is wonderful, adding to the main epic atmosphere a realistic note. The soundtrack too helps to the magic of the movie that captures the audience from the beginning. Great performances, in addition, give the movie the excellence."
sarah_se1,"Dec 17, 2002",10/10,"I was lucky enough to win a pair of tickets to see a premiere showing of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"". Needless to say I was pretty excited because for as long as I can remember I've been a great admirer of Tolkien and huge fan of the first Lord of the Rings film. I wasn't disappointed with 'The Two Towers'. Peter Jackson draws you into the film with the opening score, and leaves you breathless until the very end. The story line picks up where Jackson left off - a continuation of the first rather than another movie altogether. (I'm going to reveal the starting plot so please don't read ahead if you don't want to know.)Merry and Pippin have managed to escape from the Orks that have held them capture, only to run into even more interesting creatures in the woods: Ents, trees that can move and speak.Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying to rescue Merry and Pippin when they run into someone they didn't expect, Gandalf - back and now a white wizard, the highest a wizard can go. After being assured of the two young hobbits' safety, they travel to the kingdom of Rohan where Saruman holds the King in an evil spell. After freeing the king they must prepare for Saruman's army, which sole purpose is to destroy the world of men. The Battle of Helm's Deep (which can be quite disturbing at points, not for the very young or those who can't handle that kind of thing) decides the winner. (Peter Jackson spent over a month filming this scene and all that time was not wasted - it was a fantastic scene, well thought out and captivating.)Frodo and Sam are trying to reach Mordor but find themselves lost. After an encounter with the creature Gollum, who at one point possessed the ring and maddingly wants it back, Frodo (who is beginning to feel the true weight of the ring) decides to let Gollum guide them. Gollum wasn't much different from a hobbit before he possessed the ring, and was called Smeagol. In the movie 'The Two Towers' you are able to see the struggle that takes place within Gollum. Smeagol represents the good left inside of him, and Gollum the bad. These scenes were some of my favourites - they were wonderfully shot and really took the film to another level.And of course we can't forget the lovely elvish and thus immortal Arwen, who is faced with the choice of staying with her beloved Aragorn or leaving forever with her people; there's the nephew of King Theoden, the strong and noble Eomer who will do anything for Rohan, and his equally strong and lovely sister Eowyn who develops feelings for Aragorn; and lastly Faramir, the brother of the late Boromir, now Captain to Gondor.This movie didn't feel like a movie. I honestly felt as though I had been pulled into the screen in the theatre. It was fantasticly shot, preformed, and directed. 'The Two Towers' is the classic tale of good against evil. It is perfectly carried through. There was not a moment I didn't savour - I didn't want this film to end and will be seeing it again in theatres the next chance I get. If anything, I think I enjoyed this film more than the first. And although I understand this movie isn't for everyone, I still highly recommend it to all. I give it a 9 out of 10."
TaylorYee94,"Nov 24, 2022",9/10,"When Aragorn falls off the cliff, when legolas jumps on the horse, when legolas slides on the shield, shooting arrows, when Gandalf advents with Eomer's army, and so many other times. I cried at many scenes: when Sam tells that he fights for something good left in the world, when Haldir's army arrives right before the war, honoring the alliance, and when Haldir dies in Aragorn's arm. I laughed at any scene with Gimli in it (He's such a joy in this whole series) and with Ents being so slow. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' makes you feel so many emotions.Of course, the movie quality is just perfection: story, camera, setting, acting, and everything else. Especially, longs shots of nature and wilderness is majestic and brings the whole story to its root: Middle-Earth. War sequences overwhelm me every single time. However, the strongest advantage of this movie is that it invites viewers into their journey. I am in other place at other time fighting the war with hobbits, elves, wizards, men, and dwarves. Portraying the war in this movie is fantastic technically, but making me feel like I AM a part of this war is just perfection."
Abhit,"Apr 5, 2003",N/A,"Though many would say that The Two Towers was excellent and some would say brilliant, I have different opinions.  I have seen this movie four times, and each time, my opinon changes.  The first time I saw it, I had no idea what was happening, so I basically slept for three hours.  However, the second time I went, I went with a Lord of the Rings fan who was explaining the story to me nonstop.  It was better that time, but still not that good. The third time I understood it completely, but the fourth time I got bored of it.  I think it would have been a better movie if it was a little easier to understand.  Most people enjoy these movies because they have read the books, but the producers have to realize that some of us don't."
antiwolf,"Dec 18, 2002",8/10,"I really really wanted to love this movie.  I loved Fellowship, I found it nearly flawless.  I give a 10/10 for the acting and the special effects.  If I have never read the books, I would have been absolutely flawed by this movie.  Some of the changes detracted from this movie, but not terribly.But the fundemental changed made to Faramire (compare him in the book to the movie - not merely changed but the opposite) seriously undermined the whole plot of the trilogy.Still, I have this an 8/10.  On its own merits, it is excellent.  But changes were made that weakened the story for no good reason..."
Bones-18,"Dec 29, 2002",7/10,"Sorry to you devoted fans out there, but I just had to give the movie a 7/10.  The 20 minute ""10,000 barbarians storm the castle"" was just way over the top, even for Hollywood.OK, I GET IT... now can we move on?I'm surely in the minority, but it's still my opinion.  If it weren't for that scene, I'd give the movie a 10.More of anything is not always better.  This is the purpose of the cutting room floor."
nankipoo,"Aug 29, 2003",10/10,"""The Two Towers"" is every bit as engrossing and well-developed as its predecessor, plus I believe its new characters (those not introduced in ""Fellowship"") are some of the most intriguing ever conceived and put on film. You have Gollum, King Theoden, Eowen, Faramir, Grima, Treebeard and many others. Peter Jackson chose the absolute best actors for his trilogy, I'll give no ground on that point. One might argue about Gollum and Treebeard's categorization as ""actors"", but I say that whether they're CG or human, someone had to write the script and imagine the expressions. The existing characters are developed even more deeply in TT. Sam's humanity, Frodo's compassion, Aragorn's evolving kingship, Arwen's deep love, Gandalf's new transcendent presence, all add richly to the middle chapter of the trilogy. For epic ""sweep"", you'll have to go far to match TT. The scenes at Helm's Deep, with all of the defenders bunkered in as the numberless forces of Sauron converge on them, is the very picture of desperation, and Jackson masterfully gives us both breadth and detail. Gollum's split-personality conflicts as ""Smeagol/Gollum"" are nothing short of perfect, and unlike mainstream movies, we aren't spoonfed the reasoning behind his condition, we just get to puzzle it out for ourselves, like intelligent humans! What a relief. Howard Shore's score is again one I'd buy for myself.I think that the main criticism of TT on this board is that the movie is dull, or that it relies too heavily on special effects. On the ""dullness"" comment, I'd say that what's one viewer's ""dullness"" is another's character development, dialogue, and foreshadowing. It's called ""filmmaking"", along the lines of Kubrick and the Merchant/Ivory team. On the special effects comments, I'd counter that if special effects add to the plot and don't distract, then I'm perfectly OK with them. Now, I wouldn't be drawn to a film totally comprised of special effects, but TT is nothing like that. It's employment of them is only for the sake of plot and believeability. Would you want some guy playing Gollum, heavily made up, and totally false? No thanks. I bought the general release DVD yesterday, instead of waiting for the extended version, which I will purchase also. I only hope that TT's extended version is as fantastic as Fellowship's turned out to be."
kosmasp,"Sep 10, 2022",8/10,"Peter Jackson and his mission - well not his mission, but the mission of our Fellowship (well you get the picture and no pun intended). This is part two and it holds up pretty well to say the least. The movie has the New Zealand landscapes and tries to put as much of the book into the movie as possible.I never read the books, I did try to read the Hobbit before the movies came out ... which I failed to do - but the movies are really well done. Yes Peter got money, but the work he did for it ... not sure if he has health issues because of all the planning and work he had to do for the Tolkien universe he created ... but he did a really good job to say the least.This begins where the first movie left off - and the group will have more adventures, but also has to go different paths - to cover more ground (no pun intended), but also have different stories and people to meet. In the extended edition I watched (actually rewatched because I had seen the theatrical and the longer cut back in the day), you can see even more stuff - and new characters ... well new in the sense that in some cases you get a character that otherwise only pops up in the third movie. But the whole thing makes more sense that way.If you listen to the old commentaries (which are fun and plenty), they do talk about DVDs - if you are baffled: they are discs that look like Blu Rays or 4K discs ... but had way less capacity on them ... also a weaker overall image and sound. But while that part may not have aged well - the movie itself has aged well - it really looks good to say the least. And if you are into Fantasy movies ... well the only thing that remains to be answered: you want to read the books first if you haven't or dive into this? Of course then there is also the new Prime show - which I will dive into sometime in the future."
bh606644,"Jan 9, 2004",10/10,"I have to say that without a doubt, this movie is my personal favorite of the 3 movies in the trilogy.  Why?  I love the tension and overall sense of gloom the actors, and more noteably, the score portray for us.  Rohan seems like it would normally be a beautiful, bright, happy place, but a dark shadow has fallen over it.  Very well done in this sense.  Sometimes, it is just dreadfully quiet as the actors deliver their lines with just a hint of music in the background.  When Eomer delivers the line....""Do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands."" it still gives me goose bumps.  Same with Theoden as he conveys his sense of being alone in this fight at Helm's Deep to Aragorn...""Yes, my Lord Aragorn, we ARE alone."" Awesome....Some other awesome things I loved about this movie:-Gimli is hilarious...him and Legolas also interact well -The Uruks are just some bad mothers...I love them and hate them -The Battle of Helm's Deep is so tense and nervy...not to mention great action -Boromir flashback by Faramir was incredible, and necessary -Gollum......enough said -PO-TA-TOES!!!  I love that scene...still cracks me up. -The Nazgul on the fell beasts are scary! -The dead marshes totally creep me out...well done -The Ents attacking Isengard was one of the coolest things to watch-Even though totally fabricated...I love the warg scene -Every scene in Rohan was great, I can't say enough about the score and awesome actng by Theoden, Eomer, Aragorn, and Gandalf -LOVE the cliff hanger ending and the closing credits music -The EE adds SO MUCH to this movie...every extra scene works for me -this movie has GREAT comic relief (Eowyn's stew comes to mind, and everything out of Gimli's mouth)I think I'll watch it again tonight"
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Feb 18, 2023",9/10,"Admittedly, I think The Two Towers is quite easily the weakest movie in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's cursed to sit as a stopgap between the immensely satisfying and exciting first installment, and the epic and emotional final film. However, when its inherent disadvantage is taken into account, it's pretty incredible that it's as good as it is.And The Two Towers is still very, very good. Everything that was of high quality in the first movie is still on display here, as far as all the technical aspects go. It does also have an amazing final hour, with the Battle of Helm's Deep being one of the best single large-scale battles depicted in recent film history. It's exciting no matter how many times you see it. The Two Towers is also the film that introduces Gollum, and it's impressive how well he holds up as a CGI character over 20 years later.The only way The Two Towers suffers a bit is through its pacing. It expands the scope of the series considerably in a very short amount of time, and it always feel jarring being introduced to so many new characters while also coming to terms with the fact that all the previously established characters are off doing their own thing.It makes The Two Towers feel a little messier and less compelling when compared to the other two movies, but if you watch all the films within a short amount of time, it fits in well with the other movies. Assessed as its own film, it probably has the most flaws, but if judged purely as a stepping stone between film #1 and film #3, it's absolutely a success."
Aaron1375,"Dec 19, 2002",10/10,"This movie was as thouroughly enjoyable as the first chapter in the story. The acting was great, the special effects were great, and the story was great.  It is shaping up to be my favorite trilogy of all time.  This one follows three stories one of Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor, one of the two hobbits kidnapped in the first one, and the other of Aragon, Gimley, and Legolos and their encounters.  The one that is the main focus to me was the Aragon tale and it was by far the best.  The other two were good as well, but most of the battles happened in the Aragon parts of the story.  I also really enjoyed the expanded roles of Gimley the Drawf and Legolos the elf.  Great effects also abound in this one as the creature Gollum looks a lot better than I thought it would.  Just a great movie, I can't believe there are people that gave this movie a 1.  I mean even if you hated some part of it the scenery alone makes the at least a 3.  I am thinking these people were dragged to the movie kicking and screaming which is why you should never take someone to a movie they don't want to see cause then they give it a 1 out of spite.  It is either that or they are star wars fans who can't stand that there movies don't get the great reviews anymore."
redline-1,"Apr 26, 2003",N/A,"I'll keep my comments short and sweet:1) Terrible dialouge. I lost count of how many times I cringed as lines were spewed forth. See the King of Rohan and the burial mound scene.2) One dimensional characters. See Gimli's painful and never ending ""jokes."" Jar Jar Binks was given better material and more dignity.3) Schizo order of the scenes. The best example of this mistake takes place during the final battle at Helms Deep. Highly intense moments of fighting would suddenly shift away to Merry and Pippin. Disconcerting and as it was done throughout the film, the pacing was tarnished.4) Plot holes. One glaringly obvious one was when Frodo almost gives up the ring to a Nazgrul and THEN Faramir, who up till then had had the hobbits in chains, lets them go. That and the many others lead one to wonder where the script supervisor was.5) While a bit harder to point out, this film didn't seem to have any ""magic."" It seemed flat,coarse and underwhelming. For example one thing I rememember while watching ""Fellowship"" was not wanting the film to end as it was so enthralling. In TT I couldn't wait for the film to FINISH!To sum up, if you're still in Jr. High I'm sure this film will fit your view as being ""the best movie of all time"" as previous comments have indicated. For the rest of us however this film was pretty wretched. Note - I'm quite a big fan of JR.R. Tolkein's works so my distaste for TT was not due to ignorance. At the same time let me remark that I had no problem with the foreknowledge that a film of the LOTR would necessitate some changes from the books. My criticisms are focused on how shoddily done the film itself was."
damianphelps,"Oct 7, 2020",10/10,"This part of the trilogy has the lot and as good as the other 2 parts are...Two Towers just delivers delivers delivers.
Just a quick note this review relates to the extended addition which is (as they all are) the superior version of the film.There is drama, action, romance, humour, mystery, fun, delight and...The Battle of Helms Deep.This is a magnificent piece of film that is wrapped up within the Two Towers....its like finding bonus bacon inside a cheeseburger.Mmmm cheeseburger!"
rosepol,"Oct 12, 2003",8/10,"As a fan of LOTR before it came out in paperback and of the first film, I was disappointed in the sequel. Tolkien gets lost in all the mugging for the camera, uglified folks, and computer-battle scenes. It is sort of the antithesis of Tolkien, who presented hobbits as admirable for their simplicity and courage. The wrong aspects of seventeen- year-old boys are being appealed to here."
eb_redbaron,"Jan 7, 2003",7/10,"as a fan of the books and a really big movie buff, i was nonetheless disappointed with TTT. maybe because the first one was so excellent, especially the extended version, which unfortunately one can only watch television-size. it seems to me that a pattern in emerging, where you leave all the quiet, but very important, scenes between actors out of the theatrical version, and instead concentrate on the action pieces. but the tenth shot of an uruk-hai bellowing or of women and children looking frightened becomes boring or pathetic pretty soon. and of course there are the story changes: most of them totally unnecessary and not helping the plot at all. i dont mind the scenes between elrond and arwen (although elrond is really painfully miscast) and the conflict of mortality that arwen faces. in fact, those dream-love scenes were a welcome respite from the action pieces. speaking of which, the whole warg-attack was so useless and stupid! it reminded me of star wars, not a good comparison in my mind. and that aragorn drops off the cliff was dramatically ridiculous. not even people who havent read the book will believe that one of the main characters would die like that in the middle of the movie. furthermore it just mirrored gandalfs fall in the first movie, but at the same time belittled that event. i could go on and analyse the whole movie like that, but whats the point? the addition of laborous action pieces seems the main intent, and not staying closer to the book in terms of story-telling. i think its wrong to consider those movies as pure action-flicks that have to cater to teenage boys. after all, the books are very much loved by men and women alike.so i can only wait for the extended version, where all the really important scenes might have been put back again.... i really love the first movie, but after TTT im sadly pessismistic about part three. the filmmakers left out so many important story-elements, they will never be able to finish the story in any way that resembles tolkiens book!"
donxavier,"Dec 26, 2002",1/10,"Let me just say to the Tolkien fans out there that love Jackson's treatment, yet, with the same breath, blast Bakshi's version. What is wrong with you?? Yeah, Bakshi took SOME liberties but at least he kept to the story of FOTR and TT. Jackson, at points, seems to be telling a completely different tale and re-writing characters when it amuses him.I didn't think it was possible to make Tolkien boring but, unhappily, Jackson's TT proved me wrong. I wasn't the only one checking my watch many times during the film. I noticed several people in the audience doing the same.Now, I will say I did like the Director's Cut version of FOTR. However, I hated TT so much that I doubt I will even find the DC version appealing.Please, don't label me a purist, as that suggests unwillingness to accept different visions or interpretations of Mr. Tolkien's work. I do not mind changes being made to the story --- when they are good ones. However, Mr. Jackson and his gang of ink flinging scribes are not sophisticated enough writers to make these changes work or ring true.The wafer-thin melodrama he adds into TT, in order to build suspense, is laughable and obvious. Aragorn getting carried over the cliff edge was nothing more than another Hollywood cliche, already seen hundreds of times in other films, meant to keep the viewing masses on the edge of their seats. Come on!!! LOTR has not been so popular for all these long years for nothing. There is already enough suspense, drama and action in this epic. PLEASE, Mr. Jackson, don't add your muck."

majesty,"Nov 8, 2003",10/10,"Peter Jackson is operating at such an elevated level.  He deserves everyaccolade afforded in and out of the industry.It's impossible to tellwhat far-reaching impact he will have on this century, but it's alreadytranscendent compared to the mundane efforts of his contemporaries. Onecan only hope that he and George Martin will come to some understandingas to the deportment of that worthy's series, ""The Song of Fire andIce"". And it may indeed be Jackson who can rope in Jordan's ""Wheel ofTime"" series as well.Ultimately, the world is at stake, and PeterJackson understands the nature of this world, its peoples, and whatstories to tell to preserve that which is good in those intersectingrealms.

Tera-Jones,"Mar 4, 2016",10/10,"The second film did not loose any steam... instead it keeps building. No matter how many times I see these movies I still get the same thrills that I did at first viewing.This film is a bit dirtier, grittier than the first film... due to the war torn areas and great battles involved. CGI used for a lot of these scenes but not misused.. which is nice. I'm kinda picky about CGI and Peter Jackson's films are always done in good taste - never abused.Like the first film, the 2nd film leaves you craving more - which we get in the 3rd in the series ""Return of the King"". I can say that for movies that are around 3 hours in length - the films seems short to me... the time goes by so quickly when watching.Another film I would highly recommend for fans of High Fantasy.10/10"
Hitchcoc,"Mar 16, 2006",9/10,"This is the war. This is the necessary part of the film to set up the finale. Because it's the middle child, it doesn't get the attention or respect. Once one has all three films in hand, he can begin to view them as a single entity. Still they are considered to be separate. The arising of the Gollum. The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). Like with Trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. Just enjoy what Peter Jackson was able to do. It will live forever in film history."
Capt_comicbook,"Aug 28, 2003",9/10,"9 out of 10  (Like its predecesor, LOTRTT gets a little windy in places)Discounting the StarWars trilogy (forever tarnished by the crap that Lucas is making now), this film is the BEST 2nd installment of a trilogy I have ever seen. It really makes me believe that filming all 3 at once was indeed the only way to do this trilogy.Jackson takes some liberties, but all in all the film is a success on several levels. Characters are maintained and strengthened, The plotting does well not to be too dreadful without inserting lightheartedness or breathtaking action, and the special effects absolutely blew me out of the water.To all the Star Wars fans out there, take a look at Gollum, and see Yoda could only hope to be.  Gollum is so life like and well portrayed.All in all a great movie, albiet with some minor flaws,...  very minor."
Caps Fan,"Mar 31, 2003",6/10,"... it looks like I'm going to have consign myself to the minority here and state that I was seriously disappointed with this movie. Not that it was actually bad, but there were some very weighty flaws that left me squirming in exasperation.Where to begin? Well, it DRAGGED - oh, how it dragged! The first one did too (though it works better on DVD), but this one topped it. There were pointless changes to the characterization from the novel and the effects were very variable, though the Gollum character was brilliantly realized.I left the cinema at the end feeling even more cheated than with the first installment. I'll probably buy the DVD when it's issued, in the hope that the movie flows better in that medium, as the first one did. It needs to.Rating: 6/10."

zorea,"Sep 13, 2003",N/A,"After watching the Two Towers, I was so disappointed that I left the theater resolved not to buy the DVD and to sell my current copy the Fellowship (which I bought in the hope that it would be redeemed by the later movies.) To be fair, my frame of reference for the movie was based entirely on the books, which I have been reading (over and over again) since I was nine. It seems as though Peter Jackson takes some perverse pleasure it making the characters do exactly the opposite of what they did in the books.  I understand it is difficult to transport any book to the screen, but Jackson's changes were not even remotely consistent.  This... of course... is the heart of my disappointment.  Tolkien wrote a story that seemed to peer into another world - not just of fantasy, but a worldview that is in essence pre-modern.  Tom Shippey (Journey into Middle Earth) explains it as a reconstruction of the Middle Ages and its psychology - with priorities, duties, and responsibilities appropriate to that era.  C.S. Lewis talked about it as a ""Discarded Image"" that we once knew, but now no longer fully understand.  The Lord of the Rings is a fascinating glimpse into a world where honor and virtue (the immaterial world) stands always higher than the temptations of the material world (such as greed, selfishness, pettiness, etc.)  Peter Jackson captures none of that.  More importantly, his free reconstructions not only confuse the story on the surface level, but also run completely counter to the spirit of the book.  Jackson's characters have no concept of higher duties or responsibilities - they are portrayed as weak creatures constantly at struggle with their base emotions (with no room for higher ideals).  In fact, this movie was especially dark and pessimistic. True... this may reflect the modern mindset - in fact, it probably mimics it perfectly.  The problem is that I love Tolkien precisely because it does not pander to the modern mindset.  It speaks of higher things.  I have friends who have never read the books who liked the movie, and I suspect that my love of the books has significantly shaded my perspective.  Indeed, if viewed completely on its own terms, the movie is probable fine.  But... what I find continually disturbing is Jackson's repeated claims that he has remained true to the book - that is an outright lie!  I know he does not want to offend the Tolkien fan base (like me), but I find his pleas of innocence to have exactly the opposite effect.  He did not stay true to the book, in either its letter or its spirit.  It would have been less startling to me if he had simply called it by another name and made no pretense of turning the book into a movie.On an altogether separate, more technical, note; I found the movie to suffer generally from poor direction.  I realize this goes against the grain of almost of the critics, but honestly, I have a problem with Jackson's style of directing - this is completely apart from his editorial abuses. Specifically, he does not give the characters time to consider or reflect on the events; the cuts are too quick and unsatisfying.  And this is not just a problem with too much material in too short a time - he could have lost the entire sequence with Aragon and Arwen freeing up 30 minutes or more (without any loss to the story).  Also, Jackson so desperately wants this to be epics that he throws in giant panoramic scenes - unfortunately, he does so with the frenetic energy he puts into the scene cuts, which means that the scenes are constantly in dizzying movement.  A sustained shot would be nice, and might give the viewer a moment or two to take in the context of the events. But alas, Jackson's sweep do not allow you to catch in any details, or even any of the magnitude.  This leads me to the final technical complaint; for all the buzz surrounding the special effects, Jackson's team seems unfit for the job.  I suspect he is constantly moving the panoramic shots because the scenes would not hold up to closer examinations.  Elsewhere, the CGI characters (with the exception of Gollum, who was created and performed very well) were shallow fascimilies.  There were several places during the final battle sequences, where I could almost see the blue/green screen overlays. If Jackson wants to create a competitor to ILM, he will be disappointed. The special effects were both unsubtle and immature - they did not blend well into the story, and were, occasionally, simply distracting.Of course, if you have not read the books, these problems are minor and you may well love the movie.  If you have read the books - but only so long ago that you can't remember the storyline, then you might like the reunion with old (albeit completely different) characters.  If you love the books, their stories, and their message - this movie is probably not for you."
allucaneatbuffet,"Aug 11, 2006",10/10,"Having read the lord of the Rings trilogy, before ever hearing about the film, i knew i needed to see these movies. It has been so long since movie-goers have been able to enjoy a fantastic trilogy (indiana Jones, The first Starwars movies). I guarantee that if you have taste in movies, you will enjoy this trilogy. If you have a HiDef TV, or surround sound, this movie is a must see. However, in order to completely understand the plot in its entirety, it is almost necessary to view these movies in complete succession. Some may see this as a daunting task, but it is definitely worth it. For fans of the original books, i believe this movie to closely follow the plot of the books. While it can be assumed that some of the original plot has been removed, these movies are still quite enjoyable."
halloweennight1978,"Aug 26, 2003",10/10,"im not one to like fantasy...i liked the first LOTR movie, but i wasnt crazy about it. i thought it was an ok fantasy film. then comes ""The LORD of the RINGS: The Two Towers"". it such a great improvement over the first and probably the best sequel ever thats better and more fulfilling then the original. ""TTT"" got robbed at the oscars: peter jackson deserved best director and this movie deserved BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR!. hopefully next year, both peter jackson and return of the king will finally win the oscars they rightfully deserved. as claudia puig from usa today said...""THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS' is among the most breathtaking achievements in recent cinematic history"" i agree. ""ttt"" stands above every movie in 2002 and is certainly THE VERY BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR AND THE BEST FANTASY FILM TO EVER MAKE IT TO THE BIG SCREEN!"
had-6,"Dec 29, 2003",8/10,"This could have been as good as the first part, if Jackson had more respect for Tolkien. Those scenes of Aragorn dreaming of Arwen or utterances that may appear good in script but sound stupid on the screen (running heavy breathing Legolas speaks to himself: red sun rises, blood has been spilt this night) have pretty much harmed this otherwise good film into something that one can't watch without a very unpleasant shivering sensation down one's spine. Fortunately, there are still more good parts than those bad ones, so this is more or less a fine movie. Hope that the Return of the King ends up better."
caleb-schrader,"Jul 24, 2019",10/10,What's there to say?! This trilogy is the last and greatest book to movie trilogy ever made. Hands down spectacular.Also... HELMS FREAKING DEEP!
Saucedafamily,"Oct 3, 2007",10/10,"I remember the first day I saw the first Lord of the Rings. I was seven. I was so captivated by the performances!! I fell in love with all these new actors I've either heard of, or never knew them. I loved it so much, I watch all of them 1,2, and 3!!! I never seem to get enough, it's like every time I watch one of the Lord of the Rings movies, it's a whole knew adventure. This was the first trilogy to see with strictly my dad and brother. That was our thing, we even went to see the Harry Potter trilogy but it's not finished of course. But anyway the three of us went to see the second one, Two Towers. Once the movie started we couldn't of been more thrilled!!(Im so glad I saw all of them on the big screen!!) All of our actors were great and the theatre was so loud! All of a sudden this creature named gollom comes down this mountain above frodo and sam... I don't think I had been so creeped out by this hideous thing, I even remember leaning against my father! I cant ever forget all of them! Elijah wood (frodo) Sean Astin (sam) Viggo Mortensin (Arigon) Orlando Bloom (Leagolas) John Rhys Davies (gimli and Treebeard) Ein Mkellen (Gandalf the Grey/white) Christopher Lee (sarumon)Billy Boyd (pippen)Cate Blanchett (galadriel)Liv Tyler (Arwen) Hugo Weaving (elrond)Dominic Monaghan (Merry)Miranda Otto (Eowyn)Bernard Hill (theoden)I loved all of them but I just think... personally The One actor who blew me away with his performance and worked soo hard for the film.... the one and only Andy Serkis. I don't understand why just because it was CGI that he couldn't get an academy for best actor... it gives me chills that he came that close to getting it!!! And yet he works so hard all those expressions and body movement are his.... that voice,HIS!!!!!!!!! For those who commented that they were surprised to see him act well out of the CGI well in order to do CGI you have to be a good acter with good expressions. Smeagal was him!!! cant you see that!!? Well, everyone was brilliant, great job Peter, a trilogy that will be remembered in movie cinema forever."
peace_out420,"Jan 6, 2005",10/10,"To me, I personally think that this movie is inspirational. It shows how far someone can/has to go to achieve there goals. It shows that you have to fight for what you believe in, and make a commitment. Also, friendship is a big factor in this movie. Sam is willing to risk his life to help Frodo, and expects nothing in return. For me, that was very devoting. LOTR shows that once you start, you can't just give up. You have to work to get what you want, and you have to embrace your future. And to me that is very inspiring. It also teaches you to be happy with what you have....don't be selfish. This movie has changed my outlook on life, and I think it had changed me as a person.Not to mention that pretty much everone in the movie is a total stud! That helps a little."
jgcorrea,"Sep 13, 2024",7/10,"The second of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is two stories - one is that of Frodo and Sam making their painful way to Mordor with Gollum as a guide and that part is tedious to the extreme while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are having a much more exciting time at the Battle of Helm's Deep. In true middle-volume form, the tone of this movie is quite dark. The Fellowship has been broken, and things seem to grow ever worse for its fragments as they pursue their separate quests, until the plot ends abrubtly with yet another turn for the worse. It may be typical of trilogies for the second volume to take the story ever-darker, but here the story gets more complex. This one has the war of Helm's Deep, and you know things are going to get worse before they get better."
mac.worrall,"Dec 28, 2002",1/10,"I first read the books in the 1950s as a teenager and was ""blown away'.Over the years I recognised that there were many boring and irritating aspects to the writing,though not the story.When Peter Jackson said he was going to film L.O.T.R. I had such high hopes.Unfortunately Mr Jackson seems to have misunderstood the theme entirely:in altering the plot he has not just thrown the baby out with the bathwater,but also the bath.Christopher Lee thinks the film deserves an Oscar -that's sad.All in all I hated ""the Two Towers""-and my teenage son didn't think much of it either.Apart from Gollum the C.G.I.was very overrated and character development was poor.Verdict:nul point"
phibbus,"Nov 10, 2010",N/A,"Just read this ""fun fact"" from Philippa Boyens, some bimbo Peter Jackass picked up to hack a screenplay of one of the most intricately crafted pieces of literature ever written. She actually BELIEVES she can improve upon Tolkien...On changing Faramir in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) script: ""If you're trying to up the tension, you don't have your main characters captured by someone who sort of interrogates them, but, not really, who then offers them a cup of tea and says, 'I'll do anything I can to help you.' It's death on film. And it's not just the effect that the character out of the book has on Frodo and Sam's journey, it's the effect that character has on the Ring. You've just been desperately trying to establish that this is the most evil thing ever created, it's tearing apart the mind of your main character, it's reduced this other character to this miserable creature Gollum, and now you come along someone who says, 'I would not touch this thing if it lay on the highway.' You've just stripped the Ring of all its power.""Miserable, just miserable. Any wonder that this film is completely shapeless, dramatically?"

marcosmwedeking,"Dec 9, 2021",9/10,"Following the masterpiece, Fellowship of the Ring, Two Towers takes the story up a notch by introducing us to interesting new characters and even raises the stakes for the ones we're more familiar with. Sure, it is a bit slower moving than Fellowship, but it's more focused on its narrative. Also, the performances are spectacular, especially coming from motion capture actor Andy Serkis, who truly serves as a scene stealer. Additionally, the Battle of Helm's Deep is debatably the best battle of the trilogy and really makes up for a few pacing issues. (as does the Special Extended Edition)"
Tyson14,"Dec 27, 2014",10/10,"Peter Jackson has done what could not be done. Deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), ""The Lord of the Rings"" took the audiences by storm when ""Fellowship of the Ring"" premiered in 2001. In 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and ""Two Towers"" is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale. The movie picks up where ""Fellowship"" left off: Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are pursuing them. But they are sidetracked by an old friend: Gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as Gandalf the White. He takes them to the kingdom of Rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil Saruman. They barricade the people of Rohan in the fortress of Helm's Deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of Uruk-hai. Sam and Frodo have left, to venture into Mordor alone so that Frodo can destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom. When the two hobbits become lost in Emyn Muil, Frodo realizes that someone is following them: Gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the Ring. They capture Gollum, who swears to serve ""the master of the Precious."" But even Gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the Ring has started to bend Frodo to its will. While the first movie revolved around Frodo, the Ring and the Fellowship, here the focus widens. We get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. Gondor is crumbling, Rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by Sauron and Saruman. It's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of Saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for. Elijah Wood blossoms in this film as Frodo Baggins, the little hobbit who could. In the first movie Wood played Frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing Frodo up. Because we saw what a bright, sweet person Frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on Frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). Sean Astin perfectly embodies Sam Gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep Frodo from going under. He serves as a reminder of what Frodo is fighting for, and Astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: ""But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer."" These simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes. But if Frodo is just starting to be addicted, Gollum is a junkie. Even if Andy Serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed CGI puppet. This is no Jar Jar or Dobby -- Gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (I actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- Smeagol and Gollum, good and evil. The scene where Gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words. The other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. Viggo Mortensen turns his reluctant hero Aragorn into a leader and a warrior. Ian McKellen manages to make Gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. John Rhys-Davies provides a bit of comedy as Gimli, mostly related to Gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; Orlando Bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer Legolas once again. Liv Tyler captures Arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. Billy Boyd's Pippin and Dominic Monaghan's Merry, the well-meaning goofballs of ""Fellowship,"" are now forced to make their own decisions. And new cast members Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill also shine as the strong-willed Eowyn and tough old king Theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film. Peter Jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camera-work and direction. His cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. The battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. He adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering. Of course ""Two Towers"" isn't as good as the book. Few movies are. But taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, ""Two Towers"" is virtually without peer. Epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure."
bellino-angelo2014,"Dec 5, 2022",8/10,"As I already said in the review for THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING I was curious for years about the LOTR trilogy because of their reputation and the many reviews for them here. I finally saw them last summer and I loved them all, yet this (the second) didn't win me over like the others. I don't say it's bad, just not on the same level of the previous or THE RETURN OF THE KING.Needless to say that this chapter follows three stories: Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Samwise (Sean Astin) continue their journey towards Mordor for destroying the only ring with the company of its original owner Gollum; Aragorn, Legolas and Ghimli (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys Davies) and then Gandalf (Ian McKellen) go to rescue Rohan that is ready for the battle against Saruman (Christopher Lee); and Merry and Peregrine (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) plan an attack on Isengard while in the custody of Treebeard.The sets are great, and you can see that they spent all their money for having them so big. The soundtrack is nice, no surprise here. The performances were good, nothing to rave about, and Gollum was very funny despite a bit scary (and I won't recommend this movie to very young or sensible viewers for this reason alone). The problems were that the pace was slow in the second half and made the performances stilted, and the battle scene with those ancient elephants seemed a bit too long for my taste.Still, not the greatest in the trilogy but I think the director did it on purpose for making us wait what was in store for the third chapter."
RecaiSan,"Oct 19, 2019",10/10,"Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself."
Argead,"Jan 16, 2003",6/10,"A surprisingly bland and childish adaptation of Tolkien's legendary epic. I felt I was watching a Disney film. The talents of Lee and McKellen are wasted here. Jackson has already shown with ""Fellowship"" -- a superior film -- that he understands Tolkien and knows how to translate his works to the big screen. But with ""The Two Towers"" he takes literary license too far. Skateboarding elves and wisecracking dwarves, is that all it takes to defeat the Uruk-hai? What gives with Aragorn and the pseudo love triangle? These are distractions. Oh, and how about putting some emotional impact back into the story? I want to empathize with the main characters. Still, I'd forgive all its defects in a heartbeat if wasn't so boring. 6/10"
billreynolds,"Feb 13, 2004",5/10,"I have to say, up front, that I really liked Fellowship of the Ring a lot.  But that movie was three hours long, as is Two Towers.   Return of the King is three and a half hours.  I understand Peter Jackson considers this to be ""one"" movie broken up into three parts -- that is, one nine and a half (or eleven, with the extended ""special"" editions) hour movie.  That is simply excessive, IMHO.  Anytime a movie goes much over two hours it better be for a very, very good reason.  When you start talking about a three hour sequel to a three hour original movie, you've got problems -- I don't care how good the original was.  Maybe Godfathers 1 and 2 are the exception. But FOTR and TTT are not that good.FOTR had a more captivating story line.  It was about a small band of brothers on a difficult and daring quest -- to destroy the dangerous ring of power.  TTT doesn't have as good of a story line.  There is a fundamental problem from the start.  It makes no sense that Frodo and Sam would be left to go to Mordor on their own.  Why would all three of the fellowship's best warriors -- Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli -- go off to save Pippin and Merry, and not one of them stay with Frodo and Sam?  This makes NO SENSE, and the fact that Tolkien wrote it that way is no excuse.  Isn't the destruction of the ring more important, in the scheme of things, than saving Merry and Pippin?  Why not send at least Aragorn with Frodo and Sam -- or send Aragorn alone after Merry and Pippin and send Legolas and Gimli with Frodo and Sam? What on earth were Frodo and Sam supposed to do when they got to Mordor on their own?Where FOTR was a story about a quest, a mission, TTT quickly becomes a tiresome story about a ""war"" between ""good"" and ""evil.""  There are so many endless, repetitious, humorless pronouncements in this movie about the stakes of this battle that the theme gets very old very quickly.  If I had been the editor I would have excised every line by Theoden, Aragorn, Treebeard, Sam, et al. about all that nonsense, cut the movie down to two hours and made it almost pure action.The forces of Saruman are presented as so relentlessly, unmitigatingly evil that they are hard to hate.  The orcs (or uruk-hai, I assume that's the same thing) are slimy creatures like Jim Cameron's Aliens.  They ride CG beasts that look like dinos from Jurassic Park.  Sauron is some weird flaming eye on top of a black tower.  The only human villain is Saruman himself, who has about two lines in the whole three-hour flick.  I don't need a lot of motivation for the villains, but I'd like to get at least some idea of why they act as they do.  Why do they fight?  Why are they so evil? What's the point?  Meanwhile, the good guys are all white, the men do all the fighting -- in fact boys of as young as ten or eleven are thrown into battle but not a single woman is.  It's just a tiresome, cliched battle of ""good"" against a straw man ""evil.""  Why are the good guys so humorlessly good while the bad guys are so insanely, relentlessly evil?I was led to believe that Smeagol/Gollum was the best CG character ever, but in fact he seemed less realistic than Jar Jar Binks and no improvement over the dinos from Jurassic Park.  The only bright spot in the movie was Miranda Otto.  I felt no tension in wondering whether Aragorn will choose her or Liv Tyler -- I assume he will choose Tyler, and think he is crazy for doing so.Oh, I forgot one other human bad guy -- this ""Wormtongue"" fellow. How hard is it to figure out a guy named ""Wormtongue"" is up to no good? That's as bad of a name as ""Darth Sidious."""
dominicgarguiolo,"Oct 16, 2021",10/10,"Fantastic follow up to the first film, The Fellowship of the Ring. Nothing is better therapy than escaping into Middle-Earth, it is a timeless piece of art that moves the heart and soul with its messages and intense plot. From it's intriguing characters to the compelling vision of director Peter Jackson, this movie is breathtaking."
andrew-samson,"Apr 22, 2006",10/10,"It is freaking hard to make a movie out of a book,. The main problem is that the book inspires as many visions of the story as there are readers reading it. Now if one guy (in this case three) writes a script it will by all means not satisfy everybody. It can't. Remember when you read the books I mean it was your story it was your vision it was your world. Now there's someone stepping in here and telling you it's different from what you thought it was. Well of course it's not gonna work. I think Peter Jackson has created a film that reflects a book as good as possible, especially an epic story like TLOTR, which at one point can be looked at as a mythology of England. So do the Nibelungenlied or homer's Odyssey with an equal amount of success. I don't think so! It is art and not everybody is an artist. Sorry but Peter Jackson is the one and only who ever brought justification to a book."
LinkinParkEnjoyer,"Dec 25, 2018",10/10,"So it begins.
Is there anyone who doesn't love LOTR??? Gimli is the best I mean that jump to the bridge and his competition with Legolas gets me every time. The story and dialogues are very smart like in the first one and I think Andy Serkis deserved an award for that performance I mean it is one of the most iconic performances ever.
How did Chicago win Oscar vs Pianist and Lotr???"
denis888,"Sep 7, 2007",10/10,"Well, many people say that the Two Towers part is the most boring or very slow. The beginning and the first 40 minutes tend to drag a bit, but then, when the Treebeard appears, it never gets dull. The bloody duel between Saruman and Theoden is the central part here, and again, we witness the visible sufferings of Frodo and Sam on their deadly mission. Well, then there is a huge, really breathtaking Helm's End battle. This siege is probably the best I ever saw or maybe will ever see. The tension is huge, and when the noble Elves die you want to cry, so sweet, so light, so sacred they seem there, among the ruins, blood, smoke and death. Aragorn, Grima, Pippin and Merry, Eowin and Eomer all appear and they all are so real, so flesh and blood that again, no doubt ever dwells in you that there might be a moment that they never existed. The scene of Isengard ruin is so grand that may overshadow many others, especially when the river starts to flow and crash the evil fortress away. It is a pity that some things were omitted in the film, but then, even 3 hours could not get all Tolkien created. Big respect goes to Mr. Lee for his absolutely precise portrayal of evil Saruman The White."
aragorn53,"Feb 11, 2004",10/10,"When I first saw The Fellowship of the Ring, I got really disappointed. But, The two Towers is completely different. The plot of the movie is interesting and their characters are really complex. Besides, the special effects of the movie are unbelievable, specially in the battles. In my opinion, the best actor of the movie was Sir Ian McKellen, who played Gandalf the Wizard. The soundtrack of the film was also great, especially the one that is used in the Kingdom of Rohan. In conclusion, this movie really made me change my opinion about The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and made me a fan."
iluvtolkien,"Jan 21, 2004",10/10,"This movie was really spectacular, it is really apparant how hard the cast and crew worked on this film.

tomaslidberg,"Dec 25, 2002",6/10,"The two towers is a good film, but I would have done it differentley. If they had followed the book like they did in the first film it would have been ten times better. I am a bit sad that they didn't take advantage of the story. They thought that they could do a better job writing than Tolkien did but they couldent. They also managed to destroy some characters like Faramir for example. If you haven't read the book you should definatley watch the film, but have you read the book you might want to think twice. I guess this is a ""must see"" film for us who like fantasy, so I can recomend it, but be prepared for a film that slaughter the book, for that is what it does. Whithout a doubt - the book was better!"
dmprill,"Jan 4, 2003",1/10,"Oh, merciful heavens, what a horrid film!  I had serious problems with Fellowship, but I was able to overcome it eventually, and enjoy the movie on it's own terms.  But this...   this....!  To begin with, this should have had a disclaimer that the film was ""Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's the Two Towers,"" so that geeks such as myself could've saved the $10.00 that I'll never see again, and preserved a fond childhood memory of spending time discovering a literary masterpiece.  I thought I had been scarred by the first film's brilliant dialogue, e.g.,""Let's hunt some Orc!""  (And many people who apparently love this film think George Lucas writes clunky lines!)  but this entire installment left me wanting to pluck out my eyes in a vain effort to cleanse myself.  Of course I see the need to condense a long novel to run within an alloted time, but that's not what happened here, they apparently felt that they could improve upon something that was already nearly perfect.  That was mistake number one.  Mistake number two was devoting a good portion of the film to Liv Tyler, for reasons unkown to me, since nowhere does her character appear in the book.  Other gripes: Turning the land of Rohan into a shanty hippie commune. Then feeling the need to show some hippie kids fleeing, in order to stir up some sympathy in the audience, is my only guess.  Suddenly finding myself in the middle wondering if the movie had stopped, and I was now watching a New Age music video (see Liv Tyler above), Enya, Enigma, something like that.  Half expecting Gandalf to turn into Max Von Sydow when King Theoden is ""possessed"" by Saruman, and begin bellowing, ""The power of Christ compels you!""  Aragorn dying, to be healed by Arwen (more Liv Tyler), and then awakened when the horsey starts kissing him.  Then there's the time that... Ugh!  I give up!  It's a shame too, because I've really liked Peter Jackson's work before this.   I just can't fathom his need to turn Tolkien's work into his own.  Sheesh, even Kubrick wasn't this bad!"

Well done to the special effects crew. The story developed with some interesting revelations along the way and all in all I was satisfied with another chapter of the trilogy.8/10"

chot,"Apr 5, 2004",8/10,"I would give the film a 8.5/10 but it comes with a warning of advice.  For people that have not read the book the viewing can be a very challenging task that demands careful attention and repeated viewings.  I personally found it hard to remember the characters names, the places, and even to figure out which hobbit is which, or even which wizard is which.  I also found it hard to understand the thick ""Middle Earth"" accent.  Why does everyone's name sound the same? Sadly, I don't think that this movie can be enjoyed if you were just a casual fan who saw the first film a year ago.  In order to fully understand this film, it is necessary to watch perhaps 2 or 3 times or with the captions on, and have a ring guru nearby so you can ask lots of questions.  ""Who's that? What did he just say?""  There is simply too much going on for our ADD/ADHD society to engulf, or even me and I consider myself an intelligent college educated person. However, after working really hard, I eventually did understand and appreciate this as a spectacular film and story.  I just don't think it classifies so much as a movie - it really is in its own category.  A movie you should be able to go to without knowing anything about it, sit down and let the movie take you to its world and let you leave 2- 2.5 hours later with some token impact.  A movie should be able to give you all you need such that you can take whatever you need from it in one sitting.  The ring ""films"" don't do that with me.  That is my caution."
Elvis-Del-Valle,"Nov 1, 2025",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings got off to a very satisfying start with The Fellowship of the Ring, and now with The Two Towers we were able to delve even deeper into this epic adventure that Peter Jackson brought to the big screen. Adapting the second volume of the original novel, this sequel offers a more in-depth development of the characters' journey. The film is composed of three narrative threads that explore the situations the characters face after being separated. One detail that was already anticipated in the previous installment is that when adapting the novel, some situations were rearranged. Boromir's death, the fight against the Uruk-hai, and Frodo and Sam's departure are what kick off the second volume of the novel. These events were used to conclude the previous film and serve as a direct lead-in to this sequel. With the characters' separation, the three narratives that make up the film begin. The first focuses on Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli in their quest to rescue Merry and Pippin, but the mission changes dramatically when they reunite with Gandalf. Now their mission is to protect the kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's tyranny, as he seeks to spread Sauron's conquest throughout Middle-earth. Here, the three protagonists are explored in greater depth as characters. Aragorn still bears the weight of his ancestor's ill repute, and his love for Arwen is what motivates him to fight. He thinks about her a lot, even tho he knows they can't be together because Arwen has a longer lifespan than Aragorn. Not to mention that Elrond reminds his daughter that she has a place to go far from the mortal world. Since Aragorn and Arwen share an impossible love, it adds a more tragic touch to the character's story. Although Elrond has limited screen time, he remains a relevant character in the story. The previous film implied that his distrust of men stemmed from Isildur's poor decision, but here he's given the opportunity to regain faith in men by honoring the pact they made in the past. Legolas and Gimli are companions who differ in their races. In Tolkien's world, dwarves and elves have differences that make their relationship difficult, but Legolas and Gimli have good chemistry that allows them to develop a friendship. Gimli was already beginning to show sympathy for the elves after meeting Galadriel, and although he acts competitively with Legolas, deep down he knows he's a good companion. Even in the first film, Gimli was already showing himself to be the comic relief, bringing humor and grace to the most intense moments. The way Gimli and Legolas get along shows that they make a good pair. This narrative thread gives Saruman much greater importance as an antagonist, and you can appreciate the weight he carries as the main villain. Christopher Lee delivers a strong antagonistic performance that hadn't been seen since his portrayal of Dracula in the Hammer Productions films. Another icon linked to the horror genre that could be admired in this film is Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue, and with this character he conveys the same manipulative perversity that the actor had applied to Chucky's voice. Also in this film, the characters Théoden and his niece Éowyn are introduced, and they will become more prominent in the final movie. So far, Théoden is a king who has no interest in fighting for fear that no one in his kingdom will survive, and he doesn't summon the courage to act until the moment of truth arrives. The second narrative thread further develops the time Merry and Pippin spent with Treebeard. Here, Merry and Pippin play a more important role by trying to convince the Ents to fight. Although in the novel it happens quickly, in the film it takes longer to build tension and develop the relationship the hobbits forge with the Ent. The third narrative thread, focused on Frodo and Sam's journey, finally introduces one of the saga's most striking characters. This time it's Gollum who suffers from an internal conflict due to his dual personality. This character was portrayed quite well from the book to the film. Its design has that grotesque touch of the creatures Peter Jackson brought to life in Bad Taste and Braindead. His dual personality makes him a character equivalent to Jekyll and Hyde. Gollum is the malevolent, ambitious personality that emerged from the ring's corruption. This side is what drives the character to try to seize the ring. His good side is his former identity, which was once known as Smeagol. Something Frodo appeals to quite often, on the condition that the creature can redeem itself. For a moment, this creature does seem to show redemption and that this time it can help the hobbits. But that doesn't last long because of Sam's distrust and when the encounter with Faramir arrives. Although it seems that Faramir is introduced as yet another potential enemy, this character has a family history that makes him important to the final chapter. One difference from the novel is that here Faramir is shown to be more tempted by the Ring, to the point of wanting to hand it over to his father. In the novel, it's not like that because Faramir is more humble and recognizes the evil inherent in the object. It's noticeable that this movie didn't make many changes to the story told in the novel. The changes made here were to make the movie more intense. It just leaves out the final events of the second volume, such as the journey to Mynas Tirith and the fight against Shelob. These events conclude the second volume of the novel, and it was decided to carry them over into the third film to serve as a direct connection. That proves how challenging it has been to adapt the entire novel into the film trilogy. Like the previous film, The Two Towers adapts the second part of the novel quite well. Something curious is that this was originally intended to be the final film in the saga. At least that's what producer Harvey Weinstein wanted, due to the production costs. But Robert Shaye, the producer responsible for the Freddy Krueger saga, was the one who declared that three films had to be made in order to adapt the entire novel. It was a wise decision because if this had been the final film, it probably would have suffered the same fate as the animated adaptation Ralph Bakshi made in 1978. Like the previous film, The Two Towers manages to be very satisfying in the way it continues to explore this fantasy world. The only difference is that there's more narrative weight, with three narrative threads that develop the characters' relationships and points of connection. Both the production, the special effects, and the soundtrack remain enriching. Since the quality of these elements is exactly the same as in the first film, it clearly shows that Peter Jackson treated everything as if it were a single movie. A gamble too big by production company standards. By this point, Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings had proven to be a revolutionary fantasy film, and when this sequel was released, another iconic fantasy saga-Harry Potter-was already underway. So The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is undoubtedly another worthy adaptation and an epic film that continues to maintain the anticipation of the previous installment. My final rating for this movie is 10/10."
SeyedYasinHosseini,"Dec 16, 2020",10/10,"Starting with a general idea about The Lord of the Rings, I should mention, predictably that the film cannot reach the book's level. The book has much more details and it can be even more attractive. However we all know it is impossible to bring too much information of the book just in a trilogy; therefore Peter Jackson, the director, did his best. Perhaps this issue would solve if a Tv-show had been created instead of a trilogy.
Anyway, many people believe that just two or three great and epic scenes make the movie memorable and this is the factor that the two towers does. In my opinion the 2nd part of this trilogy is the best one. Certainly this film is great In terms of technical things like filming, music, special effects, acting and so on. Apart from these, what really I noticed and enjoyed were the dialogues; very beautiful and impressive and also full of metaphors. At the beginning of the movie, Saruman has a sinister speech about ruling the world by a new order. ""The old world will be burned in the fires of industry,"" says Saruman. I was shocked as soon as I heard these words. By the way, this speech is a good one to just have some fun moments and let our mind have some Conspiracy theory.
In this episode, existence of poor Gollum, who is seriously involved with his two characters, adds to the attractiveness of the film. Gollum was cursed by spirit of lasciviousness. Furthermore, he was defeated by his own carnality.
On the other side, Frodo tries not to be cursed by the ring because he does not want the Gollum's fate for himself. So he has an odyssey in order to destroy the ring. Sam, a friend of Frodo who is accompanying Frodo in that odyssey, has a strong will and personality. Despite hydra-headed problems in their path, Sam always helps his friend.
Another thing which I noticed is about Ents and walking trees. They were victims. The gloomy point is that the situation in the real world is not better than the film at all; even in some particular cases, it could be worse. For instance, considering that problem about cutting down trees in the film, believe it or not, I would say in the reality is much more worse than the film. Statistically we cut down over 15 billion trees each year in reality, trees moan louder and they are much angrier. Trust me.
Anyway, there is an epic war in this film, called battle of Helm's Deep, which is designed beautifully and professionally. Among all these we have Merry and Pippin who create some fun moments. Actually they do not let the film be saturnine. There are plenty of things in this trilogy and I absolutely recommend that to everyone."
ann7,"Nov 2, 2003",10/10,"This movie was even better then The Fellowship Of The Ring! When I saw it for the first time I was completely filled with enthusiasm! Those 2 hours and a half went by in just a second. Of course I had to see it again and again. I can't wait to see the Return Of The King. Although I already know how it ends, because I've read the book I am still looking forward to see it. So as far as I'm concerned this is the best movie ever!"
educallejero,"May 10, 2020",10/10,"Because this one was built on the foundations of the first one. And it used that advantage to show all the epicism of the Tolkien story. A non-stop story (with the only exception being a sequence to reinforce Aragorn's love story). The scenes either advanced the plot at a brisk pace or were action sequences (that also advanced the plot in one way or another). There's not a lot of character development and that's not a fault. The story and characters remain PG, therefore complexity and nuance storytelling aren't the focus (there is a tiny bit more of light politics with the realms and their conflicts though).Another great thing is that stop abusing the same resources (slow motion with no music and echo voices) in the ""heart fealted moments"", either because there aren't as many or because the editing changed. There is a fair amount for a 3 hour Epic, but not more than necessary, like in the first one.Last thing that makes this movie perfect is, of course, the larger role played by Gollum's Andy Serkis, which steals every second he's onscreen. The rest of the acting is equally good than in the first movie, with a special mention for the great David Wenham (Faramir), replacing the great Sean Bean (Boromir)"
ForeNikeGolf,"Dec 18, 2002",7/10,"I enjoyed this movie.  However, I feel the comic relief in this film was in bad taste.  During, the epic Helms battle sequence the joking between Gimli, Aragorn, and Legolas is totally uncalled for and took away from the drama of the moment.  The tree special effects were not very good at all, but in contrast the Smigel CGI was astounding.  I felt Samwise Gamgee was a little too smart in this film in comparison to where he was when Fellowship left off.  Overall, I gave this movie a seven.  I highly recommend seeing this film, but don't expect too much.  Peter Jackson appeared to think that it would be too much drama for viewers to handle so he softened it up.  Not sure if Tolkien would be as pleased with this one as with Fellowship."
grrrr97,"Dec 18, 2002",1/10,"This film isn't just missing small parts of the story; it's missing five plus chapters!!!The Fellowship of the Ring pleased me in that apart from small pieces it stayed, true to the original book. It was, I thought badly directed. I say this because I believe Jackson is at heart a producer. His organizational skills are amazing that at least is evident from the sheer amount of info LOTR holds within its pages. But he has no visual imagination whatsoever. Fellowship and The Two Towers are badly shot and badly edited. To put it in short I think Jackson is a second rate director who only got these films through blind enthusiasm, rather than ethical ability or quality of work.The two Towers is an insult to everything Tolkien wrote, Peter Jackson for some unexplained reason has gone from following the book of FOTR pretty well to just doing what he wants in TTT. The first half of the film is more or less true to the book and I was enjoying it. Gollum especially, but about half way through just after King Theoden and his people left for Helms deep in anticipation of the attack of Sarumans army, THE STORY WENT OFF THE RAILS LIKE A SPEEDING TRAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! With Aragorn falling over the cliff after the fight with the Wolf riding Orcs (WHICH WASN'T IN THE BOOK) as if that wasn't laughable enough, then the plot goes off into a dreamland about Aragorn and Aowhen's (sorry if her names wrong:) love affair and the choices they must make for the greater good. Well nice try in giving the story more depth BUT STICK TO THE BOOK!!!!!!I don't know about any of you but I went to see J.R.R Tolkiens The Lord of The Rings, not Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings. Ok it's still an adaptation, but FOTR was more or less the same as the book, why ON EARTH insult Tolkein's fans and Tolkien himself by taking one of the greatest works of fiction ever and changing it in any way you want. I think it was an attempt to fool everyone who haven't got the sense to read the books and make more cash on the side.THERE'RE AT LEAST FIVE CHAPTERS MISSING AT THE END OF THIS FILM. Now the people who I was chatting to today about it said well you cant have it all in the film it would be about 9 hours long. GRRRRRR! I said the annoying thing is if Jackson had left out all the rubbish he made up and put in the parts of the story, which should be there, YOU COULD HAVE FITTED IT ALL IN. I am of course referring to Shelob the great spider, which bites Frodo and then Sam takes on the Ring himself and the bookends on a cliff-hanger. He's chucked that out and put it in the next film, The Return of the King, which is already the longest book anyway, without putting huge chunks of story in from the other films.If you ask me Jackson has quiet literally lost the plot and in some style, instead of creating a realistic and accurate film on Tolkein's book he's done what he wants with it and I'm sorry but I think he should be slapped for even having the nerve!!!!!The only people who will totally enjoy this film are the ones who haven't read the books AND SADLY THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM.BUT I'M DREADING WHAT HE'S GONNA CUT OUT AND EVEN MORE SO WHAT HE INVENTS TO STUFF INTO THE NEXT ONE....A YEAR OF DREAD IS AHEAD"
buckeyes-05926,"Apr 19, 2024",10/10,"While some will say Return of the King is the best fantasy movie. It really should be The Two Towers. A perfect movie from start to finish. The miracle is that 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is better: tighter, smarter, funnier. Towers, while not quite so varied as Fellowship in its moods and settings, has a grave gusto that energizes every moment which makes it the thrilling work of film craft The Two Towers moves faster, covers more ground, has more action and with the introduction of the marvelous character Gollum is able to packs some much-appreciated laughs. This second installment is heavy on battle sequences, which make it that more thrilling."
casublegore6,"Oct 12, 2025",10/10,"The Two Towers takes the trilogy to an entirely new level - darker, more intense, and even more epic than the first film. The stakes are higher, the journey is more dangerous, and Middle-earth feels bigger and more alive than ever. Aragorn's heroic journey continues, and the bravery, loyalty, and friendship of the characters really shine. Frodo and Sam's struggle with Gollum adds incredible tension and depth, showing the growing weight of the Ring.The Battle of Helm's Deep is absolutely phenomenal - cinematic perfection. The tension, strategy, and sheer scale of the battle are breathtaking, making it feel like you're truly part of the fight. From Legolas' perfect aim and superhuman agility, Gimli's comic relief, to the courage of the defenders of Rohan, every moment is unforgettable.The landscapes of Rohan, Fangorn Forest, and beyond are stunning, immersing you completely in Tolkien's world. The film balances humor, serious moments, and epic action perfectly, and the Extended Edition adds extra scenes that make the story even richer. Every fantasy lover will be absolutely captivated by this masterpiece.If I could only ever pick one trilogy to watch for the rest of my life, it would be The Lord of the Rings trilogy."
filipemanuelneto,"Mar 31, 2016",10/10,"This is the continuation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, based on the epic novel that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote after his passage through the trenches in First World War. This film was shot by the same cast and crew of the first, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", a strategy that has given a great cohesion to the entire trilogy. In this film, the plot thickens with the division of the Fellowship: Frodo and Sam desperately trying to get to Mordor while the men, grouped around the kingdom of Rohan, begin the war against the orc's and uruk's of Sauron and Saruman. The climax of the film, the battle of Helm's Deep, is probably one of the most tense and epic battle scenes in history of contemporary cinema. From this point of view, this film surpasses in adrenaline the first of the saga. For the action scenes, the expertise of digital computerization was key. Proof of this is the character Gollum, a completely digital creation that received the voice of Andy Serkis, or Treebeard, who has the voice of John Rhys-Davies (actor who also plays Gimli).This film helped to increase the interest of the audience for the trilogy that until then, and despite the success of the first film, had gone unnoticed for many. In fact, if we think rightly, the trilogy has even popularize Tolkien, an English writer who, until then, was an illustrious unknown to almost all those who weren't English or don't speak English as their mother tongue. Suddenly, not only everyone spoke of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and Tolkien, as well as the novels it had to be translated into new languages ​​and were the subject of an important and positive revaluation.Epic in the true word of the term, this film, and the whole trilogy, learned once again become popular this genre of cinema, that now became more affordable for studios thanks to the computerization. In fact, make an epic film in the old fashioned way, with hundreds of participants, large and elaborate scenarios etc. it's extremely expensive, more than resorting to the modern digital techniques."
carmelolia,"Mar 7, 2025",10/10,"There are so many reviews and critical analysis already written about Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's epic literary masterpiece that adding my own feels almost redundant.However, I want to contribute my own few words of appreciation. Because how couldn't I? Jackson's trilogy has left such a marked impression on my life, such a lasting influence, that I am still obsessed to this day after the first time I have watched it at the cinema with my family more than two decades ago. The Tolkien purist might argue there are certain mistakes. But there is no arguing against the sheer quality, the sheer magnitude of the jaw-droppingly awesome cinematic and epic mastery of this trilogy, of which 'The Two Towers' is no exception to.From the siege of Helm's deep, which I still consider to be one of the best 'war' scenes of all time, to the brilliant portrayal of Rohan and its king, Théoden (masterfully portrayed by Bernard Hill ), everything about 'The Two Towers' is outstanding.They do not make these sort of cinematic masterpieces any more, not just in the genre of fantasy, but in film in general."
mgruebel,"Jan 18, 2014",8/10,"Is this the first time Hollywood trusted a director to just make a 9+ hour movie and serve it up in three slices (not sequels)? I think so. It was a good call by New Line, especially considering that the director of ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""Dead Alive"" did not exactly have mega-credentials.When I first read the book many decades ago, I learnt Feanorian script and basic Sindarin. I have read it many times since. So my expectations were high when I sat down for the film. In part 2, I must say I was mesmerized from Gandalf's aerial battle with the Balrog to Smeagol reverting to Gollum on the way to Mordor. I forgive the liberties Jackson took with Faramir manhandling Smeagol, as it does provide a reason for Gollum's re-emergence.The full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (Tom Bombadil) to transpositions (Warg attack on Rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the Fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (Sam being sent back home by Frodo in act 3). It merges and deletes characters (Arwen and her brother, Eomer and Erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc Sharku, a play on Saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). Many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, Arwen in film 2 showing up in Aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at Helm's Deep). Only rarely does it have plot holes (like Frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at Sam in Osgiliath, when they are prisoners of Faramir who surely removed all their weapons). Perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like Treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that Saruman has killed his trees; or Faramir originally taking the ring towards Minas Tirith to echo his weaker brother).There is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision: Why did Jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of King Elessar, and let Saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? Then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the Shire. Anticlimax, you say? I bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because LOTR mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. And it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in Return of the King. After seeing the income stream from 1-3, New Line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. As a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing The Hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of Tolkien's earlier book.All of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in Sam's ""By all rights we shouldn't even be here (Osgiliath)"" - and soon they weren't. It is visually a masterpiece. Many have remarked that Jackson has finally trumped Kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and I grudgingly admit it's true (although I still like RAN better than LOTR; it's one of a few films I give a ""10""). Jackson forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. The level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. So much work for a few seconds of screen time! The film is complex and textured, a classic like Gone with the Wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale.In the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because I had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like. Even the young Frodo worked for me in the end: who knows what a 50 year old hobbit looks like in a world where Dunedain can still reach 100s of years of age?With all its flaws, this mammoth film is great cinema, and deserves its Oscars and other accolades. It will be a long time before this story is remade."
Bernie4444,"Mar 17, 2024",10/10,"This story picks up where ""Fellowship of the Ring"", left off. The fellowship divided in its direction and even though the immediate purposes diverge and converge the urgency of getting the ring to Mordor is ever-present. We are lucky in the fact that J. R. R. Tolkien will completely follow each participant's path from beginning to end. All the wars are covered in detail and the progress of the ring bearer is chronicled. New creatures and old vermin reveal themselves.As with the Ramayana, we find that every creature has his/her function and that there is no black and white in this purpose. Frodo (Elijah Wood) alludes to this when he thinks of Gandalf, Aragorn, and Gollum. Even Gandalf tells not to hurt Gollum as he may play a larger role in the story than one could imagine.Now let us continue the tale and see where it leads us."
calinchiriac,"Feb 17, 2019",9/10,"Understandably darker and heavier than 'The Fellowship of The Ring' while being absolutely unforgiving to its already scarred characters, 'The Two Towers' feeds off its predecessor's pure energy and glee to widen the scope of the story and drain every last piece of hope that was built. Flawless in its structure, the second installment in the Lord of the Rings saga manages, in the first 120 minutes, to wisely, although sometimes clumsily, blend multiple storylines within the same quest, only to reach its culminating point in the last hour - an event so grand and so massively epic in scale that it left me astonished, a cinematic accomplishment in the likes of few others, the very epitomy of what fantasy and adventure films should eternally strive for: the Battle of Helm's Deep. In this day and age defined by the dullness of sequels, 'The Two Towers' has a purpose, a meaning, a pulse that never stops growing through the few ups and countless downs of Frodo and Sam, of Aragorn - of Middle Earth."

Bon_Jovi_chick,"Dec 19, 2002",10/10,"When I first saw the first lord of the rings film in the cinema at Easter I loved it and said I have to go and see the second one. Before seeing the second one I had my doubts, thinking it might be dull (it could be that I was used to the first one)Ive seen THE TWO TOWERS and I just have to say WOW!!! This is 10 times better than the fellowship of the ring. The first one was all talk and little action. This one is all action and little talk.The fellowship is broke- Sam and Frodo on their way to Mondor, meeting Gollum on the way who is fighting his poisoned mind (Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde thing going on with him.) Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf and Gimli meet up with a kingdom of men who are about to be attacked by Saruman. Merry and Pippin have been captured and spend their time im a forest full of moving trees. Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves.This film is far more mature than the first film. You learn more about the creature Gollum and you get to like him and feel sorry for him. The ring is consuming Frodo by the second and god knows where he would be without Sam. (Andy Serkins should get an Oscar for his role!!) Merry and Pippin are more mature and Pippin shows a bit of intelligence.Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves. Aragorn fears he may not come back to his beloved and you see him having glances at the King's niece.Although the film is dark, there is some light humor, particularly from Gollum and Gimli. You'll be stitches over what Gollum says and does and what Gimli has to put up with- a dwarf in the company of tall men.Overall this deserves far more Oscar recognition that the first one (even though the first one was badly underrated in the Oscars). Prepare for a lot of gore and one cool stunt from Legolas on a shield.10/10!!!!"
christokunz,"Jan 11, 2024",10/10,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe."
rosscinema,"Jan 27, 2003",7/10,"This is definitely a very entertaining film and the special effects are terrific but I don't think its as good a film as the first one. We've come to know the characters already so the film dives right in with the action while the first film took its time setting up the story. I do have one major gripe in this film and its the part of the film with the two hobbits Merry and Pippin and those tree creatures. The film comes to a screeching halt when the scenes shift to that part. The tree creatures talk slow, walk slow and all the scenes with them crawl along like a drunk snail. Another complaint I have is Ian McKellen as Gandolf is hardly in the film at all. And Cate Blanchett has only one scene! The most exciting part of the film is the battle at Helm's Deep of course. These scenes are not only exciting but very impressive looking as far as filmmaking is concerned. This part of the film is really an achievement. Of course during the whole course of this bloody battle the character Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) never gets hurt. So while this is going on Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are off in another direction battling Christopher Lee. So they're really is three stories going on at the same time. Where the first film took its time in its narrative this film plunges head first into action. The two films really are different. This is an extremely well made film and Peter Jackson should be proud but I don't think its a great film. Impressive looking and very entertaining but I'm hoping the third film will be better."
wclinch,"Dec 30, 2002",1/10,"I've taken my last step to Mordor. After sitting through the first movie, I thought I'd give this a try. Boy, am I sorry I did!  Because even though the movie was beautiful to watch -- New Zealand IS lovely -- that was the only thing that was worth looking at. The characters were boring, the dialogue unremarkable, and the plot -- well, what plot? Mostly it consisted of people running from one spot to another, badly in need of showers and shampoo. My concern isn't with what they left out, it's with what they put in! A lot of herky jerky camera shots of impossible to follow battle scenes and boring scenes with boring characters. I spent most of the movie asking my poor husband what time it was. We would've walked out, but  thought the couple we were with wanted to stay, and they thought we wanted to stay, so instead all four of us ended us wasting three hours -- a total of 12 --  and $32.! Don't make the mistake we made. See something -- anything -- else!!!"
baydenpickersgill,"Aug 20, 2020",8/10,"Although this movie is the most flawed of the trilogy, it's still great. My issues with this film mainly consist of having more issues with the writing in this film than the first one and the pacing not nearly being as great. I also don't think the dialogue is as good or as memorable as the first movie.Apart from this, every element of this film is either on par with the first or even better. The CGI is much better in this one and the action and battles are incredible. The makeup, costumes and production design are also even better than the first and add a lot of depth to the environment and characters. This movie is apart of an incredible trilogy and still finds its own way to be an incredible film in its own right."
ejh-60622,"Jan 21, 2021",9/10,"I think I've always seen this as the best one in the trilogy. At least I've seen it the most times. The excitement and tension before the battle at Helm's Deep is one of the most memorable sequences in any film for me. The more I watch these movies I come to the realization that I practically just can't stand the scenes with Frodo, Sam and Gollum though. Their whole storyline from when they part with the fellowship at the end of the first movie is just so boring compared to everything else. Of course it was intriguing the first time, but now I would just give it a 6/10 while the rest of the movie is 9/10."
Bradthehobbit5,"Oct 4, 2024",10/10,"My LOTR re-watch continues. And here comes the freaking good stuff. It is honestly impossible to make me choose a favorite of Two Towers and Return of the King.

But it is so incredibly close that I don't honestly know if I could choose a favorite in good standing. But this is a Two Towers review. And oh my gosh is this movie incredible. Honestly I can't write a long enough review to describe my love for this film. But I can try, here are the best and worst parts (buckle up it's going to be a long one)!POSITIVES:
The entire movie. Pack up, lets go home.OK fine I'll go into more detail. I opened my positives segment of Fellowship with the fact that it was Lord of the Rings. And that's another good start here. Watching, reading, even listening to LOTR is always a 10/10 experience. But especially if that is Two Towers. The setup is gone, so now we can get into the real juicy parts of the story. And oh is that story great! Like I don't even know where to begin. Lets just start with the beginning. Opening with Gandalf falling from his point of view was AWESOME and really h intend at his importance in the story, although most thought him to be dead. The taming of Smeagol is a great scene, that really shows how CRAZY good of an actor Andy Serkis is, and how good Weta is at its job. Trust me we'll get to all of that later. Rohan is beautiful, and the hunting orc scene shows it's beauty and Howard Shore's abilities. Which he has a ton of ability. After having listening to the scores for each of the movies in the trilogy, this has always been my favorite. It gives us the Rohan theme, and also brings back old motifs from the first film. Merry and Pip get a more significant story in this one making them important to the story and not just comic relief. And also Treebeard is awesome. I'm shocked John Reyes Davis has two incredible characters in this series, and they are both completely different. And the tension is stinking good. The entire film has an insane sense of dread, that starts the second the film picks up with the track, ""Foundations of Stone"", which gives me chills everytime I hear it, and steadily gets worse ending with ""Gollum's Song"" which once again is incredibly incredible. Each of the characters are exceptional in this film. They got the setup and some arcs in the previous film, so now that we know them, their arcs truly begin to shine. Frodo's arc is especially heartbreaking, going from someone who has slight bits of hope, and then realizing ""he can't do this Sam"". But surprisingly, Pippin has one of my favorite arcs in this film. He finally understands the stakes, and puts himself in dangers way (because ""the closer you are to danger, the further you are from harm"") to help his friends. And Theoden has an awesome arc. He goes from the, woe is me, ""Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains, like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the West, behind the hills... into Shadow"" into the ""Let this be the hour that we draw swords together, Forth Eorlingas"" epic battle dude. But he wouldn't have been able to do it with Aragorn. I really love Aragorn in this film. He is the ultimate definition of leader. He is willing to die protecting people he doesn't even lead. He is literally the GOAT. But the true GOAT finally steps up and finally fills his GOAT position. That of course is my Samwise. Brotha drops the greatest movie quote of all time in this one. That of course is... PO-TA-TOES, BOIL EM' MASH EM' STICK EM' IN A STEW. I'm just kidding (even if that is my most quoted film quote). But trust me we will get to the quote of which I speak. And I know we talked about actors last time, and there were some great editions in this one. Karl Urban is a great Eomer and Bernard Hill does an amazing job. But easily the best actor in the entire film, is Andy Serkis. Gollum in the 78' film was... a choice. But Serkis brings the Gollum from the books to life. His horrifying voice, mannerism, and the different portrayal between Smeagol and Gollum, all add to his amazing performance. The scene of his 2 different personalities are arguing really shows you how incredible Serkis is. And that was his first time being in a Hollywood production. Brotha started off with a bang. Once again the Cinematography is incredible. All the sweeping and panning shots do a great job to show the true beauty of New Zealand. The addition of Faramir has a lot of great moments (all from the book that go about in different albeit better ways.) But there are 3 major thing I am leaving out. And that is the last hour. I love the last hour of this film SO much. I watch just that portion of the film, at least once every 3 months. And I never get burnt out on it because of how cleverly made it is. The last March of the Ents is an amazing scene. The track ""Isengard Unleashed (or at least that is what Prime Video calls it)"" is one of my favorite tracks in the entire series. It adds so much to the scene in general, and makes it so great. Osgilath is great (for being something Peter just kinda did). The setting is great, and has a depressed feel to it. It was cool to see the Fell Beast, and it makes me an emotional wreck. Frodo holding his sword up to his best friends neck, and his best friend saying, ""don't you know your Sam?"" tears. Every. Single. Time. And finally, the battle of helms deep. It is literally so good, that every other battle in all of cinema is judged off of Helm's Deep. All the building tension in the film culminates to the final duel, and it is incredible. For starters, the building of Helm's Deep is awesome. And the a fight in the rain will always be epic. The orc ladders, crazy warfare, and dwarf and elf banter make this battle what it is. Legoals sliding down the shield, Aragorn throwing Gimili, the final push, ""for death and glory, FOR ROHAN"" is a crazy good sequence. Words do no justice. But they scene that makes this movie, is the Speech of Sam. It is the one ray of hope in the darkness of this movie. That was just a short (I know right) amount of things I love about this film, so go watch it for yourself and get your opinion.NEGATIVES:
Jackson did his own thing in this film. The Tow Towers book is awesome, and there are some things that don't happen. Osgilath is a good example of that. The books area different work of art, and the films are very different in many things. But if I have to find a negative in a movie without any, I'm going back to the source material.Thanks for bearing with me. I have an undying love for LOTR, and this movie is a big reason for that. But if you thought this was long, just wait for the Return of the King review.""It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn't. They kept going because they were holding on to something.What are we holding onto Sam?There is some good in this world Mr. Frodo.And it's worth fighting for!""Namárië!"
Bon_Jovi_chick,"Dec 22, 2002",10/10,"The fellowship is broke- Sam and Frodo on their way to Mondor, meeting Gollum on the way who is fighting his poisoned mind (Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde thing going on with him.) Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf and Gimli meet up with a kingdom of men who are about to be attacked by Saruman. Merry and Pippin have been captured and spend their time im a forest full of moving trees. Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves.This film is far more mature than the first film. You learn more about the creature Gollum and you get to like him and feel sorry for him. The ring is consuming Frodo by the second and god knows where he would be without Sam. (Andy Serkins should get an Oscar for his role!!) Merry and Pippin are more mature and Pippin shows a bit of intelligence.Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves. Aragorn fears he may not come back to his beloved and you see him having glances at the King's niece.Although the film is dark, there is some light humor, particularly from Gollum and Gimli. You'll be stitches over what Gollum says and does and what Gimli has to put up with- a dwarf in the company of tall men.Overall this deserves far more Oscar recognition that the first one (even though the first one was badly underrated in the Oscars). Prepare for a lot of gore and one cool stunt from Legolas on a shield."
richardbooth-45596,"Jul 18, 2021",10/10,Still in 2021 it looks amazing. I know the battle of Helms Deep strays away from the book but honestly it makes it alot more tense and the cinematography is amazing. I wish it went into the lore of the humans fighting for evil and the ents a little more but overall if you love fantasy lore then this film is definitely for you!
ryanh-00630,"Sep 16, 2019",10/10,"A story generally consists of three acts; The first act is the beginning where you introduce your story & its characters. The second act is the middle part where the majority of the plot surfaces & character development takes place. And the third & final act is where you tie up all the loose ends & bring your entire tale to a satisfying conclusion. Before penning down these stories, almost every writer has a very clear conscience of how to begin & end their tales but the most troublesome part for each one of them is always the middle act. Because no matter how great the opening or closing part may be, if this vital act isn't handled well, the overall experience of the entire story will unfortunately amount to nothing. And that's true for whether you are writing a book or a play or a movie.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is that middle act of Peter Jackson's on-screen adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga. And because, just like the novel, The Lord of the Rings is meant to be viewed as a single film edited into three parts of which The Two Towers is the second part, there is no definite beginning or ending to this film. Plus, what's even more challenging this time is the fact that unlike the first film, which had a single plot to focus on, The Two Towers deals with multiple storylines & has to make each one work efficiently in order to accomplish its goal. Nevertheless, the great news is that even though The Two Towers doesn't follow the novel's story as faithfully as The Fellowship of the Ring did, it still succeeds as one rare sequel that improves upon the original and, just like its predecessor, is one of the greatest films of its genre.Picking up right from where The Fellowship of the Ring signed off, The Two Towers tells the aftermath of the breaking of the Fellowship & intercuts three storylines. The first plot line concerns Frodo & Sam, who are continuing their journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring but soon their peril deepens as there is another who hunts the ring. The second plot line deals with Merry & Pippin, who were captured by Uruk-Hai in the last film but manage to escape, meet Treebeard the Ent & help to plan an attack on Isengard, where Saruman is breeding a massive army. The third plot line covers the trio of Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli who, while pursuing the flock of Uruk-Hai that took Merry & Pippin hostage, meet an unexpected ally and then make their way to Rohan where Saruman has King Theoden under his spell while an impending war looms upon those free lands. The title refers to the union between the two towers; Barad-dûr, fortress of the Dark Lord Sauron & Orthanc, stronghold of the wizard Saruman.The direction by Peter Jackson doesn't lose any of its potency for this sequel as The Two Towers manages to live up to all hype & expectations, which was even more this time considering the massive critical & financial success of the first film. And not only it delivers everything it promised but also shows major improvements in almost all filmmaking departments. The three story lines are extremely well written & narrated and enough time is given to develop every single one of its new characters, without interrupting the development arc of any of the reprising cast. Also, the film smoothly switches from one plot to another without confusing its viewers and the decision to conclude this film at a different event from the novel makes sense for it sets a perfect stage for the finale. Narrating multiple stories within the same film is never an easy task but Peter Jackson has done it again & what's even more admirable is that he gave equal importance & value to all three storylines.Coming to the technical aspects, all filmmaking departments get significant upgrades & are more fine-tuned this time. The production design continues to impress as the miniatures used to represent Rohan, Helm's Deep & Osgiliath are meticulously detailed down to the smallest of things, thus making art direction & set decoration a winning aspect, once again. Still, what makes these sets look even more appealing is their ideal fusion with the beautifully photographed landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography immerses the viewers into Middle-Earth just like its predecessor, and the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the film's action sequences. Make-up & Costume Design stay true to the timeline it depicts. Sound feels more authentic this time & is spot-on where it matters most. Editing trims the film down to 179 minutes & although it's very effective in that 3 hours of runtime, I recommend the extended version instead as it adds 45 minutes of new & extended scenes and further develops the film's characters, adds greater depth to its plot & enriches the overall experience of The Two Towers.Weta Digital made history with The Fellowship of the Ring when it brought alive Middle-Earth in breathtaking detail but the enhancements it brings in the visual effects of The Two Towers is even more groundbreaking. Gollum & Treebeard are entirely computer-generated & it was a VFX milestone of its time. But it's the Battle of Helm's Deep where the visuals are at its finest and without this team's creativity & breakthroughs, it wouldn't rank today as one of the greatest screen battles of all time. Another scene where visuals really shine, but doesn't get as much credit as it deserves, is the Flooding of Isengard sequence, which undeniably is one hell of an eye-opener you don't see in cinema very often. Finally, the background score by Howard Shore introduces new tracks for Rohan, Gollum & many more sequences while the music heard in the first chapter further develops & expands into new realms. Splendid where it is meant to be, touching where it needs to be & magnificently pleasing to the viewers' senses, the soundtrack of The Two Towers is an outstanding follow-up to its predecessor and continues to enhance the emotional journey of this exceptional adventure.As far as the performances go, The Two Towers doesn't disappoint in this aspect & adds even more strength to its ensemble cast. The new cast is no let down but another right step in the right direction while the reprising cast continues to evolve with their respective characters. Everyone from Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin to Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli has a stronger sense of their characters in comparison to the last film. However, Ian McKellen, who plays Gandalf, gets a fresh makeover in this film & has a new dimension to explore. Amongst the new cast, making their presence felt are Bernard Hill as Théoden; King of Rohan, Miranda Otto as Éowyn; Théoden's niece, David Wenham as Faramir; Boromir's younger brother, Brad Dourif as Gríma Wormtongue; Saruman's agent at Rohan, Karl Urban as Éomer; Théoden's nephew & John Rhys-Davies as voice of the Treebeard; Leader of the Ents. But the most notable amongst both the new & reprising cast turns out to be none other than Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum / Sméagol. Heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time, Serkis' gives this CGI character its very own soul and delivers such an intense, energetic & show-stealing performance that it's impossible to not love as well as pity this wretched character. Easily the finest performance of the saga, so far.Director Peter Jackson & his crew, in spite of deviating greatly from the film's source material, not only succeed in making the middle part of The Lord of the Rings a smooth continuation of The Fellowship of the Ring but also a worthy expansion & evolution of Middle-Earth. The artistic license taken by Jackson, Walsh & Boyens does alter the overall tone & style of the film but they still manage to keep everything very much within the realms of Tolkien's world & true to its spirits. Also, if one envisions this second chapter as an adaptation of the middle act of Tolkien's complete novel rather than conceiving it as an adaptation of only the second volume, then the writers' decisions start to make much more sense. And honestly, apart from few purists, most won't even mind this tweaking because, in spite of all the modifications, The Two Towers makes up for another successful, spellbinding & engrossing epic that effortlessly blends art & entertainment into a staggering masterpiece. On an overall scale, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is another landmark film of its genre that ably meets & exceeds the genre-defining standards set by its predecessor, breaks many filmmaking barriers of its genre with its revolutionary production and signs off as an extremely satisfying sequel which sets an even higher benchmark for the final chapter of Tolkien's legendarium."
nataraj,"Dec 25, 2002",6/10,"first the good news: a) Gollum/Smeagol is really terrific ! b) Helm's Deep: medieval warfare, very good (wish they had not added the bomb)bad: general: I am very disappointed - not about the omissions (like in the first part there had to be some) but the silly additions (""improvements"" ??? on the story), the Kitsch and Schmalz. Seems like a Hollywood producer came in and said ""oh, there's too little of this, let's put in a little of that...""Gimli: a valiant fighter reduced to a stupid clown.Rohan: a place supposed to be famous for breeding horses - all barren? give me a break!"
Vinny-28,"Sep 2, 2003",1/10,"I just watched the DVD wondering if my impressions would change.  They did. What I thought was bad in the theater is now terrible.  This film is dull and choppy, with horrible dialogue and weak acting from the ""regular"" cast. The plot is nonexistant, most of the fighting CGI average at best, and except for the breakthrough of the Gollum character, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile in this mediocre film.  The high rating here is baffling...until you see that there are millions of people who also think ""Attack of the Clones"" is a good film.  Fans will accept the worst if it has the name Lord of the Rings or Star Wars attached to it.  I thought the first film was weak--but the extended edition on DVD was truly beautiful.  I am holding out hope, but I can't imagine that there is going to be a similar ""extended edition"" save here...because this film is truly awful."
henry-girling,"Jan 6, 2003",9/10,"The Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) was a great film. Far superior to those dull films about a galaxy far away. Expectations were high for the second film in the trilogy and The Two Towers (TTT) almost made it. Perhaps the battle at Helm's Deep went on a touch too long and uncanonical scenes like Aragorn being lost were unneccessary but these are only minor flaws in an engrossing three hours. There was much to praise.Part of the success of TTT depends upon the Gollum as he is now a key character in the story and as other people have said, you forget that the character is a CGI. It is extraordinary. The interplay between Gollum and Frodo and Sam is brilliant, not just physically but emotionally. If Gollum had been another JarJar Binks it would have been disastrous but he is a real character, at war with himself.The acting varies from mock-epic to perfect. Elijah Wood makes Frodo's pain so tangible that you feel every difficult step in his journey. Sean Astin's speech near the end about finding good in the world made my eyes moist. Viggo Mortensen is better in TTT than FOTR. Liv Tyler looks the part. Bernard Hill is Theoden come to life. And Miranda Otto is my kind of shield maiden.The production values are wonderful as ever and if it is eye candy it is of the superior kind. Well done Peter Jackson and team. My only real complaint is that we have to wait another dratted year for the third part."
Ozero_Zaisan,"Mar 25, 2025",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a masterclass in filmmaking and a crucial chapter in Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's iconic trilogy. The film continues the journey of the Fellowship as they battle the forces of evil in Middle-earth, and it is a powerful blend of character-driven storytelling, spectacular action, and groundbreaking special effects. The film's technical achievements, particularly in the area of visual effects, are extraordinary-most notably, Gollum, the CGI character that is both a technological marvel and an emotional anchor in the narrative. The motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis revolutionized the way CGI characters could be integrated into live-action filmmaking, bringing a level of depth and nuance to Gollum that was previously unseen in film.On the visual side, The Two Towers showcases some of the most breathtaking landscapes in cinema, from the vast plains of Rohan to the fortress of Helm's Deep. Jackson's use of practical sets, miniatures, and CGI allows for an immersive experience that makes the world of Middle-earth feel both vast and intimately detailed. The battle of Helm's Deep is a standout sequence, combining epic-scale battle choreography with emotional stakes that elevate it beyond just a spectacle. The sequence is a technical feat in its own right, involving complex CGI work to create the overwhelming forces of Saruman's army, seamlessly integrated with the live-action performances and practical effects to deliver a brutal and thrilling confrontation.From a personal perspective, The Two Towers stands out not just for its technical achievements but for its character development. Frodo and Sam's journey through the wilderness, struggling with the burden of the Ring, is both heartbreaking and compelling. Aragorn's growth as a leader and the strength of his bond with Legolas and Gimli injects a sense of camaraderie and loyalty that drives much of the emotional weight of the film. And, of course, Gollum's descent into madness and his manipulation of Frodo and Sam forms one of the most fascinating character arcs in cinematic history. The film expertly weaves together these personal struggles with large-scale battles and a sense of impending doom, keeping the stakes high and the story engaging.The Two Towers is a remarkable achievement in storytelling and filmmaking that not only builds upon the foundation laid by The Fellowship of the Ring but also deepens the emotional and thematic complexity of the saga. It's a film that blends heart-pounding action with profound moments of introspection and growth, and it sets the stage for the epic conclusion in The Return of the King. Whether you're drawn to its technical mastery or its rich character development, The Two Towers remains an unforgettable cinematic experience."
motrous,"Apr 14, 2021",10/10,"Not a lot to say here. Second part of a masterful trilogy of movies. Amazing story, acting, action, etc. Blew everyone away whenever Gollum entered the scene. Probably saw it six times in the theater."
jay-22797,"Dec 26, 2024",10/10,"LOTR intentionally or unintentionally weakens the existence of magic. Because LOTR aims to convey that even ordinary people can change the course of events, and even the most insignificant character can change the fate of many people. However, the influence of magic on the process of things is gradually diluted in the actors' authentic performances. This is also why in the trilogy, magic only exists as a certain tone to depict the psychological changes of characters, rather than targeting the entity of a certain thing. FOTR's flowing clouds can be called ""road movies"", while TTT is more of a war epic than a magical chapter."
meydiana-65242,"Jul 5, 2022",10/10,"Words can't even begin to describe how in love I am with this next chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one was one of my favorites to watch while growing up and this one also seems to have some of the best laughs that the trilogy has to offer. The characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in Frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. Peter Jackson is a complete genius! Even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to Gandalf after his fall in the mines of Moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for Middle Earth as the One Ring is taken closer to Mordor and Mount Doom, can Frodo and Sam really trust Gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the Fellowship of the Ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the Kingdom of Rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of Boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. If you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and I will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, Legolas still for me and Aragorn still for my sister. Even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever, from Elijah Wood to Sean Aston to Billy Boyd to Ian Mchellen to Orlando Bloom to Viggo Mortenson to Miranda Otto to Bernard Hill to Christopher Lee to Liv Tyler to John Rhys-Davis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with Peter Jackson behind the whole wheel. After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3, can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old I get? No, not one and that is the truth for both me, my sister and our family!!!!!"
H4wke,"Nov 6, 2024",9/10,"My cousin was visiting for the weekend, and he - an avid fantasy fan who somehow hadn't seen Lord of the Rings yet - decided to watch this and Return of the King. Little known fact: to maintain your NZ citizenship you have to have seen all three films (theatrical at the very least) in the last ten years. He seemed to like it a great deal, though commented that it's quite slow at times. It's true, Two Towers does tend to drag a little bit.I think there's an argument to be made that the extended version of this entry is worse than the theatrical release. There's only one scene that I'd definitely keep, the flashback to Osgiliath.A lot of the Ent scenes were too long. Merry and Pippin's added adventures were fun, but not entirely necessary and drag the pacing down too much.Fortunately these are just nitpicks. The main reason Two Towers is the lesser of the three for me is because a hefty portion of its runtime is build up for the incredible final act and its sequel. The film is the most backloaded in the trilogy, with a well edited climax as we see each story thread reach its emotional height.The craftsmanship is still in top form here: practical effects that look amazing to this day and the sound design and score are so diverse and impactful. I think the films' greatest achievement in effects is bringing the most complex character in the trilogy to life. Gollum enters the fray as a tragic mirror to Frodo's plight. Andy Serkis and the animators are to be commended - twenty-one years later the character feels like a natural part of the world.The region of Rohan is the central location of the film, where we meet several new characters including my favourite of the bunch: King Théoden. Bernard Hill brings a nuanced performance to the role, and while his character differs more from the book than most, I loved every scene with him in it. Hill even came up with the saddest and most impactful lines in the film from personal experience.Jackson, Walsh and Boyens again move portions from the book around. The start of Towers was at the end of Fellowship, the end of Two Towers (for Frodo and Sam) is moved to Return. In fact they add a detour which ends up establishing a location for the next film. An interesting decision, to be sure, and one that makes a fair bit of sense.Moving parts of the story around works a treat, as the original novels were supposed to be one book, and were split for publishing purposes. The way these writers reframed the narrative lets each film stand on their own better than the books.So Two Towers does drag a little bit, but the final third (and payoff in Return) justifies most of the slow pacing. It works well as the middle film, and the lesser of three amazing films is no small feat. It's a treat to have one film in a trilogy be this quality. It's a blessing for two. It's almost suspicious for three. Onto the finale."
goofy-28,"Jan 19, 2003",1/10,"OK - since the movie is definately NOT the Two Towers (outside of the same character names and the fact there is a ring involved), the movie really needs to be seen without the Tolkien fanatics with rose-colour glasses. The movie STUNK! The acting was sub-standard (Gandalf 'fighting' with Saruman through Theoden was hysterically bad!). The plot was only loosely put together - actions of characters seem to come from nowhere (Merry standing up to Fangorn, Samwise's preaching, Aragorn's 'issues'). The actions of the characters were just bad, the fighting scenes - although spectacular in vision, were just sadly portrayed (Aragorn and Gimli 'jumping' into the middle of dozens of orcs and not getting scratched, horses ridding into the middle of 10,000 orcs and not one of the orcs seems capable of killing the horses, horses riding into 'swiss pikes' and not getting a scratch?????)on the good side - the cinematography was PHENOMINAL; the CGI is some of the best in movies today (you could barely tell gollum was not real); the orcs siege warfare was historically accurate (the use of ladders with people on them; the breaching of the walls; the use of the rams and it's security - very well done).Overall - movie 1/10; visual and historical 10/10 (but final rating must still be 1/10 - just a poorly done story)."
gamingsockee,"Sep 15, 2025",10/10,"The best. The Lord of the Rings is an absolute masterpiece that blends epic storytelling, rich worldbuilding, and timeless themes of friendship and hope. Every character, from the humble hobbits to the mighty kings, feels alive and essential to the journey. A perfect 10/10-it's not just a story, it's an experience that stays with you forever."
cricketbat,"Feb 4, 2020",10/10,"The Two Towers is worth watching just to see the Battle of Helm's Deep. It is one of the most impressive battle sequences to hit the big screen. But then there's so much more than that-this movie also features amazing special effects with Gollum, dramatic political tension in Rohan, and fantastic moments with the Ents. This is probably my favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy."
clarinets,"Oct 29, 2003",10/10,"The movie is incredible.  The acting is incredible.  The scenery, incredible.  The romance and battle scenes are wonderful, and the gollum/smeagol character is brought more to light in this one.  The last scenes between Sam Gamgee and Frodo moved me to tears.My only regret was that the movie is over 3 hours long.  When it was in theaters I kept trying to find time to see it, but it was on at such weird hours, either requiring me to see it as a matinee or late late late, neither of which I was able to at the time.Go out and get the DVD, you will not regret it.  It's a movie I want to watch over and over again.Like I said in my review for FOTR, this series has inspired me to read the book, and both are very special for their own reasons."
Hondorum,"Jan 23, 2003",10/10,"Leaving you off at the end of the Fellowship of the Ring, it continues will no background of what had happened already. It makes the movie flow better. It also gives you A reason to see the first installment. Out of all the trilogies I have seen, never have I seen the second installment better than the first one. It captures the immense detail of the book. That is why it is so grand. Tolkien's story was put together so that if it is changed, it losses its meaning. The cast and crew realized that, causing then to put in the most minute details. Of course, some things had to be changed. There are some things in books that don't work for movies. The most major mistake, that I find, is the Fact that the movie does not end when then book ends. The line in the book is, ""Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy."" In the movie, it only foreshadows that specific line with the line, ""she will do it."" But, I understand that in movies, time is limited; and time was sparse at the time. If the movie continued, it would cause the audience to become bored. Other than that, no movie has surpassed it- for me anyway. I also find that there are hidden truths behind Lord of the Rings. I find it through my studies of Tolkien. That is what made it special; that is what made it never to be surpassed by any other book. It is a book that has become a movie that will stand for generation as one of the greatest stories of ALL TIME."
belgiumfranz,"Jun 3, 2013",9/10,"The Two Towers is that rare type of movie: a sequel that is better than the original.With the fellowship in splinters, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue on their quest to destroy the ring. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) has his own duties to attend to, and we all mourn Gandalf (Ian McKellen). Peter Jackson's midpoint of the trilogy is even greater than its predecessor and successor. Every shot is impressive; there isn't any adjective that I can use that would do the movie justice.And Gollum? Now there's an intriguing character, my precious. An awe-inspiring, if pitiful, being, he makes you really want to see part 3, just to see what will happen. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is truly one movie that will continue to inspire people for years."

taikman,"Jan 8, 2003",7/10,"In my review of 'The Chamber of Secrets' I mentioned how tough the job of Chris Columbus, director of the Harry Potter movies was. However when it comes to adapting books to film his job looks straightforward compared to Peter Jackson's. Over a thousand pages of novel had to be trimmed and shaped into six hours of film, perhaps two dozen important characters to bring to life, millions of devoted Tolkien fans and also the general filmgoing public to satisfy. I thought he did an amazing job with 'The Fellowship of the Ring', which was, aside from a few overwrought moments, probably as good an adaption as could possibly have been made. Unfortunately I can not say the same for 'The Two Towers'.Oh, it is very good - Jackson again shows what a master he is at staging battle scenes and creating moments of wonder and horror, the special effects and New Zealand scenery are breathtaking and the quality cast again do a good job. But there are moments that are a bit corny and scenes that could have been more tense and exciting than they were.The story consists of three seperate plot lines - Merry and Pippin journey into Fangorn Forest where they meet the Ents, the ancient Shepherds of the Trees, Frodo and Sam head closer to Mordor with Gollum, the twisted former possessor of the One Ring, and the remaining members of the Fellowship fight to save the kingdom of Rohan from the forces of Saruman, who has used magic and a treacherous advisor to enfeeble Theoden, Rohan's king.While it is packed with characters and events, there is not as much in 'The Two Towers' as there was in 'Fellowship', so while it does not have quite the variety of locations events that the first film did, Jackson has been able to create a film that is not as episodic this time (which was inevitable with the theatrical version of 'Fellowship' - see the extended DVD version for a longer, better-paced cut). The three-pronged story is still which was the screenwriters and editors biggest problem, as they had to try and juggle and balance the plots so that the viewer follows what is going on while the movie's momentum is maintained. Generally I think Jackson and company did a fine job but, especially towards the end of the movie, they could have done a better one. The film cuts between the climaxes of all three plots which reduces the power of each of them, especially the epic battle of Helm's Deep. The battle is a huge, superbly choreographed sequence but the tension that it creates gets released too often as we shift to what Sam and Frodo or Merry and Pippin are doing. I think it would have been better to finish Sam and Frodo's story, except for the epilogue with Gollum, which belongs at the end, before cutting between the battle at Helm's Deep and the hobbits' dealings with the Ents.Partly to provide a climax, a lot has been changed from the book. Many things that were in 'The Two Towers' will now be in the third movie (which makes me wonder how they will fit everything into 'The Return of the King') and a few things have been added. Some of the additions, such as the battle with the warg-riders and the Black Rider's sweep over the Dead Marshes, are very good. Others, such as Aragorn's near-death experience and his triumphant return, the slow-motion fall of Haldir and the reunion of a mother with her children are cliched. The screenplay is a flawed one: it does not always explain what is going on adequately and there are a disappointing number of melodramatic moments. I could have done with less shots of frightened women and children, less inspirational speeches, less beams of shining light and, though he was funny, less of Gimli the dwarf as comic relief. Sometimes, as at Helm's Deep, the atmosphere should be grim and frightening and a joke spoils the mood. As do a few cute, anachronistic moments such as when Legolas skates down stairs on a shield or when Sam talks about what it would be like to be a character in a great story. 'The Lord of the Rings' is not supposed to be postmodern - such moments just take you out of the alternative world that the movie is trying to create by reminding you that it is a movie.But while it is not up to the very high standard of 'Fellowship', 'The Two Towers' is still a quality movie: spectacular, sometimes stirring and gorgious to look at and listen to. There is one other thing that would make it worth seeing: Gollum. The first CGI character to actually act well, Gollum, with his split personality, creepy voice and pale, veiny, superbly rendered body, is fascinating to watch. All his scenes are among the movie's best. If 'The Two Towers' does get an Oscar nomination for acting Andy Serkis, who did the voice and the movements that Gollum was based on, will probably be the one. I suspect though that this won't be the year that Peter Jackson gets to go up for Best Director or Best Film. Oh well, there's still 'The Return of the King.'7 1/2 / 10"
ali2412,"Aug 18, 2003",1/10,"This movie was a travesty!  Anyone who voted above a 4 for this movie ought to peel their eyes away from the TV, become literate, pick up a book (yes, the square things with pages), and READ IT!!!  Whereas ""The Fellowship of the Rings"" held almost as true to the book as it could have, ""The Two Towers"" was nothing at all like the book!!  I don't understand how Peter Jackson can consider himself a fan of the books and still put his name with this awful movie.  He has profaned everything he claims to stand for!  I feel very sorry for Tolkien and know that he is rolling over in his grave because his name is connected with this atrocity!"
cragsby_kellogs,"May 7, 2005",10/10,"In my view the two towers will go down as my second favourite film of all time behind (obviously) LOTR: Return of the King. The film proved to be a much better film than the fellowship of the ring mainly because of two things. Helm's Deep and Gollum.Helm's Deep proved to be the most exciting siege film since The Alamo. 10,000 urik-hai against a small guard of farmers, old men and stable boys proved to be like David against three Goliaths. At the end of the battle mass audiences were stunned to witness a battle sequence as stunning as Braveheart in the part where Gandalf rides down the steep mountain with the Rohirrum as they attack the Urik-Hai to win the battle.This film had a bit of funny moments such as Gimli telling Legolas that he could have picked a better spot to see the mass army. Plus the same two characters counting how many Urik-Hai they were killing during the epic battle scene.New characters in The Two Towers included Miranda Otto (from War of the Worlds) playing Aragorn's secret love interest, Bernard Hill (Titanic) playing King Theardon and David Wenham (Van Helsing) playing Boromir's brother Faramir.But the new character who led well was the CGI character Gollum who joined Frodo and Sam on their quest to destroy the one ring. His mutters of 'my precious' had giving cinema a new movie line to join others.Also impressive where the tree ents who helped hobbits Merry and Pippin to destroy Isengaard with an exciting action sequence.Overall I preferred this film to Fellowship of the Ring and would say that it is my favourite 'second film' to a trilogy! Awesome!"
sandraliana,"Dec 8, 2002",10/10,"I cannot believe how phenomenal the movie was, and I cannot wait for the opportunity to see ""The Two Towers"" again!!!! Viggo Mortensen really transformed into a superstar in front of the audiences' eyes. This is truly his movie, just like Elijah Wood was the focal point of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Go see it now!!"
rachaelitch,"May 16, 2023",10/10,"The soundtrack of this movie is my favorite out of the three. It is so epic and makes me want to ride into battle majestically on some white steed.For a lot of people, this is their least favorite movie out of the three as well. And I can see why if you are only watching it for the battle scenes. But if you are here for the character development then you LOVE this movie.You see so many great things with all the characters in this movie. You begin to know them more personally and you care for them. It makes watching the rest of the movies so fun when you feel like you actually understand the motives and reasons why behind a lot of the characters.And also I mean.... Aaragorn's door-opening scene is iconic, and it is the reason I will forever have way to high and unreachable standards when it comes to men."
ivanmessimilos,"Aug 5, 2025",10/10,"If the first part brought excellent foundations, story and characters, the sequel has upgraded all of that with spectacle. Some new characters arrive, we have relationships between them, and everyone carries their own burden. The initial group has broken into three parts. The stakes are raised and it is felt in the atmosphere. The entire film in a way prepares us for the incredible battle of Helm's Deep, which is definitely one of the best ever filmed. From the almost abnormal duration, the amount of people who participated in it, the roles we feel in the film and in this case we fear for the outcome of our heroes.This film also looks flawless visually, from the appearance of Gollum to the climax of the aforementioned battle. Many memorable scenes I even noticed how much humor there is, only it is often subtle and not always big, loud and not shoved in our faces like in most recent films.But this film also stopped just before the exciting ending, so the viewer has to be patient a little longer to wait for the end of this huge film trilogy."
xTkAx,"Apr 3, 2024",10/10,"If you have not yet seen The Hobbit trilogy and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, then you should stop immediately and go watch those films in order. For the ultimate viewing experience, it is highly recommended to view the extended version of this film for the greatest effect.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers seamlessly continues the epic journey that began in the first film. Frodo and Sam enlist Gollum's help in their quest to reach Mordor, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue their captured hobbit friends.As Sauron's forces grow stronger in Mordor with wraiths ever seeking the ring of power, Saruman's army is unleashed on Rohan in an attempt to wipe out the race of men. This leads to an intense and gripping final encounter at Helm's Deep.."
mikkiparker,"Mar 15, 2023",8/10,"I recently watched the extended version of Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers and despite some moments where the pace seemed to drag on, I have to admit that the film itself is incredibly entertaining. The depth and complexity of the story, combined with the stunning visuals and epic action sequences, make it a truly engrossing viewing experience.One of the things that impressed me most about the film was the attention to detail in the world-building. From the intricacies of the different cultures and languages to the intricate designs of the weapons and armor, every aspect of Middle-earth feels fully realized and immersive. The use of practical effects and CGI is seamless, creating a visual feast for the eyes.Overall, I loved the film - the whole trilogy is a feast for the eyes. The dialogue, character developments are top tier."
foregolfingfan,"Oct 16, 2022",8/10,"Frodo and Sam are on their own and heading to Mordor with the sinister Sméagol who has promised to guide them through the mountains, Merry and Pippin are in the hands of Saruman's Orcs as they return to Isengard and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit until they are diverted into helping King Theoden of Rohan.The film switches between the three groups so we never get chance to forget what the characters are doing. I think this is the only film that I've seen where the narrative follows different groups who never meet each other. The action is even more spectacular then the previous film, the storming of Helm's Deep is one of the most spectacular scenes that I've ever seen, also amazing are the realism of Sméagol, the CGI creature based on the movements of Andy Serkis and the Ents, huge creatures that look like walking trees.The actors did a great job, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo as he approached Mordor you could almost feel the increasing weight of the ring hanging from his neck. The cast of characters here is quite a lot larger than the previous film giving us some great new characters, the most obvious is Sméagol who was only glimpsed before but there is also the wonderfully vile Grima Wormtongue and Eowyn, King Theoden's niece who is smitten with Aragorn.If you haven't seen any of the Lord of the Rings films I strongly recommend this but only after watching The Fellowship of the Ring, if you don't watch that it will be hard to understand what happens here."
catherinemcmanus,"Dec 20, 2002",7/10,"I went to see this with great expectations. It was like going to see Phantom Menace; I really, really wanted it to be great.But, no, sorry, it really, really wasn't. At the start it goes straight into the action, no preamble, no 'setting the scene', I dont even remember there being any credits. Then it was very episodic. No acting, no characterisation to speak of. The scenes were short, not much interaction between the characters. Just loads and loads of orcs every where.The best thing in it is Sam Gamgee."
milanzman,"Dec 18, 2002",10/10,"In a paragraph I'll describe it as a fun movie to watch at any time of the year. It dominates visual design and roars to the Oscars (hopefully). Its Intro was a bit tasteless due to the fact that people who have not read or seen part 1 will go through great difficulty to understand part 2 without having seen part 1. But, nevertheless entertaining. I also think that the acting was superb. BRAVO!!!"

The characters are really amazing the dwarf was and still is my favorite !

rebeljenn,"Jan 18, 2006",10/10,"One of the most beautiful films of all time, 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is much more coherent and action-packed than the previous film in the trilogy. The action gets under way here, and the characters are separated and overcoming their own problems and battles as the time draws nearer when Frodo must succeed in accomplishing the huge task that he has been assigned. Along the way, friendships grow and more evolve in the most unlikely places. There is plenty of humor, sadness, action, and fantasy in this film. Like 'Fellowship of the Ring', 'The Two Towers' uses the beautiful scenery to convey the burdens of the journey and the beauty that there is in the world gradually succumbing to the evil wizard. This film has a lot going for it that makes it succeed on so many levels."
ronakkotian,"Jul 30, 2020",10/10,"Out of all of the LOTR films, this one is definitely the weakest but it still holds up as an amazing continuation from where the first film left off.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues the story with Frodo and Sam getting closer to Mordor with the aid of Gollum whilst the rest of the Fellowship go up against Saruman and his army.The Two Towers really steps it up from The Fellowship of the Ring in terms of scale. Once again, this film looks absolutely stunning. Peter Jackson's direction is terrific. So many gorgeous shots conveying the beauty of Middle-earth and constantly reminding you how epic it is. I view The Two Towers as more of a build up film. It sets a lot of things in motion for the events that will take place in the third film. Due to that, the film does feel slower than the first but not a single minute feels wasted. It is three hours long but Jackson manages to keep the viewer engaged throughout it with the characters and scale of the world.A lovely addition to this film is Gollum, who we got a glimpse of in the first film. The motion capture work on Gollum is really well done and Andy Serkis's performance helps the viewer feel connected to him. By far the best part of The Two Towers is the ending. The battle at the end is simply breathtaking. It's shot beautifully and the sheer scope of it all makes it one of the best battles in film history. Hats off to the special effects team. They worked extremely hard and it all paid off in the end.The performances are great all around. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortenson and the rest of the cast from the previous film all did well. The new additions like Bernard Hill and Brad Douris played their roles exceptionally well and contributed a lot to this film.I like The Fellowship of the Ring better but The Two Towers continued the LOTR story brilliantly. Peter Jackson did complete justice here and delivered to us one of the best battle sequences to ever exist."
dfranzen70,"Dec 19, 2002",8/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Starring: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Viggo Mortensen, Brad Dourif, Sean Astin Rating: PG-13 Runtime: 2:59There are two types of people who will watch this movie: Those who read the books and wand to see the visions brought to life, and those who saw the first movie in the trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring) but haven't read the books (and perhaps don't plan to do so).The latter group will be more receptive to The Two Towers than the former, because director Peter Jackson takes some major liberties with the plot. As most people are aware, there are three books (The Return of the King is the final in the trilogy). There are scenes in the second book that will appear in the third movie, and vice versa. This is perfectly reasonable, in my opinion, as it would be difficult - and perhaps not nearly as entertaining - to present the movies in exactly the same order as the books.That said, there are some major plot deviations in The Two Towers, scenes and situations that appear in none of the books. If one has read the books, this can be quite disconcerting, as one might be expecting the movie to follow the basic plot of either The Two Towers book or The Return of the King book. If one hasn't read the books (but did see the first film in the trilogy), this might not be so disconcerting - one might not even notice a problem. So this isn't a complaint, exactly, as much as it's an observation.The movie picks up right where the last one left off. Now, I'm going to assume here that people reading this have seen The Fellowship of the Ring. When that movie concluded, the original Fellowship had lost two (Boromir was slain by orcs after attempting to gain The One Ring, and Gandalf fell into the abyss beneath the mines of Moria), and the remaining seven were separated. Frodo, the Ringbearer, and his servant Sam have decided to continue their quest alone and are making their way to Mordor. Their fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin have been kidnapped by those orcs that had slain Boromir; the orcs are under orders to capture alive any Halfling, since they don't know which one has The One Ring. Aragorn the Ranger, Gimli the Dwarf, and Leglolas the Elf are now tracking the horde of orcs, hoping to rescue Merry and Pippin.The first movie clearly belonged to Frodo, who unlike most of his companions is slight, timid but fun-loving, hardly the hardy adventurer. He alone is entrusted to carry the eminently corrupting Ring to its demise in Mount Doom. But the second movie shifts focus to another character, one who was seen only very briefly in the first movie: Gollum. Gollum has a long history with the Ring, and he's now a complete slave to it. He wants it, his Precious, back in his possession. He joins up with Frodo and Sam to lead them to the Black Gate, the terrible entrance to Mordor itself, home of Sauron, the maker of the Ring (who desperately wants it back). Gollum likes Frodo, but he's plagued by split personalities; one side of him wants to help the Hobbits, the other side wants to kill them and eat them - and regain The Ring. It's interesting to note that Gollum, unlike the other major characters, is completely computer generated. This isn't all that new in and of itself, but it's Gollum's emotional expressions that make you think he's as real as the actors playing Frodo and Sam. In fact, director Jackson had Andy Serkis (who voices Gollum) act in the scenes with Sam and Frodo, then had him digitally removed and replaced with a computer-generated Gollum. The result is much more seamless than your run-of-the-mill computerized character.But the story's not just about Frodo and his quest. Sauron knows the Ring's out there, and that a Halfling has it, but he has other matters to attend to. His goal is to wipe out mankind forever. That might be tough in today's world, but in Middle-Earth man was just gaining a foothold; elves and the like had ruled for eons. Saruman, as seen in the last movie, has been breeding legions and legions of superfighters, mutant orcs called Uruk-hai. The Uruk-hai are sent to attack the kingdom of Rohan, which has already been attacked from the inside through a silver-tongued advisor to the king, a Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). By casting a spell on the king, Theoden, Wormtongue is able to render him invalid; his kingdom is shortly weakened. Wormtongue is working for Saruman, who's working for Sauron (even though he thinks he's working for himself). In addition, the kingdom of Rohan has been set against that of Gondor, the other remaining Man kingdom. Together, they might be trouble for the Enemy; separate, they can be picked apart.One of the most prolonged scenes in the movie is the battle at Helm's Deep. After being removed from his spell, Theoden takes his people there for shelter and safety, determined to fight, aided by Aragorn, Leglolas, and Gimli. The Uruk-hai, some ten thousand strong, attack. There have been many excellently staged epic battle scenes in cinematic history, but they all seem to pale to the extravagance and sheer power of this one. It's an awe-inspiring scene, guaranteed to make one cheer.Now, as I said, there are some differences between the books and this movie. I don't mind if certain scenes or sequences are left out, because you can only cram so much into a three-hour movie. But when scenes appear in the movie that never appeared in any of the books, I have a problem. These books have been around for a long time, and it just seems foolhardy to add plot that doesn't need to be added, while at the same time omitting plot that seems necessary. I won't go into details here about what ""new"" scenes are in the movie that aren't in the books, but I was scratching my head after a few of them (and I had just reread The Two Towers a month or so ago).There's even less attention paid to female characters this time around. Arwen, the Elvish beauty who had a thing for Aragorn in the first movie, is seen in dream sequences only - although this is indeed an important plot point, as it explains Aragorn's motivations a bit more lucidly. There's a new female character as well: Eowyn, the daughter of the Rohan king, who (surprise, surprise) also has a thing for Aragorn.There are some funny moments as well, most of them involving Gimli the Dwarf, who appears to be along for comic relief - even more so than in Fellowship. This can, however, have the unintended consequence of marginalizing Gimli's character; after all, he's a strong, steadfast, and tough Dwarf, yet he's pigeonholed into a ""comic"" character. The chemistry between him and Leglolas the Elf is excellent, however.One thing that we must all be thankful for is that the movie does shift away from Frodo himself. Elijah Wood continues to prove he's a terrible actor, incapable of expressing emotion adequately. As the story wears on, Frodo is supposed to get weaker and more beaten - although at times he can rouse himself to complete his quest. But Wood always has that scared look, that deer-caught-in-headlights look, the look that says, ""Why am I here with these actors?"" The performance is flat and ineffectual. And although the focus of the movie as a whole does shift away from Frodo, because his scenes basically involve just him, Sam, and Gollum, Wood's inadequacies are that much more accentuated. Luckily, these scenes are dwarfed (pardon the pun) by the battle scenes.It's never easy to make the middle movie in a trilogy - you want to build on the first movie and lead to the third. Remember Back to the Future II? Wasn't quite as charming as the first one or as action-packed as the third one. It was just kind of there. The Two Towers suffers this indignity, to an extent. Unlike the first one, there's no opening narration that gets everyone up to speed, and like the first one, this one just sort of .... ends. And not necessarily in the same manner as the second book did, either.This movie isn't as good as The Fellowsip of the Ring, but it's still very, very good. I'm giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four, but bear in mind it was a tough three and a half to get. It's not as bad as a three-star movie, but it's not quite the masterpiece of the first movie, either."
jared-25331,"Nov 20, 2024",10/10,"Similar to the first Pete Jackson mov tloie, I watched this entry a lot as a kid whenever it aired on television. Now in 2024, I can see that this movie is another epic.Positives for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002):
Similar to the first movie, Peter Jackson has crafted a masterpiece from start to finish. The directing, writing, production design, costumes, cinematography, makeup, musical score and CGI are all top notch. This movie takes advantage of its lengthy runtime and expands upon the excellent foundation set up in the first time. The movie also does a fantastic job at balancing it's three main plotlines to where they all get their time to shine in the spotlight multiple times. Everyone in the cast once again do an exceptional job with their performances including yoursome of the new cat members with Bernard Hill as Theoden, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir, Brad Dourif as Grjma Wormtongue, Karl Urban as Eomer and u as Denethor. This is also the first time we get to see Gollum and on-screen and once again Andy Serkis for hm this performance voice. The action forsequences are even more spectacular in this movie And finally, the movie ends in a place where all of the main characters are on their way to destroy Sauron and the One Ring.Overall, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) is a fantastic sequel, another phenomenal entry in this cinematic trilogy and I can't wait to rewatch the finale to this trilogy."
a2jcforever,"May 24, 2005",N/A,"As the penultimate film representation of J.R.R. Tolkien's book series ""The Lord of the Rings,"" ""The Two Towers"" was a blockbuster hit in theaters worldwide. Besides the fact that it was the film that would tie ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" to ""The Return of the King, ""The Two Towers"" closely and effectively portrayed the text of Tolkien's book ""The Two Towers"" which helped to rake in a large audience - particularly those who knew Tolkien and his story of the Ring from his books. In terms of the film, Peter Jackson's excellent directing as well as the award-winning performances delivered by the star-studded cast allowed for the attraction of millions of viewers. Also, ""The Two Towers'"" epic battle scenes and constant sequences of action contributed to the film's overall attractiveness. Perhaps one very important characteristic of the film to note, however, is its special effects. Through the use of special effects, Jackson generated a film that stimulated the imagination of the audience, especially those who had read the book series, and brought them into a place where they could easily imagine themselves in Middle Earth, watching Frodo's quest omnisciently. The quality of the film combined with its accurate representation of Tolkien's book series both contribute to the epic nature of ""The Two Towers"" and also leave fans with an incredible story to remember."
djaiv,"Apr 20, 2007",3/10,"I love J.R.R.Tolkien. I've read the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit...hmmm...at least 100 times. Honestly. From the time I was 7 years old, these have been my favorite books. And all his other writings. Heck, I even speak three dialects of Elvish and can write in dwarf runes and the runes of Daeron.... I'm a big Tolkien geek.And I understand that these books are impossible to adapt completely to film. But c'mon! Make an effort! These are beautifully shot, though filled with lots of CGI (which I detest). Beautiful scenery, able direction and OK acting. You would think I could give it at least 5 stars. I can't, and here's why: Don't make stuff up. Really. Whoever wrote this screen play is a servant of Sauron. What's with all the invention? It's a fantasy FILLED with fabulous work. Tolkien was a master storyteller. This screenwriter (unless there were several, in which case much is made clear. Nothing good ever comes from committee) really needed to leave well enough alone."
JHReviews,"Sep 12, 2025",10/10,"Echoing everything I said about The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is another masterpiece of cinema and storytelling. It picks up seamlessly where the first left off, pushing the story forward with more action, more emotion, and even more heart. This is where Peter Jackson's adaptation really cements itself as something truly special. He stays true to Tolkien's tone and identity, translating the richness of the source material into something that breathes on screen.What makes The Two Towers so brilliant is how it balances multiple character arcs. You're following different paths now, yet every one of them feels essential. Nothing is rushed. Every scene has weight, and every moment is treated with care. You're deeply invested in all of them, and it never feels fragmented, that's rare in storytelling, especially at this scale.New characters are introduced and each one feels like they've always belonged in this world. The history of Middle-earth runs deep, and you see it in the way the characters carry themselves. The performances are so strong that you stop seeing actors and just see the characters.And then there's Helm's Deep, one of the greatest battle sequences ever put to film. It's raw, intense, desperate, and heroic. You feel the hopelessness, the fear, and then finally, the thrill of survival. It's not just a battle; it's a moment of triumph, earned through loss and sacrifice. You can't help but cheer in the end.Like the first film, the extended edition of The Two Towers is the definitive version for me. It adds more character, more depth, more Tolkien, and honestly, I can't go back to the theatrical cut. The extended version is the full experience.I love these movies. This one especially is a reminder that fantasy can be more than just spectacle, it can be profound, emotional, and inspiring. And The Two Towers is all of that, and more."
klchu,"Dec 11, 2003",10/10,"This is a review of the extended DVD version.I will keep this short because there are so many reviews.The extended DVD release of The Two Towers is a real improvement over the original theatrical release.  Note, that this version has more than just new scenes.  Almost all of the scenes have been re-edited in some way.  The overall effect is that the story moves much better and the story is easier to follow.  Even though the movie is longer, the pacing is quicker and doesn't seem to drag as much as the original.  Likewise, the additional footage both improves the characterization of the newly introduced characters and restores some plot threads so that other existing scenes now make more sense (like the horse finding Aragorn).  It's also easier to tell who is who because many of the newer characters names are now spoken more often.So, just like with the ""Fellowship"" DVD, the extended version is really the only version worth owning.  I already plan on only getting the extended version of ""King"" next year."
Jaimzay,"Dec 18, 2002",10/10,"Watching ""The Two Towers"" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like ""The Tempest"" and ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways.  The film begins with a powerfully audacious image:  Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, ""You shall not pass!""  As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you.  Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in ""The Two Towers"", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination:  the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments.  We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level.  This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time.  Only 364 days until the final chapter, ""The Return of the King"", hits theaters!"
Greg-o-rama,"Dec 4, 2002",10/10,"I just saw ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" at a preview screening, and it was every bit as good as I expected it to be.  The technical elements are cutting edge, and as in ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" perfect examples of special effects expertly used in the service of the story.  This film will leave you breathless in places, awestruck and bowled-over with the fast-paced action and excitement.""The Two Towers"" is certainly darker and grittier than the first film-- as it should be.Obviously, the question with this new Peter Jackson film, as with the last, is: Is it true to the book?  Yes, it captures the spirit of Tolkien's writing, and in many places surpasses the dramatic tension of the books. Does it stray from Tolkien's plot: Yes, to a degree.  To those that love the books, the differences will be obvious-- and maybe a little jarring-- but once you weigh the changes against the dramatic & visual impact the changes make, you reach the conclusion that these were the right choices for the movie.  After all, this is the movie, not the book.  Don't go expecting to ""see the book,"" with every little plot detail and line of dialogue on the screen verbatim.  It doesn't work that way.  What Jackson has again given us is his visual interpretation of the spirit of Tolkien's Middle Earth, and the results are grand, epic, stunning, literate, surprising, vivid and unforgettable.  A vastly entertaining film.  Sadly, we now just have to wait another year to see the end of the story-- but that film, like this one, will surely be worth the wait."
PyrolyticCarbon,"Jan 22, 2003",9/10,"This is filled with stunning visuals, of huge battles, landscapes and little creatures that love the darkness and their precious. The performances are wholly wonderful and pull you into the story without a second thought, with a plot that totally immerses you and will hardly let you take a breath until the very end. The effects are stunning, although some of the more distant people or crowd scenes were a bit noticeable; none of it takes away from the story. The grand scenes are so visually and emotionally rich, you can't help but feel affected by them, I was moved at quite a few scenes. There were internal cheers, genuine sympathy for characters, and an overwhelming emotion as the riders charge down the hill. This series is destined to go down in history, and no doubt they will all end in the top ten films of all time, if not five!"
Starbuck-13,"Dec 19, 2002",10/10,"This second part of the trilogy starts right in the middle of the action and goes on for over three hours without ever lowering the excitement. It ends a little bit sooner than the second book does - probably to offer Christopher Lee a chance to appear in the third part as well - and left me with only one notion: ""What? Is it over already???""I watched the movie at midnight on opening day, and at three o'clock at night I was not one little bit tired. All I wanted was the movie to continue right now - but I guess we'll have to wait another year...Compared to ""The Fellowship"", this movie has fewer epic moments (as Boromirs death, the Hobbits being hunted by the Nazgul or the forming of the fellowship) but is somehow told faster without focusing too much on action scenes alone. The shifting between the three different storylines (Rohan (Aragorn), Rohan (Merry/Pippin) and Mordor) makes the movie much more interesting than the book with its very rigid way of telling the story. This way, not a hint of boredom comes up, and the huge cast of characters has a chance to be shown in equal parts. Certainly, the story in Mordor was somehow kept shorter than it could have been, but Jackson had to cut somewhere and he did right by rather highlighting the events happening in Rohan.As for Gollum: I would never have imagined that technology was thus far advanced! The facial impressions of Gollum were tremendous, at first I really was appalled about how ugly he was, but Jackson really captured the essence of Gollum and made him one of the most sophisticatedly portrayed characters of the film. An Oscar for Gollum? It's an opportunity!Many of the other characters were developed further like Aragorn, Sam or Gimli whose comic relief elements were just right: Not too much, but certainly right on the mark!The only thing I cannot really fathom right now is the way the Arwen character goes, how Eowyn fits in the picture compared to the books and why the Rohan storyline ended right after the Helms Deep battle instead of in Isengard.Oh yes: And the attack on Helms Deep was great in the beginning and in the middle, but in the end - after the Rohirrim showed up - it seemed rather hastened, it ended too suddenly for my taste.Not to mention the reality check when Aragorn and Gimli are fighting alone against hundreds of Orcs - but well, they are heroes after all, so who am I to criticize :-) ?"
Bizzaro_Sephiroth,"May 18, 2003",N/A,"Now don't get me wrong, I thought it was great. The atmosphere was right, and Gollum was unforgettable, but I was really shocked to see people get so ecstatic about it.I mean, the movie has no sophisticated idea, the acting, besides maybe Gollum and Gandalf was pretty medium, and some aspects in the script really annoyed me (poor Gimli.. they turned him to a clown..).I found the movie very entertaining, but it was defiantly not 'the greatest movie of all time'."
PigeonsAreTasty,"Dec 1, 2003",7/10,"TTT should be taken for what it is, a visually attractive, popcorn fun, crowd-pleaser.  In this respect, the movie does it perfect.  The action is well choreographed, and very interesting to watch.  Peter Jackson is very good at this.  He makes movies interesting.  He makes movies fun to watch. This whole movie was a big story, with really no inner message.  My mind did not go through any thought process this whole movie.  I just sat in my cushioned seat, and absorbed the action/adventure fest this movie gave me. And as I said, this movie does that well.The cinematography was amazing.  You could tell that most of the time making movie was spent in a little room, on a computer, animating Golem, who felt like a real person.  Also, considering most of the background and sets were made by computers, they did a great job with that.The story also was very good, mainly because it is from what is considered one of the greatest books of all time.Also, the movie is very eye-catching, and you can tell Peter threw in some things just to make sure you were watching (Legolos jumping onto his horse is a perfect example).  This makes the movie feel like ""The Matrix"", which is something many directors trying to make an epic DO NOT want.The love story could have been done without, as I forgot every part of the movie with that in it.  I can't even remember who was in love with Liv Tyler.  This felt like they were trying to add more meaning into the battle scenes with whoever she loved, but I could see no connection between the two.Also the character development... wasn't their.  Unless you consider Gandalf becoming ""White"", or Frodo becoming woozier, character development, i felt none in the movie.There are many movies that I sit and wonder after, not because of I being confusing, because that is what the director wants you to do.  The Pianist, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Chinatown, 2001, A Clockwork Orange and others all made me do this.  After seeing this in theaters, I was right out of the theater, and discussing how ""cool"" the battle scenes were.  Wow. Gripping.But I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.  Throughout the whole movie, my eyes were fixed on the screen.  I mean, almost any male, despite how ""inner"" they say they are, can't resist 25 minute battle scenes with fire and ogres.But this movie was easily forgotten in the thoughtful part of my mind. But it will always be in the ""Wow!  Look at that!  Once in a lifetime!"" part.I give The Two Towers:  7/10"
prashanthology,"Nov 27, 2010",10/10,"Peter Jackson delivers again. In style.The Lord of the Rings : The Towers, is the next installment, or rather the continuation of the Fellowship of The Ring. The story continues from the Great River, where Frodo and Sam part away from the rest of the Fellowship and embark on a journey never to be forgotten: that of destroying the One Ring, by taking it deep inside Mordor, into Mount Doom.Elijah Wood and Sean Astin once again steal the show with supreme performances of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee respectively, while the return of Gandalf is welcomed appreciatively. The story takes on two difference courses, both of which are equally vital and are given almost the equal amount of time throughout the movie.Peter Jackson has not disappointed one bit with the visuals. The screenplay is simply magnificent and war sequence of Helms Deep will always be one of my favorite scenes in the Lord of The Rings. Faith, trust, loyalty and friendship is shown throughout the movie, as in the epic book of J.R.R. Tolkein. The music is wonderful, quite similar to its previous installment, but nevertheless a hundred percent effective. The fall of Isengard is shown in a splendid way and Jackson shows it takes more than mere directing to achieve it. A great effort taken by the entire crew for the movie and full appreciation deserved.Quite a few would be of the opinion that The Two Towers is relatively disappointing with respect to the other two movies. I beg to disagree. The movie has been fantastically captured, and pays tribute to the book perfectly.Overall, it is a captivating movie, taking the story to its final part, the epic ending of the Lord of the Rings. A must watch for any movie fan, let alone an The Lord of the Rings fanatic. It is a visual treat, great story telling and great performances. A 10 / 10."
Jeroen van Dam,"Dec 11, 2002",10/10,"After seeing LOTR The Two Towers I only regret that it takes another year to see the final ending of this epic saga. Of course, having read the book several times, I know how it will end, but I'm very curious how Peter Jackson will adapt it to the screen. Judging by this second installment I imagine it will also be grand in every aspect. Watching TTT was an amazing experience with many highlights. First of all there is of course the creature Gollum, which is 'made' absolutely astonishing. Other highlights include the battle at Helms Deep as well as the fight between Gandalf the Grey and the Balrog. For the comic-relief this movie relies on excellent one-liners from Gimli. There are however also some parts that worked less for me. Personally I was not fond of the side-plot with Treebeard in the book and I don't care for it much in the movie. However, it is essential to the story, so who am I to complain. What I also did not enjoy was talking orcs (can't remember them as being whiners...) and can somebody explain to me what the deal is with the immortality of Elves?All these little things aside, Peter Jackson created another masterpiece in which we follow the trail of three separate groups in their quest against Mordor and survival of Mankind and Middle Earth. Jackson deemed it unnecessary to recap the stories from the first movie. Rightfully so, I would say, because if you have not seen The Fellowship there is no real point in watching The Two Towers. There is some reference to some loose ends The Fellowship left (what happened to Gandalf, who is Gollum etc), but never too much. Anybody who enjoyed the Fellowship will also enjoy The Two Towers. The movie did not feel like three hours and leaves the audience craving for more. And that is good news. I wonder how long people will let the cliffhanger be unsolved. Therefor there is a kind request to everybody who already knows how the book ends: don't talk about it in public, because some people don't want to know yet... Bring on 'Return of the King'!"
angeloveraperez,"May 22, 2022",10/10,"My favorite among the three in the movie franchise. Surprisingly, my favorite character isn't Frodo, or Legolas,or Aragorn. It's Saruman! I love his lore and plight. A little bit of darkness sometimes helps!"
michaelgs,"Aug 2, 2003",9/10,"This franchise will, in all likelihood, become remembered as a franchise that shaped filmmaking over the next 10-20 years, and will remain a watched film while the industry lasts. The question then commonly asked becomes, ""Does this movie deserve to be remembered that long?""The answer to that question is, really ""deserved"" is the wrong word.Independence Day will probably still be watched 30 years from now, not because it is necessarily all that good, but because it was hugely successful and spawned a slew of disaster-related flicks. In other words, it defined an era. And with the Harry Potter series being developed as we speak, and both the Chronicles of Narnia and His Dark Materials being made into franchises, one can easily conclude that this film will be remembered as the film that spawned the development of modern fantasy blockbusters (although the Harry Potter series being contemporary was coincidental). By now, we have come to expect that lesser films will occasionally become classics, while greater films will occasionally fall into obscurity.However, I feel, and I hope you will concurr when you see it for yourself, that this is a worthy addition to those era-defining films that come along every-so-often. In fact, IMHO, this is one of the best era-defining films since Star Wars, or at least one of the most enjoyable. Several things from this franchise are truly, justifiably, memorable, such as the wholesome innocence of the Shire and the hobbits, gandalf's stand against the balrog, the preparation for the climactic battle of helms deep, the double personality of Gollum, and...well, since this review is being written in August of 2002 and the Return of the King is not out yet, I'll leave this last one blank, but I am confident that this last film will give us something that will make it worth remembering, perhaps even more than the first two. Some say that the oscar should and will go to this last film, but I say that the oscar has had mixed reactions to these era-defining franchises (the only film I would classify as an era-defining franchise that garnered an oscar since the 70s was Silence of the Lambs), and the Academy might be better off bestowing the award on another film that will fall into obscurity if not honored, rather than adding garnish to an already classic series.I never garauntee that everyone will like a film. If you go to the Casablanca (my personal all-time favorite) page on this website and check the rating stats, you'll find that more than a few people have given it a ""1"" rating. But most probably will find this film at least a highly enjoyable diversion, and that is what film is all about in the first place.9/10"
stanoki,"Nov 14, 2003",10/10,"At the outset, Peter Jackson and company has done an incredible job of bringing Tolkien's vision to the screen. I first read The Lord of the Rings almost 30 years ago, and I felt the books were unfilmable with the then current technology. Even with today's state-of-the-art CGI, I still felt that the LOTR could not be filmed properly, unless the people making the film had a great understanding and love for the source material.  It is obvious from watching the films that Peter Jackson, et al, has a great awareness and compassion for Tolkien's work.I realize the immense differences between the two mediums of the written page and films and the challenges adapting one from the other. So I accepted the changes in the movies weighed against the books without much grievance, i.e.:  Tom Bombadil's absence; Faramir's personality change; Frodo & Sam in Osgiliath; the presence of the elves at Helm's Deep; Arwen's expanded presence; even the silliness of Gimli's character, etc.But there is one element of the movies that disturbs me. It's the films treatment of the `ring' itself. This is where I get to be a LOTR geek, so bear with me!  In the books, Sauron never had a psychic connection with the ring as it's portrayed in the films, so he's never certain who the ringbearer is. Frodo never sees the `eye' when he puts on the ring, and vice versa. This is a major plot device in the books, especially in The Return of the King, where Aragorn is in possession of Saruman's palantiri, and deliberately uses it to allow Sauron to track Aragorn's whereabouts and thereby deceiving Sauron into thinking he had the ring.  In so doing, Sauron's attention was averted from Mordor where Frodo and Sam were able to enter virtually undetected.Thus far in the films, Sauron knows exactly who and where the ringbearer is, and that makes it impossible for the ringbearer to enter Mordor unnoticed. I see this as the one major flaw in Peter Jackson's visualization of LOTR and I hope this problem is resolved in The Return of the King."
nalepis,"Dec 15, 2002",10/10,"As difficult a feat as that might seem, Jackson delivers an even better film than The Fellowship of the Ring.The Two Towers is the grandest spectacle that has ever graced the screen. As near-perfect as a film can possibly get, no longer comparable to other genre pictures, but to the great classics of the art.The sheer scope of The Two Towers makes its predecessor look like an idle stroll in the park. It starts with a bang and doesn't quit for the whole three hours of its duration. And like in the first part, Jackson doesn't fall victim to all the eye candy (and there's more than plenty), he injects the endeavour with a sense of humanity and gravitas that transcends fantasy film-making.Perhaps the greatest surprise is Gollum, a CGI creation that is guaranteed to make your jaw drop. Acted by Andy Serkis and replaced in the final version by a marvelous computer creation by Wetta Digital (surpassing all previous digital characters by miles), he delivers the best performance in the movie. Dynamic, incredibly expressive and ultimately conveying a sense of real pity for the character. And that's no small achievement in a film filled with actors of this calibre.It all concludes with what is probably the best medieval battle scene ever shown and will leave you with a hunger for more.The Two Towers is what film's all about. A true masterpiece. And we still have one more film before the trilogy is completed."
Vinny-28,"Dec 19, 2002",1/10,"Good reviews aside, I sat through an incredibly choppy and badly-paced, eternally long and boring film with no characterization to speak of, one that essentially leaves us at the same place we were at the end of Fellowship of the Ring.  No good character interaction, a CGI-Gollum that is blurry when he moves quickly--in fact, all the CGI is pretty hokey--and a final battle at Helm's Deep which, I just don't get it, it's really not all that special.  Maybe the Extended Director's Edition will rescue this one the way it did Fellowhip.  I hope so, but this film is more like a bad summer movie than it is a sweeping fantasy.  The pacing is terrible, characters disappear, the dialogue is a hollow retread of the first first. Aside from one schizophrenic dialogue between Gollum and himself, we could have skipped this whole film.  Certainly, the meager story on display here could have been told in two hours.  A bore.  A jerky mess.  A shame."
Paragon240,"Aug 22, 2022",10/10,"Each of the Lord of the Rings movies is a masterpiece: the cast, costumes, sets, effects, storytelling, scale, directing, and cinematography are all the best of the best. Picking one above the others can be difficult, but The Two Towers rises to the top because of its final battle. The moment the rain falls over the hushed armies in the last minutes before the conflict erupts is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a war epic. The overwhelming hopelessness of the remnant of Rohan as they attempt to survive the endless enemy hordes is incredibly powerful, and the tension is tangible. Despite knowing a third movie comes next, it felts as if anything could happen. LOTR: The Two Towers edges out the rest of the trilogy by avoiding the weight of beginning or ending a greater story and can be present in the intensity of its own journey."
Sinnerman,"Dec 18, 2002",10/10,"This is it.""The Two Towers"" has just opened. One can foresee the after-viewing thoughts and debates to explode any time now. At the threshold of this taste-variant blood bath, all I can say is, let it be...I have seen and since loved that seminal opening chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Like that much loved film, I do not judge ""The Two Towers"" as a stand-alone movie with flaws for nitpicking. I look upon it as a further unveiling of Peter Jackson's LOTR mythology, his visionary adaptation from book to screen. But that's just my take and my take alone...all are free to disagree with this humble reviewer as I'm not a believer in ""taste-dictatorship"".Notice I stated Peter Jackson's and not Tolkien's LOTR. With all due respect for JRR Tolkien (and the wrath of his literary groupies), I think that LOTR should by now be just as much a labour of love for Jackson as it once was for Tolkien. Judged as work of art in another artistic medium (film), what Jackson has achieved, is in my humble opinion, a masterpiece in its own right.Dissenters of LOTR movies, we know who you are. In an ideal world, we will respect each other for the movies we like, the faith we practice and the lives we lead. But in reality, nothing is as black and white as middle-earth. For good or evil, I have thus come to terms with the spectrum of people's reaction to this much debated film series. I will thus accept in grace the searing attacks or equally gushing compliments TTT will likely garner in the days and weeks ahead.I have nothing more to add on my present state of mind. That I love the LORD OF THE RINGS movies, is but a given. That I am now taking the higher road of no more bickering is my choice. A choice which I pray I will have the strength to honour. Consider that my leap of faith.In conclusion, the story is far from over. Like Gandalf's famous last words in TTT (the movie), ""The battle for Helm's Deep may be over, but the battle for Middle Earth has just begun..."" Till then, I shall breathe, while I wait for ""The Return of the King""...peace and out."
carlosjoao-23420,"Jan 3, 2021",10/10,"This movie is kind of underrated just because it doesn't start nor ends the trilogy, but this movie is as good as the other two or even better, it has some memorable scenes and it has one of the best war battles of all time. Great movie that aged very well."
Kubris,"Aug 21, 2011",8/10,"IMDb Top 250: 30 The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers continues the epic story that began in Fellowship of the Ring. We meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles.There is such a phenomenon in film called 'Middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. It means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. The Two Towers is a perfect example of this concept. The awe of Fellowship isn't present, and the finish of Return of the King doesn't happen, leaving... the middle.I'm not trying to say Two Towers is a bad film. But compared to the other Lord of the Rings films, it is. They're AAA, Towers is AA. The characters introduced, like the King and nephew in Rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. The battle for Helm's Deep isn't that spectacular. Humour is misplaced. Even the films colour is wrong. Some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with.There are still some great parts of Two Towers. Gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. His presence helps Frodo and Sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. The Dead Marshes are creepy. Ringwraiths return- on new mounts. And the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie.Most of my problems with Two Towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at Isengard leave the viewer in awe. The battle for Helm's Deep was also... not great. The sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. The colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but Gimli became a walking joke and Legolas rode a shield/surfboard. Clashing themes. The orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. In a series with groundbreaking battles, Two Towers came up short.The Two Towers is a good film, but a mediocre Lord of the Rings film. If for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. Not much else I can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. Fear not, Return of the King is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10"
janahes,"Aug 15, 2021",10/10,"I decided to rewatch the LOTR (this one specifically being my favorite) since the series was coming out later this year.Nearly twenty years later, this film was just as good as it was when it was released in theaters."
jebyvyson,"May 4, 2019",8/10,"I enjoyed this movie because it was leading to the finale of the trilogy and the visual effects blew my mind and GOD THE MUSIC SCORE OF THIS MOVIE! I did enjoy the film, but the story didn't blow my mind like the first movie did and I find that a little sad. Not to say it didn't had a good story, it does, it's just not better than The Fellowship of the Rings. Other than that, it's a lovable movie :)"
MartinTeller,"Jan 12, 2012",9/10,"The second film has its own set of problems. It includes some of the most worrisome changes to the original text... I don't get too defensive about Tolkien, but I do hate how Treebeard gets turned into a moron. Gimli's attempts at comedy are still terrible, and let's not forget about Surfin' Legolas and Indestructible Aragorn. However, this one endures better than the first. Switching between the multiple plot threads cuts down on the tedium, and excitement level is way up. You've got the introduction of Gollum as a real character, the development of the Frodo/Sam dynamic, and despite their dumbing down, the Ents are way friggin' cool. The most fun and probably the best-paced part of the trilogy."
Julie-53,"Jan 2, 2003",6/10,"Everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon that this is the greatest movie ever made.  I disagree.  First, let me say that I have read all three books in the trilogy twice, and I love this story.  However, this was too long.  It may just be that Tolkien's books are too much to try to put into a movie.  I will say that this was probably the best effort that could be made by a human.  But no movie can truly capture the feeling and human quality of the books.The battle sequences were not emotionally engaging.  And the orcs are too ""over-the-top"" scary for my taste.  I did like the sequences between Frodo, Sam and Gollum.  The portrayal of the ring's effect on Frodo was well done.All-in-all, this is a downer of a movie.  It's the book in the trilogy that is the darkest.  Hopefully, the third movie will be a good uplifting ending to this set of three."
WOMBATIES,"Jan 26, 2003",1/10,Battle scenes make 90% of the movie. More than enough to walk out... Even the more interesting characters become boring in such a context. What a disappointment !
edvardogomes,"Apr 11, 2025",9/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a near-perfect continuation of Peter Jackson's legendary trilogy - a film that expands the world of Middle-earth, deepens its characters, and delivers some of the most iconic cinematic moments in fantasy history.What truly elevates The Two Towers is its dual mastery of epic and intimate. From the thunderous Battle of Helm's Deep - still one of the greatest large-scale battles ever put on film - to the quieter emotional beats like Sam's stirring speech about hope, the movie strikes a powerful balance between grandeur and heart.Gollum (brought to life by Andy Serkis and groundbreaking motion capture) is a revelation - a tragic, twisted creature torn between loyalty and obsession. His arc adds layers of psychological complexity that few fantasy films dare explore.Meanwhile, the split narrative across Rohan, Fangorn Forest, and the journey to Mordor adds a sweeping scope, though it does occasionally juggle its pacing unevenly, with some parts lingering a bit too long compared to others. But every storyline feels meaningful and beautifully rendered.Howard Shore's score, Weta's stunning visual effects, and Jackson's direction continue to build a world that feels ancient, mythic, and real.9/10 - a breathtaking, emotionally resonant second act that perfectly sets the stage for the trilogy's climax, while standing tall on its own.If Fellowship was about forming the bond, Two Towers is about testing it - and it does so brilliantly."
august_sanders,"Jul 10, 2025",9/10,"That final battle has to be one of the most interesting fight scenes I've seen in a while. There was always something happening, and the Battle of Helm's Deep felt like a genuine, chaotic brawl. In my opinion, though, the build-up leading to it was even more enjoyable. I liked the various subplots and how they all connected. The side story with Merry and Pippin felt slightly out of place and was overshadowed by the others, but I still enjoyed the Ents and their part in the story.Once again, the Battle of Helm's Deep was incredible. The orcs were fascinating and fun to watch as they clashed with the main characters. Frodo and Sam's journey toward Mordor was especially tense-when they nearly got caught, I genuinely almost jumped out of my seat. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens in the next film.This is easily one of my favorite trilogies, and I enjoy thinking through all these moments."
02simon,"Nov 10, 2003",10/10,"TTT, like FOTR is one of the most phenomenal films to come out in the past ten years.  Indeed, I would hardly be suprised if, in the future, the entire trilogy is considered one of the greatest works of cinema ever.  Both are (and Im confident the third will be as well) beautifully scripted, layered in meaning, with outstanding effects and set design, all rolled into a (so far) 6+ hour epic that seems all too short,"
toseale,"Oct 9, 2022",10/10,"The Two Towers is another movie I really don't mind the extended version of. 4 hours of amazing dialogue, fights, and storytelling that I love so so much. There's so many memorable scenes, and nothing to complain about. While I do find it a little odd that Frodo isn't included as much in this, he still has his key moments and the movie's still full of amazing scenes. The visuals are really something I enjoy, with plenty of places that look some kind of cool. I can't get enough of the strong, visible pulls between good and evil that hammer each other back and forth, and it leaves this feel of giddiness when something good happens. This is just another great addition to Peter Jackson's perfect trilogy."
The_Jew_Revue,"May 2, 2025",9/10,"Peter Jackson's middle chapter in his epic adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers, stands as a monumental achievement in cinematic storytelling. Far from suffering the ""middle child"" syndrome, this film boldly expands upon the foundations laid by The Fellowship of the Ring, plunging viewers deeper into the fractured landscapes and escalating conflicts of Middle-earth. It masterfully juggles multiple narrative threads, each fraught with peril and imbued with a growing sense of urgency as the shadow of Sauron lengthens.The film's brilliance lies in its ability to navigate these disparate storylines with both clarity and emotional resonance. We witness the harrowing journey of Frodo and Sam as they navigate the treacherous terrain of the Emyn Muil, their trust in the enigmatic Gollum a constant source of tension. Simultaneously, the scattered remnants of the Fellowship - Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli - pursue the Uruk-hai who have captured Merry and Pippin, their quest leading them to the war-torn kingdom of Rohan. This parallel storytelling not only broadens the scope of the narrative but also effectively highlights the widespread impact of Sauron's encroaching darkness.The introduction of Rohan is a particular triumph. The portrayal of this proud but beleaguered kingdom, under the subtle manipulation of the treacherous Gríma Wormtongue, is both compelling and poignant. The character of King Théoden, initially weakened and despairing, undergoes a powerful transformation under Aragorn's guidance, providing one of the film's most stirring arcs. The breathtaking landscapes of Rohan, captured with Jackson's signature visual grandeur, serve as a stark contrast to the looming threat that hangs over them.However, it is the depiction of the Battle of Helm's Deep that truly cements The Two Towers' place in cinematic history. This extended sequence is a masterclass in action choreography and tension building. The sheer scale of the Uruk-hai army, the desperate defense mounted by the Rohirrim and the arriving Elves, and the visceral intensity of the close-quarters combat are all rendered with stunning realism and emotional weight. The battle is not just a spectacle; it is a crucial turning point in the war, showcasing the courage and resilience of the free peoples of Middle-earth in the face of overwhelming odds.Beyond the grand battles and sweeping landscapes, The Two Towers also delves deeper into the inner struggles of its characters. Frodo's increasing burden and the corrupting influence of the One Ring are palpable, while Aragorn grapples with his destiny as the rightful king. Even the seemingly comic relief of Legolas and Gimli's burgeoning friendship is imbued with a sense of loyalty and camaraderie that underscores the importance of unity in the face of evil.In conclusion, The Two Towers is a powerful and engrossing cinematic experience. It successfully navigates a complex narrative, delivers breathtaking action sequences, and further develops the rich characters and intricate world established in its predecessor. It stands as a testament to Peter Jackson's vision and his ability to bring Tolkien's epic saga to life with both grandeur and emotional depth, leaving the audience eagerly anticipating the final confrontation to come."
Kirpianuscus,"Sep 19, 2025",N/A,"Obvious, more than a merituous adaptation. Or expression of ambition of Peter Jackson. Maybe a sort of miracle because, at first sight, the Fellowship of the Ring is pretty enough and the two towers can be more soft.The heart of this miracle- the emotion. You feel the fights, the travel, the tension, the heroism. And, indeed, it is Tolkien but it is a splendid resume of entire history of humanity and precious image of the birth of hope.Great, memorable - fair terms. But , obvious, it is more, something out of words."
