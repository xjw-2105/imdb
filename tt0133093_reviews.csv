acedj,"Nov 1, 2019",10/10,"When this came out, I was living with a roommate. He went out and saw it, came home and said, ""Dude, you have to go see The Matrix."" So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging."
suryanmukul,"Oct 1, 2020",10/10,"The Matrix - 1999This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future."
xNecRosex,"Jan 4, 2021",10/10,"This film doesn't age, it will be contemporary even in 2030 or 2040.
Wachowski's best one, by far."
mambubukid,"Sep 19, 2000",10/10,"The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.)  There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What is the Matrix, you ask?  Something that's closer to reality than you think.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time."
DARi0,"Jan 2, 2021",10/10,What if I told you the Matrix is not a Sci-Fi but a Documentary movie?
0U,"Feb 23, 2020",10/10,"The film is as well crafted as the matrix itself! On another level entirely to any other science fiction film from the last 20 years . Getting lost in another world, is interly what Cinema is made for. This one takes you into a whole new universe interly ."
MinorityReporter,"Dec 2, 2005",10/10,"Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10/10 - on my top 3 of best films."
Kirpianuscus,"Jan 8, 2017",N/A,"and this is all. because each explanation sounds wrong. sure, the acting,, the plot, the fight/action scenes are great. maybe unique. but the essence, for me, remains the basic idea . a fake reality against the pure truth. and the magic as clothes of each character. because it is more than a film. it is a revolution in the way to see a film and to discover reality. you are Neo. and the mythological mix of symbols and cultural references and the simple story who seems have more and more levels are more than fascinating - it is real. sure, Matrix has a lot of reviews and around it is very easy to say hypothesis, verdicts, opinions or, maybe, critics. it is enough to say it is a masterpiece. or the perfect fascinating fairy tale."
Xophianic,"Feb 2, 2000",9/10,"At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away."
Manchui,"Sep 10, 2001",7/10,"Ok, I'm getting sick of comments saying stuff like ""The Matrix is the greatest film EVER MADE!""That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.7/10"
SamuraiYost,"May 17, 2004",5/10,"Really, my summary says it all.It's a cute premise overwhelmed by its need to be cool at the expense of plot, characters, meaning, or consistency. It has philosophical and literary pretensions that come off as kindergarten philosophy at best and ham-handed at worst. Luckily, these can be ignored fairly easily.Good action sequences for the most part. Most of the cast is summer-movie capable. i.e. Their acting is neither embarrassing nor impressive. Keanu gives his second-best performance ever (after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). Unfortunately, that is likely merely the convergence of his naturally confused look with the confusion inherent to the character.All things considered a fun action movie provided you don't buy the hype telling you that it is so much more.By the way, stop with this one. This movie is watchable and complete in its own and is only degraded by its truly dreadful sequels. If this movie is the triumph of style over substance, its sequels are the cruel beating and maiming of substance by style gone bad."
notoriousCASK,"Apr 11, 2018",10/10,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made."
SdrolionGM,"Mar 3, 2001",N/A,"The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller.  Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.Boy, was I wrong.  Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome.  And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well.  It has characters that I cared about.  From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles.  I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion.  It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes!  Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before.  Watch one of the fight scenes.  Then watch the whole movie.  There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters.  Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.  If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time.  It isn't just special effects, folks."
tom10_,"Oct 12, 2021",10/10,"Was slightly confused and second guessing throughout first viewing which was not enjoyable; resulting in a a score of 7/10.However on second viewing, you quickly become aware of why this is regarded as such a classic. Great fun to watch and it's captivating throughout. Loved it.10/10."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 22, 2024",10/10,"In the realm of cinematic landmarks, few films have blurred the lines of reality and provoked philosophical ponderings quite like ""The Matrix."" Released in 1999, this groundbreaking film from the Wachowskis isn't merely a visual spectacle; it is a thought-provoking exploration of existence, consciousness, and the nature of reality itself, making it a masterpiece that resonates profoundly even today.""The Matrix"" catapults audiences into an intricate universe where humanity is unknowingly ensnared in a simulated reality created by artificial intelligence. Keanu Reeves delivers a stunning performance as Neo, a hacker drawn into a rebellion that challenges the very fabric of his understood world. This narrative is punctuated by striking characters, each embodying profound philosophical archetypes; Morpheus, with his unwavering belief in prophecy and fate, and Trinity, who symbolizes both strength and connection, serve as guiding lights in Neo's journey of self-discovery.The film's visuals are nothing short of revolutionary. The signature ""bullet time"" effect not only redefined the action genre but also serves as a metaphor for the clarity gained when one awakens to the truth. With every slow-motion leap and gravity-defying dodge, the film invites viewers to question their perception. The stunning choreography of the fight scenes-elegant yet visceral-transports the audience into a world where every choice reverberates with existential weight.Beneath this dazzling exterior lies an intricately woven narrative rich with philosophical inquiry. The Matrix poses questions that tug at the very essence of human existence: What is real? Can we trust our senses? In an age increasingly dominated by technology, the film's cautionary tale becomes strikingly relevant. It dares us to reflect on the data-driven realities we inhabit and challenges the notion of choice when confronted with overwhelming digital influence.The film's infamous ""blue pill/red pill"" dichotomy embodies the quintessential human choice-between comfort in ignorance and the painful truths of reality. It speaks to the dissonance many feel today amidst the barrage of information and entertainment that can distract us from authentic experience.David's haunting score, combined with a distinctive, neo-noir visual style, enriches the film's atmosphere, creating a sense of foreboding and urgency as the protagonists navigate their treacherous world. The dialogues are imbued with philosophical depth, offering nuggets of wisdom that resonate long after the final scene.""The Matrix"" is not just a film; it is a cultural phenomenon that transcended its genre. It invites viewers to ponder profound questions, urging us to look beyond the surface of our existence and to consider the forces that shape our realities. As we navigate a world rife with virtual experiences and complex technologies, ""The Matrix"" remains an enduring beacon-a challenge to seize our autonomy and discern truth from illusion."
david-meldrum,"Feb 22, 2019",10/10,"20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels...."
EVON1TY,"Mar 2, 2023",10/10,"This movie is so well written that you can't even prove this movie is wrong about our world. This movie mades you think that our world can be just a reflection, a fake world. It's not just about the war between AI and humanity. It's more about questioning the reality.And years later the idea is never gets old. This is the movie that you should respect if someone says ""I think this is the greatest movie of all time."" because it has somethings unique, not special it's just unique.It's beyond all the Science-Fiction movies. Normally Sci-Fi movies mades you think ""Can this subject of the movie be real someday?"" and actually only some of them made you think that way. This one mades you think ""I can't deny, this could be our reality. We can never be sure.""Besides making one of the greatest Fictional Universes, this movie also achieves so much more.And not only that, this movie is also achieves something great in Action. It has the most iconic action scenes. Action director is so great. Revolutionary VFX and SFX, amazing Set Decoration and more."
TaylorYee94,"Oct 1, 2020",10/10,"You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work."
PreOre72,"Jun 17, 1999",3/10,"The Matrix is just another sci-fi film that offers nothing special to the genre. The only reason everybody dropped their jaws and praised this film was because of the great special effects and fight scenes. Believe me there is a lot more to a film than just it's special effects.The script was mind numbing at times, especially with the whole ""We're not in Kansas anymore"" bull crap line, and the acting was just a notch above awful. The only person that even resembled an actor was Laurence Fishburne. Keanu Reeves is his usual self.All in all a pretty terrible movie and everyone's love for it made it even worse.If you are looking for a good sci-fi flick go out and get ""Planet of the Apes"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", or any one of the Star Wars films. If you are looking for a good 90's sci-fi flick go get 12 Monkeys cause that has a lot more than this, like a script and a plot that is more than paper thin."
MrsRainbow,"Apr 2, 1999",N/A,"The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.I feel some hope for the future of movie-making in America to be able to recommend this film."
emptyskies,"Apr 23, 2002",10/10,"The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too."
ozer-can2,"Feb 7, 2019",10/10,"There will be no movie like matrix, thanks for the masterpiece !!"
TheLittleSongbird,"Feb 20, 2017",9/10,"'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one.

UniqueParticle,"Mar 31, 2019",10/10,"Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one. Check out my others if you're interested for now 10 out of 10 phenomenal movie in many ways!"

Pessimisticynic,"Apr 3, 1999",10/10,"It's been a while since a movie has generated enough interest in me for me to watch it.  ""The Matrix"" looked exciting enough in the trailers, so I decided to give it a look.  What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the greatest special effects I've ever seen.  The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more.  Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.  He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film.  He was a great choice for the role of Neo.  Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne.  I highly recommend this film for those who are a fan of visually stunning movies.  It will blow away your senses..."
lastliberal-853-253708,"Jul 23, 2015",9/10,"I remember taking a class in social psychology many years ago. The Joy Luck Club figured prominently in the course. I like the idea of combining movies and theory.I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics."
AllieRubyStein,"Dec 18, 2021",10/10,"Never will there be a film that can harness the creative worldbuilding, mind blowing story, and intricate themes of social commentary as well as The Matrix can. I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.My Rating: 9.9/10."

It not only looks better than mainstream movies today, you're hard pressed to tell what was added in visual effects and what was happening at the time of the shoot.The entire tower scene, not just the bottom level, is a thing of beauty.

elto-30283,"May 22, 2018",10/10,"The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!"
robpye-93618,"Mar 9, 2025",8/10,"I just watched The Matrix again. It feels like we are living in the Matrix today. 26 years on from its original production, it still feels up to date and innovative. Two of my boys watched recently which drew me to it again. Aside from some quite stunning graphics the story line is compelling. I didn't remember all of the plot from when I watched first time many years ago. Being a geek, I found the link between software self-determination and a mediated reality quite compelling. With the advent of LLM and AI the Matrix seems more real than one could have imagined in 1999. That's the great thing about sci-fi when they come true in parts."
BradenTheRater,"Sep 28, 2025",10/10,"Watching this movie made me question everything that is real, my free will, my right as a person, and our status of the human species.What I'm trying to say is that it was pretty good. Seriously, though, it's a great film with many thrilling and iconic scenes, endlessly quotable lines, and deep, thought-provoking themes. This is not Rated R for violence or language or any of that stuff, it's Rated R because this might have your entire reality in question. Some of the things they say in this movie are insane, and I think it's so good because of its psychological nature.So, in conclusion, ""The Matrix"" is a deep philosophical film that will leave you with your jaw on the floor. But if you are satisfied with your life, take the blue pill.""You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure."""
MercurioKnight,"Apr 27, 2000",N/A,"Who is to say what is real or not? We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.With that, I leave you with the fact that I've seen more different types of people liking this one film than most other films to date. Move over George Lucas, you may have just met your match... :)"
Ashrith26,"Apr 17, 2021",7/10,"First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea as many think it is. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released."
Jarv1,"Feb 23, 2004",4/10,"OK- don't get me wrong this was a groundbreaking movie. However I have some serious problems with it.First the good. The action scenes and special effects are awesome. They really did set new standards and knocked that hackneyed load of tripe The Phantom menace into the bin. The ending is also fantastic- there is no way that an ending this perfect was meant to be followed by two mediocre sequelsHowever, The plot is more full of holes than a fishnet stocking. For instance- I know this is nit picking- but how can Cypher be betraying the crew when not only do they have to plug him into the matrix for him to go and meet the agents in the first instance, but are also monitoring said conversation.Secondly- the philosophical parts. The matrix basically asks the question is it better to live the dream. The flaw comes in that in this case it is quite clearly better- great, so mankind is not ""free"" but each person lives a sufficiently realistic existence inside their own head for it not to matter. If the alternative is living in fear and squalor, dodging sentinels whilst eating what looks like congealed semen then I would frankly rather live inside my own dreams dining on fine food etc.Next up, the acting. Could someone please explain to me how Keanu Reeves is a leading man. He single handedly trashes all the good work put in by the supporting cast- especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Anyway how can I be expected to take a film seriously where Keanu is effectively god?Overall, a reasonable film but not the second coming of Christ so many people think it is."
wolf_wallace,"Mar 29, 2000",10/10,"The Wachowski Brothers vision of a possible future takes the visual and sound aspects of filmmaking to a new high. Incorporating older still photography with computer enhancement to the degree that appears on the screen has raised the genre to a level that will be very hard-pressed by filmmakers for a number of years.

jackgdemoss,"Dec 24, 2021",9/10,"As the most senior movie on my watchlist, The Matrix has been on the back of my mind for years. I knew it was genre redefining for the time, but I assumed that it would not age well given how tech dependant it should have been. I could not have been more wrong.The Matrix has some of the best practical effects that I have ever seen. The CGI tech was jarring whenever it was used, but thankfully it wasn't relied on heavily. The score was fantastic, the plot intriguing, and the story enthralling. This is the best action film I have seen to date."
blake-northcott,"May 25, 2018",10/10,"By the end of the 90s, there hadn't been much in terms of fresh, new sci-fi that we hadn't seen before. Or so I thought.The Matrix combined the best of hard science-fiction with Asian cinema's frenetic and masterfully choreographed action sequences, gorgeous direction, pitch-perfect casting, and the best martial arts I'd ever seen in a Hollywood film.I don't think the sequels did it justice, but The Matrix - as a stand-alone film - remains one of my all time favorites in ANY genre."

The introductory scenes of Neo looked a bit odd but that won't stop me from giving a 10."
jimmydennis00,"Sep 6, 2021",9/10,Was way ahead of its time. Still hold up. Now as far as the sequels I can not say the same thing.
SteelBlue82,"Oct 28, 2018",N/A,"This movie raises one of my favorite questions. What is reality? The biggest strength of The Matrix is the story. The special effects hold up because they did not try to go beyond their technological limits.The biggest weakness of The Matrix is some of the dialogue. It is often times either melodramatic or robotic. It has a few plot holes, the biggest of which being blood. ""If it happens in the matrix your mind makes it real..."" I don't know how your mind could give you a bloody lip.With all that The Matrix is still the best sci-fi/action flick ever made."
s_daad,"Sep 22, 2010",3/10,"A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix."
BailedOutHotDog,"Mar 12, 2025",10/10,"The Matrix is a film that no matter how many times you watch it it will always leave some unanswered questions.Crafting a film that ultimately blends multiple genres and has as much of a complicated screenplay as this is undeniably difficult. Although the matrix is nowhere near a movie I'd traditionally watch seeing as I prefer classic movies, I still appreciate the work that was put into this film.I won't go as deep into this review as I typically go with most of my film reviews but I will put down what I observed while watching.Story:
Never fully explained, and perhaps that's what makes the Matrix so good. It never is fully explained and leaves you with more questions than answers.Impressive use of CGI:
I'm no huge fan of exaggerated CGI gun play but it was an art that was essentially mastered for this film. The film blends the use of action scenes with dialogue scenes on a scale that most typical action movies have failed to copy.Acting:
Laurence Fishburne plays a good role as well as Keanu Reeves.I'm not going to speak of Carrie Ann Moss as I completely hated her character and I think her character was completely forced. And I stand by the philosophy that last-second-romance doesn't heighten the tension or make the movie any better!Overall, the Matrix is a classic action movie that was made on a modest budget of only 63 million dollars: a number that would make many present action movies tremble in their boots. It is not a film I would traditionally watch based on my current interests in films, but the majority of the public will likely appreciate it.A solid movie with a good cast and lengthy, dramatized, action scenes stands the test of time and proves itself as a worthy player in the field of action movies.I recommend it.10/10

Why correlate with our Universe & how we see it ? 😊 Also, as for finding faults - well it's your limited understanding that you can't see the sheer beauty of Matrix Universe, concept of Maya, free will & choice.

Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 22, 2022",10/10,"Imagine being told that the world you live in is a lie, that everything around you is simulated, that nightmare comes true for computer programmer Neo.Over twenty years old, and it still packs a huge punch, The Matrix will forever be a sci fi masterpiece. It is lightening paced, energy charged, and filled with tonnes of original ideas.Epic action sequences galore, but it is so much more than just an action movie, it covers so many genres, and as such will have a very broad appeal, horror sci fi lovers in particular will find it so rewarding.The special effects hold up incredibly well, and I still find the scene where Neo wakes up incredibly chilling, Reeves looks so different, you'll question whether it really is him or not.It was obvious that sequels were going to follow, but of course none of them have quite been able to recapture the sheer magic of the original.The cast are terrific, and along with Point Break, this ranks as my favourite Keanu Reeves film.It's an awesome movie, 10/10."

The film has influenced both the cinema industry and the computer entertainment industry. When you watch The Matrix for the first time, it looks like perfect action movie with high-class special effects and good actors.Time passed and we remember only a black cloak, two hands shooting, kung-fu and running on the walls.Recently I watched it again and I was amazed that there was so much hidden behind the spectacular scenes that I needed to watch this film several times, and I would probably find something that I had missed earlier. Reality is the only what we see and feel.We can understand the movie in different ways. You will see what you emphasize. Slavery, the fight against the system, the role of man in this system and the system in life, fanaticism and faith, chosenness and resurrection.I suggest watching The Matrix even if you've already watched it."
ShinKyo81,"Oct 31, 2018",10/10,"It is funny how it has been 15 years since ""The Matrix Revolutions"", bringing the movie trilogy to a close. I wrote reviews for it and ""Reloaded"" as well back in 2003 and I realized that I had never written a few lines for the first movie. Well, here I am.I will keep it short. We all know how good ""The Matrix"" is. The plot, the visuals, the mythos, it all adds up to a movie experience that is timeless. Almost 20 years later, it now has a ""retro"" vibe that makes it more interesting, with late 90s cars, rotary phones, Nokia cells and CRT monitors.Today sets the 4K HDR release of the trilogy. Coming back to ""The Matrix"" after probably 10 years since my last viewing, it is a constant reminder of how the Wachowski's masterpiece shaped up the movie industry and its echos are still felt today.A true timeless piece of movie history."

Some excellently edited and choreographed sequences by wunderkinds, flavors-of-the-decade directing brothers Wachowski, Andy & Larry, whose graphic novel (read: comic book) depiction a la `Blade Runner', `Dark City' and any other sci-fi fable of humanity questioning What's It All About navel gazing gives off a giddy, guilty rush of adrenaline and one head rush of  a movie viewing experience.  Kudos to production designer Owen Paterson's sleek, sexy visionary and cinematographer's nifty, tricky photography."
meathookcinema,"Jan 21, 2018",5/10,"I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix."

I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action."
idakiefer,"Sep 12, 2021",10/10,Best Movie of ALL Times! I love it ! Highly recommended!
Filmudo_BR,"Feb 18, 2019",10/10,"This movie and the series (Reloaded and Revolutions) is a masterpiece from the 2000's, this movie is a blockbuster, if you are a TI entusiast, loves Exterminator or sci fi fan, you really NEED See this!"
denmez27,"Dec 27, 2021",10/10,"Matrix is a movie which makes me think about the world we live in, because it brings some unique (crazy) ideas. In my opinion this film succeeded in showing us a theory of what people are (can be). Personally, I really enjoyed all the special effects alongside with the fight scenes. This movie is a must to watch!"
FlickFusionCritic,"Oct 20, 2024",10/10,"The Matrix isn't just a movie-it's a cultural reset. This film redefined what sci-fi could be and literally left my brain scrambled in the best way possible. There's ""great"" and then there's The Matrix level. Let's be real-this movie is an 11/10 because it took everything we thought we knew about action, philosophy, and filmmaking and turned it upside down.Keanu Reeves as Neo? Absolute perfection. He starts off as a regular dude stuck in the system, and by the end, he's out here dodging bullets in slow motion, questioning reality, and literally becoming ""The One."" It's impossible not to root for Neo as he navigates the layers of this dystopian world, and Reeves' iconic coolness makes the whole journey legendary.The action scenes? Next level. From the mind-blowing bullet-dodging scene to that rooftop battle, the Wachowskis changed the game with their insane choreography and visuals. Slow-motion, 360-degree camera spins, martial arts that feel like poetry-this is the movie that made us all want to learn kung fu (or at least pretend we could).But what really makes The Matrix more than just a sick action flick is the story. The whole concept of questioning reality, breaking free from the system, and figuring out who you really are? It's the ultimate ""wake-up call"" movie. It's got layers on layers of philosophy, tech paranoia, and human struggle that hit hard, even years later.And let's talk about the supporting cast-Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is the mentor we all wish we had, and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity? She's a badass from start to finish, breaking stereotypes and just oozing confidence and skill in every fight scene.Visually, The Matrix is still ahead of its time. The green coding, the dystopian cityscapes, the machines-it all blends seamlessly with the mind-bending plot, and it still looks SO clean today. Every frame feels iconic.The soundtrack? Straight fire. Rage Against the Machine's Wake Up closing out the film? Chef's kiss. Every song fuels the adrenaline and tension, making the entire experience feel epic.The Matrix isn't just a film, it's a full-on experience. It makes you question reality while delivering some of the best action scenes ever filmed. 11/10 because it's the ultimate sci-fi action movie that blew everyone's mind and keeps doing it, no matter how many times you watch."
mfisher452,"Jun 3, 2004",N/A,"'Frank? Larry here. How are you? Listen, Andy and I are writing a new screenplay and we really want to sell this one. I'm thinking of writing a sci-fi pieceThat's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse, that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we know with any scientific education at allWell, we figure to sell, it has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel possibilitiesWell, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown inIt's, say, about 200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares? Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no feelings, but it makes a good storybecause it does, that's all.So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how would you power it?Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boringwhat else?nuclear power plantswhat else?Look, what about electricity from living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'"
CuriosityKilledShawn,"May 24, 2004",6/10,"I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie. A contradiction in terms yes, but still the most appropriate way of describing it."
troccafranco,"May 1, 2021",10/10,Not much to say that hasn't been said. This movie is the masterpiece of its genre. Pure and simple!
savagebunny-16867,"May 14, 2020",10/10,"The starting of the movie itself makes the viewers really curious about it, and engages you till the final scene with some great action and shocking twists. The ending of the movie isn't even enough to get over it and makes you wonder only more about it."
elenamarri,"Jan 7, 2021",10/10,Amazing movie and so relevant to the world we live in now surprisingly.
naomilouiefarias,"Sep 17, 2021",10/10,The only thing i could say as a 22 year old experiencing the film as a film student and aspiring filmmaker in 2021 is how i wish i were in m early 20s in 1999 (the year i was born) to see how impactful this film was in the industry back then and to experience its release and reception.
zyaylaci,"Jul 5, 2025",10/10,"This movie not just sci-fi, this movie is not just action, this movie is not just a movie. It is a movie that I will watch again and again throughout my life. It is a movie that is way ahead of its time and also a deeply philosophical movie. I watched it 20 years ago. If I am alive I will watch it 20 years later. In addition to its philosophical depth, even subject will remain relevant for years. The movie set the bar so high that when the second and thirt movies could not reach the same level, it disappointed people. But I think even the 2021 Matrix is very good. I am waiting for the new movie with great excitement."
aayushwarade,"Aug 16, 2024",10/10,"10/10, if you got 'The Matrix,' you're officially a genius. You followed the mind-bending plot twists, understood why Morpheus was so obsessed with pills, and saw through the virtual reality like a pro. Congratulations, you've earned the title of 'Ultimate Brainiac'! Now, if you gave it a score below 7, you might want to reconsider your movie choices. You probably have a mind better suited for simpler pleasures like Curious George's banana adventures. No shame in that-Curious George is a legend in his own right. If you find the concept of a simulated reality and gravity-defying kung fu a bit too complex, it's cool. Just enjoy the cute monkey and his antics while the rest of us decode the mysteries of the Matrix. Keep rocking your own movie universe, even if it's a bit less mind-bending!"
soumyalal2,"Jun 30, 2020",10/10,Omg what a movie is this... 1999 are you kidding me.... who can think of a concept like this in 1999.... One of the greatest SciFi movie ever made in the history of Cinema PERIOD
DaanIMDB,"Sep 23, 2024",10/10,"I've heard a lot about this movie over the years, but I never got around to watching it until now. I finally did, and I have to say-it was absolutely amazing! I really didn't expect it to be the kind of movie that it turned out to be, but I was pleasantly surprised in the best way possible.At first, the plot was a bit confusing, especially in the beginning, but that's totally normal. We, as the audience, know just as much as Neo (played by Keanu Reeves) at that point, so the confusion is intentional. But once everything starts to make sense, it's incredibly satisfying. The whole concept behind the movie is really unique, and it definitely makes you stop and think-what if the world actually worked like this?The practical effects are seriously impressive, and even the CGI still holds up remarkably well, especially considering the movie was made in 1999. It's clear a lot of care and attention to detail went into making everything look as cool as it does.All the action scenes are spectacular, but that final act? Wow! It's one of the most entertaining and exhilarating things I've watched in a long time. And let's not forget about the soundtrack-the music is incredible and really adds to the overall experience.Overall, this movie is an easy 5/5 for me. Everything about it-from the story to the action to the effects-was just spot-on. I can't wait to see if the sequels live up to the standard set by this one."
Buddy-51,"Oct 30, 1999",6/10,"As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives.  In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres.  Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner.  What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail.  Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality.  Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies.  We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention.  ""The Matrix""  borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time.  Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care."
ryanadavis-62779,"Sep 14, 2024",N/A,"The Matrix follows Neo, a computer hacker, who has always questioned the world around him. His suspicions are confirmed when Morpheus, a rebel leader, contacts him and reveals the truth to him.I just want to say this film is mind-blowing! I love this film! The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi films ever. Keanu Reeves is outstanding as Neo. The story is magnificent, the acting is outstanding, the action is brilliant and the characters are excellent. Neo is an outstanding character and Keanu Reeves plays him brilliant. The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi films and one of the best action films ever."
jpintar,"May 16, 2003",3/10,"This has to be the most overrated movie in sci-fi history.  It is way too long and the acting is stiff, especially Keanu ""get me a new facial expression"" Reeves.  Who cares about the special effects when the story is incoherent and uninteresting?  I certanly don't.  It disturbs me that many people consider this not only a great movie, but a classic!!!!  Did these people see the same movie I did.  I saw a dumb action movie with delusions of grandeur.  I say watch Star Wars again and see what real storytelling is all about."
bats915-455-219560,"May 26, 2025",9/10,"There are movies, and then there are moments. The Matrix isn't just a film-it's a cultural reset, a sci-fi milestone, and a philosophical punch to the face, all wrapped in black leather and slow-motion bullets. When it dropped in 1999, it didn't just blow minds-it rewired them. As a lifelong comic book and sci-fi geek, I can say without hesitation: this movie didn't just raise the bar-it was the bar.Let's start with the basics: the concept. A simulated reality controlled by machines where humanity lives in ignorance? That's pure Philip K. Dick territory, cyberpunk through and through, but the Wachowskis managed to take a dense philosophical premise and make it feel cool. Not just ""smart cool,"" but ""iconic cool."" The kind that burns itself into pop culture for decades. You don't have to fully grasp Baudrillard or the allegory of the cave to understand the red pill/blue pill choice. It's primal. It's relatable. It hits.Then there's the action. Sweet cybernetic Zeus, the action. Bullet time wasn't just a gimmick-it was a revolution. The rooftop shootouts, the lobby scene, the Neo-vs-Smith finale-they're kinetic ballet. Every punch, every dodge, every wall-run felt like a page ripped from a graphic novel brought to life with a kung fu twist. It's not just fight choreography-it's visual storytelling, and it changed the way action movies were made forever.Keanu Reeves as Neo? Perfection. He's not playing a traditional hero. He's us-the questioning, disconnected, searching self. And then he becomes something greater. His journey is classic hero's arc, but layered in existentialism and a hacker aesthetic. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity? Utterly badass. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus? That voice, that presence-like a cyberpunk Morpheus literally from mythology. And Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith? Cold, calculating, and unforgettable. His monologues are sinister poetry.The Wachowskis deserve a standing ovation for fusing anime, martial arts cinema, hacker culture, transhumanist theory, and slick noir into something cohesive and groundbreaking. They pulled from Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Neuromancer, The Invisibles, and poured it all into a blender that somehow created something fresh, daring, and absolutely electric.And let's not forget the soundtrack. Rage Against the Machine. Rob Zombie. Propellerheads. That soundtrack slapped so hard it practically had its own trench coat. It wasn't just music-it was attitude.The Matrix wasn't content to be another sci-fi action flick. It asked questions: What is real? What is control? What are you willing to risk to know the truth? It didn't just entertain-it made you think. It made you doubt. And it did it while flipping through the air in sunglasses and dodging bullets in slow motion.Bottom line: The Matrix is lightning in a bottle. It's a cyberpunk masterpiece, a philosophical mind-melt, and a cinematic revolution. If you love sci-fi, if you breathe comics, if your soul runs on digital dystopias and leather trench coats-this movie isn't optional. It's canon."
tempsjayjay,"May 28, 2019",10/10,Watched again recently and still stands up as one of the best movies ever!
dogg01,"Jul 19, 2000",8/10,"You walk into this film not knowing what the Matrix is. You take your seat and watch the trailers. The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema, knowing what the Matrix is.This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.You may notice in this review that I have not revealed what the Matrix is. Like the trailer says, 'You have to see it for yourself.'Excellent. Best film of '99. 9/10."

azbayarz,"Jun 8, 2019",10/10,"I was around 12 years old and watched it on Russian language first 20 times. So first 20 times I was stunned by the visual of the film, amazed by the craziness and awed by the fights. Years went by and finally I watched it on my mother tounge. I watched it 20 more times to get the grip of it. Years went by, Matrix still haunts me with its questions. Around 16 years old I read some theory and explanations of the film. Thats when I finally understood the 2/3 of the film. Matrix forced me the Red Pill on entertainment and films."
rik8888,"Dec 6, 1999",9/10,"Right there with Seven and Silence of the Lambs for me.  I love this film, and rate it a notch above some of the other great action films of our time (i.e., Terminator, Predator) because it has a really well thought out (although moderately unbelievable) story line.  A lot of thought provoking material, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't usually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. Enjoy!"
perica-43151,"Jul 20, 2018",7/10,"This movie is one giant plothole based take on some philosophical issues, that has proved to be hugely influential. Quite original for a Hollywood flick, it is often given more credit than it deserves. The giant plot hole is that using people as batteries makes absolutely no sense. Contrived in its core, it however delivers many themes and is a decent movie, and the influence it has ups its rating a bit. But lets not get over ourselves, this is not Terminator or other such gem, not by any stretch. Still, worth a watch."
Stevenuccj,"Oct 18, 2001",1/10,"Yeah, the effects were good.  But the story was just your basic, run-of-the-mill futuristic action script.  The character development is virtually non-existant, the acting is weak, and their are non plot twists that cannot be spotted a mile ahead.  The only reason this film is praised so much is because of the martial arts sequences and the effects i.e. the famous slow-motion bullet shots.  But the fact remains that this is a poor effort.  There is no outstanding reason to see this movie; there is no great acting.  The story is intriguing to sci-fi fans at first, but later on boils down to cliches and shootouts.  The ending is a cop-out just so more sequels can be milked out.If you want to see a great futuristic sci-fi film, see The 13th Floor.  You will notice the plot is very similar to that of The Matrix, except it is much more inventful about it, much better executed, and the ending will leave you thinking for months afterwards.  The ending in the Matrix, however, will leave you thinking ""What was so great about that?""  The answer, simply and disapointingly, is nothing."
VictoriaZillo,"Jan 25, 2019",10/10,"Still in 2019 a lot of people will this this movie as science fiction, I could watch it over and over and still discover need things and details that can relate to real life event.
The characters did an amazing job."
SnoopyStyle,"Nov 9, 2013",9/10,"The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible. They have squeezed every movie magic out of all the visual and computer effects."
DanielStephens1988,"Jul 25, 2019",10/10,"Reality is non-dual, which means that all boundaries, all categories, and all distinctions ultimately collapse, they're all relative. There is no distinction between inside/outside, me/other, right/wrong, black/white, human/non-human, all of these dualities will ultimately collapse.
Your mind constructs all these categories and distinctions. It is beneficial to see how most of the things taught in school, and adult life has just been categories that were constructed by the human mind. Many of these distinctions are purely conceptual, they're not absolute in any sense and that they ultimately all collapse into one unity."
johnfos,"Jun 11, 2005",9/10,"A large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. But, on reflection, part of the appeal is also its philosophical and religious underpinnings...When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path."
zfiany,"Mar 30, 2009",10/10,"I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!"
mansravald,"May 5, 2022",6/10,A little bit too dark and confusing in my opinion but I can see why so many people like it. The sci fi is spot on and the story is truly one of a special kind. However I found the movie a little bit boring and if you're not into action this one is not for you.
RachelG-2,"May 10, 2000",1/10,"Somewhere along the line, someone planning this film forgot to put in a plot.  It's worse than ""Twister"" in that respect.  Ooh look at all our fancy camera tricks and weapons and weird sci-fi stuff that really makes no sense. But it's loud!  And that makes a good film, you know.  And I would love, just once in my life, to see Keanu Reeves not play a blank-faced doofus in every movie he's made since ""Bill and Ted.""In short, I absolutely and totally hated this film.  My fiance loves it and watches it at least once a month, but I would rather clean out a cat box every hour for the rest of my life than ever see this film again."
sarfor-96084,"Mar 4, 2025",9/10,"In many ways the matrix is the perfect blockbuster. A high concept science fiction action thriller that has cutting edge special effects, groundbreaking action sequences, the coolest protagonist, a brilliant villain and a solid supporting cast. The opening sequence alone is better than most average blockbusters. This film transcended the art of film and visual storytelling to unprecedented levels. So much deep, rich, metaphorical and esoteric subtext, a multilayered film that works as a thinking man's film and as a well crafted action thriller. Its impact is and relevance is undeniable. A cinematic masterpiece."

You gonna want to see it again and again Keanu reeves is just marvelous in this movies and The Wachowskis brother dude hats off to you all the narative you show us with all the elements uuh still cant get over it!!Good job to editor sound designer , actors, directors , model makers.. and every one who put effort into this masterpiece."
AJmcelroy85,"Sep 24, 2024",10/10,"This film is iconic and was truly ahead of its time.What sets The Matrix apart is its innovative visual effects, like the iconic ""bullet-time"" shots, and its unique fusion of genres, combining kung fu, cyberpunk, and existential philosophy. Beyond the cool fight scenes, the film explores profound themes like free will, the nature of reality, and the dangers of unchecked technology, making it both a visual spectacle and an intellectual experience. It's a movie that pushed boundaries and remains relevant even decades later.Set in a dystopian future where humanity unknowingly lives in a simulated reality controlled by machines, the film follows Neo (Keanu Reeves) as he learns the truth and fights to free humanity.It's inspiring, eye-opening, and makes you question many aspects of life."
LeonE-0,"Apr 6, 2025",10/10,"I could have easily rated The Matrix a 9, but if you are a person who believes in something more; something above you (and around you), then you will understand why I give The Matrix a 10. When you see it you will either understand the 10/10 or you just won't, but anyone who rates The Matrix below a nine doesn't care about purpose in movies and only cares about what can trigger the biggest amount of dopamine release. It has an incredibly perfect plot, it has purpose and it is cinematically well executed, too. I like to imagine how it would be like if Christopher Nolan or some other exceptional director would have made it, but I doubt it would be significantly better. This is and will always be one of my favourite movies. When you watch it, look for signs. If you are interested in movies and you are experienced with cinema, you will like the movie."
dbz19852004,"May 30, 2024",10/10,"The greatest film of all time, exceeded my expectations, a thrill ride from start to finish, seen the film 179 times, and I will watch the film 179 more times, I'm not a sci-fi kind of guy, but this is the first film that introduced me to the genre, the special effects still hold to up to this day, I can watch the film from the first frame, all the way til the very end of the credits, the music goes well with the film. If you plan on going to film school, I highly recommend watching this film for inspiration, filmmaking 101, I can't find any negative thing to say about this film, I can watch this film all day, every day, I tend to use dialogue from this film in everyday life.... WHOA......."

TxMike,"Sep 30, 1999",N/A,"December 2019 update. My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD. Isn't it amazing how much stuff they get on that small disc that only holds about 70 minutes of music in its CD version!!"
Donjon_the_2nd,"Apr 25, 2004",7/10,"If you are some small programmer working for some big company, doing all day the same stupid work you might fall for the idea that your life is not as boring and senseless as it seems (and maybe actually is), but that you are in fact the god and creator of this world. The normal reaction should be: Turn that computer off, take a vacation, maybe seek professional help. You can also make a movie...Matrix is not boring, it`s tense and it has stunning visuals. But like a good video clip does not make the music worth listening to, a whole bunch of special effects do not make a great movie.After watching the Matrix I recognized that:1. I don't get why super-robots, who overwhelmed the whole human kind, are not able to build some nuclear power plants, despite the fact that they really needn't care about radioactive pollution. Instead they get their energy from humans, and if you take a look at their body ""farms""  you must agree that it looks like they are putting a lot more energy into it than they get out of it... A good movie (even if it's science fiction) should provide some ground level logic in its story.2. I did not care about the characters. They die? Hmmm, okay. Trinity loves Neo? Uh, why is that? Did I miss something? A good movie makes me feel for the characters and understand their reactions. In this point Matrix is a total failure. Ever watched Brazil? You maybe should if you'd like to see a good ""big brother"" picture.3. This pseudo religious bla bla. Realize that there is no spoon? I realized that there is something else missing somewhere in the story writers head. Well, wouldn't be so bad, if there weren't point 1 and 2.4. This background theme of being something better than the others. Uh, am I really just some role playing games liking informatics student? Or am I the master of the universe? Look in the mirror, decide for yourself...does not look like Keanu Reeves? What a surprise.Watch this movie, it won't bore you. But if you think your going to see a REALLY good movie, or even a masterpiece, keep away from it. You will be quite disappointed afterwards.Ah, and if you like MTV...this is the best movie ever made. ;)5/10"
pinkrobot3021,"Feb 9, 2004",5/10,"The whole premise of THE MATRIX is flawed.  The machines are using humans as a power source - WHAT?  Yes, humans, and all animals, radiate heat, but they never radiate more energy than they consume.  Any physicist will tell you that it will take more energy to produce food and transport it to the humans than will ever be gotten from the humans.  The humans are an energy sink. It doesn't matter how high-tech the machines supposedly are.  You can't overcome the laws of thermodynamics."
d1_4s,"Dec 12, 2024",10/10,"The Matrix is, without a doubt, my favorite movie ever. I've watched it countless times, and every time, it feels just as fresh and exciting as the first. I gave it a 10/10 because it's not only a thrilling action-packed experience but also a thought-provoking journey that changed how I look at the world. The moment Neo takes the red pill and enters the real world is one of those cinematic moments that stays with you forever. It made me question the very nature of reality-an idea that still fascinates me today.The action scenes in The Matrix are legendary, and the groundbreaking ""bullet time"" effect blew my mind the first time I saw it. The fight choreography is stunningly fluid, and every punch, every kick, feels like part of a larger narrative about freedom, self-discovery, and the human spirit. But it's not just the action that draws me in-it's how the film uses these moments to explore deeper philosophical questions about reality, free will, and identity. The world-building is incredible, and the mix of sci-fi, cyberpunk aesthetics, and philosophy creates something timeless.Keanu Reeves gives one of his best performances as Neo, playing the confused hacker turned reluctant hero with sincerity and depth. Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is wise and compelling, and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity brings a perfect balance of strength and vulnerability. Their chemistry feels real, making the characters' struggles and victories even more impactful.Every time I watch The Matrix, I discover something new. The movie's layers of meaning and intricate details keep me coming back for more, and each viewing seems to add another level of appreciation for its complex narrative. What really sets this movie apart, though, is its ability to entertain while challenging viewers to think deeply about the world around them. It's not just a movie I love-it's one that has had a lasting impact on my perspective.The Matrix is more than just a sci-fi action film-it's an experience that reshapes your understanding of reality. Even after all these years, it remains a timeless masterpiece, and without a doubt, it will always be my number one film."
premrjaiswal-38681,"Aug 19, 2024",9/10,"The movie seems amazed everyone. It seems better then expectation. Box office collection was too good as world wide and this is once in a decade kind of movie. I'd recommend everyone to watch this one time.This one has been distributed across the world as on the large amount and one of the best movie of his.As I have his other movie too like John wick, seems greatest of all time and by the season to season it leaves an amazing experience for all of us. I have seen all the chapters of this movie and I can watch it many times as the action seems unlimited and the love for the car and dog that inspires everyone. People can take inspiration from this movie."

emvel,"Mar 21, 2024",10/10,"25TH ANNIVERSARY THEATRICAL RE-RELEASE REVIEW - Let me tell you what I believe. I believe that this is cinema. It was cinema back then in 1999, and 25 years later in the year 2024, it's still cinema. There are many great films out there, and I've given some of them a 10/10. However, if there's 1 film that stands above them all, it's The Matrix - my favorite film of all time. I think I had already seen it 5 times, and for my 6th time, I finally saw it in a movie theater. The film really shows that no matter what kind of world we live in, we can make our own choices. Some of them may be good or bad, but there's still that freedom of thought...which can be freedom of action - or in my case, the freedom of telling people that The Matrix is my favorite film of all time even when flaws are pointed out. Pretty much every film I've seen has flaws like ""why can't they suddenly do that thing?"" or ""why is this subplot randomly added?"" The Matrix is no different, but it's still something very special and easily a timeless classic. Score: 10/10."
VulaneMthembu,"Aug 26, 2024",10/10,"!n 1999, I was in high school. A trailer on a popular South African show called screenplay which was hosted by Barry Ronge appeared featuring the now ubiquoius bullet time. My mind was blown.What John Gaeta and the Wachoswskis achieved back then is nothing short of gargantuan. The matrix transformed media as we know it owing to its technical achievements as well as its pioneering cinematic technical showcase.Based in part on the japanese anime classic Ghost In the shell we were presented with a luve action spectacle loose adaptation comprising of the broad ideas and conceptual exploration of the former as well as philosophical musings."
MattUK,"Oct 14, 2002",N/A,"What am I supposed to say about this film?Pure and simple, it is a blast. It is about someone discovering his own invincibility though he certainly doesn't feel invincible to start with.It's about working out the definition of real - the character Cypher throws us an interesting questionWith the real world now ruined, what exactly are the rebels fighting for -and in all honesty with a straight choice between the 'real world' in this film and the Matrix - how many of us would abandon the Matrix?"
senseset,"Nov 22, 2024",7/10,"Good film. The humans are planted, so why need to give them a matrix? All they need to do is just find a way to keep the human energy alive. The film is so pretentious, and has this confidence that is smart, but has one of the most cop out endings in a blockbuster movie. Trinity saves Neo with the power of love. How is something like that left in a ""cerebral"", ""philosophical"" movie, when it has an ending that belongs in fairy tales? It's stupid, forced and doesn't add up. So for all the rant this review has, is the film terrible? Not quite. In fact, it's a decent movie with some clever ideas and analogies, and props for having a major impact on film making and actually trying to do something different in the action genre as well as blockbuster movies, but it's not really the masterpiece it is claimed to be. It's outdated and is deeply flawed. But to some extent, it is understandable why many people love it."
allah_is_mighty,"Sep 5, 2009",2/10,"With its trite Kafka-wannabe subtext and pretensions to profundity, this badly acted (Reeves is like a lump of wood, with a permanently perplexed look on his dumb face), poorly scripted, mess of a movie had me yawning and, at times, bristling with irritation. The stupid, faux philosophy about different realities was clearly ripped from a film called Dark City, which was far more chilling and unhinged, and managed to steer clear of the juvenile philosophical clap-trap that infected The Matrix (even the title is lame).Its only saving grace was some innovatory and influential action sequences and a good Don Davis score.But the action eventually seemed to contrive to divert the viewer from the paucity of original ideas exhibited, and culminated in a ridiculous, Dodge City-style shoot 'em up that had me laughing out loud. Then Neo turns into Superman: yep,s-o-o-o original. Then there's the bit where Neo is resurrected by the kiss by Trinity. It's ET and Snow White and every other now-predictable cliché in the cannon of story telling. To top that Fishburne's character whispers in hushed awe: ""He's The One"". I would have laughed if it wasn't so pathetic.In another comment someone described this and the sci-fi benchmark for all others to follow. Excuse me?! Show some me actual science in this muddled subterranean labyrinth, then I might reconsider. I won't even comment on the ensuing two movies,with the preposterous Christ fixation that dominated the third. Horrible, style-over-content rubbish."
leftwichzachary,"Aug 15, 2024",10/10,"I was probably a little young to truely grasp the complexity of the film at 13 but I do remember enjoying it. I've seen bits and pieces of it over the years on TV but hadn't really sat down to watch if again properly until now having bought The Matrix Trilogy on Blu-ray. The movie is still a great sci-fi flick and worthy of being called one of the best. The fights scenes, although a little slow this day and age, are well choreographed and heavy hitting - I particularly enjoy when people get thrown against or through walls and this movie has plenty of that! The bullet time effects and slow motion shots still hold up, and even though other films have copied it, The Matrix was the original and still does it better if you ask me. The storyline still feels futuristic even after 21 years and the CGI, although looking a tad dated, is still pretty sharp mostly (better than what was in the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, oddly). The story can get a little confusing at times for new comers, infact there were things in this viewing that I had not picked up on or understood previously so just one viewing may not be enough to truely appreciate the film. The one thing the film didn't do for me however was the emotional relationships - I liked the characters, but the relationship between Neo and Trinity felt a bit forced for my liking. My favourite scene is the fight in the Subway between Agent Smith and Neo - it was a great lead in and a very back and foward encounter with neither man truely gaining the upperhand.Final Verdict: it's hard to fault such a genre defining film as The Matrix. The fights still look great, the story maintains a futuristic feel and it's surprisingly deep. But it is starting to show it's age ever so slightly with the action feeling slow and CGI looking a little bland. Still highly recommended!"
TaylorMadeTakes,"Oct 15, 2025",10/10,"The Matrix isn't just science fiction, it's cinematic evolution. Every frame feels deliberate, every idea electrified with purpose. The Wachowskis built a world that fuses philosophy with pulse-pounding action, and the result still feels revolutionary. The performances are iconic, the visuals timeless, and the story complete even without the sequels. It doesn't just hold up, it still bends the rules."
Sweety555,"Sep 1, 2024",9/10,"""The Matrix,"" released in 1999, is a cinematic masterpiece that redefined the science fiction genre and left an indelible mark on popular culture. Directed by the Wachowskis, this film brilliantly blends philosophical questions with groundbreaking visual effects, creating an immersive experience that challenges viewers' perceptions of reality.The story follows Neo (Keanu Reeves), a hacker who discovers that the world he knows is an elaborate simulation created by machines to subdue humanity. As he joins a group of rebels led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Neo embarks on a journey to free the human race from this artificial prison.The film's visual effects, particularly the ""bullet time"" sequences, revolutionized action cinema and set new standards for what was possible in filmmaking. The iconic green-tinted digital world and the stark contrast between the simulated and real worlds are visually stunning and symbolically rich.""The Matrix"" is more than just an action-packed spectacle; it delves into profound themes such as free will, reality, and the nature of existence. Its philosophical underpinnings, inspired by thinkers like Descartes and Baudrillard, invite viewers to question the very fabric of their own lives.Keanu Reeves delivers a career-defining performance as Neo, perfectly capturing the character's transformation from a confused hacker to a confident savior. The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity and Hugo Weaving as the menacing Agent Smith, also shine in their respective roles.In conclusion, ""The Matrix"" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that continues to resonate with audiences two decades after its release. It is a timeless exploration of reality and perception, and a must-see for anyone who appreciates cinema that challenges the mind while dazzling the senses."
gavinpiliczky,"Aug 6, 2021",10/10,"I remember leaving the cinema in my teens all those years ago and thinking ""Holy cow, that was incredible"" This movie is a timeless science fiction classic. It has an excellent mind bending concept that will leave you questioning your own reality. The cinematography is great, the special effects are excellent for there time and still hold their weight now, the acting is superb, the music score is something to drool over. Ladies and gentlemen this is a masterpiece of a movie and must be watched."
danyinfantino,"Jul 29, 2020",10/10,"This movie really stands the test of time. Today, 21 years later and at least 11 years since i saw it last time, it still holds up perfectly. The story, the visuals, the tone."
Rockshow2310,"May 13, 2024",10/10,"I was 9 years old when I first saw this movie, and it stayed in my mind to this day almost 25 years later. I am writing this review from a nostalgia-based stand point, so it's very subjective. This movie had amazing special practical effects that fit perfectly with the movie's atmosphere and story... i wish films nowadays relied more on practical versus CGI. The cast of Matrix was chosen perfectly in my opinion, and the lead by Keanu Reeves is a 10/10 perfect performance. This is definitely one of the best movies I ever saw in my life and I hold it very dear to my heart. The soundtrack is a perfect match with the tone of the movie."
bob the moo,"Jun 20, 2002",N/A,"Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day.  When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police.  However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy.  Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods.  Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.Has anyone not seen this?  The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero.  That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones.  The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing.  The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake.  Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.The action is fantastic.  After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here.  Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels.  The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT.  The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too).  Reeves is cool and is suited to the role.  Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on?  Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on.  Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden.  Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc.  How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted.  The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree.  However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch.  For me  I can't wait for the sequels."
kewlconner,"Jul 14, 2022",6/10,"This title pretty much seems up all of my thoughts on the film, which is quite overrated, but it was a revolutionary film, and the effects mostly hold up, but the ending just isn't my style. It was honestly kind of bad, and ruined an already meh film."
Soujiro,"May 6, 2001",5/10,"The good: The action scenes involving guns are original. The ""frozen moment"" camera effect is well done.The bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional.The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad.This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value. A truly mind-numbing movie."
BA_Harrison,"Nov 14, 2009",10/10,"With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.What a shame they had to go and make those sequels!"
Adam-09265,"May 30, 2019",9/10,"The Matrix was made at a time where special effects were reaching more and more to their peak and because of that along with story, the Wachowski brothers (now sisters) were able to create a breakthrough in movie history.The Matrix is pure art."
view_and_review,"Jan 21, 2007",9/10,"Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue."
Sam_M_Antony,"Jan 4, 2021",10/10,I can give 100 put of 10 if that's possible. This movie created a benchmark which I believe has not being met with any other film yet. When think of it you really get the feeling how this story was way ahead of it's time. It's still easily ahead of most Sci-Fi movies. This is a must watch movie for any kind of movie lover. It's is a masterpiece in it's own way. It's not for everyone as the idea itself is only for particular type of movie fans.This is a movie way ahead of it's time. It's still a better movie than most of the movies we got to see in 2020 which had better technology! Some of the effects are way cooler than many recent movies. The action sequences use way better CGI than any recent movies we saw in 2020 or any other recent movies. It's full action packed and the effects they used is way ahead of their time.Recommending this to be added to your must have must watchlist.

Manthorpe,"Jun 23, 2004",6/10,"One of the most overrated films of ALL TIME, if not THE most overrated film of all time. Why people love this movie so much completely baffles me. I realize that different people have different opinions and tastes but even some fellow reviewers here that have comparable tastes to mine praise this film to my astonishment. There isn't anything great here, so why all the fuss? It's not original, and if you think it is you didn't see Dark City or a slew of others....the story is very slow, it's pretentious beyond words, and the acting is absolutely terrible to the point that it's hard to sit through without wanting to bite a running chainsaw, all thanks to the abysmally talented Reeves and Laurence Lamprey aka Cowboy Curtis. The ending is also weak, and don't tell me it's because they had planned on making a sequel because movies should be able to stand alone.....and don't even get me started on the sequels. At least they're not too overrated. I have felt this way since 1999 when it came out and I went to see it in the theater. When it was finally over, I said, ""That's it?!""Let's go over this piece, shall we? People praise this film for it's fight choreography, when the people fighting are tools like Fishburne and Reeves. Are you serious? I can't help but to laugh out loud at Keanu in the dojo training scene with Lamprey. He looks like he's got a Klingon dagger rammed up his butt! This is the ""One""?! I can't think of anyone more miscast. Actually, I can't think of a film where he wouldn't be miscast. True, a lot of my discontent with this film comes from the actors, but even with decent actors I still think it would've failed. The story is also sloppy and filled with more useless techno-babble than a quantum-physics book from Brent Spiner's ""Data"" from the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. To sum it up, it doesn't make any sense. People as batteries? OK. For a movie that spouts so much techno-babble at you, it's not very technical. It's all a red herring.My biggest problem with the people that like this film is that they praise it for it's originality when that could not be further from the truth. Do your research or just watch more movies and you'll begin to realize that this film is nothing more than a long list of rip-offs from others films....and it gets the credit for all of it. This isn't the film's fault, it's the uneducated fans....the same fans responsible for it's ridiculously lofty rating here at IMDb. I think the rip-offs were intentional personally, and I don't think even the Wachowski brothers thought it'd be as successful as it was because of it.Criminally overrated....and will not stand the test of time. The epitome of the phrase, ""Style over substance."" Just another summer blockbuster.It's a lot like Pokemon. People like it, but I can't understand why....and I don't think they do either. I think this will just be another fad. Time will tell."
audiophile,"Dec 26, 2003",3/10,"The Matrix is the first installment of a ""trilogy"" of sci-fi movies. In fact, it's not really a trilogy, in an organic sense, it's just a movie and its sequels.Anyway, ""The Matrix"" is a film with good premises, but bad developments. Although most of the ideas of the film were taken from sci-fi writers of the 60's and philosophers of the past (the idea that we exist as a thought, or a dream, goes back to Plato at least), the script did a good job in putting these ideas together in a modern plot (at least as for year 2000). The oniric influence of recent sci-fi comic books on the film is visible throughout and is what makes the visual appeal of the film.Unfortunately, what could have been a really good movie has been turned by the W. brothers into an average action flick targetted at 15 year-old boys, among which must belong the guys who wrote this flick is the ""best movie"" they've seen. There is almost no acting, and the heros wearing sunglasses all the time is a good way to avoid any sort of emotion to show on their faces. This total absence of emotion is one of the reasons why nobody gives a f..k whether or not everyone dies in the sequels.The W. brothers have a strong tendency to show off : heroes wearing sunglasses and Armani black leather coats designed for yuppies, trendy night-club population, ""bullet time"" special FX, (ugly) kung fu video game action, heavy metal and techno music during the whole film, etc. All this is supposed to make the film look ""kewwwwl"". In opposition to the heros, the agent Smith wears a dark working suit : he is not cool (although he also wears sunglasses, but that's because he is a spy agent).But what really turns me off is the pretense of the religioso-philosophico-technobabble which hardly hides the vacuity of the characters and the serious weaknesses of the script. There are so many other films which say much more with less, that this film looks highly overblown in comparison.I'm not even trying to elaborate on the sequels, which, instead of correcting these problems, show them in their full splendor.In a word, this flick is highly overrated. But hey, who cares ? The ""trilogy"" has ripped off enough spectators to make the Warner happy."
Xstal,"Aug 22, 2020",9/10,We gorge on the binaries prophesied through an ever increasing bandwidth as we exponentially widen our dietary desire to become what everyone wants us to be without thought for who or what we really are or could be.
Skeletors_Hood,"Nov 9, 2001",10/10,"The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.But...is that all it is?No.  It isn't.When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb.  They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.Here's why.  Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another.  ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version.  The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point.  No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue.  Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage.  The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""Okay, stop yawning.Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ).  I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on.  But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave.""  In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other.  Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows.  You leave them in this cave for 20 years.  The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall.  They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world.  Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile.  He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc.  If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did.  He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave.  But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.WHEW!!That's the basic story in the Matrix.  Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave.  The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see.  When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is."
Boba_Fett1138,"Mar 26, 2006",10/10,"""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

wiserkid7,"Jan 19, 2019",10/10,"When The Matrix first came out, I was way too young to appreciate its beauty. Inside, the film began unravelling layers of reality. Like an onion. And like an onion, it potency is unmatched in its own family of similar genre'd films. It begins, as society shapes the roles we play within in. A cycle, hopelessly dependant on the system, but slowly and surely, we learn the truth. And from there on, the rest is history. My go to film, no matter what the mood. A titan of a film, and the best film ever made, in my opinion."

dltdvd,"Feb 15, 2002",7/10,"When I first saw the Matrix a few years ago, I thought it was a pretty good flick, but as I watched it more and more, I began to realize that the film ripped off from a variety of films such as the computer-animated masterpiece Tron and the intelligent action film Face/Off to name a few. Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made. Overall, the Matrix is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen and had more attention than it actually deserved. Grade: D"
Danimal-7,"Aug 23, 1999",5/10,"The first half of THE MATRIX is pretty darn good.  After a bizarre and surreal action sequence where the black-clad Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) displays superhuman abilities in eluding some Men In Black who also have superhuman abilities, we meet the plot.  He is called Neo (Keanu Reeves), who finds himself being contacted by two seemingly omniscient characters: the aforementioned Trinity and a man called Morpheus whom we at first know only by his voice.  They try, not always successfully, to guide Neo out of the danger posed by the Men In Black (who we learn are called Agents, but Men In Black gives you a better idea of what they look like).The movie to this point is great fun, with a palpable aura of mystery making your pulse pound as you wonder what the explanation is for what's happening to Neo.  Better yet, the explanation we get from Morpheus is actually moderately imaginative and makes at least some sense (although one wonders how humans can live without a solar-based food chain beneath them; I can't explain more without giving too much away).Unfortunately, at this point, THE MATRIX is only halfway done.  The second half is a nonstop pastiche of action cliches and mystical mumbo-jumbo, as Neo, supposedly the most important person in the world for Morpheus to find, actually achieves very little other than to become your routine Hollywood superhero and pull off a depressingly prosaic rescue mission.  Characters come back from the dead literally by magic, or with no explanation at all. The action sequences are competently done, with an eerie musical backdrop sounded out by cartridge cases clinking against the floor, but they can't disguise the essential problem: THE MATRIX runs out of plot an hour before it ends.Keanu Reeves is not improving with age; the way he expresses disbelief will have you expressing your own disbelief, and there is no chemistry between him and the attractive Moss.  Laurence Fishburne's character is poorly sketched, leaving him nothing to do except be very, very cool, but he does that very well.  Moss does her action scenes with verve, but delivers her dialogue weakly.  Hugo Weaving, playing one of the Men In Black, is sinister, inhuman, and a lot of fun to watch.  A number of supporting characters who assist Trinity and Morpheus are well played.Regrettably, THE MATRIX is yet another case of Hollywood putting excellent production values into creating a half-baked story.  The same themes were much better examined just last year, in THE TRUMAN SHOW and DARK CITY.  And by no means does this film deserve comparison to BLADE RUNNER, whose plot dealt with the line between man and machine in a way that this movie never approaches.  THE MATRIX is mildly entertaining, but still greatly overrated.Rating: ** out of ****."
billion_mucks,"Nov 20, 2007",10/10,"Strangely, Matrix is one of the few action films that open my brain to deep, profound thinking while at the same time it magnetizes me with the most brutally good action scenes. Putting together the thinking line of the new generation, where we are just but pawns in a system we don't understand or belong, Matrix also borrows a lot of the oriental culture with the fights and it's inner travel over the nature of Life.Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.Brawn mixed with brains. The Matrix IS the science fiction film. With a perfect script that drowns so profoundly into the true nature of things, and with major, Industrial high tech digital action, I will ask you this if you haven't seen the movie:-What are you doing reading this instead??"

akdjreview,"Dec 18, 2021",10/10,"The Matrix is groundbreaking and the start of the modern-day effects we see today. From everything to the action, to the acting, to the beautiful cinematography. The Matrix flourishes and perfects everything there is. The film is the beginning of modern-day effects and action and many movies have taken inspiration from it.The storyline manages to capture the audience interest from the get go. Containing a storyline that makes you think and question your own reality to induce questions you might not have thought about before. Every single scene serves its purpose meanwhile every single scene is incredibly thought out, with no unnecessary scenes.With incredibly thought out scenes comes beautifully filmed scenes that are nothing less than eye-catching. There are so many scenes that are well done from a film perspective. With beautiful use of colours, to incredibly used angles that manages to capture different feelings.The action is nothing short of incredible. The start of the action movies that will come in the 2000s, The Matrix is an inspiration. With awesome action scenes that capture intense fighting, while also keeping you on your toes it's nothing but amazing.The Matrix is one of the best movies there is with very little to no negative things to say about it. I highly recommend everyone to watch it with the promise that you won't be disappointed."
layla_silver7,"Feb 11, 2024",10/10,"The matrix is a dystopian science fiction film with a plot that questions reality, and that's about all I can say without spoilers. The film is instantly engaging, and when you reach the ultimate plot twist, you will be on the edge of your seat. Not only is the idea of the film incredible, but it is brought to life flawlessly. The film, which is directed by the Wachowskis, is stunning to watch; the visuals definitely add to the dystopian tone of the film. Almost every shot has some kind of reflection, depth, or color contrast to make the science fiction even cooler. The film editing is also incredible and makes every action sequence amazing to watch. The visual effects are also amazing, especially for 1999. This is a must-see sci-fi film."

Horror-yo,"Apr 9, 2011",10/10,"How could anyone claim that for any movie ? How pretentious am I to impose this premise ? Everybody's different, so no one movie could ever be the goat...uhhhhh...wrong, but at least consider this:Such a profound and multi-faceted metaphor about Life, existence.Script, acting, settings, scene transition and sequencing, music are simply paradigmatic for this style of dark, cyberpunk epic and cinema in general.Crescendos/build-ups are chilling to the bone, fighting/acting scenes unique (not only is this film ahead of all others conceptually, but it is also supremely brilliant visually - bullet time, a huge cinematic technical innovation) + superb camera angles.Classic myths/ideologies/religious transfiguration/philosophy:Man vs Machine; a post-apocalyptic dystopian future; Plato's cavern allegory; Kant's phenomenon/noumenon (things as we see them/things as they are); Jesus Christ and his super-human abilities/prophetic fulfillment- myth and concept of the Oracle, Resurrection and salutatory function; Judas, Betrayer; the Choice (blue and red pill scene); Man mechanizing (think Neo's metamorphosis and holes); and the magnificent ""Sleeping Beauty"" theme, when in all hope fading, Love and Destiny collide and bring the One to the Matrix. Also: the names, Morpheus (Greek God of Sleep), Neo (anagram of ""One""), Trinity...Roughly all main genres in literature/cinema/art/story telling: drama, action, humor, horror, psychological thriller, conceptual piece....yes, all those, think deep.Personal note: all plots, sub-plots are easy to follow and digest, yet the multi-layered nature of this opus will have you benefiting from a few re-watches. Philosophically, this movie is mature, and deep; to not be too complex for the viewing masses, not too cliché and typically Hollywood for the practicing partisans.Not to even mention this movie created an entire sub-culture, cult following; ""what is the Matrix ?""."
wendte,"Mar 10, 1999",10/10,"(As an avid film critic and reviewer, I got the chance to see this film among other critics and lucky people in late Feburary.).Andy and Larry Wachowski have done it again. With their chilling, dark film ""Bound"", which they directed and written, I knew I was going to expect another fantastic presentation. ""The Matrix"" completely blew me away.I got the announcement about this film over three years ago, and I was curious to see what ""The Matrix"" really was, but information was far too limited, leaving me only the names of the people behind the magic. However, it creeped up through the neighborhood and slapped me in the face, yelling, ""Damnit! Look at me!"" Look at it I did, and I am stilling pondering about ""The Matrix.""""The Matrix"" stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Carrie-Ann Moss, and Joe Pantoliano, among others. I have tracked Fishburn's acting career since his infamous role on ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"" as ""Cowboy Curtis,"" and I must say, I am amazed once again. Fishburn with the rest of the actors/actresses perform stunningly, and leave you wanting more.But what is this Matrix I keep rambling on about? Well, as Fishburn states, ""Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" That is exactly what you need to do to decipher ""The Matrix.""Although I promised myself not to let out too much information on this film, I have permitted myself to blabber on about what this film has done. It has done far past my expectations in technology. The slick movements by the characters, and the martial arts are amazing. Obviously, a lot of work has been put into this film, and work has done it good.Another point about this film that may be brought to your surprise. The actual fight scenes, twirling about, action scenes, and so on, were conducted by the actors themselves, not stuntmen, which also adds another nice touch to realism. The training that the actors must have gone through has to be appreciated from this film.Now, after viewing this film, you may decide, ""Oh jeez. I thought I was in for something. This is just another Hollywood show-off of an old, repetitive storyline."" Well, may-be, but ""The Matrix"" has an insightful and nice touch to its storyline. It brings it out in a unique way that no film has brought before. That is why it stands out.""The Matrix"" is a marvel among movies. This may not get an Oscar or two, but it definitely stands out among other films. ""The Matrix"" cannot be explained unless seen, so for you to discover the mystery behind ""The Matrix"", you have to see it, to believe it."
LeonLouisRicci,"Nov 13, 2012",10/10,"Ultra-stylish Techno-Noir classic that is broad on concept and design and creates a novel realm of realism vs cerebral creation. This is groundbreaking visual stuff and is backed by extraordinary electronic/metal music and really cool sets.It is a visual and literal ""Rage Against the Machine"" that is fully realized in its display of a deadpan humor and dead-on violence. This was the ride of the decade and brought a new look to the new millennium.It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.The whole concept of a Messiah and ""The One"" is kind of elementary in an extreme exploitation such as this but that only drops it a notch from the best of Sci-Fi and does nothing to hold this exhilarating experience back from being quite entertaining, if on a lesser level."

Tomsdoingstuff,"Jun 24, 2019",10/10,"If you are looking for the answer to this question then you are going to find it in the 1999 masterpiece from The Wachowski brothers which watching in 2019 still feels like it could have comed out last week and you wouldn't really notice it's a 20 year old movie. Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise.
I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very brieflyThe story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could.
Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.)
Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.)
Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo."

It was quite boring to watch and contained no groundbreaking notions or idea.It is a film that has done well due to the time it was released. Had it been made and released today it would receive a fraction of its hype or praise.
freakroach,"Mar 27, 2016",10/10,"I think there were Action/Sci-Fi movies before The Matrix and there are action/sci-fi movies after The Matrix. It changed everything.This movie was one of it's kind when it came and there was nothing like this seen before. Awesome action sequences, bullet times, slow motions and the concept, everything was awesome.Not just action, the movie is great in other aspects too. The movie is thought provoking and very influential. This movie forced every filmmaker of action/sci-fi movies to step up.I still remember when i watched this movie for the very first time more than 10 years ago, it felt like i'm in a different world. I've never ever seen anything like this. Movie had awesome effects, that might seems outdated these days, but that time it was first time something like that was shown in movies.This movie was really a gamechanger, and we are lucky that this movie actually happened."

nickmaverickeudemonic,"Feb 23, 2025",10/10,"The Matrix follows Thomas Anderson, a programmer who goes by the hacker alias Neo (Keanu Reeves), as he uncovers the truth about his reality: it's a simulated construct controlled by machines that have enslaved humanity. Guided by the enigmatic Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the fierce Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Neo embraces his role as ""The One"" to fight back against the system.The movie's strength lies in its seamless blend of mind-bending philosophy and jaw-dropping action. The concept of a simulated reality wasn't entirely new, but ""The Matrix"" packaged it with such style-think leather trench coats, green digital rain, and that iconic red pill/blue pill dilemma-that it became a defining moment in pop culture. The action sequences, especially the ""bullet time"" slow-motion effects, were revolutionary at the time and set a new standard for choreography and visual effects in Hollywood.Keanu Reeves brings a quiet intensity to Neo, perfectly balancing vulnerability and heroism, while Fishburne's gravitas as Morpheus anchors the film's deeper questions about freedom and belief. The supporting cast, including Hugo Weaving as the chilling Agent Smith, adds layers of menace and intrigue. The pacing keeps you hooked, though some of the exposition-heavy dialogue might feel a bit dated today.It's not flawless-some plot holes (like how the machines' energy system really works) invite scrutiny, and the sequels muddied the waters-but as a standalone, ""The Matrix"" is a rare mix of brain food and adrenaline. It's a film that asks you to question reality while delivering a slick, entertaining ride. If you haven't seen it yet, it's worth a watch for its influence alone."
Cinemaniac1984,"Jul 19, 2024",9/10,"The Matrix set the benchmark for all science fiction movies upon its release back in 1999. One of the biggest blockbusters of the year, the movie received high acclaim with groundbreaking special effects (which also netted a well deserved Academy Award for Best Visual Effects), incredible stunts, action sequences, and a mindblowing story. It would also be one of the most memorable movies for Keanu Reeves as well as for Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving.Keanu Reeves plays computer hacker Thomas Anderson/Neo who finds himself drawn into an alternate reality where everything is not all what it seems. The big question is ""What is the Matrix?"", and what is real or is it a dream. He is drawn into the underground world by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) to the leader of the rebellion Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Neo's biggest threat is Agent Smith (delightfully played by Hugo Weaving) who is pursuing Neo, Morpheus and Trinity to eliminate any kind of resistance and exposure of their new reality.Directed by The Wachowskis, The Matrix also stars Joe Pantoliano, Belinda McClory, Robert Taylor, Gloria Foster, Marcus Chong, Julian Arahanga, Matt Doran, Anthony Ray Parker, and Paul Goddard.25 years on, The Matrix is still regarded as one of the best science fiction movies of all time and easily one of the best movies of the 90's. The visual effects which raised the bar very high in 1999 have also aged very well over time and it is still regarded as highly impressive and spectacular. It is also one of Keanu Reeves' most memorable movies right up with the Bill and Ted trilogy, Point Break (1991), Speed (1994) and the John Wick anthology. Unfortunately the sequels weren't the same and was met with a mixed reception by critics and audiences alike.Though The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions (both 2003) were box office hits, The Matrix Revolutions (2021) would be a forgettable box office flop.""This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.""The Matrix was a fantastic movie when I first saw it back in 1999 and it still is a fantastic movie 25 years later.9/10."

No enterprise ever shipped tea (!) 3000 miles (!) from India to a desolate island. Brits know better than to preach that humbug to adult people.

mbergh,"Feb 2, 2006",N/A,"This movie provides the opportunity for people who aren't able to understand a film of actual quality to have something to say. It has come to be a sort of common understanding that Matrix contains some philosophical truth or even reasoning. However, this is not the case. The theme of this movie is extremely unoriginal and it's attempts to discuss philosophy is a blunt self-blow.But, this movie is suitable for people who feel ashame of the fact that they are incapable of understanding more complicated films. Therefore it has come to be a consent between viewers of lower intellectual ability to evoke this film as soon as philosophy is mentioned.It is plainly speaking a film for people who doesn't like films in particular but needs something to cling on in conversations about film.Quite pathetic really. A consent of stupidity."

SoumikBanerjee1996,"Feb 6, 2022",9/10,"""What's he doing?""
""He's beginning to believe""When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.The Matrix had 'em all, as simple as that. A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word!"
actionmovielist,"Mar 26, 2024",10/10,"""The Matrix"" is a visually dazzling cyberadventure, full of kinetic excitement, but it retreats to formula just when it's getting interesting. It's kind of a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of reality, and ends with a shoot-out. We want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes with automatic weapons fire.I've seen dozens if not hundreds of these exercises in violence, which recycle the same tired ideas: Bad guys fire thousands of rounds, but are unable to hit the good guy. Then it's down to the final showdown between good and evil--a martial arts battle in which the good guy gets pounded until he's almost dead, before he finds the inner will to fight back. Been there, seen that (although rarely done this well)"
Eltonshot,"Aug 15, 2023",10/10,"This is the best film ever made, in my view. It really deserves 10 out of 10. Now, I will explain why. To begin with, it made an evolution in science fiction genre. Producers used tremendous effects according to its production year. They kept minimum, approximately none of logical mistakes,which makes movie a real and enjoyable. Afterward,actors do their jobs well. Next, scenery is really awesome. Sometimes I assume that how they can think the scenery like this. In addition, it is one of the films, everybody should watch every year. I ensure that you will get a rich variety of gains. Especially, it changed my entire life succesfully. Thanks who has a contribution to this masterpiece."
judybrennert,"Mar 18, 2022",9/10,"Still the basis of how you kick off a revolution in film, with a distinct style and tone, it is unapologetic of how movies should be, rather it is original to the core taking the best of what we know and creating a hero's journey like no other.

lajuana-55206,"Feb 28, 2024",10/10,"The Matrix (1999) is a groundbreaking, thought-provoking sci-fi masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the genre. I like this movie a lot. Its captivating story, innovative visuals and memorable characters have solidified its place as a timeless classic. The movie follows Thomas Anderson, aka Neo (Keanu Reeves), as he uncovers the truth about the world and his role in the ultimate battle between humans and machines. In my opinion the Wachowskis' direction is top-notch, with stunning action sequences and a gripping narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. What i most like is the special effects with including the iconic ""bullet time"" scenes, remain impressive even by today's standards. Am i right or what? The talented cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving delivers strong performances, making the characters relatable and engaging. The Matrix is a must-watch for SCI-FI fans and a landmark film that continues to inspire and influence the genre. I like this movie and give full 10 stars. Must watch movie of all time."
jamsbarlker,"Nov 16, 2021",10/10,"The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci-Fi Action Film ever !It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen.The slow-motion ""bullet-time"" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, ""Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing.""Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting.Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job.The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopia atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly."
Sonatine97,"Aug 27, 2001",7/10,"I really cannot understand the hype & gushing praise for this sfx/cgi gloated film.The story is routine - a contemporary mix of Men In Black, Tron and a shedload of other ""10 seconds to go before the world is destroyed"" movies.The principle idea of a make-believe world called The Matrix, a world where we all live totally oblivious to the fact that this world is totally artificial and controlled by machines, could have been immensely interesting in the hands of a better set of scriptwriters & directors. In any case this kind of story isn't a million miles away from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, a book far more interesting than this rubbish.For the sake of a good story the Wachoowski Brothers (writers & directors) went all gooey for lots of cgi to distract the viewer with the many plotholes and poor character development. The story simply gets in the way of a good sfx. And on and on it goes, each cgi trying to out ""wow"" the previous effect to the point where you wonder whether this is nothing more than an expensive computer game.People went wild when we saw our heroes climb up walls, jump huge rooftops & dodge speeding bullets in slowmo. But so what? I feel we have become so blaise about cgi that only our imagination limits us to what we think is possible. And the cgi in this film no longer had the same kind of ""jaw dropping"" effect as one witnessed in Star Wars, Terminator 2 or even 2001:Space Odyssey.Our superheroes, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne & Carrie Annie Moss, looked like bit players compared to the computer bits making up the over indulgent CGIs. Fishbourne tries to come over all cool & hip, but looks fairly average when asked to do anything remotely interesting; Reeves acts just like...well...Reeves, with that usual ""no one's home"" expression & designer jackets. While Moss hops in & out of the movie when it looks as if the going's getting a bit tough for Reeves, resulting in an ending ripped straight from Luc Besson's 5th Element!This film lives off its own hype & marketing, and already looks dated. Once you've viewed the film more than a couple of times and got used to the sfx you then want to look for more depth only to find that its only the sfx that holds the film together.BAD!**/*****"
JGerber-2,"Aug 25, 1999",1/10,"I made every effort to be open minded about ""The Matrix."" I put aside such questions as ""Why does Hollywood see Keanu as a cyberpunk? How came everyone is making making a big deal about these fx which you can see in shampoo commercials?"" I can honestly say I gave it every chance. The fact that the creators were trying to create fully developed worldview was admirable, and the movies surprises hadn't yet been revealed.So as the movie rolled, and I got too see one of the worst, most painful movies I have ever seen, I could honestly say it wasn't me. I enjoy scifi and Hong Kong films, enjoy Philip K. Dick, so I was basically the ideal audience for this film.The plot was so full of loopholes, maintaining suspension of disbelief was impossible. Except for one or two supporting cast members, the acting was lifeless, and the action was unsupported by any motivation. The antagonists were far more sympathetic than the protagonists, whose cold-blooded killing sprees did nothing to endear them to me. Finally the washed out lighting and coloring took away a lot of depth from the images.. when someone seems to leap from building to building, if the buildings look collapsed together, it's not that impressive.And the fighting.. when you watch Jet Li or Jackie Chan fight, even when they are obviously assisted by wires, you feel an exhilaration at what they are physically capable of doing. The fights flow, and the character is maintained through out. In The Matirx, there is no real joy or sense of exertion. People punch each other, pull some interesting feats, but without any sense of risk or accomplishment.What people saw in this waste of film, time and money, I do not know. But I include it with the American remake of Godzilla as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you want Phillip K. Dick reality warping, see Blade Runner. If you want good cyberpunk anime, see Akira or Ghost in The Shell, or for martial arts, a good Bruce Lee or Hong Kong flick.But don't waste your time on this."
Retro_Movie_Lover,"Jun 27, 2025",8/10,"Written and directed by the Wachowski's, The Matrix was a project that was not only a very important and personal project for the duo but also a difficult one for them to get off the ground to actually turn into a reality.The story centers around a character going by the alias Neo (real name Thomas Anderson), a computer hacker that believes that the world around him isn't what it seems and is looking for a man he believes will confirm his suspicions, Morpheus. After being arrested and questioned about the matter, he is then approached by Morpheus and his team, who confirm his suspicions and take him out of the world he currently lives in (The Matrix) and take him to the real world, which is a machine run relic, where the remaining humans are in hiding and in war with the machines.Morpheus believes Neo to be the ""One"" who is destined to bring an end to the war. Morpheus teaches Neo about the Matrix and how to fight within it. He also shows him their enemies within that world (computer programs known as Agents). After visiting a program known as the Oracle, Morpheus is betrayed by one of his crew members and turned into the agents, where Neo and another member of the crew, Trinity, have to save him.To say that this is a very detailed story would be an understatement. The Wachowskis went above and beyond when it came to writing the story and scripts for this particular movie. While this isn't the first movie or show to center around this kind of story, it is definitely the first to go this far. The dialogue, the level of detail in its visuals and the world(s) it conveys was very unique at the time.This was also one of the first movies where computer effects were used to help tell the story rather than being there for just visuals. By using the effects in this fashion, it's helped them age quite well and better than most of its contemporaries.With that said, not all of the presentation is perfect. The Wachowski's writing may be detailed but has a habit of being too detailed. The common joke amongst fans is that they are afraid to use apostrophes and it won't take any newcomer to this film long to see why that joke is so prevalent. The dialogue is very stilted in areas, and the amount of dialogue being delivered can sometimes make the story overbearing and hard to follow because it's not allowed to breathe at times.They're also not the best writers when it comes to writing love stories and romance. The story between Neo and Trinity is pretty heavy-handed and forced in areas, which is actually the same issue the Wachowski's had with the love story in Bound.Despite that, the ones keeping everything grounded and making this film what it is, is the cast. The acting is often the most polarizing element of this film to many. I love the acting, and I think it fits the tone and the story perfectly. I know many are mixed on Keanu Reeves but his performance is very deliberate and that's what makes it work. He plays Neo like newborn kid, which I thought was great. He holds back in most scenes and only goes beyond that on a few occasions.Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus is tremendous. There's a reason why this became his most iconic role. There's a power you feel from this character, but also this parental figure that guides you through the lives of these characters. This was the first movie I ever saw Carrie-Anne Moss in and much like Reeves, she delivers a very deliberate and held back performance, which again, works for this type of movie.The last actor I'll highlight is Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. He is technically the antagonist in this film, but he is so engrossed in this performance that he winds up being the most fun character to watch. He delivers dialogue so entertainingly that you don't care if it makes sense or not.So overall, it may be stilted and a little too heavy-handed with the details but it is still a darn good movie. Its unique presentation and innovations has allowed it to age very gracefully. It remains a must see movie."
cglism,"Aug 25, 2024",10/10,"The Matrix is an extraordinary film that combines exhilarating action with deep philosophical questions.

Keanu Reeves delivers an unforgettable performance as Neo, a character who embarks on a journey that challenges our understanding of existence.The film's innovative ""bullet time"" effects and sleek action sequences are as impressive today as they were at its release. But what truly sets The Matrix apart is its ability to blend high-octane entertainment with thought-provoking themes about reality and freedom.If you haven't seen The Matrix, you're in for a cinematic treat.

arihiggins,"Apr 9, 2025",10/10,I consider this to be one of the best movies of all time as it is unique. Now not to upset other people my favorite movies are mostly from the golden age of Hollywood as my favorite actor is Cary Grant and Actress is Myrna Loy. I consider this movie as one of best due to it being unique in its scope and production. Its just not another take on other movies. It keeps you in the plot and makes you want to keep watching unlike most movies Hollywood puts out. They should have left this movie as a stand alone movie instead of putting out the other 3 movies in this series as i consider them trash not worth the film they are on.
pulpficat,"Oct 11, 2023",8/10,"Alright, hold onto your pods because we're diving deep into The Matrix. You might expect a thrilling, mind-bending sci-fi blockbuster, and you'd be absolutely right. But this movie is so much more than just your regular sci-fi action flick; it's a reality-bending masterpiece that messes with your mind and leaves you questioning the nature of existence. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?From the moment we meet Neo, our hacker-hero portrayed by Keanu Reeves, it's clear that The Matrix is no ordinary film. Neo's life takes a surreal turn when he learns that the reality he knows is a computer-generated illusion designed to keep humanity in check. Can you say, ""Welcome to the dark side""? Enter the enigmatic Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, whose epic, almost Shakespearean speeches make you want to take that red pill right away. It's like he's the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the digital world, guiding our hero through the rabbit hole and opens his eyes to the true, nightmarish reality.Speaking of that rabbit hole, The Matrix raises some profound questions about reality and the nature of existence. You'll find yourself questioning everything. Are we all just lines of code in someone else's program? Are our lives just simulations? It's enough to make your head spin. The underlying philosophical questions about reality, destiny, and choice add layers of existential dread that will resonate with anyone who's ever questioned the meaning of life or the dubious nature of our reality. So, in case you haven't had your daily dose of existentialism lately, The Matrix has you covered.But let's not forget the spectacular action sequences. The slow-motion kung-fu showdowns are pure adrenaline, and that rooftop chase scene? Heart-pounding stuff. And the famous bullet-dodging scene is so iconic that it's become a meme. Plus, the black leather and slick shades - it's like every character walked out of a '90s goth fashion catalog.All in all, The Matrix is a blend of cyberpunk aesthetics, philosophical musings, and action-packed sequences that'll make you question reality long after the credits roll. So, if you're ready to explore the shadows between what's real and what's not, give The Matrix a try. Who knows, you might just wake up from your own digital dream."
Ozero_Zaisan,"Dec 14, 2025",10/10,"The Matrix isn't just a movie you watch; it's a movie that hacks your mind. The Wachowskis fuse action with philosophy and cyberpunk aesthetics with existential questions so seamlessly that the result becomes a timeless myth. The question ""What is real?"" hits like a hammer for two straight hours, and there's no escape.Keanu Reeves' Neo is minimal yet effective, while Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus feels like he stepped straight out of Plato's cave. The visual effects still command respect today. Bullet time didn't just look cool; it added a whole new alphabet to the language of cinema. The music, atmosphere, and pacing are all placed with surgical precision.What truly elevates The Matrix isn't technical spectacle. It's the film's courage to question systems and expose how fragile our accepted ""realities"" really are. A comfortable lie or a painful truth? That dilemma remains just as relevant and unsettling today.The Matrix isn't only for sci-fi fans. It's for anyone who thinks, doubts, and dares to step back and question the world. An undeniable turning point in cinema history."
Erewhon,"Mar 29, 1999",8/10,"The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.So they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it.  No wonder.  It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies.  While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne.  But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT."
feaf1979,"Dec 11, 2009",6/10,"..I reckon it's aimed for a certain type of viewers.I love Action, Sci-fi, and so on; However, and believe me I have tried, never found that greatness that many were on about after its release.Therefore, I just cannot get all the cult movement it created afterward (black coats, tattoos, slang,...) For me it was a very original film, nice fights (although the effects were not all that) and just average interpretations from the cast with the exception of the always effective Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) and little more.I would not recommend it to those who do not have an open mind for fantasy and Sci-fi.Hope this was useful!"
dr_foreman,"Jun 10, 2004",4/10,"I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones - oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then, we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor Who (""The Deadly Assassin""). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography (and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else put together.I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs. It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really tacky.I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously OTT karate battles.As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and poorly informed junk."
estevexzz-69-169052,"Dec 26, 2021",10/10,"What can you say about the Matrix?! One of the best Sci-fi Movies ever that pushed the boundaries of a new concept in 1999. Still today, more than 20 years after, you get the feeling of something special and different without being overcomplicated. Part of my personal nostalgic bucket for sure!!"
gomestranslator,"Jul 12, 2024",9/10,"It's no coincidence that this film changed the trajectory of big screen cinema all over the world.The brothers brought us cinema lovers a new motivation besides watching. The effects used in this film made anyone who was watching it wonder, how is this possible?It definitely shows the idea that, if you sat down to watch this film, you would certainly have already taken the red pill.The film's plot also encourages us to ask ourselves what is real and what would be the Matrix today.Despite a few mistakes that I've noticed after watching it several times, I still think this film was one of the best of its time and it remains a great film to watch at least once a year."
AnkurGurung,"Apr 5, 2024",10/10,"Every Sci-Fi enthusiast should share
their first experience of watching The Matrix.This film set a trend whose influence is still evident 25 years later, a rare feat for any film.I've likely watched this film over 20 times, and I still believe there's no other Sci-Fi movie quite like it (Inception came close).It represents the pinnacle of the '90s film industry.The direction of the film is exceptional; you can palpably sense the difference between being in the Matrix and being in the real world. The action sequences are amazing and have stood the test of time; the cinematography and special effects are impressive. And of course, one cannot overlook the iconic bullet time. Keanu Reeves as Neo, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity form the revered trio of acting."
guskeller,"Nov 6, 2021",9/10,"The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.Writing: 9/10

Prince-P,"Aug 15, 2024",8/10,"Lana and Lilly Wachowski were working at their construction business in Chicago when they got the basic idea for what would develop into ""The Matrix"". The sisters wrote their thoughts in a small notebook, which they showed to producer Joel Silver. He, in turn, managed to persuade Warner Brothers to buy the siblings' screenplay, even though the heady mix of quantum physics, kung fu fighting and Japanese anime probably confused the company's executives.The management at Warner Brothers became even more puzzled when it turned out that Lana and Lilly Wachowski wanted to direct ""The Matrix"" themselves. To demonstrate their skills on an actual movie set, the sisters promised to make a kind of ""audition piece"" for the studio. The result was ""Bound"", a low-budget production that the Wachowskis filmed during a hectic thirty-day period in Santa Monica. And it worked. Without further ado, Warners now green-lit ""The Matrix"".So, in the spring of 1998, the Wachowskis could finally begin work on their movie in a rented studio in Sydney. But it wasn't an easy shoot. Just the fight choreography involved four months of intense physical training (with specially hired martial arts masters). The walls in the thirty soundstages were then covered with green screens so that digitally rendered backdrops could be inserted. In fact, every stage of the production relied on computers, from the explosive action scenes to the removal of the stunt wires later in the process.Many influential critics saw ""The Matrix"" as an exercise in style rather than substance. A skillfully executed work where pop culture, graphic violence and Asian cinema are sampled for effect - not depth. Despite that, ""The Matrix"" was a massive success at the box office. Some people even believe that Lana and Lilly Wachowski's movie set up the very template for how a modern, action-packed blockbuster should be made in the early 21st century."
berestov,"Jul 26, 2025",10/10,"As a representative of cyberpunk, it's just great. The universe invented and developed in subsequent films is quite simple in concept, but has enough details to be considered almost an icon of the genre.There is also complete order on the part of the militant. And shootouts will show hand-to-hand fights and even helicopters with flying ships of the future.There are a lot of questions in the picture that are asked directly, so to speak, so that there is something to think about, as well as implicit and slightly hidden ones. The symbolism and duality of some elements of the film.It turned out to be a great movie 25 years ago. One can only regret that the budget could have been bigger, but perhaps this is why so many viewers fell in love with the film, unlike the sequels. More emphasis on the story rather than setting action sequences."
blanche-2,"Aug 31, 2025",9/10,"For a 26-year-old film made in the age of special effects, The Matrix somehow manages to look as if it was made yesterday.Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss star in this amazing film, directed by Lana and Lilly Wachovski.Reeves is Thomas A. Anderson, a computer programmer who when he's not at the office is a hacker named Neo.When he is contacted by someone named Morpheus (Fishburne), the police come after him and accuse him of being a terrorist. These ""police"" are powerful computers, called agents, dedicated to stopping human resistance against the Matrix.The Matrix is the fake world in which mankind has been living. The real world, as introduced to Neo by Morpheus, will free man, but only if the Matrix is destroyed.Morpheus has been seeking The One, the person who has the power to destroy the Matrix. He believes Neo is The One.Such a fascinating concept, pointing up the dangers of AI and taking Neo into sone dark places as he learns his own strengths.There are those who wish to stay in the Matrix; Neo joins forces with Morpheus and the beautiful Trinity (Moss) to learn the reality of the imprisoned existence.The effects are mind-boggling even by today's standards and were truly groundbreaking at the time. But my favorite was a human moment - the reverse Sleeping Beauty kiss Trinity gives Neo when she needs to bring him back from a harrowing encounter.Great film."
inspectors71,"Mar 31, 2005",N/A,"Pardon me for being an adult, but I cannot understand the hype of this movie, past the breathtaking special effects, of course. This mess has all of the elements I have grown to hate most in a modern movie: The wooden acting, the predictable shootouts (with thousands of guns and millions of bullets), the noise, the gut-bashing violence. I may sound like an old prude, but, without the techno-dazzle, this is just a stultifyingly dull mess of scififoolishness.On the other hand, the sfx were so amazing that I sat through it to the end. I must say that the fans of this movie are a passionate lot. I told a friend of what I thought of The Matrix and he looked at me as if I had twin stalks of celery sticking out of my ears.So, if I sound stupid because I JUST DON'T GET IT, oh, well. I guess I shouldn't have taken the blue pill before watching it.No, not that blue pill! Sheesh, you people are annoying.(Just an after-thought--I watched The Matrix a few weeks ago, 12 years after writing this, and it still was stupid.)"
Prismark10,"Mar 28, 2016",7/10,"What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels."
IQ42,"Dec 13, 2021",5/10,"Years ago, when I was in grade 10, we watched this in ethics class. My teacher Mrs. Kosiol proudly announced that she had interpreted how the Matrix was inspired by Plato's cave allegory before the maker of this movie mentioned it.I just rewatched it mostly because I don't remember everything in the movie and want to watch its sequels. The first half of the movie really had me. All these ideas must have been so revolutionary for 1999 and surely defined parts of film-making. Some ideas like AIs and humans destroying the planet seem overused nowadays but for 1999 this is a remarkable movie.I really like the matrix idea. As my teacher said, it really is like Plato's allegory and it's interesting and scary to think about what were if the matrix was actually true. The idea also reminded me of the Infinite Tsukuyomi from Naruto. I wonder if Kishimoto was inspired by the matrix.So the first half really had me and I kinda wanted to like this movie but so many points just destroyed the feel for me. Especially the second half was pretty boring and absurd.With such an intriguing idea as the matrix, why does there have to be all those fight scenes? Why does there have to be hand-to-hand combat and gunshots and what-not? Maybe that generates more viewership in the cinema but for me it really didn't fit the scene.And then the very ending, like what was that? Why does Trinity have to wait so long and tell Neo something almost meaningless in front of the phone booth? For god sake, just get out and then you have all the time in the world to say whatever you want.It was all to set up some romance between Neo and Trinity. But I ask you: Why?! This was so forced and at no point of the movie it seemed like there would be a romantic relationship arising between them. It was romance just for the sake of a Hollywood kiss.And then there is Neo. How flat can a character be? This guy has absolutely no personality besides being the one. And him going back in to save Morpheus also just doesn't fit his personality, it is a forced superhero behaviour. Then, at the end he just randomly becomes overpowered for no reason at all. Oh, I guess there is a reason - the power of love. How cliché.He starts flexing and fighting one-handed but man just get the **** out of the matrix. We don't even know what these people see in Neo. Why was he chosen? His hacker personality seems to have almost no impact at all. Neo is really one of the worst written characters I've seen recently.It's a revolutionary movie that you should have seen to experience the idea of the matrix. But other than these ideas, it is not too watch-worthy."
TheRealDarkFang,"Jul 14, 2025",10/10,"A Magnificent Piece of Art and Cinema, Beware, this movie is not for everyone; many people will not understand it completely and may have to watch it 2-3 times to get a perfect understanding of the film. The Movie's Concept about Free will and breaking the matrix (the world we are living in) is a great concept, but at some point having free will and not having it doesnt make a huge difference I think the movie was somewhere lacking in showing the meaning of free will, but still, it's a great movie. Even though it's an old movie, the visuals were looking great as we were indulged in the story, and they don't feel like how fake VFX and CGI are used in the real world, like the whole area of the real world outside the Matrix they showed was weak VFX as compared to VFX and CGI now we are getting, but it felt premium and worth giving time to this movie. I still haven't watched the next 3 films, but as soon as I watch them, I will keep you guys updated. Add this to your watchlist!!!"
candinata,"Sep 30, 2023",10/10,"""The Matrix"" (1999) is a mind-bending, action-packed movie that will leave you questioning reality.The story follows Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, a computer hacker who discovers that the world he knows is just a simulation created by machines. He joins a group of rebels led by Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, to fight against the oppressive machines and free humanity.The movie is known for its groundbreaking special effects, especially the iconic slow-motion bullet-dodging scenes. The action sequences are intense, and the martial arts choreography is impressive.What sets ""The Matrix"" apart is its thought-provoking concept of a simulated reality and the idea that we might not be living in the real world. It makes you question the nature of existence and the boundaries of technology.Overall, ""The Matrix"" is a classic sci-fi film that combines action, philosophy, and a dose of cyberpunk, making it a must-watch for anyone who enjoys thrilling movies with a twist. It's a timeless movie that still holds up well today."
VhilaX,"Dec 7, 2025",10/10,"The Matrix is a towering cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends Hollywood spectacle with philosophical depth. The Wachowskis crafted a visionary world where thrilling action, groundbreaking special effects, and a provocative narrative coexist in perfect harmony. Keanu Reeves delivers a quietly magnetic performance as Neo, while Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss provide unforgettable, scene-stealing support. The film's revolutionary bullet-time sequences and inventive choreography reshaped genre filmmaking, and its exploration of reality, freedom, and identity remains profoundly resonant. Brilliantly paced, emotionally engaging, and intellectually stimulating, The Matrix is not only a technical triumph but a cultural milestone that continues to inspire filmmakers and audiences alike."
Harsh_304,"Mar 5, 2025",10/10,"The Matrix (1999) is hands down one of the best movies ever. The martial arts scenes and slow-motion effects are insane, and the bullet-dodging scene is legendary - it's definitely my favorite part. The movie's whole concept of living in a fake reality is so cool and makes you think. The special effects are ahead of its time, and the action is top-tier. Honestly, The Matrix is a masterpiece. It's a movie I can watch over and over, and it still blows my mind every time. Definitely a classic that everyone needs to see.And its my my first existential crisis , Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski did an amzing job."
Mcduff3601,"Aug 29, 2023",10/10,"Even after 24 years this movie is still in my top 10 sci fi movies of all time. When this came out it was ground breaking. The special effects still hold up today but they have lost some of their polish especially since then the techniques are common place amongst new movies using better quality graphics.The story however is something out there. It is told in a way that allows you to connect with the main character, as he finds out things you find them out at the same time.I also like that even those this is the first in a trilogy you don't need the other movies to complete this one. It's fine as a stand alone movie.Totally recommend to anyone who likes sci fi, or movies, or good things."
jack_o_hasanov,"Jul 28, 2021",10/10,"When i 6 or 7 years old i saw this movie on TV. It was shocking and little bit scary for me.

Bilstein,"Aug 23, 2001",N/A,"I have to say, I was very tempted to write 'AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!' in the one line summary, as that is my true opinion of this film. However, I thought it better to be a little more objective than that.I was intrigued by all the talk of how great The Matrix was, and at first, I was intrigued by it. Thomas Anderson, the agents that came looking for him, the talk about 'Morpheus' made me interested about just how the plot would turn out.However, after the blue pill/red pill scene, what had been a nice premise became very poor indeed. I can honestly say that I didn't care who was 'the one,' and with all the cryptic phrases and mumbo-jumbo this thing threw in, I began to wonder whether or not I was watching a bible story. It leaves you wondering just exactly what this film is trying to say.With the exception of Agent Smith, there was not one character I liked. I was praying Morpheus would die, as it might have brought this rubbish to an end. And what was with all those pointless one-liners? ""It's Neo."" ""Dodge this."" If I had watched this in a cinema, I would probably have been thrown out for shouting obscenities at the screen.All in all, a thorough waste of time. The interesting premise, special effects, and well-executed scene where Neo is being pursued by Smith just about lift it out of the dung-heap, but they don't compensate for all its faults.4/10 - Special effects and cryptic messages do not make a movie"
thebishop2,"Dec 9, 2000",6/10,"I didn't dislike this movie.That said, I just have a few problems with it. I'll start with the cast. Where in the world did they find actors so badly on par with Keanu Reeves? Amongst the 'pretty boy' actors in Hollywood, he is the prince of the wood face. Clint Eastwood may have more expression. All of the actors, with the possible exception of Larry Fishburn, who I have seen in other roles that were good, are as stiff as a corpse. None of Neo's pals need to be in this film. They are totally uninteresting and unnecessary. Apoc? Switch? Mouse? Why? These people have the personalities of a smock. At least the two brothers serve the purpose of getting them in and out of the Matrix and driving the ship. The others are there to look good, and they missed on that too.And why so much needless violence? All these 'cops' they kill are just people suppossedly stuck in that gooey jell you get out of the 25 cent vending machines, right? So, Neo and his babe go around and kill a bunch of helpless, innocent people. Those guys were just minding their own biz when they burst in with an arsenal that rivals that of Rick James's.And then there are the scary characters. They range from the emotionless 'smiths' to that of those creepy kids who bent spoons and made me wax sentimental about unicef for some reason. In fact, the Smiths were the best 'acted' roles, but I think that's because they had the least to stretch since they were the bad guys.I can't even get into the plot holes, since there is a word limit, but there were a lot. This whole movie is beyond improbable. But, it's worth a viewing or 2. Check it out if you got a friend who wants to blow there money one saturday night."
jernejzupevc,"Sep 21, 2024",10/10,"The Matrix is a film that redefined not only the sci-fi genre but also the way we think about movies in general. It was the first movie I watched multiple times, and with every viewing, I found something new. That's part of the magic-it keeps you hooked, peeling back layers you didn't notice before.Released before the streaming and digital age, it's a reminder of how cinema can captivate from the very first scene. The film's groundbreaking ideas are not just mind-bending, but they challenge your perception of reality itself. And let's not forget the action-it's nothing short of iconic.What makes The Matrix special is its blend of philosophical depth and adrenaline-pumping sequences. It's one of those rare films where the action doesn't overshadow the story-it elevates it. Whether you're watching for the thought-provoking concepts or the jaw-dropping choreography, there's always something to pull you back in.The movie invented bullet time."
michaelsize,"Dec 26, 2021",9/10,Great for its day. Story slightly confusing but very good.The sequels and the reboot have let this great movie/story down. Neo deserved a better ending but the first one is fantastic. Faultless apart from the story being a bit difficult to understand.
cuddlesatusc,"Dec 23, 2021",8/10,"I practically grew up on this film and its sequel. I can recite it word for word but I couldn't tell what the words imply about the movie itself. So to rewatch it all these years later and say it holds up pretty well is very satisfying. The combination of overt philosophy, -- ranging from Plato's cave to Descartes' intellectual autonomy-- cyberpunk aesthetic, and balls to the wall action is utilized so well. It shouldn't work at all, but it does. Now the film isn't perfect by any means: Trinity is reduced in the second half of the movie to character on standby mode and while the ending is cool, it leaves the viewer with too many questions that have to be lazily answered in a sequel."

gabrielbastos-07277,"Sep 22, 2021",10/10,"I think with almost 5.000 reviews, i dont have too many to add here. But i will try.First time i watched Matrix its was in 2000, ( i was 12 years old) and took me for the inovative action, i loved it!. In 2003 a lit bit older i rewatched as a study in a philosophy class. And that i just remarckble. After that day it opened my mind to many aspects in films and moviemaking. First for the movies itself ( the oracle and its messages, the pils, the Matrix itself and its meaning). And of course, .this broadened my vision of film interpretation, not just in the Matrix itself, but ignited my perception as whole and after that i become a lover of the seventh art,
In short, I liked Matrix Iwhen I was 12 years old, and I loved it when I was older and could really understand it (or thought I did). The perfect mix of sci-fi, philosophy, action, a perfect mix of cult and mainstream movie, a real masterpiece.For all the meaning that this movie has in my life i would say that its ( of course in my opinion) the best movie the human kind did."

inframan,"May 5, 1999",N/A,"Can't believe this film has so many people so enthused. Most of it is dumb boring cliche-ridden dialogue. I've seen tons of b-flicks on 2 AM cable that had more life than this thing. The ""sci-fi"" effects are 10th rate derivative of Alien & all its spawns down through even the stupid remake of Lost in Space. Where the hell is all the groovy gothic architecture I read about? The climax is bad John Woo knock-off. So what's it all mean? That today's moviegoers love nothing more that bad remakes of yesterdays movies? Guess so."
TheHig,"Jun 4, 2003",4/10,"I have never fallen asleep at the cinema, but The Matrix is the closest I've ever come to doing so.  Quite frankly, the first hour of this film is the most boring hour of film ever.Keanu Reeves cannot act, neither can Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss doesn't do much better.  The whole thing is too dark, and let's be honest: If you've seen the trailer, you don't need to see the film, as it shows you all the special effects there anyway.I've been more disappointed by other films, but I fail to see how this uninspiring and badly acted mess is hailed so much by fans.  Any old fool can string together a series of special effects, the trick is to link them with a good story and enjoyable characters.  The Matrix does neither.I'll admit it picks up a bit in the second half, but I was so completely and utterly appalled by the first hour, no amount of bullet time, however impressive, can save this film.My Rating: 4/10"
ARW3N_RAV3NCR3ST,"Jul 17, 2024",10/10,"I first saw The Matrix on its initial theatre release back in 1999. I was probably a little young to truely grasp the complexity of the film at 13 but I do remember enjoying it. I've seen bits and pieces of it over the years on TV but hadn't really sat down to watch if again properly until now having bought The Matrix Trilogy on Blu-ray. The movie is still a great sci-fi flick and worthy of being called one of the best. The fights scenes, although a little slow this day and age, are well choreographed and heavy hitting - I particularly enjoy when people get thrown against or through walls and this movie has plenty of that! The bullet time effects and slow motion shots still hold up, and even though other films have copied it, The Matrix was the original and still does it better if you ask me. The storyline still feels futuristic even after 21 years and the CGI, although looking a tad dated, is still pretty sharp mostly (better than what was in the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, oddly). The story can get a little confusing at times for new comers, infact there were things in this viewing that I had not picked up on or understood previously so just one viewing may not be enough to truely appreciate the film. The one thing the film didn't do for me however was the emotional relationships - I liked the characters, but the relationship between Neo and Trinity felt a bit forced for my liking. My favourite scene is the fight in the Subway between Agent Smith and Neo - it was a great lead in and a very back and foward encounter with neither man truely gaining the upperhand.Final Verdict: it's hard to fault such a genre defining film as The Matrix. The fights still look great, the story maintains a futuristic feel and it's surprisingly deep. But it is starting to show it's age ever so slightly with the action feeling slow and CGI looking a little bland. Still highly recommended!"
catscolacabrini,"Feb 25, 2022",10/10,The best out of the original trilogy and far superior than the reboot. One of those timeless classics that still looks great today. The rebirth of Keanu Reeves.
D_I_Sammi,"Nov 29, 2023",10/10,"Among my favourite films of all time, The Matrix is a ground breaking breach into a new top tier level of cinema, where amazing visuals effects and meaningful characters come together with one of the most courageous and cleverest scripts ever written. Easily Keanu Reeves's best performance, he brings a nicheness and believability to his mysterious character and way the world revolves around him is original and full of intrigue. Hugo Weaving is truly gripping as Agent Smith, and it is clear he is having a tremendous time playing the role.The cinematography is some of the best to ever appear on film. The stylish flashes when in the matrix, the more rustic steady shots while in real life - every scene is composed with purpose and art.The characters are portrayed with an incredible sense of believability; they entail bravery but with that little tinge of fear as they fight against a true turmoil of a system. It's everything a perfect movie should have but with the extra ingredient of outstanding competency in addition to some of the best action sequences ever created."
ratersup,"Aug 21, 2023",9/10,"The Matrix the one of the best Sci-Fi movie that changed the ways of thinking for the future. It will also show the future eara with the concept of AI.The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars."
masonsaul,"Dec 19, 2021",10/10,"The Matrix is a superb and revolutionary film that combines multiple genres and ideas to create something unique. A thought provoking, action packed and inventive film that's impressive visual effects still almost entirely hold up.Keanu Reeves gives a perfect lead performance that always anchors the film and keeps it grounded and focused. Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are both incredible with effortlessly cool and stylish supporting performances. Hugo Weaving is a phenomenal villain who is effectively cold and calculating yet also full of rage.The Wachowski's direction is excellent, with director of photography Bill Pope they manage to create clean and comprehensible action scenes as well as some truly mind blowing moments. The music by Don Davis is great, suitably epic and high tech with a solid soundtrack that suits the film's tone."
alicenelsonvb,"Nov 19, 2021",10/10,"The Matrix is one of the best, most spectacular, and most captivating action/sci-fi movie ever filmed. It smacked me in the gut like a stone. I was left wondering about for days in amazement of the notion and uniqueness, attempting and failing to come up with something similar. It's both aesthetically and technically remarkable, not to mention iconic."
Bernie4444,"Apr 30, 2024",9/10,"To Neo (Keanu Reeves) it seemed as if his entire life was a dream. As with most of us, he was searching for something. He was also looking for a person named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who would be able to answer the burning question ""What is the Matrix?"" It just may be possible that for other reasons Morpheus may be looking for Neo.The movie producers get points for the first people to do the particular FX.This film even though it has a beginning and an end is the first in a series that unfolds further truth.Keanu Reeves plays his part well; however, he is better as Siddhartha inLittle Buddha (1993). Their little trick with pills reflecting off the classes was good. Speaking of Buddha, one does not realize until going through the rest of the films in this series that there is a subtle Buddhist philosophical thread running through them.Even though this is a review of the first film in a series or trilogy I do have the complete Blu-ray set. It rather grows on you."
grantss,"May 24, 2025",9/10,"Neo is an employee at a software company and a hacker. He starts to receive strange messages on his computer, as if he's being watched. Then he is contacted by Morpheus and Trinity, legends in the hacking community. What they have to tell him will change his entire perception of reality.Excellent film. Clever, original, intriguing plot. Possibly too clever - lose concentration for a moment and you can easily lose track of what's happening it's that intricate. Despite the complexity, originality and science-fiction nature of the film it's also quite plausible. There's a few minor contrivances but generally the plot is pretty watertight.Aiding the sci fi plot is mind-bogglingly brilliant CGI. It still looks amazing today and was absolutely revolutionary in 1999. This CGI allows for the physics-defying action scenes, of which there are many. The action scenes are quite something to behold.Superb."
I-love-the-five-deadly-venoms,"Nov 23, 2003",N/A,"Before I saw this movie.. I kept hearing how ""deep"" and ""thought-provoking"" it was. So I watched it. And I laughed. This? This movie? Was I watching the wrong one? And the dialogue..""My name...is NEO!!"" Wow. This movie really just appeals to 15-year old boys. Black sunglasses, trenchcoats and guns. Yeah..everything that is ""cool"" for suburban computer nerds. If you think the whole ""what is reality?"" theme is new.. why don't you read some books. That's been written about for years and years. If this is material for your philosophical musings than you are truly a sad, sad boy."
mattfrancis-03963,"Dec 20, 2020",6/10,Kind of gets a bit boring! The film was a huge success so much so in 2021 another one will be coming out. The movie though is stupid. Let's be honest. The dialogue is ridiculous in parts and well it's just a bit tedious.
zbrak,"Jul 14, 2003",4/10,"I have heard so much about the Matrix and finally watched it for the first time this weekend.Boy, were there lots of action sequences. Lots and lots and lots of action sequences. You can feel the filmmakers just trying to top the last sequence instead of doing something like advancing the plot or developing the characters. Unless you think the action sequence is the be-all-and-end-all of movies, all that action just gets boring after a while. I have nothing against whiz-bang special effects as long as they do something worthwhile to move the film along (the Lord of the Rings films are good at this). But this is just not happening with the Matrix.The Matrix concept itself is thought-provoking. Why isn't it developed more? The fact that this monumental struggle for the soul of humanity ends up with a shoot-out, a helicopter-dangling rescue sequence and a martial arts fight is almost laughable. It's like saying the mysteries of the universe can be unraveled by watching beer commercials. If you want to see an ending that leaves you with something worth chewing on, you'll be sadly disappointed (as I was).As for other elements of the movie -- Keanu Reeves, as much as I usually enjoy watching him, was extremely wooden. Fishburne and Moss were good at what they did, but their parts were pretty two-dimensional. I couldn't get emotionally involved with any of the characters, which is ultimately the fault of the writers. The cinematography and ""style"" of the film and the sets is pretty cool to look at. However, the whole black clothes and sunglasses motif is just a little bit hokey after a while. And the agents -- I swear they look just like the bad aliens in Brother From Another Planet -- I kept expecting them to shriek at each other.I look at it this way - people who think that sitting in front of their tubes and playing video games is a worthwhile way to spend their lives will probably love this movie. People who want something more will think it's pretty hollow. It's a shame because the concept had a lot of potential, but the filmmakers took the easy way out."
stupid_llama,"Aug 8, 2025",9/10,"The Matrix wasn't just a cool action movie in 1999, it was a cultural earthquake. The Wachowskis blended philosophy, cyberpunk style, and bullet-time action into something that felt genuinely new. It's the rare blockbuster that actually questions authority, systems of control, and the lies we're fed to keep everything running smoothly.Keanu Reeves nails the quiet, reluctant-hero vibe, while Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss bring a gravitas that makes the world feel lived in. The fight scenes still hold up because they're choreographed with purpose, not just flash, and the practical effects mix seamlessly with the visual innovations. The film's aesthetic - black coats, sunglasses, green-tinted code - became instantly iconic for a reason.What makes it timeless is that its themes have only grown sharper. It's about breaking free from systems designed to keep you docile, and that message lands even harder in an era where corporate control and surveillance capitalism are stronger than ever. The Matrix isn't just entertainment, it's a wake-up call wrapped in leather and kung fu."
edonmez-68288,"Jan 9, 2025",10/10,"The Matrix is a thought-provoking and visually stunning masterpiece that redefined science fiction cinema. Its exploration of reality, identity, and human freedom resonates on both a philosophical and emotional level. The film's seamless blend of action and intellect sets it apart, making every fight scene and plot twist feel meaningful. What truly stands out is its ability to make you question the nature of your own reality-are we living in a constructed illusion? It's not just a movie; it's an invitation to reflect on existence and the power of choice. The script, the acting, the music, the lines, everything is perfect and it is a movie that everyone should definitely watch."
joao-luiz_mjr,"Dec 28, 2021",10/10,"The Matrix is a masterpiece of modern cinema. It draws heavily from sci-fi classics such as Ghost in the Shell and Neuromancer, exploring themes of systemic societal exploitation, the notion and expression of the self, as well as technology encroaching onto the human body and mind and the dread of a now all-too-known dystopic future, all of it wrapped up in a shell of sleek, leather and vinyl-clad punk visuals and beautifully choreographed fights.Fishburne (playing Morpheus) and Weaving (playing Agent Smith) are both stellar - every word coming out of their mouths, every inch of movement they make, all of it feels carefully measured if not downright hypnotic, and they both manage to keep the plot fresh and profoundly engaging even when armed with nothing but dialogue.It's one of those movies that can give you chills and enthrall you with its scenes, even after all these years. Truly, it's an incredible experience."
marwanmousa-02996,"Jul 26, 2024",9/10,"First saw The Matrix on its initial theatre release back in 1999. I was probably a little young to truely grasp the complexity of the film at 13 but I do remember enjoying it. I've seen bits and pieces of it over the years on TV but hadn't really sat down to watch if again properly until now having bought The Matrix Trilogy on Blu-ray. The movie is still a great sci-fi flick and worthy of being called one of the best. The fights scenes, although a little slow this day and age, are well choreographed and heavy hitting - I particularly enjoy when people get thrown against or through walls and this movie has plenty of that! The bullet time effects and slow motion shots still hold up, and even though other films have copied it, The Matrix was the original and still does it better if you ask me. The storyline still feels futuristic even after 21 years and the CGI, although looking a tad dated, is still pretty sharp mostly (better than what was in the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, oddly). The story can get a little confusing at times for new comers, infact there were things in this viewing that I had not picked up on or understood previously so just one viewing may not be enough to truely appreciate the film. The one thing the film didn't do for me however was the emotional relationships - I liked the characters, but the relationship between Neo and Trinity felt a bit forced for my liking. My favourite scene is the fight in the Subway between Agent Smith and Neo - it was a great lead in and a very back and foward encounter with neither man truely gaining the upperhand.Final Verdict: it's hard to fault such a genre defining film as The Matrix. The fights still look great, the story maintains a futuristic feel and it's surprisingly deep. But it is starting to show it's age ever so slightly with the action feeling slow and CGI looking a little bland. Still highly recommended."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Apr 9, 2009",10/10,"I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10"
ccthemovieman-1,"Oct 18, 2006",8/10,"Special-effects were the drawing card when this came out at the end of the 20th century, and those effects were spectacular. They lived up to their billing.Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.Once again here's a movie that made you glad VHS tapes were being phased out in favor of sharper, widescreen transfers."
led_zeppelin_zoso,"Mar 5, 2005",8/10,"After seeing this movie it changed the way i will look at sci-fi movies for the rest of my life. This film was taken straight from the imagination of the Wachowski. The amazing special effects drove this film along with great sound editing and dialog. Just in case you don't know i will tell you the main plot of the movie. Neo is just an average guy who ends up being hunted by Agent Smith. HE ends up being one of the crew members with Morpheus and Trinity. Morpheus thinks that Neo is ""The One"" which means that this person would be very strong and can dodge bullets and do wild stuff like that.The reason so many people loved this movie was because it was so out of this world and no one else not even Mr.Spielberg could have done this movie because only two brothers could have brought this to life and made one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made(tied with the ""Alien"" saga) and make remembered through generations, so i hope when i get old this movie will still be remembered because it is simply amazing."
taldarus,"Dec 5, 2020",7/10,"I was completely disappointed by this movie.I remember having to stop multiple times and double check if it was the right movie. I remember it coming out, I remember being unable to watch it. I remember all my friends giving me 'spoiler-free' reviews. No one could stop talking about this movie for way to long. I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point. I wish I could have been in a theater when people hadn't seen this movie, or even considered the idea that drives this movie.It must have been quite a horrifying shock to experience Neo's story without spoilers.I can think of dozens of pop culture jokes/references to the matrix. None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.I wish I had been as blown away as all those people who experienced it the first time.All I though was, 'Huh.' Still a good movie though."
DunnDeeDaGreat,"Nov 1, 2002",8/10,The Matrix is one of the most overrated films that I can think of. The film does have good action and some of the most amazing special effects ever put on a film. But the film is also drawn out and confusing. Keanu Reeves is the only one who could play a chacrter as flat as Neo and the rest of the cast expect for Laurence Fishburne and Joe Panotilano all give paper thin performances. I give the action and effects a 10 the plot a 3 which equals about 6.4.
CosmicXI,"Apr 26, 2016",10/10,"This movie is literally the reason I do what I do. the special effects were so amazing for it to be a 99 film, the fighting was beyond well choreographed and the story!!? don't even get me started, do you know how many times I had to watch this movie!? it took years for me to understand it all.I couldn't thank the director enough for this film this movie inspired me to begin doing things that were extraordinary and that stood out. my passion for parkour, riding Motorcycles, to my martial arts. now I just wanna become an actor and be great, do my own stunts, and not be a nobody.

wes-connors,"Jan 1, 2009",9/10,"Insomniac computer hacker Keanu Reeves (as Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson ) lives a common and interesting life.

You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage.

One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not.""

waledemz-62418,"Jun 23, 2016",10/10,"*Deeply exhales* The movie MATRIX was indeed a breaking point for movie makers, and it paved way for both marketers, producers, and film makers generally. The era at the time the MATRIX was released really needed something new and different, and this was what the MATRIX was able to deliver. With ground breaking still motions and effects, it was indeed a movie of the time. While being perfectly casted with Keanu Reeves playing NEO, and Carrie-Anne Moss playing Trinity, while leaving the boss himself in the middle of it all, Laurence Fishburne playing Morpheus. Their roles were imbibed in them as if it were their true nature and this really made a significant difference between the so called science and fiction."
AlexPechlivanidis,"Mar 7, 2019",10/10,The Matrix is stunning visually and story wise. People often cannot see beneath all the action and realize the philosophical meanings this movie is trying to convey. It's a cultural and philosophical phenomenon which changed the movie industry.
lnavarrocr,"Jan 29, 2019",9/10,"One of the icons at this era, it changes the way I saw life and movies."
peterspam-22486,"Apr 20, 2024",9/10,"I just came to realize that I have not rated this classic since I saw it 20+ years ago, which is a good thing, as I changed my mind on two major aspects, that you will not hear easily:
1. It's a rip-off of Dark City. There are plenty of videos showing how the Wachowski bro.. I mean sisters ripped off not just the story, but even scenes and went as far as to use the same studio settings even, like the rooftop scene. This alone should make people think about the ""originality"" of the movie, but for the sakes of argument let's leave that at rest. Shame on the Wachowskis, in hindsight
2. More importantly: their ideological ""genius"". Since it's 2024 and the makers decided to make it quite obvious that their view on life goes beyond the ordinary, to the point of their existence and perception of their own reality therein resulting in their operations, I no longer see unintentional phantasy behind it, but a deep rooted ideology. Which was perhaps there from the start, the main reason for my review now.Let me elaborate on this: I believe that the most powerful message of The Matrix is not the virtual reality, but it is a message of a very strong transhumanistic attitude. Part 4 of the series already made it abundantly clear that they saw Morpheus as nothing more than idle ideology versus the harsh realities of life, when Niobe basically is shown as the wise elder preaching on the useless rebellion against a system where no victory is possible since slavery is eternal for the masses. But even the first episode of the series has revealed the true agenda of the makers' convictions: that humanity is not able to create with our minds and that it is only technology that is all powerful. Neo is nothing more than a false prophet according to them, as he is basically a magician that juggles code, his existence is no proof for a transcendent higher power, a God. Which is exactly why Neo is shown as a demi-God, to take away any illusion that there is a higher sentient being that is worth living for. Faith in God is fully replaced by the sect-like religion in the demi-God Neo, but on a technological basis, where his ability to manipulate the known and seen is what determines his power. This is transhumanism and atheism in its purest form, strengthened by a consciously religious cloak that Neo is perceived in: if that is how humans call someone a Messiah, then surely the Bible's a fraud too and there is no God, just illusions in our minds.The reason I have come to conclude this is based on the conscious difference they made between the original (Dark City) and their copy, The Matrix. In Dark City, we remain in the realm of fantasy. The hero, as well as the anti-heroes, create with their mind. It is a setting in a totally fictitious world, where the mind is the only creating force. But the people are REAL. Victims, but real. THEY have not been created by programs, not by the evil masterminds or by the hero. They cannot be ""un-thought"", no matter the powers that be. Anything else can, anything material. But the writer consciously avoided the possibility of bending humanity within this fantasy realm. Stopping time, yes, as a singular parameter, as well as all matter. But the induced sleep is not equal to undone thought or undone humanity, they even have to have minions walk around to people are kept being deceived. And as soon as the hero bends the fabric of life, both material and time, he can awaken the female protagonist, but not change her. Human sanctity remains untouched and its mysticism remains unexplained, just like our image of God can never be uncloaked. The movie remains in the realm of the intangible, because this ability of his cannot be technologically explained. It cannot be controlled by others, it is a gift, a blessing. And just like the endless possibilities that this gift offers him, the possible answers to the question ""Why?"" would offer endless possibilities as well, therefore making the question totally obsolete. And this is a perfect circle for the story to remain in the realm of fantasy.Contrary to The Matrix. The Wachowskis have consciously flipped the table by placing not just Neo, but all humans in the realm of the tangible. The virtual world and its endless possibilities, where those present do not know about being just a cogwheel in the machine, is a very realistic sci-fi setting, where merely the technological abilities are a threshold. As soon as we would reach the abilities where we can fully trick the mind into believing that the virtual world is the real one, we have achieved what we see in the Matrix.Which brings us to the message The Matrix conveys: we humans have the power to create The Matrix. And if we are skilled enough to do so, it might as well be that we live in a Matrix already.This seems all very straightforward for most and you may wonder why I find this a revelation: because it holds two very strong messages, that are both false and destructive.1. That we are in control of our fate through pure materialistic thinking, that there is no unseen force, no mysticism about life, to be found deep in us. That technology is the final frontier, not God or some higher power. And that power is a known external, not an unknown internal to be discovered. And that basically we ARE God, since we have the absolute power over our faith, it is just bits and bytes, when we can no longer distinguish between what is real and what isn't.2. That everything is inconsequential when it is virtual. No consequence, no responsibility. A game that you play and are freed from the burden that the human ethic, the human condition brings with itself. Especially responsibility towards society, but also towards yourself. Because if it is all a simulation, why would I keep to any ethics? Who cares if I steal, lie and murder for my ego, since it is all a game?There are YT vids of young gamers playing increasingly mentally deranged games. In less than 30 years time we have gone from a game that we play for fun to worlds we create to escape to and strip ourselves from our humanity, with little incentive to learn or develop any skills for the real world, in fact increasingly twisting minds. The extent to which people are becoming both desensitized towards externalities like violence, the morphing of their own self into abstract abominations (initially gender, now into anything but human), the olbiteration of ethics by living out utterly sick perversions in roleplaying especially (killing, stealing, betraying, envy, twisted sexual fantasies etc.), the instant gratification with which they want to turn themselves into efficiency machines to fit in as a cogwheel instead of enjoying the ride as an individual, while at the same time endless ""grinding"" of unproductive and useless routines to immerse in a virtual universe where the routine resembles real-life work just to create the false image that they are being productive, all of these are a mirror for escapism that typifies the virtual world that is gaining ground as a feasible alternative to our real world. But feeding the subconscious animal, which is showing its teeth when especially adolescents step out into the real world. School violence is no surprise as a result of this brainwash.The Wachowskis laid the groundwork for this trend, in the minds at least. Considering their bodily change, I do not believe this is coincidental. I think they very much religiously believe in transhumanism. Whether their movie and the twist they gave Dark City is wishful thinking or whether life imitates art and they have become a victim of their own fantasy, the result is the same: masses influenced by this ideology, that we are the creators of our own universe. And that there is no difference whether we eat that steak in bits and bytes, once the real world can no longer hold cows and grass and clean air.The moment that nobody believes there is a spoon, we really will be out of spoons."
anthonydapiii,"May 8, 2020",10/10,"My subject line fills up a majority of my takeaway from this ""fictional"" movie.Keenu Reeves and the cast are stellar performers in this way. They show more than just a fictional tale of a computer hacker learning the reality of the world from rebels.This storyline shows the power of the mind and the ability we all have as human beings. I see the symbolism in this movie beyond just the surface of what is seen on the screen.I will also add that the filmmaking in the action scenes has to be, hands down, the best of any special effects I've ever seen in any movie."
tfrizzell,"Mar 15, 2002",N/A,"""The Matrix"" is easily one of the most, if not the most, over-rated film ever made. It is short on characterization and direction and all the performances are sub-par. A group of innovative special effects dazzled many, but I was unimpressed by them as well. In many ways, the film is ugly and cheap looking. Keanu Reeves plays a computer hacker who learns from a strange group of rebels what his true purpose for living is to help stand against a department of controllers who run what is really reality. Exactly. The plot is so stupid and it just makes no sense most of the time. Keanu Reeves usually makes films work, but he cannot save this mess. The same is true for dependable players like Joe Pantoliano and Laurence Fishburne who just seem lost in the maze that is the movie. In short ""The Matrix"" is eye-candy and little else. Save your time and look at a group of Picasso's paintings instead. They are just as empty and meaningless as ""The Matrix"". 2.5 out of 5 stars."

We have questioned reality during the worst of times, we have felt like the moment is unreal during the best of times, but after watching The Matrix, people started to question every moment in their lives.And even more so, the question of whether if given the choice we would continue to leave this possibly fake reality, and wake in our true reality, we would actually take that pill...Not really something that can be taken lightly.The cast was an top form, each bringing a level of emotion fit for the character, standing out from the crowd was Laurence Fishburne, who's energy when addressing the crowds was hair-raising, his belief in Neo was inspiring, he made people take a good look at what it meant to have true conviction.This film broke all the rules, it bent reality and it made us appreciate the little things in life a whole lot more, I don't know what the next step in film is, but if it's as mind blowing as The Matrix, it's going to be epic."
hooma814,"Jul 14, 2020",9/10,"This movie was always epic watching it as a kid. The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!The costumes and colour design is also well thought out with the green that matches the Matrix reality.This .movie is so good. If you haven't watched it for a while or again as an adult, I'd highly recommend."
yaszi-83296,"Dec 27, 2021",9/10,"The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.The music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.The story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.Another great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.At the end of the day, an iconic sci-if movie with great everything and also if you made it this far I hope you have a great day and:Unfortunately, no one can be told what The Matrix is. You'll have to see it for yourself."
Calicodreamin,"Apr 22, 2020",9/10,"A great send off of the 90s, the matrix is a one of a kind sci-fi action movie. The cgi and stunts are amazing, the choreography of the fight scenes are crazy good. The acting is great from both the good guys and the bad guys, Keanu is amazing. The outfits are badass and really send this over the edge, who doesn't want to look like Carrie Ann moss?!"
CFraser-31966,"Nov 27, 2018",9/10,It was a very good film and I very much enjoyed watching it.
Cameron-6,"Mar 29, 1999",10/10,"Incredible, ground-breaking action sequences make this movie ultra-cool, but it's more than just flying bullets. This movie is like anime come to life.Yes, the Wachowski bros. toss in bits of every myth and fantasy they could find, yes, they lift bits from dozens of other movies -- from Alien to Star Wars to Face/Off -- but they make it all work. Even better, they draw the best performance from Keanu Reeves since Speed.As sheer movie spectacle goes, it's brilliant."
pooch-8,"Apr 7, 1999",N/A,"It is really a shame that the talented Wachowski brothers did not spend more time paring down the sprawling, unwieldy, and ultimately confusing and unsatisfying plot threads of The Matrix and settle in on one.  Had they found a way to drop about thirty minutes of this overlong and oftentimes dull hodge-podge, the truly spectacular martial arts and digital effects would have seemed even more special.  A cyber-flick owing an equal debt to Blade Runner and Lewis Carroll, The Matrix collapses under the weight of an idiotic and mind-numbing New Testament-like structure that finds surrogates for Christ, Judas, etc.  Joe Pantoliano, so thoroughly excellent in the Wachowski's previous outing Bound, is helpless and hapless playing the underwritten Cypher, but Hugo Weaving easily gives the worst performance of his career as a strictly one-note, wooden bad guy in the grand tradition of one-note, wooden bad guys."
bajbij,"May 19, 2002",6/10,"I loved the Matrix--when it was a film released in 1998 called  Dark City, a far superior, character driven entry in the sci-fi genre. The Matrix, with its dazzling special effects, is nothing more than a silly tale of perseption vs reality. Everyone's view of the film seems to be manipulated by the effects. If we were dealing with Blade Runner style effects instead of Doritos inspired ""bullet time"" effects, would the film still be considered as memorable? I highly doubt it. Laurence Fishburne is good as Morpheus, Moss is ok but her character elicits no sympathy or emotion from me, and Keanu Reeves is just ok, but none of these characters are as intriguing as those of Dark City. The kung fu was obviously inspired by the late Hong Kong style of fighting (IE wire fu and CGI instead of actual skills and choreography.) This was designed to make the simpletons of today go ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" while real kung fu afficionados ache over the obvious fakeness and frustration of chop editing, thus inspiring furhter kung fu crap like CROUCHING TIGER, EXIT WOUNDS, and ROMEO MUST DIE. Matrix does boast some wonderful cinematography, but so does Dark City and it boasts a better story along with it, too. I'll give this film a 5 out of because in originality it's not in the top, in style it's not original, in acting it's saved by one, and story, pretty basic but not complex. Dark City is better."
The_Other_Snowman,"May 8, 2005",2/10,"I saw this movie in the theater back in 1999. It had its moments, but not many. To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as that sexy sidekick babe in a video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix.For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. ""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. ""Dark City"" is a better, more original version of the same premise, without the Chosen One nonsense or the martial arts."
Spleen,"Sep 5, 1999",8/10,"... I don't know how long.  Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.Much of what you will have heard about this film is false.  You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that.  You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither.  You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all.  It's really quite charming once you get to know it.  Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man.  Indeed he acts rather well.  Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well.  Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis.  When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched.  But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.Special effects are marvellous.  I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well.  A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place.  The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops.  Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes.  I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better."
robotobscura,"Mar 17, 2009",9/10,"I couldn't believe the people who voted poorly for this legendary, top creative movie. I'm dead sure they didn't understand the story behind the world & the principles of the Matrix. Go see this movie 5 times more, then watch the Animatrix & read the books, maybe you need a manual to make it to your minds who knows....I agree that a quite similar idea was used in Alex Proyas' Dark City. But what if I tell you both Dark City, & this so called Star Trek Episode is a complete copy of another concept?Go see for yourself. Google these keywords down :""ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE by Plato""""Thinking so ruthless for the ones who create or derive ideas & improve them to a point where they can shape it into a movie, & not showing any respect for creative minds""....it's a very easy thing to do. If I start to think so blame oriented, then I come to a conclusion which is ""from this time ,no one should make a movie. No horror movies! No vampires, no werewolves, no creatures. No thrillers with killers. Why? because these were all used 200 centuries ago in books & literature. Oh all movies are copycats right!?!? Then I think we should kill ourselves, drink cyanide or something. there is nothing else to do in this world."

hrobertsizemore,"Nov 18, 2004",10/10,"What Star Wars brought to Sci-Fi and movie goers in 1977 the Matrix brought back in 1999. For a whole new generation of movie goers and for older fans of Sci-Fi The Matrix was one of those movies you go back and watch again and again. An excellent mix of technology, acting, and story. How many of us today have not felt or wondered if this is all real? Does the Matrix have you? Classic lines from the movie which ask questions on several levels.Casting was excellent, direction was top notch, and the CGI was over the top. People will forget or have forgotten the new methods and techniques that the Matrix brought to us that we now see on TV and every other movie out on the screen today. A much better product then the next two Matrix movies. I would recommend both of those to hard-core fans of the The Matrix. So if you want a great action flick or a great action flick which will make you think the Matrix is the movie for you to watch. Now after the success or lack of success of Matrix I, II, and III will there be a Number 4? Will Neo return? In many ways I hope he does."
Robin-55,"Mar 23, 1999",8/10,"This is a ludicrous film. Loud, brash and generally bombastic at every turn. Fortunately, it knows this and wears these features on its sleeve. It is knowing and ironic and has its tongue firmly in its cheek. The ideas, which will no doubt be hailed as 'startlingly original', are all stolen from Philip K. Dick, but at least its stealing from the best. It is basically familiar territory, territory mined by Dark City only a few years back. The Matrix, however, is an immeasurably superior film, simply by virtue of the fact that it does not take itself seriously. At times, the characters play their ludicrous lines so deadpan, it achieves a bizarre spooflike quality. Fishburne's performance, in particular, is splendidly arch as he delivers lines like 'Welcome to the desert of the real' with a misplaced Shakespearean grandeur.The effects are also ground-breaking and mostly effective. The use of slo-mo to eroticize the violence is reminiscent of Woo or even Peckinpah but with the use of clever CGI, Matrix achieves the feel of ballistic science. The shootouts do not revel in the familiar 'operatic grandeur' that has been a staple since Bonnie and Clyde. Rather, they play like FBI reconstructions of shootouts. We see the paths that bullets take, the positions of spent shell casings. It is shamelessly fetishistic and utterly irrelevant to the film's central idea but spectacular and exciting nonetheless.I hate virtually everything. Dark City was a nauseating waste of my time. Everything released over the last three summers has seemed despicably lazy film making. Godzilla, Armageddon...these films are offensive cynical money pits without a single grain of wit, a single interesting idea to tie the whole rotten mess together. Therefore, I fully anticipated hating the Matrix with equal vigor. As it was, I was pleasantly surprised. While I would make no claims that it was in any way a classic, it certainly appeared to have been put together with a great deal of love and humour and these attributes go a long way. It was overlong and unnecessarily portentous at times but these are minor quibbles when one is being bombarded by such a wealth of outrageous imagery and ideas. What other film could link Dick, Christ, Alice in Wonderland, Monty Python, Woo, Jackie Chan,  and still find time to make Keanu Reeves look good?"
Anonymous_Maxine,"Jun 1, 2000",10/10,"Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt."
Gaub,"Apr 19, 2003",6/10,"I saw this movie last night on German TV, and there must be something to it, because after I went to bed I dreamt I myself was caught in the Matrix, trying to convince Morpheus that an unexpected intruder to his ship was benign and ending up as Morpheus's secretary. Possibly it is the dreamlike quality of the movie that makes it a classic. There are some scenes visually compelling, if not really beautiful (e.g. the green insect penetrating Neo's body). But the excessive martial arts sequences were at first annoying and then, as they became more frequent, I was just bored by them (just as in Charlie's Angels, if this comparison is politically correct). Obviously martial arts are fashionable, but I never cared for Bruce Lee either. In general, The Matrix forgot about its lofty aspirations as it drew towards its end, turning into a plain action movie with endless special effects, fireworks, shooting, and all, even with a helicopter. But what about the very idea of the Matrix? Isn't it just nonsense? After all, if machines took control of the world, using human beings as ""batteries,"" these machines could easily put the poor humans into a perpetual coma, leaving them without consciousness, a state in which they would even spend less energy to sustain themselves, making the whole thing more efficient for the machines. Such human beings would not need any surrogate reality; the Matrix, which is not only a complex box of tricks, but also a waste of energy, would become obsolete."
a_nelson1-1,"Apr 29, 2003",1/10,"Tell me...what do you get when you take a bunch of computer nerds who have no concept of effective storytelling and put them into a room to make a movie...?  You get ""The Matrix""I hate this movie...and you wanna know why?  Because it serves no purpose. It's ""Dude, Where's my Car"" on steroids...louder, flashier, but not a bit more interesting.  The whole thing is based on special effects.  It's a film by two directors that think half of the cameras running at 300 fps is art...or something.Hugo Weaving has the only good performance in this movie as Agent Smith. Carrie Anne Moss is bland as can be.  Do I even have to comment on Keanu Reeves....dude...woah...nuff said.This is the perfect example of Joel Silver run amuck.  Just because you have money to produce movies, doesn't mean you should produce bad movies....sounds pretty obvious to me.  I'm just so thankful when I see someone like Steven Spielberg putting out a movie like Minority Report...a movie (actually...a director and crew) that knows how to USE special effects to drive a story.  Not just shoot the hell out of a government building...hmmmm...not such a great scene to slip in there now, huh?So, to everyone involved in The Matrix...give up your black leather, gun toting, world-is-an-illusion, horrible filmmaking and go put your money to good use...like film school."
PIST-OFF,"Oct 19, 2003",10/10,"i love this movie for the manny many themes that come up repeatedly. The story's arch is quite good in that it doesn't feel as though much of anything else could be added. The central philosophy is admirably brought to a movie that a mainstream audience can digest, along with metaphorical and allegorical strains of the bible, alice in wonderland, drug use, the life cycle, cartesian dualism, buddhist one consciousness, giger style enemies, artificial intelligence, newtonian physics, orwellian nightmares, and euclidean view of the world as a series of numbers and probabilities. Sci fi need not be the same old, evil monster chase humans without rhyme or reason. The movie dooes sidestep charecter development by making it's charecters not know who they are, and also by killing most of them off as soon as they are met. while this isn't the arty pretentious greatness of citizen kane or waking life, it is a movie that is likely to be long remembered and worshipped like Star Wars"
cyberknight,"Aug 13, 2008",10/10,"Like ""Blade Runner"", the ""Matrix"" trilogy has at least two different levels of story. Both are evident, but we, at first, only see the first and less important, which is the Matrix itself and the man-against-machine war. The second level, which is the central plot of the whole thing, is so obvious that it becomes invisible.If you liked this movie more than the sequel, ""Matrix: Reloaded"", then you, like almost everyone else, didn't understand it. If you are feeling bad about that, don't worry, it took me almost eight years to finally understand it, too! Many people liked this first part, the rest hated it, and both didn't understand it. Interestingly enough, the ones that hated it were closer to understanding it than those that liked it. People that didn't like the ""Matrix"" trilogy always talk about the ""shallow story"" and the ""cheap philosophy"". As much as they are right about the cheap philosophy, they are complete and absolutely wrong about the shallow story. The ""pseudo-philosophic junk"" is, actually, junk, but a very important part of the story, and that is so clear in this first part of the trilogy that no one actually realized it. It happens because, taken alone, ""The Matrix"" is just a fantasy movie, placed some time in the future.The key to realize the greatness of the ""Matrix"" trilogy is accepting that it is a science fiction, not a fantasy movie. With that in mind, you can find the real villain of the trilogy, then everything will make sense, including the things that make no sense at all in a science fiction movie, like Neo's skills, both inside and outside the Matrix. The really interesting thing is that the villain openly shows its evilness in ""Reloaded"", it even explains its reason to do the things it does, but we promptly forgive or forget it! And pay a lot of attention to the dialogs at the very ending, in ""Matrix: Revolutions"", don't be deceived or misled by the background, because they present the final results of the main struggle of the trilogy and you will realize who is the winner.So, follow the white rabbit and find out who is the real villain in the ""Matrix"" trilogy. After that, you will see that almost all speeches in it have two completely different meanings, one that supports a weak futuristic cloak-and-dagger flick, with lots of ""cool"", but unimportant Greek-and-whatever references, and another that leads to a much darker reality, which will make you love the whole trilogy, or more properly, the trilogy as a whole, not only this first installment."
au_law2001,"Jan 15, 2005",10/10,"Back when people feared the Y2k virus and when people thought the world were to end, and others didn't. This came out and put us on the edge of our seats! Yes one of the best movies ever made, and one of the most intriguing sci-fi's to be made, a movie that made Keanu Reeves big. The story is set in modern days, and now, someone finds out the reality they are in is fake, they are but bites in a computer. Wow, an original concept, and a great cast of characters, and not to mention the great special effects! The battle scenes and the unforgettable gun fights, and lets not forget the memorable and very recognizable scene with the slowdowns and Trinity doing that poise. And the bullets the way they move in slow motion, it started it all. And I like especially the part when Neo asked for guns, lots and lots of guns, they all appeared at once in a flash! It's great, recommended to all who like fast paced action and sci-fi. Watch it. You know you want to."
Bergmo,"Jan 15, 2005",10/10,"This remains my number one favorite movie of all time. The 2nd one was alright. 3rd one nearly made me cry, what a horrible way to end this series. What made this movie great was the same reason that made A Clorkwork Orange great, it was very original and entertaining. That scene where Neo does the crazy bend back to dodge the bullets thing was purely amazing. Very unique storyline what with turning humans to batteries. That was just brilliant. I dare to even say that I liked the acting. Keanu Reeves and Laurance Fishburne(not sure if that's spelled right) were what clearly made this movie what it is. I still can't tell if Morpheous is a homosexual."
Brawl_666,"May 14, 2010",10/10,"'The Matrix' must be one of the most ambitious and highly successful projects of the past twenty years. Its difficult to imagine how this film could have gone from conception to execution, and succeeded with such flying colors. For a long time I've avoided writing a review because this was my ""Godfather"" or ""Star Wars"" movie, having first seen it at 13 and instantly falling in love with it. I could never be truly objective about this movie, nor could I find a single truthful, objective analysis of it anywhere on IMDb or RT. Roger Ebert's review was nice, but too harsh.'Bound' helped me appreciate better how 'Matrix' was conceived. Neither of these two films has a single wasted moment. It seems that the Wachowskis build a film by cascading a set of scenes, like a series of dominos, so that each scene projects into the next one. This is of course what all screenwriters do, but as simple as it sounds, it is no mean feat. The most important part of any film, I think, is how you connect scenes, how you work on transitions so as to create meaning and plausibility. What you show, how you show, and most importantly, what you Don't show. This is extremely difficult. It requires a deep understanding of the cognitive mechanics at work between a film and a viewer. It is, if you like, the most important part of film-making, as important (if not more) than the actual shooting process.The brothers nailed this whole conception business down to the last detail. The editor won an Oscar, but the film was streamlined by the directors for perfect editing. The cinematography and sound design is breathtaking. Joel Silver brought another influence to bear in terms of production expertise. They worked on the formidable design and effects requirements, even bringing in a legendary Hong Kong action choreographer for the martial arts scenes.And then they made casting choices that could not have been better. This film rests on the visual and vocal libido of the leads. It works only because the actors work, because we relate and identify with them. Just watch Weaving and Fishburne scorch the frame in their respective parts; these are their best roles. Moss is visually apt. Reeves is unwittingly perfect for his role, more perfect than anyone could have imagined.Another important part of this film is the self-reference. This film riffs on itself many times in many ways, such as when Mouse asks Neo how the machines could possibly know about the taste of Tasty Wheat. This is essentially winking at the viewer by momentarily snapping the plausibility of the whole idea. Also, this whole franchise is one big stab at the Terminator movies and their enduring popularity. Instead of time travel, we have virtual reality. Instead of terminators, we have agents. Instead of John Connor....None of this explains how they came up with this concept. The keystone of the arch is hidden. There are countless other 'influences' here : Phil Dick, William Gibson, Doctor Who, Grant Morrisson's 'The Invisibles' etc. And as with Tarantino, we are unable to say for sure whether it is homage or plagiarism. The innovation lies in the architecture of the whole thing, in the layering, in the flawless integration of so many different design elements to form a seamless, coherent entity. The Matrix is everywhere indeed.This is the only way to make movies."
eeuuhombre,"Jun 6, 2004",N/A,"Keanu Reaves, Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie Ann MossThe Matrix is a very interesting movie about reality. How does one know exactly what is going on in their lives, if they are confined only to what their 5 senses are telling them?The Hype: Hype is hype, no matter what movie is popular at the time. Do not listen to your friends who tell you it sucked, or was totally awesome. Watch it yourself, and rate it.The Acting: Many people say that the acting in this movie was horrible. I disagree. I think that a large group of people trying to get their world back wouldn't have much of a culture to make an example for them on how to express themselves in ""this certain way"" that most other movies are shown in. Everyone in the movie was acting humbled by fear, which is exactly what anyone would act like in that situation.The Story: It raises a lot of discussion points, and ideas of what is reality, what is control (picks up more in Matrix Reloaded), religious references (mostly for extremists to scream at each other about), armageddon, do we need machines, is there a such thing as technologically going too far, should AI theory be developed; ect. I believe the storyline of this movie was a lot better than most others, especially nowadays, when movies like ""The Fast and the Furious"", ""XXX"", ""Torque"", and my own personal least-favorite, ""Biker Boyz"".  If you have action, then why not have more of a story.Action: Really cool for the time, but once you've seen a fight scene once or twice, it's time to move on.Good Movie  9.5 out of 10go see it"
matrix-9,"Mar 29, 1999",10/10,"There is nothing more I can say about this amazing movie...GO experience it for yourself!  You will not be disappointed...  it has already gotten my vote for the best and most ground-breaking sci-fi pic for the decade... and it will no doubt pioneer a string of similar ones in the future!  This movie has given me hopes for Sci-fi films in the future...Even if ""Star Wars"" doesn't live up to its hype, I am still a happy man this year!"
Xarx117,"Apr 28, 2022",10/10,The concept of the matrix is really awsome. The first minutes of the film are incredibly suspensefull. They leave you asking a bunch of question. I love the revelation of the dark wolrd we live in and how the scenes follow theme self to rapidly throw us in this situation. The following sequence are not more boring because we always learn more and more about the world and everything makes sense. The Matrix also have some of the best fight scenes and badass sequence of Hollywood. Its a good interpretation of how people can redicaly change when put up to the truth. This is definitly a very original and one of a kind concept and one of the best movie ever.
se_vaan,"Jan 22, 2004",1/10,"The Matrix is perhaps the most overrated movie i have ever seen, it doesnt offer anything but... Overwrited or other manner bad and comic dialog. Amusing armchair amateur philosophy that makes me laugh! Boring, overcool, unintentional-comic and baffled looking kung fu fights and shooting scenes with stupid looking slowmotions. Also a lot of clichés and scenes that are copied from other movies. I give The Matrix 1/10 and it deserves its 100%. Dont ever watch this movie, its waste of time and maybe waste of money if you rent it or go to cinema to see it!"
budmassey,"May 5, 2001",9/10,"I really like this movie, but seeing it ranked #40 of all time is laughable. There is, or course, the geek effect, the fact that techie folk who frequent this forum are likely to rate a techie film abnormally high, but there must be hundreds of films, at least, that deserve to be ranked higher than this one.Granted, it is a great story.  Not Star Wars great, and certainly not Lawrence of Arabia or even Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe great.  But oh what a concept.  Humans have been subjugated by their machines, a concept James Cameron explored ages ago in the Terminator pictures.  But Matrix has more wow and gee whiz than any of its genre.The fight scenes are spectacular.  Carrie-Anne Moss kicks ass and looks great doing it.  Hugo Weaving may not be the most intimidating man in black, and I still think of him as Mitzi from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but I wouldn't get on his bad side.  And I have to admire this movie for not going the brain dead muppet route of so many otherwise great sci-fi films just to milk the aftermarket.Keanu Reeves, who has made a great career out of so very little talent, may have found his best vehicle since Bill and Ted.  His deadpan, detached delivery is perfect, especially in the films climactic battle between Reeves and Weaving.  I have to say that I can't imagine a Matrix without him.My absolute favorite scene is the one with Spoon Boy.  ""There is no spoon."" I still get chills.  I also have to say that I didn't quite buy Joe Pantoliano selling out his comrades because he missed the taste of a good steak.  I think that story line could have used a little work.  Laurence Fishburne is definitely the class of the cast, and I am delighted that he has signed on for both sequels, already in production.All in all, you absolutely must own this movie.  It is fraught with clever allusions, dazzling effects, and more fun than summer vacation."
espadajusta,"Aug 6, 2021",8/10,"Despite some plot holes, and recurring to ""the chosen one"" explanation, Matrix is certainly a classic action movie from the 90's. It boasted some extraordinary effects and action scenes at the time, making it one of the best movies of the genre. It is worth watching.However, this movie created a new fashion in action movies of exaggerated fight scenes, explosions, and indiscriminate special effects with very poor stories that ruined the action genre until today."
evanston_dad,"Jun 30, 2010",9/10,"The fanboy cult that has since arisen around ""The Matrix"" makes me want to not like it, but I do have to admit that the first installment in the mind-bending sci-fi saga is pretty kick ass.I had to have my friends explain it to me, of course, but once they did I thought it was one of the coolest premises ever conceived. ""The Matrix"" is like ""Pulp Fiction"" -- in many ways, it defined the culture of its time and has had a major impact on everything since. And it's also in the same league as films like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Terminator 2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" that redefined what movie special effects could do.The first sequel was incomprehensible and I haven't (and probably won't) see the third film, but I like this one.Grade: A"
braddugg,"Sep 8, 2014",8/10,"A great looking film that has less substance than the expectation.It's a movie that looks great and even the premise is outstanding but is made comical i action ruining the point to an extent. Surely, when I saw it in theaters when I was very young I loved it and went gaga and saw the whole trilogy in theaters and liked t to an extent But now, when I revisited it after several years, the 'wow' factor has gone and now it seems like any other action film.Surely, in terms of action and the whole production design, this was the first of it's kind that had the greenish tinge to frames and setting up infinite space in a room, in that complete white background scene where ""Neo"" and Morpheus talk.Keanu Reeves as Neo/Thomas Anderson was good ad so was Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity but I loved Morpheus played y Laurence Fishburne the most as his character was the epitome of setting men free from bondage and in his own way.The writer-directors Wachowskis must be appreciated and credited a lot for having taken the Hollywood action sequences to a new level. Be it the ""Bullet movement"" or the ""walking on the walls"" they were stunningly and with an ease.We know, that none of it is possible, this is a science fantasy film that takes the premise from the myths of ""being free from world"". It takes from the Buddhism concept of ""Nirvana"" I think that means liberation of the soul. Yet, we are engaged in a way much better than many sci-fi films that this makes us believe in the theory at least.I might not like this whole picture being seen again, but I am going with a 3/5 that means the film is surely good. I might not watch this again just that I am not much into action."
Odin-2,"Mar 24, 1999",9/10,"This movie had everything.  Great special effects, a strong story, and even Keanu Reeves put in a good performance.  I spent the whole movie switching between shuddering at the view of the future, and saying ""Wow, how did they do that shot.""  Definitely one of the best action movies of the past few years."
ariannafox,"Dec 5, 2019",10/10,"There is so much to say about this. The first and most epic of all 3, it introduces the characters you love throughout the entire series.The types and shadows and allegories to Christianity and how so many people are as Agent Smith says, ""billions living out their lives... oblivious...""Every part was well thought out and the the absolutely AMAZING sci-fi storyline, intricate details and character depth, as well as superb incredible special effects, action, and OH! the MUSIC!!!Must see!"
apollo_projects-685-479654,"Mar 10, 2021",8/10,"A good adaptation of Plato's allegory of the cave, only let down at times by some wooden or corny acting. The Greek, and original, version of ""Know Thyself"", (Gnothi Seauton), was inscribed in the forecourt of the temple to Apollo at Delphi, the site of the Delphic Oracle, the most important Oracle in the classical Greek world. Plato employs the fundamental principle of 'Know Thyself' extensively in his books by having the character of Socrates use it as the means of motivational emphasis in his dialogues. Neo is good and Trinity fabulous in the catsuit."
edels,"Jan 20, 2003",6/10,"At first I loved this film, but now, after half a dozen viewings realise I was suckered by the effects. The acting is poor and Keanu is totally unconvincing in his macho martial arts pose which causes him to look like a complete prat in one of the films unintentionally funniest moments. The story has too many religious undertones for my comfort and lacks plausibility. However a spectacular and moody film which in the right circumstances is highly entertaining and watchable. I would suggest as more worthy alternatives Blade Runner or Twelve Monkeys."
Thanos6,"Apr 10, 2001",1/10,"It's ridiculous that a film like this is in the top 250, much less the top 50.  This is a film with not a single redeeming value.  The special effects are really nothing to write home about, the plot has so many holes you could pilot a 747 through them, and Keanu Reeves gives his usual performance; that is, being outacted by the scenery.  I recommend watching this once, to truly appreciate how bad it is."
ike-6,"Mar 29, 1999",9/10,"As much as i dislike Keanu Reeves' acting ability,...as much as the trailer for this flick told u absolutely nuthin...as much as i had no faith ... i am now a true believer. this movie was fantastic. it had as much action as ""blade,"" but with an incredible sci-fi edge that was deep as well as breathtakingly exciting. the storyline was good and solid and the movie's pace kept me jumping in my seat. what the hell,...i'm going back to see it again!"
bilging,"Jan 8, 2025",10/10,"The Matrix (1999) is a revolutionary achievement in cinema, blending philosophical depth, cutting-edge visual effects, and a mind-bending narrative into a perfect sci-fi experience. The Wachowskis' masterful direction creates a thought-provoking story about reality, control, and human freedom, while the bullet-time effects redefined action filmmaking forever. Keanu Reeves delivers an iconic performance as Neo, supported by a stellar cast including Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss. The film's fusion of cyberpunk aesthetics, martial arts choreography, and a pulse-pounding soundtrack make it a cultural milestone that remains timeless."
extraplay-61838,"Nov 12, 2022",10/10,"The Matrix (1999) - changed my life, 10/10 or wow words can not describe the impact of this film. Because of it I began to see the world differently.I have watched this so many times, that I can quote lines from it. This IS THE film that made all the other film makers think of doing films differently.This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging."
trashgang,"Jun 14, 2020",9/10,"Seen it when it came out and now I saw it again on Netflix for two reason, What is the matrix and to get back into the story because Matrix 4 is on the way.Over 20 years old and it is still standing strong. Effects back then were unseen and even nowadays they are still top notch. Lust also be one of the first flicks to use wires in fight scene's.On the other hand there's a lot of blah blah to stand through but there's enough action to make it even. Only the score used from bands big back then is outdated.Nevertheless, a hell of a movie, instant classicGore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 5/5
Story 3,5/5
Comedy 0/5"
