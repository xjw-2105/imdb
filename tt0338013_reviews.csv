It would be kind of stupid to pass judgement on a film that I didn't fully understand.Some years later I watched it for the second time. My ex had just left me, and I don't remember how and why I came by this movie again. But the second time I got it. And how life would be like a bleak dessert, frozen in time, in the eternal sunshine of a spotless mind.And after watching it a second time I felt hopeful again."
A_FORTY_SEVEN,"Mar 20, 2019",9/10,"My Rating : 9/10""I ditched work today. Took a train out to Montauk. I don't know why. I'm not an impulsive person. I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning. ""Gorgeous filmmaking. An absolute must-see!Superb screenplay writing and performances."
Superunknovvn,"Jul 2, 2004",9/10,"There's only one way to describe ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"": perfect. It's been one week since I saw the movie and I still cannot stop thinking about it. Was the ending happy or sad? I cannot tell, but it's deeply touching.Charlie Kaufman is incredible. How does he come up with all these original, flawless scripts? Finally there's someone who uses the possibilities of cinema to the fullest. I love the way Kaufman shows the fate of individuals and derives universally true rules from it. The content of his story is always highly philosophical without ever being smart alec.Some say ""Eternal Sunshine..."" was over-directed. I disagree. Having read the script, I know that Gondry deserves lots of credit for bringing this beautiful story to life. Sure, there are five creepy images per minute, but have you ever seen such an original, weird picture? Mind you, I'm not saying that lots of effects automatically make for a good direction, but in this case it really helped to underline the story, not distracting from it.Jim Carrey... wow! I've always liked him as the hilarious Comedian he is, but I never thought that his performances in ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man On The Moon"" were that much of a departure from his funny-man side. As Joel, however, he is a completely different person. It's like Jim Carrey had a serious twin brother. Unbelievable. I bow to this performance! Give this man more chances to show his acting abilities, I say!Finally I have to mention Beck's cover of ""Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime"", which fits perfectly into the movie and won't leave my CD-Player for the next months.A movie like ""Eternal Sunshine..."" really shows how much time and money Hollywood wastes on producing crap like ""Bad Boys"" or ""The Fast & The Furious"", and its box office result demonstrates how little people care about quality in movies. Personally, I have found my first contender for best motion picture of the year. I need to see the movie again, because I have a feeling that this one gets even better with each viewing. I can't wait until it's released on DVD.I feel the need to say more, but I can't put my feelings into (English) words. All I can say is: GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You won't regret it."
doctec,"Mar 22, 2004",N/A,"Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup.  Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (""Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it""); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.The film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind.  He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her.  He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active.   Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped.  His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.The manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences.  Michel Gondry's visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human.  The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds.  Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.While there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters.  As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you're ever likely to see.  I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause.  This gives an idea of how compelling this movie can be.  If you give this film a chance to creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate to them.  A thought provoking, moving and entertaining film - I can imagine that a working title of this film might have been ""Warts And All."""
samuellewis48,"May 6, 2004",10/10,"After a lukewarm reception in 2001 with ""Human Nature"", Charlie Kaufman has teamed up with director, Michel Gondry again for this romatic fantasy. With a name like Jim Carrey, this second collaboration couldn't go wrong in terms of box office success, and nor should it as this film is quite simply brilliant.""Eternal Sunshine"" centres around the life of Joel (Jim Carrey) a shy, mild mannered man who is heart broken after splitting from his feisty, impulsive girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet). A short while after their split, he meets her again while she is working at a library and he is stunned to discover that she doesn't recognise him. He later finds out that the reason for this is that Clementine has had her memory of Joel wiped out completely. Dr Howard Mierwick (Tom Wilkinson) has performed an operation on her brain after Clementine visited his clinic to forget Joel. Much to Joel's distress, he decides to do the same, but during his operation he revisits memories of Clementine that he struggles to let go of.If anyone was in doubt as to whether Jim Carrey can act, this is the film that will put all doubt out of the way. He performs with sensitivity and warmth, never once verging on the manic rubber faced lunacy to which he is most well known for. Out of all the perfomances where he has stepped into the dramtic role (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, The Majestic), this has got to be his best yet. Kate Winslet is also brilliant as his unpredictable, adventurous girlfriend.Kaufman's story of a man going into a surreal dream world is not too dissimilar from his earlier work, ""Being John Malkovich"". You have off the wall images such as Carrey re-enacting his 4 year old self along his journey in his head. The eccentricity of the story, which is Kaufman's trademark, once again works excellently. When watching this you generally care for Carrey and Winslet, in much the same way as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in ""Lost In Translation"". Gondry's diection gives a bittersweet flavour to the tale.The sub plots involving the supporting characters who are operating are ingenius. Tom Wilkinson once again proves that he is one of the best British actors of his generation and he is backed up by great performnces from Kirsten Dunst and a post-LOTR Elijah Wood.This is a lovely film and if you like originality with a sense of fantasy with a love story, then I suggest you see it. It's one of those films you'll want to see twice."
Apollo_11,"Oct 6, 2004",6/10,"I'm a movie lover and I own 1000s of DVDs from all eras, so I like to think I have an eye for a really great movie... So why am I scratching my head after watching this and seeing over 49% of 12,000 voters giving this a 10? I just don't get it.To be honest, I found the movie pretty average. It has some great acting by Winslet and Carrey and the soundtrack is quite enchanting. I suppose the storyline does touch the emotional nerves of anyone who has been in love and felt pain from it, but nothing I haven't seen done better in other (mostly ""World Cinema"") movies. The direction and style of the movie is nothing revolutionary (contradicting a point raised quite often here).I was wondering was it something to do with the general reviews of the film? One trend I've found on IMDb is that the vast majority of people tend to echo what reviews have said about a film, even if they (deep down) don't feel that way themselves about it? I'm not sure, I tend not to read reviews until after I've watched a film.I gave the film 6/10 as I was feeling generous. It really doesn't deserve anything more than this."
Quinoa1984,"Oct 27, 2004",10/10,"Michel Gondry, credited as the director and co-writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is only partly responsible for the success that the film achieves. He implements a awe-inspiring blend of style to a story that is perfectly non-linear. But then there is also the madman genius of the current screen writing plane- Charlie Kaufman- who has written three of the most ingenious, funny, and human of ""little"" Hollywood movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind).He understands, and perhaps likely experienced to a degree, what a relationship holds to- the truth, to understanding, and then when it ends, how out memory changes the relationship. Enter in the concept that makes 'Eternal Sunshine' something of a un-official science fiction film - the Lacuna corporation, led by Tom Wilkinson's character, can erase just one person out of your memory, all of the experiences that you and the significant other had. So, when Joel (Jim Carrey) goes in to erase his memory of Clementine (Kate Winslet) after finding out she did just the same, he enters into a mind-warp. He goes through memories they had, happy ones, sad ones, some that are just what makes up what you have emotionally with the one you've loved. And sometimes, and to the behest of the assistants of Lacuna (Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo), Joel doesn't want them all to be erased.As I mentioned, the plot is non-linear, which could've gone the wrong way if not done with skill. With a film like 21 Grams, which has a talented director and cast, the non-linear structure isn't necessary. But it's an asset that the story doesn't start from A to Z. To assist Gondry with this, he has the extraordinary Ellen Kuras as DP and Valdís Óskarsdóttir, an editor from Iceland. Their collaboration is crucial with Gondry and Kaufman (and co-writer Pierre Bismuth), as they bring all of these un-real images a real quality. Quite simply, there isn't a finer example of surrealism crossbred with realism in any other American film so far this year. The usage of lights, cuts, and with the kinds of special effects not expected (i.e. no CGI), add to the effect it has on a viewer. That the characters of Joel and Clementine are as enveloping as they are is also a credit to Kaufman.But then there's one more part that completes the success of the film - the acting. Jim Carrey, very simply, is at his very best. He finds a balance from certain scenes in being like people we see everyday, feeling low, not much of interest, inward. And then when the memory erases begin, we get to see him act funny, but not like the kind of humor he brought with Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. This is Carrey knowing this character just well enough to play off his counterpart, played by Winslet. She, meanwhile, is perhaps at her best. Her character is eccentric, funny, insightful, and wanting. She pulls it off. As do the supporting actors.There's not much more I can say about this film, except to say that even after seeing it three times, I feel like I could watch it over and over and see a new shot, a new sequence, and new set of emotions tied to things. It's one of the great romantic dramedies of the decade."
saraheberkner,"Nov 25, 2024",3/10,"I was surprised at Kate Winslet's character because she is quite unlikable, and they didn't really seem like a couple at all. I like Jim Carrey in the Truman Show and he's fine here, I like him better in serious roles. But it's a really slow paced movie like others have said. Not horrible but not what I'd call good.I have to compare it to Secret Life of Walter Mitty which I was thinking of while watching this because it also ""makes a statement about life"" and ""has a good soundtrack"" but is better in every way. Or to La La Land which is also about a breakup. I would be surprised if someone thinks this is objectively as good as either of those."
rje58,"Mar 24, 2004",N/A,"If you can relate to the underlying theme of love longed for, love given and received, and love lost, this is a great film. If you have come to understand that acceptance can -sometimes- be a great thing and not a compromise or a 'settle for' - this is a moving film.As crazy and almost surreal as elements of this film are, it somehow remains honest and real. That seems like a contradiction... life is contradictory, isn't it?Carrey and Winslet both turn in superb performances, as do the supporting cast.  An incredible film that most of the people who 'get it' will love - but I suspect there will be more than a small percentage who won't understand it or can't relate to it and they will (understandably) dislike it."
SnoopyStyle,"Sep 23, 2013",9/10,"Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) falls for Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) from the first moment they meet on a train. After a bad breakup, Clementine erases Joel from her memories. He decides to do the same to her. Patrick (Elijah Wood), Stan (Mark Ruffalo), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) are the three slacker technicians who are running Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson)'s machine. As his memories are eliminated, he starts to fall in love with Clementine all over again. He struggles to hold on to his memories before it's all gone.The premise is amazing, but it's the imaginative visualization of the process that puts in on another level. Jim Carrey pours his heart into this very difficult disjointed performance. It's very effecting and probably one of his best non-impersonation performance. In its core, it's a beautiful love story. It's funny. It's poignant."
mstomaso,"May 6, 2006",10/10,"Very nicely crafted science fiction love story. More of an experience than a film.What? Sci Fi? Well yes. A simple science fiction device, memory erasure, is the vehicle for this beautifully shot, brilliantly edited and directed love fable. The fact that this is a good film does not disqualify it from the sci fi genre. In fact, would-be sci fi writers and film-makers should take note of this.But Eternal Sunshine is a love story first and last, in all respects. The characters are what John Irving would call ""L.A. dysfunctional"", although they don't live in L.A. Carrey and Winslet are deeply insecure people with little going for them but good looks (which they try to disguise), fairly sweet dispositions, and a desire for companionship. They meet on Valentine's Day in Montauk, where they have both seemingly traveled 'on a lark', and the entire experience of the film seems to derail from this point forward. Chronological, linear story-telling becomes impossible because the characters are having their memories erased in order to assuage the pain of their separation. No spoilers, so let me stop right there.If I have made Eternal Sunshine seem like it might be too much of a challenge or too disturbing for an evening's light entertainment, be not afraid. Certainly there are occasional disturbing elements, and the characters themselves are all neurotic enough to have walked off the street and onto the screen. But the film is so artistically rendered, and so well thought-out that what could have been a nightmare really becomes a fantastic post-modern love fable. It's also one of those great films that becomes predictable after a while, but is so delightfully portrayed and satisfying that it does not matter.The acting is exceptionally good. I would expect nothing else from this cast. Winslet is especially remarkable for her ability to play a young North East American better than most American actresses could. How this genius has been passed up in each of her 4 Oscar nominations to date is inexplicable. Carrey's talent is undeniable, though I dislike many of the films he chooses to take on. His performance here is easily as good as his award-worthy performances in the Truman Show, Bruce Almighty, and Man on the Moon.We spend a lot of time inside people's heads in this film, yet the camera never becomes a member of the cast as it does in films like ""Being John Malkovich"". I can pay no higher compliment to the production team. This is a very difficult thing to accomplish, and it is done with flawless simplicity in Eternal Sunshine. This film has just joined Shakespeare in Love, Wild at Heart, and Brokeback Mountain among my favorite all-time love stories. This is the first Michel Gondry film I have seen. I am going to make sure it is not the last."
TheLittleSongbird,"Nov 24, 2010",10/10,"When I first saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I wasn't expecting to love it, let alone like it. What a surprise when I saw it! I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don't mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.I especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography which is indeed spellbinding but also in the scenery which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.I was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring if at all, and the direction is adept.I have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's performances either. As good as the supporting performances are especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films, The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.Overall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Matt_Layden,"Feb 13, 2005",10/10,"Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.Well, if you're familiar with Kaufman's work, then you know what your getting yourself into. This is just as weird if not weirder than his previous work, Being John Malkovich. I knew what I was getting myself into, but 90% of the movie I was saying to myself ""What the hell is going on?"", but in a good way. It opens with Joel calling in sick for work and going on a different train, heading for Montauk. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Now this is about 15 minutes into the movie, then out of nowhere come the opening credit sequence. I will admit, I thought it would be different, but I'm glad that it is the way it is, the movie is 80% of the time in Joel's head.If you think you know Carrey, think again. This movie is his best performance, better than Majestic, Truman show and all of his comedic roles (which is what I love him for). Just looking at his face from the second we see him, we feel his pain, then like that, we feel his joy, embarrassment and hate. Just awesome acting on his part, and Winslet was great as the free spirit who never seems satisfied. The supporting cast all work well in their small, yet important roles. Oscar nominations for Winslet and (crosses fingers) Carrey.But if I were to bet any money on any Oscar nominations it would obviously be the writing, what a mess, but beautifully constructed. You think to yourself, is that scene really necessary? Then ten minutes later you think to yourself how brilliant it was, that's beautiful, crazy, give me whatever he's smoking kind of writing. Charlie Kaufman's writing is always clever, but this time he's one-upped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but 'Eternal Sunshine' manages to dazzle you with it's originality and it's poignancy. The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a self-consciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.Michel Gondry's use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handy cam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. He decides to use more practical effects than what we see today with computers.Eternal Sunshine is a tragic, yet beautiful film that sits at the top of my list of ""Best of 2004""."
silly-lil-thing,"Dec 23, 2004",10/10,"this is my favorite movie of 2004 and definitely one of the top in my all-time favorite lists!Eternal touched a certain part of you, your heart that most shows never did. or rather could never did. it shows the fragility of a relationship. people want to erase bad memories of a failed relationship yet at the same time, cant bear to part with the good ones! how so can that be done? how can you erase bad memories and saved good ones only? Carrey and Winslet did a perfect job acting as Joel and Clementine respectively. Arguably one of their career best so far. its a pleasant surprise to see the man behind ""The Mask"" playing such a quiet and introvert role. Kate, on the other hand, brought Clementine to new heights as the bubbly and brutally honest lass who you love and hate.Eternal is a definite marvel, a feat in itself. its rich and flamboyant yet fragile. it brings the audience to such a personal level it hurts. especially when both cant seem to escape from the erasure.well-done!"
sbg-6,"May 20, 2006",6/10,"I usually like this kind of film - anything that looks at why we do the things we do, takes a character or two lovers on a winding and beautiful road through all kinds of confusion until they finally get hold of themselves again.The premise is obvious enough but with plenty of scope to tell a good story. Unfortunately it just isn't told well enough. The thing with any story like this is that you really have to invest yourself in the protagonists for it to work. Otherwise it just becomes academic, an interesting question but one where you're not too bothered about the answer. There's a problem with performances and material. Carrey plays a roughly similar role to Truman in the Truman Show, but with so little nuance in the script and evidently something lacking in the direction, he doesn't manage nearly the depth of that character, and none of the humour. Much the same applies to Winslett, who just doesn't seem to have any material to work with.As I say, it's a shame, because there's a great cast here and a good idea - it would have worked if they'd spent a few months more working on the script. As it is, despite this being exactly my kind of film, I'm surprised by the overridingly positive response here."
baileycrawly,"Mar 15, 2020",3/10,"This movie isn't bad. In fact, the acting is good and I commend the writers and director for the way in which they chose to tell their story.
But for it me it just doesn't work. There's not enough of a focus or cohesive story to hold my interest. There's not even continuity, with this film intentionally jumping through a number of time periods. It was a tedious film to endure when I watched it, and not something that left me with any desire to watch again."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 17, 2022",9/10,"Joel and Clementine have reached breaking point in their relationship, every action, every word triggers the other, so much so, that they each undergo a procedure to remove all trave of the other.How wonderful a thought, being able to remove all trace of an ex, better still having them remove all trace of you.It has taken me years to get this film, years, I simply didn't get it, I'd tried several times over the years, it just never clicked, until now. If you're frustrated by the first twenty minutes, I urge you to give it another try.We've all been there, hurt by a relationship, pushed to the point of despair, how wonderful it would be to remove all trace, it's a wonderful concept, but real life doesn't allow for that, however in film, anything is possible.Wonderfully nightmarish, but sweet and tender at times too, the moments of hate and loathing are eclipsed by Joel and Clem's tender scenes.The only thing I can think of that had similar vibes, was Total Recall, dissimilar in most aspects, but that whole memory manipulation theme is similar.I have forever been a fan of Jim Carrey, and I would regard this as one of his best performances, he's terrific, as is Kate Winslet, the pair combined so well.9/10."

mardalsfossen01,"Jun 3, 2019",6/10,"I can understand if there's people who love this movie, but for me the whole setting felt a bit too staged. Jim Carrey's role is different than what he usually plays and it's nice to watch him act; Winslet is okay I guess.The movie surely has it's unique parts, worthy being worshipped, but the whole thing didn't deeply touch me and for me it's ironically more a forgettable film."
nicholls905-280-546911,"Oct 20, 2019",10/10,"Easily one of the best films from 2004.

Great film that deserved more attention."
sdcrenovations,"Dec 30, 2018",6/10,"Grossly over rated.
Cool story . But just seemed flat to me."
Peridonian,"Dec 11, 2022",5/10,"I went into this movie with very high expectations. Everything I had heard about this movie from friends was very positive. The general consensus with this film is that it is very good. Devastating. Emotional. Beautiful.To me it feels like I watched a completely different film than the one others described. I found this movie extremely lacking in basically every aspect except the acting. It's campy, and not in a good way. The aesthetic choices can be summarized as ""mid 2000s digital slag"". Nothing about this movie impressed or moved me in any meaningful way. I was simply glad it ended. Like I said, the acting was good, but Jim Carrey was the wrong man for the role. It did not capture me. It made me cringe. Perhaps it would be better on rewatches, but nothing in this film makes me want to watch it again. ""Goofy"" is probably the most apt word I can use to describe it.Average."
Hitchcoc,"Feb 15, 2006",8/10,"This is a real mind bender (no pun intended). I really liked the premise because it opens up great implications for us all. How far are we from the manipulation of specific brain centers? We can already do a fair amount. The reality is that even if one can erase memories, we can't curtail the ""butterfly effect ""of our actions. We have trod the earth and the small or large changes we inspire, create something new. Now project love and romance, and, given time, let it percolate. You have Jim Carry and Kate Winslet being ""forced"" back together because despite their minds, they never left. And if the memories were inconsequential in the larger picture, their remnants will continue to influence. Pretty thought provoking. We are more than our memories--we are part of the entire picture."
Pseudus,"Dec 5, 2024",6/10,"I think this film is respectable for many different things, but is also very grating in others. The concept of this movie, and the story it tells, are incredibly moving. However, the characters are incredibly not. Now this may be the point, to have the characters be so profoundly unlikeable, but just because it was intentional doesn't make it good. The male lead is unimpressive, soft, infantilized, boring, and indecisive. The female lead; unhinged, impulsive, with the viewer able to make a founded amateur diagnosis of some kind of bipolar disorder or sociopathy.Either way, their natural opposition and terrible chemistry have you actively rooting against their relationship for the sake of the wellbeing of the characters, while the point of the ""romance"" story is to force them together beyond all odds. This leaves the whole film in an unpleasant dissonance.This movie has incredible potential, and I would love to see it remade, with a better emphasis on depth of character, rather than a superficial demonstration of ""opposites attract""."
Ben-Hibburd,"Sep 28, 2017",4/10,"I think it goes without saying amongst fellow film aficionados, that we all love films, especially the great ones. However over the years watching films I've noticed there seems to be that one film that is hugely popular, but when you sit down to watch it, you can't understand why it's held in such high regard. For me it's only happened a couple of times, but I unfortunately have to add Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to the list.Whilst I appreciated the original screenplay from Charlie Kaufman(whose work I usually love), it felt completely flat. I was never engaged at any moment in the film, the characters were extremely unlikable and had horrible personalities. Other then one emotional scene towards the end with Kirsten Dunst's character, the film felt dull and lifeless. At no point did I feel invested in the story. I was unable to buy into Joel(Jim Carrey) and Clementine's(Kate Winslet) impromptu relationship, which dissolved just as quickly as it began, giving me no time with their characters to care about their eventual fate.Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give excellent performances, as do the entire cast. I just disliked their characters. The technical aspects of the film were well done. The way the film showcases memories, and the way they subsequently disappeared/folded into each other was expertly crafted and brilliantly edited. The only issue is the story and the characters didn't work for me. No matter how good the direction and editing is, the majority of the the time a film lives or dies by the strength of it's story and it's characters, and here it ultimately failed."
newyorkcine,"Jan 22, 2018",10/10,"This film is just SO GOOD. It is a masterpiece.
Original yet simple, Touching but not sappy.
It has no political agenda, It's just for you, human being.
The soundtrack is subtle, it is not trying to lead you by the nose.
It's humorous, authentic, beautiful, imaginative, thoughtful, and timeless.No Hollywood train wreck here.I sincerely want to thank IMDb, I discovered this by browsing in the science fiction category. I checked out quite a few lemons before discovering this gem.Sometimes a kind act by a random stranger renews your love of life.This is such a film."
alishahmohd,"Jul 5, 2014",10/10,"Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind is a love story about two lovers who undergo a procedure to erase each other from one another's memories, but when they meet after their memory is gone, there is something strange still drawing them together and it is also during that memory wipe that they realize how precious their relationship really was.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of those films where you have to pay close attention to the scenes and dialog because even the smallest bit of dialog is important in this film. Because otherwise you will be confused in your initial viewing and will soon be asking yourself what in the world is going on. This film requires close attention in the initial viewing or multiple viewings in order to fully understand it and appreciate it for what it truly is.The film is not your basic love story, it is unique and sort of bizarre at the same time, and while it is not a suspense movie, it is filled with several shocking moments and twists, which will only increase your interest in the movie and the more you will be intrigued by it. The narrative part of the love story is also told in a reverse chronological order, which starts from the moment the lovers broke up and ends when they first met. While the present scenes are told in a normal order, the film constantantly switches back and forth between the two which may create some confusion, another one of the reasons that this film requires close attention, at first you will probably be confused about what you are seeing is the present or the past, but as the film will progress you will be able to tell them apart. The way the Narrative is similar to Mememto which also followed a reverse chronological order of storytelling. The storytelling is clever and interesting and only makes the film better and it's twists more shocking and intriguing.Acting wise, Jim Carrey is in Truman Show mode, or probably the most serious he has ever been in a film, this is probably the most serious role he has ever done, and he shines in his role as Joel Barish and is completely into his character. Kate Winslet also performs excellently well, and her character development in both the dream sequence and the present sequence is done extremely well. The supporting cast did not get that much screen time but they are performed their roles well, Kirsten Durst and Mark Ruffalo are good but the scenes between them in the apartment are kind of drawn out and I could have done without a few of them, but Elijah Wood is really great in his role as Patrick and scenes between him and Clementine are also interesting.The ending is also great because it leaves it completely up to the viewer to interpret what will happen next and the events that led up to the ending were also very interesting and intriguing. The soundtrack is also great and suits most of the scenes it is being played in, the opening and closing credits song is also fantastic and also wonderfully portrays the relationship between Clementine and Joel. The ice setting was not something i was fond of before watching the film but it is handled extremely well here, with the scene of Clementine and Joel laying on ice being one of the most touching and memorable moments of this film.Overall, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is a touching, in-depth and intriguing love story with such great plot, settings, performances and memorable moments that I can watch this film over and over again and never get bored. However you may need to watch this film multiple times to fully understand it's plot and the message it is trying to convey and appreciate it for what it truly is.Rating: 9.5/10"
aplusr,"Jan 23, 2019",10/10,"Its a splendid movie all round. For me, it is indeed one of the finest work of cinema art. It tickles your curiosity throughout and doesn't falter at the end. In a nutshell, if you don't find this movie as being a masterpiece, you're either stupid or dead inside, there is no other way to put it.
""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd"""
BA_Harrison,"May 17, 2017",5/10,"When Joel (Jim Carrey) discovers that his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has undergone a procedure to erase him from her memory, he decides to have the same treatment to rid himself of all thoughts of her. As he is having his brain tinkered with by some seemingly incompetent techy geeks, Joel realises that he has made a mistake and wants to keep his memories meaning that he must somehow hide inside his head.I'm pretty sure I enjoyed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind back when it first hit DVD. Not so, this time around. While I didn't exactly hate the film on my second long-overdue viewing, I now feel that it is vastly overrated: it's reasonably fun for a while, but the scenes that occur inside Joel's mind as he is having his memories erased go on for way too long, comprising the majority of the movie.Round and round we go, watching the same thing over and over again, with a few cleverly integrated special effects to make us go 'Ooooo'. Carrey and Winslet put in passable central performances, Carrey reining in the gurning as best he can, and Winslet looking and acting suitably quirky, but when all is said and done, there simply isn't enough of a plot to drive a 108-minute movie.5.5/10, not rounded up to 6 for that terrible scene where Carrey plays his four-year-old self."
MoviesMaster01,"Feb 5, 2022",8/10,"Pretty nice and decent movie. I really liked it in 2nd act. Feeling of losing memories you spent with someone you wanted to live for your whole life is an extremely scary concept. You get reminded of things you never said, you never felt but when you hear it, it feels you've dived right into the state of De ja vu. I really liked how the movie explored the psychological side of Joel and how heartbreaking it was when he was trying his best to don't look clamen from her memories. It was pretty sad and shattering. This movie might not be everyone's cup of tea but it sends a beautiful message in the end that you should watch the movie to understand."
mahdypersonal,"Nov 19, 2022",8/10,"Eternal Sunshine loses its way on occasion, particularly in the sequences where Joel reverts first to childhood and then to infancy in his effort to find a place in his memory where he can hide Clementine. In both scenes the figure we are watching onscreen ceases to be Joel Barrish and becomes immediately recognizable as Jim Carrey. The mugging and mewling Carrey brings to these scenes might be funny in another context, but they relate to nothing else in the tone or content of the film. One almost wonders whether there's a rider in Carrey's contract insisting, ""Star retains the right to do something rubbery with his face at least once during project."" It's a pity, too, because otherwise Carrey is refreshingly un-Carrey here, responding passively to the acute hyperactivity with which Winslet imbues Clementine.And while it's impossible not to think of Eternal Sunshine as Kaufman's film (fair or not), Gondry directs it with wisdom and nuance. Movies often portray memories and dream states with a hyperreal vividness, made up of garish colors (or stark black and white), absurdist landscapes, and, yes, sometimes even dwarves. Gondry takes the opposite course, filming Eternal Sunshine with an aggressive lack of style, or at least of stylization. Scenes are dimly lit and hazily filmed (cinematographer Ellen Kuras filled many of the sets with smoke before shooting), lending the movie an almost documentary feel. Even when special effects are called for--when a fence must evaporate or a character disappear from a fading memory--Gondry underplays them as much as possible. The result is a cinematic vagueness that makes the film less aesthetic yet more persuasive. This is how dreams really look: like reality, only less so.But Eternal Sunshine's elusiveness is not limited to its look. One of the least remarked upon achievements of the film may also be its most cunning: just how unmemorable Joel and Clementine's relationship is. Its general contours are clear enough--Clementine always pushing and testing, Joel always retreating and nursing grievances--but its details are easily forgotten. The dialogue is unremarkable (Clementine explains how when she was little she thought she was ugly, and Joel tells her she's pretty), and the conflicts somewhat generic (she thinks she's ready to be a mother, he doesn't). ""There's something weirdly ephemeral about Eternal Sunshine,"" Brian Johnson of Maclean's wrote following the film's theatrical release. ""Just two days after seeing it, my own memory of the film has almost completely evaporated, like a dream. Which is not to say that the movie is forgettable--I'm still clinging to the strange but familiar emotions it raised, and am curious to see it again to see just where they came from."" Johnson was on to something: The film provokes an intense, yet oddly unspecific emotional response. Like a memory that has been not-quite-successfully erased. Or maybe a smell."
xxxxxdarkmoon,"Jul 11, 2022",8/10,"What is the message of the movie:WAIT WAIT WAIT!First I want to apologize for the length of my review.I couldn't do it with fewer words. Explaining the difference between true love and a falling-in-love sensation is not doable in fewer words, not for me at least. Please read it anyway, you won't regret it and hopefully, help in the future when you are in a similar situation, like in a break-up that hurts you. The pain of a broken heart is one of the most painful things a person can go through. No group of people has a higher suicide rate than people in pain because they have been rejected by a person they love.I start with a question:
Did you know, that every relationship goes through different stages? Sure you do.First I must explain that there are in general 2 different main groups of love:1.) Ego-based love.2.) True love.EGO BASED LOVE:
it is always happening when we are freshly falling in love, like head over heels. It is always the 1st stage of a love relationship, and it will end sooner or later. Always. Though we don't know much about our new partner, we feel extremely attracted to them and want them to feel the same for you. We want to impress them as much as possible. We go to the hair stylist, try to achieve weight loss to look better, try making the funniest jokes, and whatnot. You want to impress them with anything you do. Do you fight for your partner's interests? Well of course you do. But the most important thing is, that your partner knows YOU are doing it. Because it is only about impressing your partner about you. In the end, you are doing it for yourself, for your ego, that your new partner is impressed with you, what a cool person you are..... This is completely different when it comes to real love:REAL LOVE:
it doesn't matter if they know that it was you who did it. The only thing that matters is that your loved one will receive help, an advantage, or something that benefits them. Very similar to what loving parents would do for their children. Loving parents would do anything that helps or benefits their children, and it doesn't matter if their children know it has been you. (as a father or mother). Exactly that is true love. On a non-relationship level of course.NOW HERE IS THE THING: When the big ego-based ""falling in love"" sensation ends, we suddenly don't feel the need to impress our partner anymore, because trust has built up. Besides, we suddenly realize the imperfections of our partner. It's needless to say, NO partner is perfect. Everyone has imperfections. It is just the ""blindness"" that has gone. But that doesn't mean that it's over. It's just the 1st stage that ended. The stupid stage of ego-based love that feels so good. Now you have the choice to stay together, or not. You have the choice of accepting the imperfections of your partner or not. And if you hold on to your partner, if you both accept the imperfections of your partner, chances increase massively, that you have found TRUE LOVE. Trust me on that one. It also depends on their ego. If it is an ego-focused person, chances for a break-up are bigger. In that case, it never has been love in the first place. It was some ego thing.This is exactly what this movie is about in its core message. Before the breakup, it was the 1st stage, ego-based, and it came to an end. But when they reunited, it was because they both recognized there was more. That they don't have to impress each other and still feel great when spending time together. That the imperfections are not strong enough
to break the bond between them. That there was more than that ego-love thing, from the beginning. True love is the greatest gift one can get from life. This is the core message of the Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind movie. A movie that touched the souls of so many people - for a reason, because it gets to the core and it is NOT a science fiction movie besides these strange machines deleting memories. Are science fiction. But the love thing is as truthful as it gets. It is not true that love can't be explained. Love can be explained to a certain agree. And you just learned something about it. Thank you for reading."
mamo_speed,"Jan 13, 2019",8/10,My favorite jim carry movie ever and a well made movie
jpgranera,"Jan 4, 2019",6/10,"I did not have a good time with this one. Watched it with my family and we all thought at the middle of the movie everything had to be a joke, but sadly it wasn't. I am surprised at how great critiques this movie has had. I watched it only because I saw it in a Top.40 movie list on the internet, aside from that, I never heard about this movie in my life. Not everything was that bad, I will say, it had short good moments but in general, the movie intended to innovate a way of telling a story, but it was just an experiment, nothing more. I don't quite recommend it, only if you want to experience it by yourself."
stimpy_tr,"Nov 30, 2020",6/10,"Everything other than Jim Carrey's performance is nonsense in this movie. I got sick of repetetive scenes and overacting including Kate Winslet. What is that neverending partying scene in Joel's bedroom? Are we supposed to laugh at that? What about Joel's interaction with the memories of Clementine and taking advices from them? Nonsense over nonsense... The movie could have been much better, had the screenwriter made a better research about the unconscious mind and the director introduced less agitation. All of 6 points are for Jim Carrey."
thelastjedi_good,"Jul 21, 2017",9/10,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind understands what relationships are like in a way that is uncanny. While masquerading as a happy movie about a loving couple, Eternal Sunshine shows the darkest and most harmful parts of relationships.The film is about Joel (Jim Carrey) a guy in his thirties who has dated a quirky woman named Clementine (Kate Winslet). Their relationship is difficult and marred with unhappiness. When Clementine stops talking to him inexplicably, he finds that she has had an operation that erased all her memories of their relationship. Joel is distraught and gets the same operation. The film then becomes a narrative within Joel's head as he relives all of his memories with Clementine as they are erased.The narrative is experimental, completely fragmented with some scenes that are bizarre within Joel's head. This leads to some unique, memorable, and just plain weird moments. This uniqueness gives the film its identity and the lack of linearity in the dreams both leaves the viewer the fun job of piecing together a narrative on his own while also giving the filmmakers license to contrast memories directly against each other, even when they are from different time periods.Our characters are very quirky and not entirely likable at first. Joel is reserved and awkward, a combination that initially turned me off to his character. Clementine, on the other hand, is very expressive and emotional- perhaps to a fault. it isn't until you see the best moments these people shared together when you begin to like them. Both the characters and the film itself feel very genuine when we see their happy moments.What is the ultimate point of Eternal Sunshine? (SPOILERS follow) What does it have to say? In the end, Joel and Clementine stay together. They know all of the horrible things that they will do to each other and they stay together anyway. The audience is happy that they stay together.Why do they stay together? An optimist would say that it is because they are meant to be. It seems unlikely that two people would happen to fall in love again if they had no memory of their history. Maybe some people are just soulmates and they will always find each other. In fact, the same phenomenon occurs to the Kirsten Dunst character when her memories are erased- she finds the same man and falls in love with him again.The more pessimistic answer, and in my opinion the real answer to the question is that people tend to ignore obvious red flags when starting a relationship they are excited about. The two leads share one day together, having fun as ""strangers"" before they are given documents telling them about their past relationship. Joel and Clementine have hard physical evidence that proves they are incompatible. Their original relationship became unhappy and borderline abusive, and the two of them have documents that detail exactly how much they come to hate each other. This is the biggest red flag that a person could ever receive: hard proof that the relationship won't work. Still, the two of them are excited about their budding relationship and their first day together, so they ignore this giant red flag and date anyway. They don't look at the documents and see how they can better their relationship, they just blindly get back together, doomed to fall into the same traps they did before, because it is the easy choice and the exciting choice. The movie ends on an optimistic note, but a viewer has to wonder about the dark implications of this and the ignorance that it takes for them to stay together.When Joel is going through the memories of his relationship, there is an overwhelming feeling both in him and in the audience that he should stay with Clementine because the two of them have such good memories together. In essence: it doesn't matter that the relationship has grown into something horrible and toxic, they should stay together because they used to be happy and they need to hold on to those happy memories. Any person who has seen a relationship through knows this feeling as the end nears. This movie makes the audience actively cheer for that outcome. It's not until you think back on the movie's message that you realize how delusional this idea is.The main points the film is making are common justifications that people have to stay in broken relationships: it's easy to ignore red flags, no matter how large, and it's hard to break up with someone you have good memories with. It's eerie how easy it is for the audience to cheer for these irrational justifications, and it tells us something about ourselves.In all, Eternal Sunshine is a romantic film that really knows what long-term relationships and toxic relationships are like. The more engaged viewer will leave with an interesting message about the darkness of relationships. I strongly recommend the movie as a study of the irrational behavior people have when in relationships."
tuzlukek,"Jan 26, 2019",10/10,"Raising questions about love, past and traumas, challenging the very foundation of a person's behaving and a person's way of life as such. Film could be finished at 91th minute of it's running time , but than it extends for another 10 minutes for what I thought
was ""the producer's ending"". But to mu surprise, it was worth it. Fantastic script, good directing, outstanding editing and brilliant performances. What else? Not for entertaining purposes."
adamonIMDb,"Jan 6, 2017",6/10,"This is an interesting film, a romance like nothing I've seen before. I think the idea is a great one and it was executed well enough, though not wholly to my taste. If the filmmakers had adopted a more simplistic approach, this would probably be one of my favourites in this genre.The problem isn't so much the story but the style adopted. I wasn't too keen on the construction, the way the film is constantly toing and froing between scenes, scenarios and characters. I almost felt like the filmmakers were trying to be too smart and would have preferred it if the story would have been told simply.That said, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are highly convincing as couple Joel and Clementine. Their relationship and chemistry on screen is probably why this film is popular with so many people."
balajeffhardy,"Oct 16, 2019",10/10,"This movie shows how painful it will be ,when you try to forget the love of your life ,and whatever happens love always finds la a way to get back to you.."
w00f,"Mar 10, 2004",6/10,"Having just returned from an advanced screening of this movie, it's hard to find exactly what I want to say about it without giving too much away.Jim Carrey turns in a solid performance, and for the most part one of his most understated and nuanced.  In all, the acting is solid by all concerned. As far as that goes, this is a very good film.On the other hand, I found myself thoroughly confused at various points. There are elements of the story from the beginning that don't make sense at the end.  Again, I don't want to give it all away before people have had a chance to see the movie for themselves, but I will say that the ending is rather contrived and, in the context of the movie, doesn't make particular sense.The plot of the movie is quite good, but the storytelling is choppy and the way it's been edited together gets rather harsh at times.  This probably won't make much sense right now, but I thought that there were points at which the movie was so obviously trying to be obscure that it put me off quite a bit.The cinematography got downright annoying at times.  The whole movie is shot on handheld cameras (I think digital as well), and at times the image bounces around so much that it's hard on the eyes.Perhaps the best way to sum this movie up is simply to say that it had good ideas, but the execution isn't great.  It did get a bit sappy at times, too. Elijah Wood's performance is perhaps the weakest of the film; he comes across as rather whiny and cold.  His character doesn't have a lot of screen time, though, so it's not a major impediment.It's not terrible, but it's not terrific either.  The whole core of the film really comes down to the old platitude that one has to take the good with the bad in relationships and that one shouldn't be willing to give up the good memories of one's life in order to escape from the bad ones.  Perhaps this is part of why the sentimentality is so overblown at times.The film will benefit from the presence of Jim Carrey and might do fairly well at the box office.  That being said, it's no ""Truman Show."""
elliotjeory,"Mar 27, 2022",4/10,It didn't age well. The cast look ridiculous. The story was boring and could of been done better. Not to mention it's complete nonsense. For serious Jim Carey watch The Truman Show.

SharonKuo,"Feb 24, 2014",10/10,"Love hurts for most of people because we don't really learn how to love and how to live with someone you love. We got our role model for love from our parents but lots of time they didn't even know how to live with someone they love either. And then, we learned how to love and how to communicate the one you love through so many heartbreaks. This movie gives us what we all secretly wish for- a chance to forget something that's hurt us in the past. I have heard a lot of people talking about this movie. I remember I saw once when I was so little. I couldn't understand the whole movie at all at that time, but last year, I watched it again. It totally amazed me, not only the story, but also the scene."
jungleehyun,"Feb 9, 2020",10/10,"I often find myself knowingly going back to toxic relationships regardless of it being romantic, etc. After a high, a low may follow and it absolutely crushes me to know that I will go back to them regardless. Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like to leave them completely. But that only lasts a second and I know that I am going back to them because when it is good, it is extremely good I want nothing else until the day I die than to spend time with them.This reminds me of the girl I used to like; the day I met her ex, I realised I did not even deserve to like this girl anymore. I saw how much they were missing each other, yet not making a single move because they knew they would be toxic to each other. Knowing that, I knew that I could never make this girl happy the way her ex did. Good times are good, it's just that it sucks they are followed by some awful times at times.Love is such a weird feeling, though I doubt that I have ever experienced it. All I know for now is that once you earn it, it should not be easy for it to be taken away from you. It would also be very lucky of me to have experienced it in my life time."
ivans536,"Feb 8, 2019",9/10,"I watched this movie multiple times, and really enjoyed it when I was younger, however the rating dipped a bit as I got older.Now there is some imagery in here that is very symbolic, the script is very witty and well crafted, the story innovative & the visual effects amazing.
The story is incredibly original and even has interesting twists.However what is lacking is the deepening of the protagonist's relationship.
I feel that in order to buy into the premise this movie needs to prove that their love is soecial enough to start again even after deleting each other, but somehow it just doesn't work well enough. Now maybe the idea is that they are just flawed people in a flawed relationship, but I feel that more time could have been given to this by for instance cutting out the moronic scene of Jim Carrey as a baby, that seems only as a vehicle for him to use his non-verbal comedy chops.An 8.5"
educallejero,"Sep 17, 2019",10/10,"After the first 15 minutes I thought I was watching a lesser versión of ""Before Sunset"", with sci-fi touches.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
This is a masterpiece on every facet of cinema.
The story is complex, with an original structure and super natural and deep dialogue.
The acting from the protagonists was amazing (hard to believe this was the same actress that made Titanic, and even Jim Carrey disappears on the role, except for two or three moments). Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Dunst weren't that great (in smaller roles) and the rest of the cast was serviceable/good.
The score couldn't possibly be better (well, maybe it could've been, but it was still great).
This is an extremely romantic movie with sci fi touches that makes easier to get into the philosophical and existential themes they approach, all without losing anything in the entertainment department"
The_big-dipper,"Apr 24, 2020",10/10,"Everything about this movie is incredible. Michel Gondry, who I usually don't like does a brilliant job directing. Kate Winslet gives her career best performance and Jim Carrey gives one of the great performances of the 21st century. So crazy that he didn't get an Oscar nomination! Also one of the greatest scripts ever, I'm convinced Charlie Kauffman is a madman but he is undoubtedly a genius."
bryangary65,"Feb 21, 2024",6/10,"Quirky film yes,odd, also yes but not for meI think with Jim Carrey it's like marmite you either love him or not, and it's the latter when I watch his filmsThe movie started off brightly enough but soon derailed and got a bit confusing and my own mind started losing interest. Good supporting cast with Kirsten Dunst a particular favouriteDisappointment considering its high rating of 8+ as was expecting a lot more, though not a surprise the film attracted Oscar wins as it's the sort of art they like to see on a big screen in recent yearsIn summary was not attracted to the two main characters."

tedg,"Apr 10, 2004",N/A,"What an exciting time to be alive! We can actually go to our corner theater and participate in the invention of a new medium. Fundamental elements of the vocabulary are still being explored and invented.I knew that I was witnessing something important halfway through. Superficially this is another Kaufman exercise in self-reference. Those are always interesting, he knows how to fold the story with methods of telling the story plus a third story about those methods. There's some of that here, but it is shoehorned into the 'big idea' that wasn't his in the first place. So although you have one of the most powerful folding actors ever (Winslet), the real advance here is in another area.Hundreds of films have tried to portray dreams and visions, folding them into 'reality.' Some are blunt ('What Dreams may Come'), others frantic ('Pi') and puzzling('Mulholland Dr'). No one has yet managed the arbitrary slipperiness of visions as successfully as Tarkovsky in 'Nostalgia.'Part of Tarkovsky's genius is in making ordinary objects exotic by bending the context. But he does his work in large chunks.Any filmmaker, the real ones, make an early decision about the materials of their creation, just as an architect does. In architecture, you can choose to make the structure out of bricks. These things actually hold the building up. Then you have to design the brick. What's the right size?Tarkovsky used large bricks, so we could read them from a distance. Rodriguez , for instance, in his second act of 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico,' used what looks like small bricks, but they are just for show: they carry no narrative.What we have here are small bricks, small minivignettes that come at blinding speed from all tenses and actually hold up the narrative. You need an intelligent actor to help carry this off and in this case we have the redoubtable Kate who is one of our most intelligent masters of this sort of architectural material. After all, her very first film ('heavenly Creatures') was about this same matter: how small a fantasy or memory could be and still create reality.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
AfricanBro,"Apr 4, 2022",7/10,"I watched this a long while ago and never wrote down what I thought about it, but it holds a special place in my heart. The type of movies that make you believe in love. It's so unique and original, and even though I rated it I think it's one were you either love it or hate it. Imagine a world where you could forget all your traumatic experiences; someone shatters your heart into pieces so you just erase them completely, move past it. You never have to heal. But what if the person who hurt you also happens to be the love of your life? Joel erases Clementine from his memory and realizes this, he fights his fading memories because even though he was hurt, he still loved. It's a beautiful because it's a representation of human emotion on screen, and that's complex, it makes the movie more than just about love. The dialogues also amazing, as his memories fade he decides to stop fighting it and instead enjoy all the mements with her he's reliving for the last time and I feel like there's something to be learned from that because he had something special, it hurt him in the end but that's no reason to forget about it. It was once beautiful so just because it ended in pain doesn't mean it's not worth remembering. It's as emotionally draining as it is beautiful. It's a movie where sci-fi meets romance, giving stunning visuals a beatiful story to tell(It might not seem so stunning to look at now considering things like cgi are more advanced now but in 2004). And because we live through Joel's memories and the timelines nonlinear it all feels like a personal dream, and to exhibit something so chimerical and personal onto the screen is stunning art to me."
salmineo,"Oct 14, 2004",1/10,"I don't care if this movie is on more than 50 critics top 10 lists. It was, in my eyes, a horrible film. One of the worst films I sat through in a long time. I actually felt I wasted 2 hours of my life I can never get back. I also know 9 other people who rented this mess and hated it just as much. The video clerk called this movie a ""stinker."" I know I am in the minority here. But I stand by what I say. I would never watch this movie again. Jim Carrey cannot do drama. In fact, he is not much of an actor. He's just a modern day Jerry Lewis. When he attempts to express anguish, he puts on his typical rubber face expressions. I know I am gonna get lots of flack for saying this. But I hated hated hated this movie. It was weird in a bad way, totally stupid, and a waste of Kirsten Dunsts talents. For those of you who praise this film, more power to you. I'll never ever watch it again. I thought it made the ""Friday the 13th"" films look like Oscar winners. Seriously. Alful, pointless, and enternally boring. I give it a huge thumbs down and a zero rating."
TOMNEL,"Nov 22, 2009",10/10,"Jim Carrey is known for his roles in screwball comedies, and it seemed as there was no way to get an actual clean break off from his normal goofy persona. It may have seemed that way, but this movie proves otherwise. What we have here is a mature film, with some funny moments, but instead of a stupid Carrey performance, we have a deep and moving performance, in a very strange and original, but nonetheless deep and moving picture.Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) leads a fairly mundane and boring life until he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet). He and Clementine click right away despite their contrasting personalities. One day when visiting her and work, Joel finds she has no recollection of him, and discovers she had her memory erased of him from a clinic. Because of his depression over her, Joel decides to do the same thing. During the procedure, Joel realizes he wants to remember her, and must take her to places in his memory where she can't be erased. Meanwhile, during the operation at Joel's apartment, we meet the doctors working on him. Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) are the somewhat incompetent doctors, as they care about their own needs more than that of Joel, and Stan ends up inviting over Mary (Kirstin Dunst), the receptionist at their place of work. Joel jumps from memory to memory causing confusion by the younger doctors and a call to older Doctor Howard (Tom WIlkinsin) and secrets about the people performing the operations come out.For a movie that takes place mainly inside one guy's mind, this manages to be a very emotional film. Joel is a really likable character, and his progression throughout the film and in his memories is quite interesting. Kate Winslet plays a good opposite to Joel's introverted ways, and her performance as Clementine, and as merely a memory concocted by Joel is also excellent. All the performances are great, and what makes them great, is despite some stupidity even in the doctors, they're still portrayed as people, not just morons. They are just as deep as our protagonist, and have just as much baggage on the brain.The direction is phenomenal. The jump from memory to memory and the erasing of the memories gives us a huge feel of what Joel has gone through and takes us through all kind of interesting settings. In contrast, we have Joel's apartment where our co-plot is going on with the doctors, and the apartment in so many scenes gives a feeling of intimacy with the surroundings. The memories Joel has are so well done and even eerie at times, but also very sad and lonely when need be. Director Michael Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman really molded some brilliant contrasts, and some lovely and thought provoking characters.Overall, this really is destined to be a classic, or if not that a highly regarded cult classic. It's an emotional, beautiful movie, with Jim Carrey showing that he deserves more roles in dramas after pulling this off. Nothing's ever been quite like this, and chances are, nothing will again.My rating: **** out of ****. 108 mins. R for language and sexuality."
blanche-2,"Aug 15, 2007",10/10,"It's hard not to fall in love with a film that begins with a voice-over saying (paraphrasing): ""Valentine's Day was created by card companies to make everybody feel like crap."" Right afterward, I watched Jim Carrey force himself through a half-closed train door, and I said, this is for me.Carrey, in a complete turnabout, plays Joel, a lonely man who falls in love with a lively, quirky nut named Clementine. The romance progresses, fights ensue, and one day, Joel walks into the bookstore where Clementine works, and she's making out with someone else and doesn't seem to even recognize him.Then their friends receive a note saying that Clementine has erased Joel from her memory, and they shouldn't mention him again. Joel heads to the clinic himself to find out what's going on.There he finds programmers who can draw a map of your memories about an individual on the brain and get rid of them. Joel decides to have the procedure.Part of the way through it, he tries desperately to stop it, to find some way to remember Clementine, bringing her into places and memories where she never was.The programmers (Elijah Wood, Thomas Ryan) don't notice anything odd about the procedure because they're busy drinking, dancing in their underwear and doing drugs with Mary (Kirsten Dunst) a secretary at the clinic.When they finally notice a problem, the head man (Howard Wilkinson) is called in. Slowly Clementine disappears from Joel's brain as he desperately tries to hold onto her.A spectacular story with a few twists along the way, and spectacular acting, particularly from Carrey, Winslet and Dunst, make this a real winner.Carrey is a sympathetic, warm character, Winslet is adorable and charming, and Dunst is a complete natural, be she stoned in her underwear, trying to talk sense under the influence, or crying. They are wonderful as is the rest of the cast.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is about the death of memory but not of emotion and the cry of the heart that goes on - sometimes without knowing why. A beautiful, beautiful film."
littlerascal-11989,"Oct 5, 2018",8/10,This film will reduce you to raw emotion. Carey and Winslet did a fantastic job that really plucks those emotional strings. Definitely a Carey classic that in my view revitalized his career Back then

blaineyuan0204,"Jan 15, 2018",7/10,"I've long been hearing people raving about how refreshing The Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind is, and how unjustifiable it is that Jim Carrey didn't receive a Oscar nom for his outstanding performance in it, so I was really excited to check this one out (after all these years!!!). And I have to say the hype is well deserved.
The Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind centers around an estranged couple's decisions to erase their respective memories of each other. this movie has a very unique/surreal approach of arranging sequences, with the bulk of the plot unraveling in a dreamlike state, which is a considerable divergence away from Jim Carrey's previous slapstick efforts. We see him reflecting on his memories of Clementine (Kate Winslet) in an almost melancholy undertone. He proved yet again, after his stellar performance in The Truman Show, his acting talents, as well as The Academy's biases against comedians.
That being said, this movie is far from perfection. For me the subplot of Kristen Dunst and Tom Wilkinson could be further explored, as it accords with the theme of this movie. And the placement of the opening sequence may be a tad questionable. But who cares? at the end of the day The Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind is without a doubt one of Jim Carrey's finest works and will be remembered and revered for years to come."
Dethcharm,"Mar 31, 2022",N/A,"ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is an exceptionally well-made, romantic science fiction film. It will definitely resonate with anyone who has ever gone through a breakup, especially if you're the one who was ""left behind"" while your former partner simply ""moved on"".Kate Winslet plays Clementine, who has had enough of her relationship with Joel (Jim Carrey). For his part, Joel hasn't gotten over her, and when he inadvertently discovers that Clementine has somehow had him erased from her mind, he decides to do the same.Enter Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), and his seemingly ragtag team of tech experts (Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Kiersten Dunst). These are the wizards whom Joel seeks out to remedy his situation by wiping out his painful memories of Clementine.What could possibly go wrong?As said before, this film will appeal greatly to anyone who has ever experienced the end of a relationship before they were ready to ""let it go"". Those not familiar with this sort of suffering will still enjoy it, but may not be hit quite as hard or as deeply.Carrey really gets this across, bringing a sadness to his character that is genuine and palpable. Anyone who still sees him as primarily a slapstick ""clown"" needs to see him here.Ms. Winslet's Clementine is carefree and vivacious. There's a whimsical yet poignant quality to her performance. Both of these actors pour themselves into their roles.Highly recommended for those who need a good laugh or cry, sometimes simultaneously..."
alexx668,"Jul 27, 2005",6/10,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", one of the most overrated films of recent years, is mostly a parable about how humans should accept their destiny instead of escaping it. But while the general meaning is fairly simple, the script is complex, using a non-linear narrative (a la ""Lost Highway"" or ""Memento""), confusing past and present, dream and reality, the lives of the main characters etc.The direction further enhances this elaborate scheme: there are cut-ups, special effects, imaginative montage techniques, but also a post-modern overlapping between genres. Thus the film is sometimes a lyrical love-story, at other times a comedy, realist drama, Freudian analysis and so on. Unfortunately, a big part of the movie resorts to Hollywood melodrama (complete with generic sentimental soundtrack music). It feels as if the director is mostly interested in showing off his skills rather than presenting an interesting and organic movie. Vastly inferior to the similar ""L'Appartement"" (1996, Gilles Mimouni)."
cathj-53991,"Jun 3, 2021",3/10,"92% on Rotten Tomatoes. Wow! What for? I thought that any movie has to be entertaining first, but this one is just boring. And so many people loved this film! Why? May be they enjoyed how Frodo Baggins and Mark Ruffalo were humiliating Jim Carrey?"
nzswanny,"Sep 23, 2017",10/10,"When people ask other people what Jim Carrey's best acting performance is, people usually light up and say, ""The Truman Show!"" Although I would say that he gave a good performance in The Truman Show, in my opinion I think that he gives a much better performance in this movie, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Although this opinion definitely isn't everyone's, I think that this is Jim Carrey's best performance because he goes out of his daily routine as an actor that works in comedy and stand-up and usually he acts in his films with the same personality which is undeniably a humorous one. But with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Jim Carrey goes out of his routine and gives us a subtle, grief-causing performance that is entirely the opposite of his usual personality and yet it still feels natural as if it were his usual personality. In this film I saw a lot of serious acting talent shine through him that I had never seen him show before and if you're like me and enjoy seeing actors be in a different, unusual personality that they usually aren't in I think you'll enjoy this too.Another reason why you may enjoy this movie is because of it's dream-like surrealism. There are so many psychological tricks in this film that make the film feel like an incoherent dream such as the disjointed editing, the unnatural situations and the emotionally dreamy soundtrack. Also, you know how when you dream you can be doing something in one room and the next minute be in a completely different building? I thought I was the only one, but here Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind captures this fully in a movie and letting us transform into frankly a hallucinatory drug trip. If you're like me and enjoy the weirdness of dreaming I think you'll enjoy this too.What are you waiting for? An emotional, devastating, honest movie that feels like a dream with wonderful performances from the entire cast and interesting, realistic characters as a sidedish. If this sounds good to you, then please, do give this a watch!"
shonalijha,"Feb 22, 2025",10/10,"""I wish I stayed too, now I wish I stayed, I wish I'd done a lot of things"".The characterisation in this film is so intricate, particularly Clementine. From her acknowledgment of her flaws, we as the audience are introduced to a completely different perspective to their relationship, we're plunged to reevaluate the image Joel has created of her- much like we have to do in real life. This also places significance of memory as the backbone to one's perspective. Based on this, my favourite memory is by far when Joel and Clementine are entirely under the covers, momentarily hidden away in a compartment of Joel's memory where Clementine, usually so sporadic, is openly vulnerable and Joel can unapologetically love her in his own mind.Their last conversation too, Clementine telling Joel she knows she'll get bored and feel trapped is such an impactful conversation. They both come to realisations, Clementine admitting to and arguably embracing her destructive, nomadic personality and concluding they won't work; Joel on the other hand accepting this, and yet also subconsciously realising he'll always come back to Clementine.In every ""erasing"" the two characters always find and seek one another. Ultimately, they need one another to come to the realisations and changes they do, and so erasing one another for the bliss of erasing the bad, in turn, erases components of themselves they need."
Ivanovivanivan,"Jan 19, 2022",9/10,"This is a real mind bender (no pun intended). I really liked the premise because it opens up great implications for us all. How far are we from the manipulation of specific brain centers? We can already do a fair amount. The reality is that even if one can erase memories, we can't curtail the ""butterfly effect ""of our actions. We have trod the earth and the small or large changes we inspire, create something new. Now project love and romance, and, given time, let it percolate. You have Jim Carry and Kate Winslet being ""forced"" back together because despite their minds, they never left. And if the memories were inconsequential in the larger picture, their remnants will continue to influence. Pretty thought provoking. We are more than our memories--we are part of the entire picture."
pulpficat,"Oct 16, 2023",9/10,"Let's face it; romantic comedies have a formula, a tried-and-tested recipe involving meet-cutes, love triangles, and grand gestures, right? Well, say goodbye to clichés, because Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind throws that recipe book out the window. It's a cinematic voyage through the labyrinthine corridors of love, memory, and the enigmatic human heart. Michel Gondry's masterpiece is like a whimsical snow globe that, once shaken, unleashes a flurry of emotions and musings on the nature of love.The film unravels the bittersweet tale of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), two individuals who, in the aftermath of a failed romance, decide to undergo an experimental procedure to erase each other from their memories. As the procedure unfolds, the narrative takes us on a dreamlike odyssey, not bound by the constraints of time or logic.Eternal Sunshine possesses a unique quirkiness that is both endearing and profound, lying in the exploration of human vulnerability and the complex tapestry of memories. As the memories of Joel and Clementine are systematically erased, the audience is treated to a non-linear journey through their relationship, where past, present, and future blend into a kaleidoscope of emotions.Kate Winslet's Clementine is a fiery masterpiece, vibrant and mercurial, embodying the essence of love's unpredictability. Jim Carrey, famed for his comedic prowess, delivers a poignant and subdued performance as Joel, illustrating the multifaceted nature of love in its melancholic splendor. The supporting cast, including Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Kirsten Dunst, contribute layers of complexity to the narrative. Each character, a technician in the memory-erasing process, is a study in their own emotional complexities and fragilities.Michel Gondry's direction is a masterclass in storytelling, infusing the film with whimsical visuals that blur the lines between dreams and reality. In Gondry's world, memory is a tangible place, both a treasure trove and a minefield. The visual effects, often appearing low-tech yet astonishingly effective, mirror the intricacies of Joel's and Clementine's minds. The fragmented recollections are woven together with delicate subtlety, and Jon Brion's hauntingly melodic score elevates the emotional journey.Eternal Sunshine is not a straightforward romance; it's a poetically surreal exploration of the human soul that will leave you pondering the beauty of the scars that love leaves behind. It dares to ask whether love is worth the inevitable heartache and whether the beauty of a moment is tarnished when that moment is lost. The film tugs at your heartstrings with its portrayal of the beautiful mess that is love of two flawed individuals who are inexplicably drawn to each other, despite the baggage they carry. As we unravel their relationship in reverse order, we realize that love isn't about the destination; it's about the journey. It's about embracing the moments, both beautiful and painful, that make it worthwhile. Even in love's imperfections, there exists an ethereal beauty that transcends space and time. The film's central message, that love persists even in the face of forgetfulness, is as bittersweet as it gets. Even if we could erase the pain, we'd also erase the joy, and sometimes it's better to love and lose than never to have loved at all."
dtb,"Mar 19, 2004",7/10,"Yes, I realize that any review that isn't an unabashed love letter to this film is likely to get a ""No"" vote! :-) I hope you'll note that although I didn't love this film, I didn't hate it, either. Charlie Kaufman's script deserved its Oscar, the acting is top-notch, the emotions rang true, and the DVD's got loads of goodies -- it was the direction that I felt dragged the film down.If Philip K. Dick had written a romantic comedy, the result might have turned out like ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. In this seriocomic SF love story, Jim Carrey proves again that he's not just another mugging face, and Charlie Kaufman proves that he's the master of surreal dramedy. Director Michel Gondry, however, proves that Spike Jonze is really the most suitable director for Kaufman's particular brand of daffiness.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are stunningly believable as dysfunctional couple Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. Clem initially seems like a sexy free spirit with a roguish streak, but as their romance continues, Joel sees the dark side of Clem's impulsive nature: on her bad days, hard-drinking Clem is needy and temperamental. What's worse, she sees Joel's relentlessly low-key, emotionally walled-off nature as a rebuke to her recklessness. Mutual misery ensues.No wonder Clem finally consults Lacuna, a Manhattan company run by avuncular Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) that erases your memories of a bad relationship. Lacuna even sends postcards to clients' intimates telling them not to mention the erased ex again, as Joel discovers when he sees one in their mutual friend's mail. Heartbroken, he also opts for the Lacuna treatment. While the erasing process takes him through memories of life with Clem, we discover that, when Joel wasn't being passive and Clem wasn't drunkenly cracking up Joel's car at 3 AM, the couple also enjoyed many good times together. Joel's reluctant to forget these happy moments, and that's where the film gets phantasmagorical as reality, fantasy, and memory collide. Within the maze of Joel's mind, he and Clem (who's been panicking and feeling like she's ""disappearing"" as she's slowly wiped from Joel's brain, despite having already forgotten him) team up and try to hide in all kinds of memories she has no part of. The funniest of these is the scene in Joel's childhood home, as a shrunken-to-child-size Joel faces Clem as his mom's miniskirt-clad, go-go-booted neighbor.The details of Lacuna's workings are ...SUNSHINE's most consistently witty, entertaining bits. Lacuna looks like a typical busy doctor's office, with receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst at her most winsome and dimply) constantly scheduling appointments: ""Valentine's Day is our busiest time."" Funny yet poignant details abound, such as the teary-eyed client loaded down with her dog's belongings, a crucial part of wiping away memories of a loved one. The actual procedure is performed by young computer techies Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood, leaving Frodo Baggins far behind) who erase the subjects' memories in their homes while they sleep. The techs act like a bunch of fun-loving but irresponsible babysitters, swilling the unsuspecting Joel's whiskey, smoking pot and having sex (with Mary, not each other :-) as he sleeps. But Patrick goes beyond mischievousness into unethicality: usually a strikeout with women, he's begun dating Clementine, having fallen in love with her while erasing her Joel memories. Patrick tries to take the expressway to her heart by wooing her with her discarded Joel mementos. Of course, he doesn't consider that since Joel's relationship with Clem went sour despite all those nice gifties, history just might repeat itself. I was disappointed that there wasn't a bigger payoff to the Patrick subplot; he just kind of disappears from the film as if *he* were erased. Of course, that may well be the point! :-) Director Gondry, who also directed Kaufman's HUMAN NATURE (2001), spends so much time cross-cutting, juggling the movie's timeline, and inexplicably staging certain scenes in darkness with only a flashlight rendering the characters' faces visible that instead of enhancing the storytelling, it's merely distracting. I kept getting the feeling Gondry didn't trust the story itself to keep moviegoers' attention -- ironic, since he shares story credit with Kaufman and artist Pierre Bismuth. Having said that, when the visuals work, they work wonderfully, like when our hero and heroine dash through Grand Central Station while commuters wink out of existence left and right.Refreshingly, the New York locations aren't the usual hip or glamorous places. Joel and Clementine live in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and their apartments look just like homes of college students or artistic types trying to inject Soho style into suburbia. The filmmakers also make splendid use of the stark beauty of Montauk beaches in winter.For Carrey fans seeking slapstick and belly laughs, ...SUNSHINE... may seem to drag on eternally; its humor is more in the rueful TRUMAN SHOW vein, shot through with Kaufman's trademark surrealism. If you want a love story that will make you laugh knowingly and think about the way people approach relationships, ...SUNSHINE... is worth seeing. Hopefully it will convince you that counseling is a better approach to your relationship problems than science-fiction gadgetry!"
Harlekwin_UK,"May 31, 2024",8/10,"When a furiously strong love comes to an end how do you cope? Try to forget? What if you could forget the whole relationship? What if you change your mind?This is another one of those movies that start with a SciFi premise but simply aren't SciFi, in this case it's a Romantic Drama. Also yet another Academy Award winning movie (Original Screenplay) with a cast that play out the story magnificently.When Clementine's relationship with Joel ends she decides to have all memory of it removed, a process invented by the Lacuna company. When Joel finds this out he decides that the memories are too painful for him also and elects to have the procedure.Whilst going through the process however, Joel changes his mind (realising he still loves Clementine) and starts fighting the deletions. As his subconscious moves from memory to memory trying to protect what it knows of Clementine the story of their relationship unfolds. Things get more complicated by real worlds events around him though and Lacuna's future also hangs in the balance.Wonderfully written and presented, the only odd note is that any company, like Lacuna, with such a powerful product would be run in such a shoddy fashion. Perhaps it's explained in there somewhere. Kate Winslet and Jim Carey are ably supported by their co-stars.Things to look out for: Clementine's hair, the destruction of each memory, baby Joel under the table, DVD includes and advert for Lacuna."
vstoneco,"Jan 5, 2006",1/10,"This isn't really a movie review. It's more a reaction. After watching this movie, I feel like running around screaming, ""You're missing the point! You're missing the point!"" Perhaps I'm missing the point. The film gets kudos for being clever and quirky and well-filmed, in a Being John Malkovich kind of way. Clever, quirky, but there's a spiritual barrenness underlying it. Shouldn't art be more than clever? Shouldn't it reach deeper? Limericks are clever  we don't call them art. The underlying message in Eternal Sunshine isn't all that original. I am tired of seeing movies about love and loneliness. How many movies have we all seen whose basic point is that if you just reach out, take a chance, find romance, this will fend off the ravening wolves of loneliness at the door of modern life?In a culture that desperately needs a sense of community and connection, peddling movies and songs about romance is like giving cotton candy to a starving person.It isn't what we need! Finding romance is not the way to fend off loneliness and alienation, a change in the culture is. If we all felt connected to something that mattered, to other living things, to communities we cared about, romances wouldn't be the be-all and end-all of meaningful existence, it would be just one among many of life's joys."
xnicofingerx,"Jul 31, 2025",8/10,"Blue, the colour of melancholy, and then 'Everybody's got to learn sometime', a musical low point. Despite the mood-lifting cast, the fare served here is obviously rather heavy. But then there's a playful flirtation, a little weird, but charming. Not simple characters, but sweet, the two of them. When yin and yang meet, a circle is created, but with fire and water, one of the elements is lost. So the stage was set for an emotional punch in the gut. And it hits home, probably for most of the audience. The great love, the great love that one does not always appreciate in the dullness of everyday life, the great love that one carelessly loses, the great love that, out of frustration at that loss, is sacrilegiously pushed out of one's mind, along with the wonder that it once was. Technically speaking, all our emotions are in the brain, not the 'heart', which is the basis for the surreal background of the story, that of computer-based memory erasure. However, such manipulation has never been a good idea, and besides, where there is a spark, there is still hope, and that is what our existence is based on. To ensure that Charlie Kaufmann's book does not become just one of many, director Michel Gondry relies on creative technical means, drawing on the origins of cinema, the vivid projection of a fantasy. A non-chronological narrative, practical effects for the intermediate world between memory and paralysis, mood-related lighting and colouring, hand-held camera, sudden cuts, weird sound effects and a generally melancholic soundtrack. It often seems improvised, but according to a well-executed script, it effectively puts us in the mood of the actors.The two main actors in their rather unexpected roles deserve special mention. Well, Kate Winslet is somehow Rose again, charming, only a little more hyperactive. Jim Carrey shows once again that there is more to him than just being the class clown. The chemistry is wonderful, the love story touching. A soulmate relationship that does not mean unrealistic perfection kitsch. Where happiness awaits, you also know what pain means; where there is good, there is also bad. The moment when Joel and Clementine finally talk about something like this is probably when they really find each other."
Reza_Rehan,"Jun 2, 2025",10/10,"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is the epitome of Romance. This is the kind of movie where the more you're in love the more you understand the depth of the story. Its unexplainable. Iam speechless. Never have I ever been more astound watching the credits roll in a romance movie. It goes from a Joel in the worst state of mind and how much he's sick of everything including Clementine. When he wanted to wipe out his memory of Clementine he got to relive it again. The beauty of being in love. He wanted to call it off. Everything looks so perfect. It started off as confusing at first seeing him warp his head through what is going on. But that's just how he feels. He's lost. Its like being so attached to someone who's better off without you. And even if you know that it's gonna end badly, you want to do it anyway. In order to feel happiness you must be ready to go through the deepest of sorrows. This movie showed us every single way imaginable of how love can end up. Even in the sub-story of Mary And Dr. Howard. We catch a glimpse of what it feels like to be in love with a person you know you will never get with. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet did an astonishing performance in this movie. Truly seeing a Comedian to play such a role of complexity is magnificent. This is by far the best Romance Movie I have ever seen in my life. A type of movie everyone should watch in their life."

chiragrathod09,"Nov 20, 2025",10/10,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is not merely a romantic comedy or a science-fiction film; it's a profoundly original, disorienting, and ultimately hopeful meditation on love, loss, and the nature of memory. Directed by Michel Gondry and written by the visionary Charlie Kaufman (who won an Oscar for the script), the film asks a devastating question: If you could erase the pain of a failed relationship, would you?The bulk of the film takes place inside Joel's mind as the erasure crew works, creating a mesmerizing, surreal landscape where memories literally disintegrate around him. Gondry's inventive, often low-fi practical effects perfectly visualize this internal chaos-characters fade, locations warp, and Joel and Clementine become fugitives racing through their shared past, desperately trying to save the good memories before they vanish forever.Kaufman's non-linear, fragmented narrative perfectly mirrors the way memory actually works-jumps in time, shifts in perspective, and the blurring of the past and present.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet deliver some of the best work of their careers, capturing the messy, unromantic reality of a turbulent but deeply felt connection.The movie suggests that even the most painful memories are essential to who we are, shaping our identity and providing context for the beautiful moments. To erase the pain is to erase the love, and the lessons learned. It's a labyrinth of the human psyche, where erasing the past isn't a cure but a curse. Twenty years on, it remains a masterclass in blending whimsy with raw ache, proving that love's imperfections are what make it unforgettable.It is a film that is complex, cerebral, and often sad, yet its ultimate message-that people can choose to love each other even knowing their flaws and the inevitable pain-is one of cinema's most powerful affirmations of human connection. It's a true masterpiece that lingers in your mind long after the final, bittersweet ""Okay."""
TauranSilken,"Mar 6, 2005",7/10,"Kate Winslett is always good. And I love seeing Carrey play ""normally"" for a change. But as with Memento, I find going through the memories boring, could have done without half as much of that. Too bad somehow, the movie could have been so much more compact with some added cutting. I suppose it was meant to be confusing, and it is so at times. For really good acting, I give it a seven, otherwise I would have given a six or a five.. I like many slow-paced movies - like Fargo or Smoke, but with this movie my hand started to move by itself toward the fast forward button of the DVD remote, and that's not good =) I thought long and hard about this, and maybe the worst thing about this movie is, that there simply aren't any deep truths, philosophies or revelations etc. to keep you occupied.. definitely NOT worth the Oscars."
dataconflossmoor,"Dec 5, 2007",10/10,"Focus is an independent production company which dwells on the non-conventional ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is, to say the least, a non-conventional film!! This movie, which is a purveyor of many Molotov Mardi Gras emotions, authenticates an equivocal potpourri of ideas that are indicative of numerous independent production company films!! This movie also bears a striking similarity to Elia Kazan's intensity to itemize belligerent confrontation!! ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is sort of a counter culture version of the film ""The Arrangement"". Many films that are run of the mill mainstream Hollywood movies immediately hack out a succinct and concise mindset of everyone of the major character's feelings. In ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" to say that Joel's (Jim Carey) feelings were introverted, would be a paramount utterance of understatement!! Joel's relationship with Clementine,( a name we associate with a folklore about loving regrets, also, with a particular type of orange) evokes a vivid presentation which signifies an emotional diligence. The illogical transition to their pursuing ideas and trepidations compound an inexplicably and unnecessary intransigence for both of them!! The ephemeral activities in this film perpetuate a cerebral anguish which becomes the heinous culprit to Joel and Clementine's difficulty to adequately dissect their conceptions about one another!! I could see this film 100 times and still not capture every intricate detail to it!! Set in a New York City neighborhood, it depicts a realism about imperfection being ubiquitous in all of the character's lives!! This movie had a foreign flare to it as well!! In fact, I initially thought this film took place in Montreal... After viewing a couple of scenes, I, of course, blew that contention out the window!! My first clue was when I saw the New York License plates on every single one of the cars!! Jim Carey is FABULOUS!! in this movie!! Originally known as the box office star of copious high profit zany comedies, his enormous popularity garnered an auspicious association with the light hearted!! In ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", his role was very serious and complex!! Think about it though, if someone were to handwrite a silly comedy, and then, all of a sudden, he was required to change this screenplay to a serious drama, it would be a case of simply needing to borrow someone's erasure for no more than 18 seconds!! Kate Winslet is superb in this film as well!! I did not even know she was British!! When the acting in a movie is so excellent, it almost appears as though the writers and directors of the film are getting paid only about a buck above minimum wage!! ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a remarkable movie, and is considered to be one of the best films ever made according to this website!! The step by step thought process to this film puts this movie in a category all by itself!! Marvelous flick!! Focus Productions always gives way to the unorthodox, perhaps you as a movie viewer should try doing the very same thing once in awhile too!! FIVE STARS!!!! ABSOLUTELY!!"
visualsbyalan,"Mar 23, 2024",6/10,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a mind-bender that dives into the chaotic terrain of love, loss, and memory. Inspired by the Alexander Pope quote, ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!"", the film explores a world where a scientific procedure allows people to erase unwanted memories. Charlie Kaufman's labyrinthine screenplay takes center stage, weaving a complex narrative around Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), a couple with a tumultuous past. The film cleverly abandons a linear structure, opting instead to depict their relationship through fragmented memories. This ""Maze Cinema"" approach can be disorienting, but it effectively portrays the confusion and heartbreak that cloud Joel and Clementine as their memories are manipulated.Carrey delivers a nuanced performance, toning down his usual comedic energy to portray a lonely man clinging to fading memories. Winslet matches him perfectly, embodying Clementine's impulsiveness and vulnerability. The supporting cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Kirsten Dunst, adds another layer of intrigue with their quirky portrayals of the employees at Lacuna Inc., the memory-erasing company.While the film's central concept is undeniably fascinating, it's the emotional core that resonates most deeply. Despite the unconventional narrative, ""Eternal Sunshine"" explores universal themes of love, loss, and the human desire for connection. Director Michel Gondry, known for his music video background, brings Kaufman's vision to life with a unique visual style that perfectly complements the film's surreal and dreamlike qualities.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is not for everyone. If you prefer straightforward narratives and easily digestible plots, this film's non-linear structure and offbeat humor might leave you frustrated. However, for those seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant experience, this is a cinematic gem. The film lingers long after the credits roll, prompting reflection on the importance of memories, the complexities of love, and the resilience of the human spirit. It's a wild ride through the labyrinth of the mind, but one that ultimately celebrates the beauty and messiness of human connection.6.575/10."
gsfword,"Mar 21, 2004",1/10,"Despite my desire to enjoy what I hoped would be a unique film, I found it dark and self indulgent.  The superb acting couldn't overcome a script that is centered on a failed relationship that never makes sense to the viewer or to the lovers.  In the end you feel like this is ""Adaptation II"" - yet another film about a brooding self-centered guy who can't really relate to anyone beyond his own fantasy life.  The dramatic device ultimately used in the film of having the main character fight to preserve his memory fails because it comes across as a clever but unsatisfying rendition of psychotherapy.  The subplot is banal and adolescent.  In many ways this entire film comes across as something that was done back in the 60's, but which now falls flat."
octagon88,"Dec 27, 2005",10/10,"I will admit, when it first came out last year it did not appeal a whole lot to me, but after all this talk of how great it is, I am letting everyone know that I regret not seeing this one in the theaters!It was a beautiful film, very different, very realistic, very crazy, and trippy, however, although it is strange, it is one of those movies that you can understand what's going on without it throwing you off to badly, leaving you saying ""WTF?!?!"" No, this is a fantastic movie with excellent character structure which I recommend to anyone, anyone who loves movies. However tis is not for the low intelligent people out there who wish to only see blood and explosions, while those kinds of things are entertaining, they aren't much without a story, and this was a movie with a lot of wonderful story, and it wasn't quite 2 hours!Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is living Proof that the best stories are not found in big over priced Hollywood popcorn movies, but with people who put time, effort, and love into writing a script, and producing a movie that will both entertain, shock, and leave the viewer speechless with how thought provoking and moving the film truly is. Eternal Sunshine is definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2004 if not THE BEST one. Great Job Jim, Kate, Kaufman and Gondry!"
MattyMugan,"Jul 19, 2006",10/10,"Sunshine was one of those cinema films, credited as a story about love i got dragged along by the girlfriend. At the time I enjoyed the sci-fi aspect of it. I found the writing and idea to be interesting on a purely inventive level. A very original concept which I found as more of a good story at the time. I appreciated the acting, particularly the way Carrey portrayed his character. People don't always give him the respect that his abilities deserve, they see him as a funny man, but their are films like this and The Truman Show where he manages to capture an emotion which he might not be so related to.I watched the film again on DVD of late, and things that happened to me related to the film, which cast it in a totally different light. I could suddenly understand the idea of removing somebody from your mind, the physical act of it didn't sound like a clever Sci-Fi idea, but something that should be able to be done. In the same way, I also understood the concept of running from the removal. It related to me because I found that I didn't want to forget things, and wanted to forget others.I think this film has several different effects on people. Those with histories in relationships will feel a lot more connected with the film, it speaks to people who still feel the effects of their own relationships. To others, who cant feel this connection, it becomes much more of a typical film, nothing really to relate to, no compelling characters, no huge action or uncomplicated story lines. The viewer can just see it, but not really care. This leaves them thinking less of such a film.I think the only way people can really appreciate this film is to see themselves in it, pick a person who they are like, and understand how they would react in such a situation. I believe that this film is much better when you see your own mind and memories, and begin to feel the story."
gavin6942,"Feb 19, 2008",9/10,"Joel Barrish has a love-hate relationship with his girlfriend Clementine. But after things fall apart, the relationship goes from strained to bizarre: she has visited Lacuna, a service that deletes or erases people from your memory. Everything that was Joel in her mind is now gone. Joel, not wanting to be heartbroken alone, follows suit and undergoes the same treatment -- only to discover halfway through that even the worst memories come with good ones and both are important.Not surprisingly, this film is beautiful and sad. Why am I not surprised? Because it comes from Charlie Kaufman, who also brought us ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"". Kaufman has the power to make the strange familiar and is something of a kingmaker in the world of acting -- ""Adaptation"" may well be Nicolas Cage's best work, and this may well be Jim Carrey's. All those who doubted he could play serious roles had been proved otherwise. Kate Winslet also compliments him well and offers a nice departure for those used to her from ""Titanic"".If one wants, they can get into some great existential questions with this film: are bad memories important? Is it wrong to remove them? Are we destined to meet and love certain people or certain types of people? There's some wonder about the morality of removing another person from your memory and the biggest question of whether or not we need those memories to shape us. This film quotes Nietzsche and Alexander Pope -- but not one of Nietzsche's more well-known quotations: that which doesn't kill us only serves to make us stronger. Isn't that what pain is? A catalyst for growth? The supporting cast is excellent. Mark Ruffalo has a breakout performance (though not quite on par with ""Zodiac"") and Kirsten Dunst is pretty lovable as Mary (though still not as lovable as Maggie Gyllenhaal). Elijah Wood also appears, which is good or bad depending on your love for Elijah Wood, I imagine.You will have to ignore certain continuity questions (if you see someone every day for two years, what becomes of those two years with them removed) but that really isn't the point of the film anyhow. It's about fate and chance (see also ""No Country For Old Men""). And it's amazing, easily deserving the accolades hoisted upon it. If you're inexperienced, make this a top priority in your life."
aravind6010,"Jan 27, 2014",10/10,"Hands down one my most favorite movies of all time, starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet is a brilliantly directed movie from Michel Gondry.Plot :A girl highly impulsive and the guy a calm and soft spoken gets in love and the love is gone bad. A new service opens up where they promise to erase part of your memory, the girl gets her lover erased from her memory and starts a new life. When the guy gets to know this he gets frustrated and gets an appointment to do the same. The plot starts to travel in reverse direction from the last memory of the couple getting erased. The guy gets to see the memory getting erased from him and after a point of time thinks he has taken a bad decision and tries to stop the process by trying to hide his girlfriends memory in old memories where the doctors cant reach, but it goes in vain and all the memories of them gets erased from the guys head without a spot. Finally what happens to this couple is what the whole movie is about.A very complex story telling technique, you need to watch it twice to truly appreciate the effort and ingeniousness of the script. I always felt Jim is a very underrated actor and my notion got stronger after watching this movie. Memento was my top rated movie till I saw this movie, a definite #1.Review : A truly unique script and a genius story telling, a ""MUST"" watch for all!.. 9.5/10! :)"
ellieforpeace,"Jul 13, 2009",10/10,"I belong to the same group as Woody Allen and Nietzsche. I wouldn't want to belong to a club that would have me in it. This attitude pervades my life. It includes clubs, relationships, and movies among other things probably. For example, I hesitated to give this, my most favorite movie in the world four stars. I thought, since it is an enjoyable movie, one I enjoyed, I can't give it four stars. I wanted to give it three and a half. But I just watched it for maybe the twentieth time, and I absolutely had to give it four stars.Four stars does not mean it is perfect. This film is not perfect. I can't describe many movies as perfect. But there are many flawless parts of this movie.Let me start over with the recapitulation. This movie starts with Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) writing abysmally about Valentine's Day on a snowy beach after he skips work for no reason and falling in love with a woman he has just seen. Oddly, she introduces herself to him, Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), and though she is immediately strange and exotic and Joel is introverted and boring, they hit it off immediately. For the first twenty minutes. And then there's a snapback. You're ripped from the plot and you realize that you haven't seen the opening credits yet, and you watch them as Joel sobs in his car.And the movie starts in on this crazy plot with purposeful amnesia, love, and all sorts of other human things.This is a Charlie Kaufman movie, and if you don't know what that means, then you don't know indie movies (but that's okay. Just make sure you get to know Kaufman). He is a crazy, insane genius screenwriter (see Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche, New York) and his mind is a wonderland. Michel Gondry is a French genius, a director who doesn't seem to direct, but lives within the movie (see The Science of Sleep, Be Kind, Rewind). Both of them are perfect in the film, and it is great that they were the two to make the commentary on the DVD.Kate Winslet gives the performance of her life in this movie. She disappears. Clementine takes over. There is no trace of Kate Winslet, or Rose from Titanic, or Marianne from Sense and Sensibility. She is fantastic. I cannot praise her performance in this movie enough. Jim Carrey also disappears. You forget Ace Ventura and every movie he ever made. This is his best performance ever. The other ""stars"" of the movie in its subplot are Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo. They are all amazing, with perhaps the exception of Mark Ruffalo, who is simply fitting. But even he fit wonderfully. (Side note: This movie features my favorite actor and actress, Tom Wilkinson and Kate Winslet)This movie is affecting. That's it. Affecting. It's modern. It takes place NOW, although it could take place anytime. But it's odd for great movies to take place NOW. So often they are placed in another place or time, but this movie is here and now, in your face, so relevant, and it has the feel that it could never be irrelevant. The effects are sparse and perfect when the come, subtle, and helpful, but not a focus at all, the way they are supposed to be.The music is quite good an fits well. It is quirky and playful in a movie that is often just that.More than anything, this movie is a good friend. After seeing this for the twentieth time or so, I can quote nearly every line. I can laugh. I couldn't laugh at it the first time. Now it is hilarious, a real situational comedy. Yet, it is more touching each time. It's like a fine wine that only gets better with age.I would recommend this movie to anyone. Children, old people. Young people in new relationships, old people who have been married fifty years. Everyone."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Sep 8, 2009",10/10,"Wow... this had me spellbound. Deep, intimate piece. If one wasn't already convinced that Jim Carrey is an actor, not just a comedian, one would be so after taking this in. Winslet does incredible, as well(and both are playing against type), as does everyone else that I can think of(Dunst also impressed me). You have to pay attention during this, and a second viewing may help, but it's not so abstract and loose that it's difficult to understand. This is the third work of Charlie Kaufman's that I've seen(the other two are Being John Malkovich and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), and by far my favorite. Anyone who has ever loved can relate to this. I can't promise it'll be pleasant, in fact, it's possible that it won't, but this is absolutely absorbing. This is mature, smart and does not try to distance itself, or its audience, from the subject matter. I haven't seen any other work by Gondry, but he directs this magnificently. Masterful visuals, and somehow apparently with little to no CGI. The editing and camera-work are excellent. Story-telling and characterization are of such high quality that I'm not sure words can do them justice. The ambiguity of the final moments is perfect. All of the special effects are amazing. The movie pulls you in, it is thoroughly engaging throughout. I'm not sure any viewer can avoid being affected by this. You may not recognize every scene as something from your own life, but the feelings, the impressions... they're universal. I don't remember when I've last been this into a big screen experience. Anyone who can watch films that are personal, and emotionally powerful should consider this. There is some strong language and sexual content, as well as drug references and the like. The DVD holds two featurettes, one of which I will review on its own page here on the site, interesting deleted scenes, a fake commercial, a music video, and an informative commentary track with the Michel and writer Charlie Kaufman, all of them also well worth your time. I recommend this to anyone who is or has been in a relationship, and who don't need their cinematic experiences spoon-fed. 10/10"
ReturnedVideotapes,"Nov 9, 2013",N/A,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has a very philosophical and ethical question to ask us: Would you have an operation to forget someone completely? The movie manages to stick to not just the plot point of Joel and Clementine but also, the scientists who work in the business and what they think about what they are doing. Watching this movie reminded me of the dreams that I've had and how you wish they would go away or wish they were real but you can't wake up. Which is what Joel was stuck in. The whole movie is given a quite modern aesthetic which could be a hint at how close this procedure is from actually existing."
rsd22,"Dec 31, 2004",7/10,"The theme, the story, the acting, have been covered thoroughly by other reviewers here, and I won't cover these topics yet again. On the whole I agree with the majority that all of these were excellent.The film would have been excellent in all respects were it not for two factors that I haven't seen discussed much, if at all, elsewhere. One of these is artistic and the other a combination of artistic and technical. First, the sequences of Joel's ""internal"" mental scenes as Clementine is being erased from his memory are too long - two or three or even six or seven surreal and poignant fading memories would have been plenty - by the time I'd seen what seemed like a dozen or more the point(s) had been made, I began to check my watch, waiting for the _story_ to move onward, Second, the excessive hand-held camera work is annoying. I realize that this cinematographic style is a current fad, but it was really quite distracting particularly in the first 45 minutes or so. While it never reached the nausea level, the continual camera motion kept me from getting ""into"" the film for quite a while. The overall feel of the film is clearly intended to be surreal, rather than real, so, with due respect to the director's expertise, I would maintain that the realism implied by the hand-held camera actually interfered with the intended artistic impression.I started out expecting a 9 based on reviews; halfway through the film this had dropped to a 5 or so; by the end I was back up to an 8, which would have been 9 except for the two factors I've just mentioned."
jameszxcvbn,"Jan 28, 2022",10/10,"I stumbled upon this film early 2010s when I was still a high school student and remember thinking ""What a beautifully shot film"", without understanding much about the emotional message between the everlasting love story of two heartbroken lovers. This film is one of those films that I was come back to watch every once in a while to remind myself that there is still a relatable drama. Watching it in 2022 certainly has a different vibe to the film as I have aged leading up to the protagonist's age to understand the emotional turmoil which have been portrayed by the characters in the film. The film is certainly beautiful to convey the message of the everlasting of true love, even when the memories are wiped clean. It does this so well from the gloom acting in the start of the film (signifying the ending of their love story) to happiness in the ending (the very first moment of their encounter). Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet portrays their beautiful love story of when they first met to the devastation of a relationship. The director has focused on even the littlest things like the beeping sound effect, to when the books are becoming blank in the library scene to illustrate Jim's memories being erased. The soundtrack is very fitting and the one played at the very last memory of Jim and Kate in the beach house is very heartwrecking. I believe this is one of those film that gets better with age because the storyline is very relatable to many people who will be experiencing some sort of true love and heartbreak throughout their life. Hoping to come back to watching this film again and again to remind myself that there was a film that made me both happy and cry."
Keemer44,"Mar 31, 2019",9/10,Not many films can combine serious dramatic elements and science fiction so seamlessly. The film will constantly having you guessing and will have you wondering where it is all leading. Not many films can manage to confuse you and fascinate you in such a way that keeps you thoroughly entertained. Carrey gives a career-best performance here and only proves his overall talent as an actor.
Higher_HIghs,"Jun 9, 2023",10/10,"This movie is just too personal for me to even attempt to review it in the classical way. The main female character just happens to be very similar to that one girl I once fell in love with during my university years. Like in the movie, our relationship didn't last long, and the ending was far from happy (at least for me). I've watched over 700 movies and only few of them have resonated with me the way this one has. It is crazy how a piece of art created on the other side of the planet and a decade ago can be so relatable (another such movie for me is ""Before Sunrise"", btw). Even if I set aside the personal experience, I think I would still rate the movie 9/10. It is truly a masterpiece in every way and form."
hyprsleepy,"Nov 23, 2010",N/A,"I've never had a movie break me down and make my heart ache the way this one did when I first watched it (in the theater no less). This could be an unfair comparison though since I had a recent break-up right before watching this movie.Jim Carrey played Joel as a real person and did so in such a believable way that I immediately became impressed with his range when I had been lukewarm about his other attempts at drama.I've known couples like Joel and Clementine and at some scenes I've been them. Of my friends who didn't like the movie they were always people with no experience or very little. I think what makes people love this movie is realizing how realistic it is and respecting that.One of the things that makes Eternal Sunshine stand out is its depth. The movie has little hints for you to find and uncover if you watch it multiple times. If you pay close attention you can see that Joel and Clementine have probably erased each other more than once as have other couples. It makes sense that if your memories are gone but who you are as a person is the same that you'd find the same people attractive and have the same desires and of course the same problems and issues. And so one of the main points of the story is a reminder that, ""Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it"". Therefore, the only way to grow as a person and progress is to keep your memories, no matter how much it hurts. It is part of growing and moving on. It is part of progress."
=G=,"Oct 21, 2004",6/10,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a sloppy mess of a movie which dumps sci-fi, romance, camp comedy, and mediocre drama into a Mulligan stew seasoned with intellectual grunge. The film spends most of its run time flashing to and fro between a romantically involved couple's happy days and a sort of lame white out job of their memories of each other. The upside to this flick is its solid cast and remarkable public and critical approval. The downside is it's an ill focused, pathos drenched mess with peripheral nonsense which detracts from the core theme making the ""buy-in"" difficult. Reminiscent of Kaufman's ""Being John Malkovich"" in its lunacy, this film proves once again that creativity is not necessarily a good thing. For Kaufman fans only. (C+)"
dawn_santamaria,"Sep 4, 2023",10/10,"If there's anything more to be said about this movie, it's that it's beyond anything any human can experience in a relationship. It's moving in the most intimate way imaginable. I found myself watching, thinking and feeling more interested about my own experiences in connection and with intimacy. (Not my norm). Sometimes movies hit a 'note', but eventually leave you hanging and waiting for something that felt real. This wasn't one of those disappointing moments. It left me both crying and relieved that there really is a chance that people can connect and commit beyond what's just verbally communicated."
rokkomanguitar,"Dec 28, 2004",7/10,"The fundamental problem with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is that, unlike the other films made from Charlie Kaufman's original screenplays - Adaptation, Being John Malkovich - there's really basically only one idea at work here. The acting is excellent (probably the best work that Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have ever done, and kudos to the great English character actor Tom Wilkinson), the digital effects are great, and the elliptical plot is quite emotionally moving for something so clever, but once you know what's going on (and i'm not going to ruin it by saying what it is) then all you can do is sit back and wait for the Halloweenish funfair ride to finish. The great thing about seeing Being John Malkovich for the first time was the sheer mind-blowing inventiveness of the story, which left you constantly wondering what the hell was going to happen next; and likewise for Adaptation, which was just as original but had even more layers upon layers and circles within circles that Kaufman's laser beam of a brain always managed to refer back to the various disparate threads of the plot(s) without letting the whole thing dissolve into a self-canceling tangled mess. Even though the ideas and the intellect on display in the writing of these films are dazzling in their brilliance they still manage to move your heart as well as your brain, and while Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind will also make you laugh out loud at certain scenes and (possibly) cry in others, it's my opinion that maybe if Spike Jonze - who directed Adaptation and Malkovich - had directed this one as well then he would have pushed Kaufman creatively a bit more, because by halfway through the movie you pretty much know what's going to happen for the rest of it. I did really enjoy it but i'm looking forward even more to the next Charlie Kaufman/Spike Jonze collaboration which is currently in production."
votarus4,"Nov 21, 2004",1/10,"(Spoiled...) Like the rest of Kaufman's self-absorbed hallucinations, Eternal Sunshine fails to jump the ""who cares"" hurdle. What an overwrought mess of a movie. As far as that mind-surgery-memory-deleting helmet goes, why in tarnation was Jim Carrey's character--a self-described uninteresting bore--so very talented at resisting the program? No mental giant, he would have succumbed immediately. End of movie. But no! We replay this deja vu game of meeting forgotten lovers into infinity, while every character gets thrown into stylistic outer space: Comedy for some, tragedy for others, sex farce when Mr. Kaufman runs out of ideas. Actually, apart from Sunshine's tangled structure, there are no ideas. Not once are we given useful, relevant information about anyone who inhabits the film. Carrey and Winslet's megawatt dual-presence is wasted inside of a situation that resembles a hamster cage, not a story. Only Tom Wilkinson, as the memory-deleting helmet inventor, seems to grasp the danger of what's happening. Kaufman, however, surrounds him with a gang of assistants who are giggling morons. What a sad, confused, irrelevant film. I was reminded more than once of the forgotten French mind-game films of the sixties. Marienbad, anyone?"

This is the type of quality that movies today are missing."
samantavillegasm,"Jul 8, 2021",10/10,"Why keep trying if you know that you are going to suffer?. Why try a relationship when you know it will always end in the same way?. Why?Because At least you lived the good and bad things, the life is like that, with highs and downs. Here, you have the opportunity to forget. It's fantastic in a certain way, because you have the chance to experience the emotions to the fullest. Because at least you tried. It's better to live it than not."
CrazyIvanFilms,"Mar 2, 2004",10/10,"I got into a screening late last night of this movie, and was pure and simple blown away by what I saw. It's unbelieveable.After a brief prologue, it simply throws you into the movie headfirst. It took me about twenty minutes to get my bearings, to realize what was going on, but the execution of the core idea behind the movie (what if we could erase the memory of someone who hurt us?), is probably the most original storytelling method I've seen in a long while. The movie smashes everything you think you know to expect, everything you know about filmmaking, and just takes you for a ride through one man's consciousness, and his love for a woman. Only Kaufman and Gondry know where you're going, and as the movie works backwards through Carrey's memories it also works forwards through the process of his memory being erased. I simply can't describe how complex some of the scenes become, but through a brilliant series of camera tricks, phenomenal writing, and truly amazing acting, we're taken through a story that unfolds both in the real world and in Carrey's mind. I don't want to ruin anything of the plot points, not because there are big revelations or secrets, but because the whole point of the movie is to gain complete understanding of two people who very soon aren't going to even remember that they ever knew one another, and who do not realize just how much they love each other.I will not see a better movie this year."
nickkinghorn,"Aug 12, 2017",10/10,"This is probably my favourite movie of all time. It speaks to me about love in the same way that Catcher in the Rye spoke to me about the mind. That's all I can say really, that you need to watch this. I would feel that anyone who hasn't seen this is missing out on a piece of art that is truly unique and that most special of things, perfect. Highly recommended."

Running away from memories, hiding places, humiliations and regreats, all manipulated it so easily like taking out a teeth of a mouth using a hammer!I never thought I would find this amazing idea on this movie; I always prefer to watch beside hearing empty and destructive commentaries. But in this case it was a surprise, no doubt, A Blast! It blowed my mind. I'm glad to had had contact with the art you all presented. The actors, iconic and graceful play roles they developed, CONGRATS.To finish, the theme song: 'everybody's got to learn sometime'. HAha, lets us be direct and say that after many, many years listening and enjoying it, yesterday I got to look up for this delightful spirit of mind. And today, at the first start of the movie, there it was again the song, coincidence, casually; another pleasure to add on this.At least....THANK YOU"
blawson2010,"Jun 20, 2009",10/10,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind came out of no where and blew my mind. A friend recommended the movie to me and i was skeptical at the premise. Jim Carrey plays Joel who tries to erase the memories of his ex-girlfriend Clementine, played by Kate Winslet, because she erased him from her memory. To me the movie sounded like a silly comedy movie but it is in fact just the opposite. The tone of Eternal Sunshine is rather dark and serious most of the time.I was hooked instantly with Jim Carrey's narration. It was brilliant, i instantly empathized with his character. At first you see Joel depression caused by his break up with Clementine. Later in the movie you see several of Joel and Clementines good and bad memories. Along the course Joel realizes his mistake in erasing Clementine and internally struggles with himself and the people performing the process of removing his memories to keep his memories of Clementine.I felt deep empathy for Joel every memory sad, funny, happy or cruel i felt it as Joel did. Jim Carrey is great in this role. His character is just average Joe, a real easy person to relate to. Winslet creates a unique but still believable character in Clementine. She played the role great. Winslet and Carry's chemistry was great.The shots were great but every so often the distorted memories got a little to crazy, it was a little disturbing and kind of over the top but maybe that was what the director intended.Anyone can like this movie. Those who like craft in their movies and those who just like a good love story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a one of a kind love story with brilliant acting, great editing and sound with a terrific plot."

She was amazing. And don't forgetting ; Kate Winslett and Jim Carrey awesome couple. I must watch that couple other film & films."
ruffinelli_ro,"Apr 4, 2009",10/10,"This movie is extremely rare. But I say that in he good way. It's hard to find a moving film like this one. That is why I think that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is beyond reason. But love is beyond reason as well, and that is what this film is about.Everyone can relate to this movie, because who didn't suffer for love sometime? Love is a complex concept that can't be explained. This movie shows us that like no other could. This is the opposite of all romantic movies. It's very original and very warn as it is sad as well. Both main actors gave excellent performances and their relationship felt authentic like no other relationship on screen.Jim Carrey is a really good actor when it comes to drama. I personally dislike most of his exaggerated comedies but he did a terrific job here and in The Truman Show for example. I think that he should choose more carefully his roles, because there are some roles where he can show he actually has talent. Kate on the other hand is always great.Everyone should take a look on this title since almost everyone can relate to the characters, and although it's a sad movie it is still highly enjoyable."
UMWolvie2442,"Apr 10, 2004",N/A,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind wants to be a bittersweet comedy about erotic loss and memory loss. But it doesn't have the heart or brain. It does have an idea with so many clever compartments that audiences can unload their emotional baggage into it. And that may be enough to make it a critical hit but it will just tank at the box office. Without more depth and inspiration, all this cleverness ultimately goes down the drain. Critics are determined to give this film a high grade because they want to seem clever but the fact is that this film is just a strange mess and nothing deep at all.  Bizarre for bizarre sake because you really don't care about either one of these strange characters."
dcp2727,"Mar 6, 2022",7/10,"I loved this movie because it wasn't a remake, and it's original with a unique story line. Hollywood actually can do something new and take a risk. The problem is, the general public didn't like this movie because Jim Carey is funny in it. No He's brilliant.With all the social issues, especially with society being forced to stay away from each other the last two years, and all the personality disorders caused by living our lives through social media, video game personas, and the lack of actual real people in our lives, this movie show these effects on the two main characters. Neither know how to deal with reality. And for that, this movie can be difficult to endure, but it's lasting redeeming quality it that none of us are too far gone to find real happiness in a relationship with a real person."
usergirl-52970,"Jan 20, 2025",7/10,"This movie made me realise that no matter how painful our memories are (especially with beloved ones), no matter how hard they betrayed us ,even if years have passed and it still hurts , the MEMORIES DESERVE TO LIVE WITH US!It was part of us and just making sure you deleted them from your mind/pretending it's ok- doesn't make any sense...
When he was running after me drunk as hell trying to make it up for me,bumping into trees and people. Then he forced me filming him making drunk statements and promises... He peeled off christmas stickers from my neighbours' doors to stick them to my door, while I was pushing him to go upstairs...
That was fun... that was real....
Cherish the moments and memories. Only they are staying with us forever...."
shiddo,"Jul 18, 2005",1/10,"I cannot emphasize enough how much I hated this film. It was such an interesting concept and the teasers made it look so good that I had to go and see the movie. Unfortunately, as in so many cases, once you have seen the trailer, the film is identical but has been made about two hours longer. The end result is that you already know what is going to happen and are left waiting for the end so that you can leave to talk about how bad it all was...I desperately wanted this film to be good. I hoped it would be as visually dramatic as the previews suggested. I prayed the cast would live up to their reputations and bring it alive. What I found was that no amount of desire was going to save this film. Avoid it at all cost."
nickmesafilms,"May 21, 2012",9/10,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is one of the many masterpieces that proves why we all love film in the first place. Directed by French director Michel Gondry, and written by accomplished filmmaker Charlie Kaufman, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is equal part romantic comedy, psychological thriller, science-fiction, and non-linear narrative. Taking a break from comedy, the film stars Jim Carrey in a more dramatic performance as a man who volunteers to erase every single memory of him and his ex-girlfriend, played by Kate Winslet, whom coincidentally has already done the same thing. The film then takes us on a wonderful and imaginative journey through this one man's mind, as he tries to fight against those who try to steal his memories away, while at the same time, trying to fight for the woman he loves. First-time director Michel Gondry makes his second directorial debut in such a stylish fashion. He perfectly guides the movie with enough clever execution and brilliant uniqueness. Writer Charlie Kaufman has written such a beautiful script that contains witty humor, sharp characters, and true dialouge, which was able to win him a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. Besides Carrey and Winslet, this remarkable cast includes Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson, all bringing such memorable performances on screen. But it's the romantic relationship between Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet that carries the movie, and their adventures into trying to keep their memories together from falling apart. Jim Carrey may be more noticeable in more comedic-driven films, but he still provides great dramatic performances, and this is one of those movies that shows how great an actor he is. But, Kate Winslet is the scene-stealer, as the light-hearted, charismatic girlfriend, with a different choice of hair color in nearly every scene. It doesn't matter what role you give to Kate Winslet, because no matter what, she will still be awesome in the role! This movie also provides some of the beautiful uses of imagery that I have seen in a while. In a usual Charlie Kaufman movie, something weird always has to happen. Accompanied with a memorable soundtrack, beautiful effects, and stylish editing, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is pure filmmaking at it's finest. Although there were some characters that kind of got me annoyed, especially Elijah Wood's character, who seems sort of lost into his given performance. It was just a few moments where the movie loses a bit of it's magic. But, that doesn't hurt the movie's momentum, though! Those flaws are out-shined by how beautiful this movie has been made to look. This is probably one of my favorite movies, and it will definitely be a memorable one, as well. ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", in my review, ""a magical romance, fantastically well-made film""."
marcupetric,"Apr 22, 2020",10/10,"Intelligent, depressing, stunning. The performances were great, especially Kate Winslet. The directing is unique, the writing is excellent and the soundtrack is so brilliant. It is deep movie, I never thought my favourite movie ( current favourite ) could be a romantic one but Charlie Kaufman wrote the perfect script and gave it to the right director so the result was a perfect masterpiece."
Manal_Shal,"Apr 28, 2012",10/10,"Creative. Brilliant. Dreamy. All that and even more. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an extraordinary story of love that goes beyond the limits of time and defies all rules of reality. I loved every second of it and I wouldn't mind watching it over and over again.The movie is about Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), a couple who decide to undergo a memory erasing procedure to forget each other after their relationship goes downhill. Only through this unusual experience do they embark on a journey to discover their true feelings, realizing that forgetting might be the easiest cure for pain but tolerating is definitely the best. The idea is absolutely crazy in an amazing way, and turning it into a moving picture with story, plot, characters and emotional charge must have been a painstaking task. The actual timeline and the dream sequence were craftily interwoven in a way that arises the viewer's curiosity with every passing second, and gradually holds a grip not only of his mind but of his heart as well.Kate Winslet played her character to perfection. She was the sunshine in the movie; her impulsive nature and spontaneous, fun-loving character contributed to the vividness of the story. Jim Carrey gave his lifetime best performance. He was so believable and mature I had to convince myself that this is the same Carrey who plays mainly sappy roles in inane comedies.A million kudoses for Charlie Kaufman's exquisite mind."
foxytom,"Dec 18, 2019",10/10,"""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" isn't a movie, it's an experience. The directing of this film is mind blowing and flawless. The score composed by Jon Brion is Gorgeous and Majestic."
xThatOneKidx,"Sep 2, 2014",10/10,"I don't think anyone could possibly sum this movie up in any word but ""perfect"". It's so perfect that every time I watch it, I rate it one star higher. 10 stars is TRULY an understatement. This movie is one of--if not THE-- best movies I have seen. The characters and story mix together perfectly. The story is about a dull, shy man, Joel Barish, meets and falls in love with an eccentric, fantastically unique girl, Clementine Kruczynski. He learns she erased him from her memory and he does the same to her after learning this. That's all I will say, so I won't spoil anything. Now. I love this girl. I haven't loved a character like this ever since Ramona Flowers (I dunno, I have this thing for girls with unnatural hair colors). ANYWAYS. You will love her too. And you'll love Joel too. And You'll feel a deep sorrow for all the other ""unfortunate souls"", except Patrick. You will want to kill that little rat. I. Hate. That. Guy. But never fear, losers never win... The story and some of the movie may or may not make sense to some viewers (I understood it JUST enough the first time but I'll have to say that the second time watching it was BETTER.) And that sorta reminded me of when I watched Inception. You catch more that way. This is an intelligent, down-to-earth, loving, sad, triumphant, and deeply emotional (even if you rebuff your emotions 100%, you WILL get emotional. Because it's THAT good).And another thing, this isn't a mushy-gushy romance (BONUS!! I'm fist pumping) and I recommend watching this on a date, it will appeal both genders. I don't know what else to say other than I absolutely loved this movie. I don't know whether or not you'll like it but there's gotta be a reason you looked up this review. You're at least a LITTLE interested...."
duderandom,"Jun 12, 2019",10/10,"I loved this movie. The soundtrack, script, acting, story & visuals are perfect. Many people can relate to conflicts Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) have in this movie. This movie should have won an oscar for best picture."
ebertjr,"Nov 24, 2004",N/A,"I've been a Kaufman fan since he was writing for television, and was blown away by Malkovich, like most everyone was.It's truly shocking this movie is 200 places higher rated than either Malkovich or Adaptation among IMDb users (#35 on the top 250, compared to #208 and #235 respectively). I thought this movie was great, though not as inventive as his prior work. Actually, this movie is probably the most conventional movie Kaufman's written besides ""Confessions"".Also, a shout out to those who think Spike Jones directed this, actually Michel Gondry did. Gondry has given us better crafted movie than Spike Jones has with Kaufman's scripts. This movie's full of fun visual gags. Still, I'd love to see what how Kaufman's scripts panned out if he ever paired up with a director that didn't come from the music video generation.As far as performances go, the best aspect of this movie is Kate Winslet. The character that Kaufman gave her is spectacular, and she is awesome as usual. Carrey's character just mopes a lot. In the end, Carrey's performance in this movie is nowhere near his performance in.... ta-da... Cable Guy. Cable Guy is his best and most underrated work. Carrey was born to do goofy faces and over the top characters, why not appreciate the movies where he's at the top of his game? It's not exactly a subtle performance, but since when is subtle always better? Would we ask the Three Stooges to do Hamlet?"
melichac,"Jun 8, 2022",7/10,"The message was clear, do not try to erase the past because you'll simply regret it... we're nothing without our past, the memories, good and bad, are part of us, so let's just live with what we are in the present. Jim Carrey's killed this, he's one of the best really, but the whole cast is amazing, I really loved watching this, 7/10."
thedudeabides-2,"Jul 31, 2014",10/10,"Have you ever been in a relationship that you wish you could completely erase from your memory? Perhaps you fell out of love, perhaps your significant other was unfaithful, or perhaps it simply wasn't meant to be. This is the situation that Joel Barish is faced with in the superb Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.Jim Carrey plays Joel, a shy and unassuming bachelor who meets Clementine, a boisterous, fun loving dynamo who gives his mundane existence a considerable shot in the arm. Unfortunately for Joel, Clementine decides she has had enough and has all memory of him erased. Feeling understandably hurt, Joel decides that he also wants the operation and subsequently arranges a memory wipe of his own.The rest of the movie takes place in Joel's head as he realises he does not want to have the operation and proceeds to try and prevent it. It sounds a little confusing and, to some extent, it is. The high concept can take a little while to get your head around, but once you do, you will uncover an absolute gem of a romance.The fact that the movie takes place inside Joel's head gives director Michel Gondry the opportunity to fill the screen with some unforgettable images, such as a rainstorm in a living room and a fully grown Jim Carrey being bathed in the sink. But the true genius of Eternal Sunshine lies in its structure. The first half of the movie is quite gloomy as it focuses on the end of Joel and Clementine's relationship but, as the team begin to wipe earlier memories, we see what made the couple fall in love in the first place and we are treated to some truly heart warming scenes that never threaten to stray into cheesy territory.With Carrey playing against type as the close mouthed Joel, it falls to Kate Winslet to adopt the typical Carrey role, and she grabs the opportunity with both hands. Winslet's energy permeates every scene she is in and it is easy to see why Joel fell in love with her. A stellar supporting cast does good work with a slightly underwhelming sub-plot, but this is very much Joel and Clementine's movie and, by the time the credits roll, you will instantly want to watch it again if only to make sure you understood what just happened.A mind bending romance with a fantastically clever script and some outstanding imagery. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is one of the best romantic films you will ever see."
Slarkshark,"Dec 31, 2023",7/10,"I get it and all, and it's totally relatable, but this kinds of film isn't normally my thing. I watch a film to be entertained or have an escape, and ones like this can emotionally drain you. It's not a criticism, but everyone has their preferred cup of tea. It could also be that I see too much of myself in Joel and so it makes me uncomfortable.It's very artsy of course, and unique. It has many elements of great filmmaking throughout, particularly during the entire dream sequence.Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet were very good. Carrey has shown time and time again that he is a fantastic dramatic actor with tremendous range.A message that I took from it is that pain is real and pain is life... emotionally speaking."
Nyagtha,"May 30, 2004",1/10,"This is the filmic equivalent of being stuck in a room with someone who thinks they have the most emotionally upsetting life imaginable and is doing everything in their power to persuade you they are truly tortured and pitiable. By the end of both experiences you just want to go home and feel utterly relieved you aren't so arrogant. Or you wish you were able to erase your own memory. (Sorry, a cheap film tie-in metaphor already.)The film itself, like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation suffers from a hole in the centre. Charlie Kauffman seems to think it is clever to take a totally unlikely scenario and then develop it into a ""quirky"" film that is supposed to make little sense. In each instance he fails to grasp that you can't just take a scenario so utterly implausible as to defy any audience to relate or respond to it. Eternal Sunshine is a slightly easier premise to connect with than Being John Malkovich, after all who hasn't wondered what it would be like to erase painful relationships. However Kauffman sems to mistake nonsense for emotional and intellectual depth.Someone told me that you have to watch Eternal Sunshine more than once to 'get it' and I promise that this isn't true. There is nothing you get the second time that you won't have got the first time. It is a fairly straight forward film. The only problem you might have is if you are colour blind and can't work out the time scale of the film from Kate Winslett's hair because you cannot tell that it is changing colour. The director might as well have put subtitles across the bottom of the screen saying ""Two years ago"" ""Present day"" because Gondry's visual 'clues' were about as subtle or 'clue-like' as subtitles.Performance wise, Kate Winslett was her usual self, and Jim Carrey was in Truman show mode. Carrey offers ocassional glimpses of acting talent before they are devoured by his all consuming gurning. Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst offer more respectable performances, however I felt cheated that their entire sub plot was clearly lying on the editing room floor, it felt rushed and unconvincing. Which is a shame because the rest of the film felt over long and over laboured and perhaps a better balance might have saved my cinema ticket which I spent the whole film folding into a variety of shapes.I made a square (Not too difficult) a triangle. I tried to make a swan but it ended up looking like some sort of half eaten fish. After that I was running out of ideas and so i tore it into equal pieces. Then unequal ones. Bored yet? I was. The second time I saw it was even worse. Fortunately I had just seen 3-4x Jugatsu and so had something to concentrate on. Namely trying to understand a film which actually had some sort of emotional depth, some sort of conflicting plot and some semblance of lead performances.I wish people wouldn't think that any film which doesn't have a discernable Beginning - middle - end structure automatically qualifies as intelligent or engaging. And that just because Jim Carrey isn't smacking himself in the face or making chimp noises he is acting. He isn't. He is just biding his time until he can start hitting himself in the face again."
witchley-david,"Mar 22, 2013",10/10,"For some reason or another I had put off watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind until now, and I had no idea what I was missing. I came into the movie with preconceptions that it was a great, if not amazing movie, but I wasn't quite prepared for how moving Eternal Sunshine really was.In my honest opinion this is the best acting I have ever seen out of Jim Carey and even Kate Winslet..the chemistry these two share on the screen is an enjoyment in itself, and they do it with such short and artistically fragmented scenes, and by the middle of the movie I found myself caring about these characters.This is a movie about characters, personalities, love, and loss. The score, supporting actors/actresses, script, directing and especially the lead roles were all above and beyond my expectations..and all in all the movie was simply beautiful."

Shouldn't really say sorry though, it should be all the critics out there that rated this piece of shite, who should be saying sorry to me! What is it all about! Typical American attempt to be arty. A 10 minute film dragged into a hour and 3/4's. There is nothing wrong with the actors, but if you didn't know the ending within the 10 minute prologue to the titles, you would have to be a 5 yr old. Overrated, indulgent, crap! Why is there no story? Yes there is a nice ending. So what? You are so bored of the characters, that you don't even want to try to understand the plot! Why has it been rated so highly? Well one guy liked it and the other sheep followed. Shame on them! If you want a long weekend, watch this movie because it makes 1 3/4 hrs feel like a day.

ronakkotian,"Aug 19, 2020",10/10,"Charlie Kaufman is a very talented screenwriter. Being John Malkovich introduced me to his unique mindset and Adaptation blew me away with its creativity but this film is his best.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind follows Joel, a man who decides to take a medical procedure in order to have his partner Clementine erased from his memory after he finds out she did the same.There have been some great romance films like the Before trilogy and my favourite being Her, but this film just might overtake that film to be the best romantic film ever. Never have I seen a romance as creative and thought-provoking as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Out of all the Kaufman films I've seen this is the deepest. This film raises really important questions regarding love and relationships. Is it worth it to forget previous relationships entirely just because of the bad moments? Would you want to forget all the happy memories just because things got a bit ugly later on? It's these questions and so many more philosophical ideas that Kaufman wants us to think about and it's told in such an endearing fashion.Like Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry is an extremely talented director. To be able to make this film come to life isn't easy and Gondry managed to capture the heartfelt and emotional weight of Kaufman's script beautifully. The way this film is told is very interesting. The film's narrative goes back and forth a lot and has multiple surreal moments which is what makes this romance unlike any other. The characters are extremely well realised and the performances to go along with it are excellent.Eternal Sunshine shows a side of Jim Carrey which we've never been exposed to. We've all known him for his over-the-top and comedic personality but he's never done a role as serious and restrained as Joel Barish. Carrey is absolutely superb here and makes his character as relatable, realistic and human as possible. He should have got a Best Actor nomination at least. This is his best film along with The Truman Show. Kate Winslet has never been better. Her chemistry with Carrey is believable to its core and she deserves her Best Actress nomination. The supporting cast with the likes of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson were also terrific in their roles.Much like Her, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind will have a special place in my heart. This film examines love and relationships in a beautiful and impassioned manner. Charlie Kaufman, without a doubt, deserved to win the Oscar for Best Screenplay with Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth. It's become one of my favourite films and I cannot recommend it enough."
Victor Field,"May 8, 2004",N/A,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is one of those movies that signifies its strangeness by having the opening credits come quite a way into the movie (a la ""Alias""). If nothing else, it lives up to the mindset it promises, although I have to admit I don't love this movie as much as others do; director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman have certainly delivered a clever and touching tale... but it's a bit too much of the former and a bit short on the latter.The movie's biggest problem is that Jim Carrey (cast against type as an introverted nice guy) and Kate Winslet (as a woman who we know is a free spirit - though a troubled one - because she keeps changing her hair colour) don't really seem like they are or ever were a couple, even allowing for opposites attracting. This doesn't ruin the movie's effect, but it does make it seem a bit remote, especially as their relationship is seen almost entirely from his point of view. Remember, there are two sides to every story, and although we do eventually see her side of it, the real added dimension comes from Kirsten Dunst as the receptionist at the company that performs the mind-wiping that triggers the plot. She seems surplus to requirements at first, but it turns out that she's there to do more than dance on a bed in a T-shirt and panties.This is one of the movie's main strengths (not Kirsten Dunst in a T-shirt and panties*); everything proves to have something else going on under the surface, including the structure of the movie itself. The constant unpredictability and the conviction of Carrey's performance as the man on an adventure inside his own mind makes it more than the exercise in cleverness for cleverness's sake that it could have been - the movie never forgets that it's a romance at heart. Jon Brion's wonderful score (which is almost another character in the movie) is another plus; so is Tom Wilkinson as the doctor in charge, and so are Dunst, Winslet, Mark Ruffalo and even Elijah Wood.But though funny, ingenious and even a little touching, in the end ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a feelgood movie for people who like to think they're too smart to be caught at feelgood movies; I like it, certainly, but I can't help wondering if this is one of those movies that viewers of a certain kind SAY you should love, rather than something you can take to your hearts of your own accord. Either way, it deserves a second viewing, and there aren't many Jim Carrey that even merit one.*Which is not to say that's a bad thing, mind."
jotix100,"Apr 19, 2004",8/10,"The best excuse to see the film is the tour de force acting by Jim Carrey. He is paid millions to appear in other films that are supposed to be funny movies, but in reality, Mr. Carrey is at top of his craft when he plays against type, as is the case in this film.That Mr. Carrey is surrounded by some of the best actors working in films today, helps to make this  movie a favorite for a lot of IMDB contributors, judging by the hundreds of comments submitted to this page. Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, are very good and very effective in playing the people in the story.As far as the writing of Charlie Kaufman goes, he is never boring. To every new project Mr. Kaufman brings his own fresh ideas on how to present them on screen. He is very lucky to have found directors that are sensitive to his material and do the job well. To have Michael Gondry bring it all together, it's just happiness.The only point I would argue with Mr. Kaufman is the suppression of those painful memories at the center of the story. It is utopian at best. Would anyone be better off by having a bad love affair, or even a death of a loved one, erased from one's mind permanently? I think not. I'd rather remember the good and the bad."
Hegemont,"Jun 21, 2022",7/10,I really liked how creative the movie is. Storytelling was also very original and interesting. I hated the girl personally and didn't had any feelings towards what happened but all I can say is that this movie contains very creative and original ideas in every way.
Cheesedemon28,"Apr 28, 2004",1/10,"I struggled for a long time to like this movie. I just felt horrible; everyone was enjoying the ""best film of the last ten years"" and I just felt like I was watching cinematic vomit. I felt out of the loop, but, I suppose that's just going to have to be alright, because I refuse to like this piece of bile.First off, the plot revolves around a pretty lame plot device, namely a memory erasing company. Some people really do forget other human beings, even those they've been romantically involved with, so why rely on this lame device? Charlie Kaufman's funny dialogue and interesting plots have gone out the window, making way for some incredibly bad lines, like, ""Do you think I'm ugly?"" I just hate listening to the characters talk; they are some of the most repulsive, unlikeable characters committed to the screen. Kate Winslet's character in particular I wanted to smack. I mean, how is it possible I can stand a four hour movie starring a rapacious gangster (Once Upon a Time in America) and can't not walk out on this under-two hour claptrap starring decent humans? I wouldn't want to spend ten minutes with these bastards, let alone 100 minutes.Kirsten Dunst starts dancing in her underwear. Whoop-de-doo. Mark Ruffalo makes a mistake. Elijah Wood looks like a chihuahua. Jim Carrey looks ill. Kate Winslet spaces out and annoys the hell out of me. No actor in the movie has a breakout performance, not even Jim Carrey, who's just as annoying as he is in his comedic films. Even the score by the otherwise talented Jon Brion sucks! It's like everything that touches this movie instantly turns to sh*t.The direction, courtesy of mediocre music video director Michel Gondry, is not even worth mentioning. It's ridiculous. All of it is done very ambitiously, but most of the time it just feels stupid and over-the-top.In all, I found a predictable, bland, overrated, steaming piece of tripe. Please, never speak of it again in my presence.Overall.5/10"

Overall = Masterpiece.Performances: Jim Carrey is my all-time favorite actor, He's an amazing actor. Kate Winslet is excellent. Tom Wilkinson is very good. Kristen Dunst excels. Wood tries hard to leave a mark, but we are not over your act in 'LOTR' series.'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' is one of my all-time favorite films . I love and adore this film. Don't miss this one even in your busiest movie day."
Galina_movie_fan,"Jan 19, 2005",9/10,"I started to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and after first 15 minutes I realized I could not turn it off and drive to work (which I was supposed to do). I did what Jim Kerry's character Joel did  I called my boss and left her a message that I would be late. I stayed home and I watched the film. I cried, I laughed, I sighed, I felt  I lived through it. There are not so many films that we don't just watch but live through  for me, ESotSM was that. Finally, the Charlie Kaufman's film that I absolutely love. ""Being John Malkovich"" amused me; ""Adaptation"" irritated me  too much of Charlie in there for my taste even if he looked like Nic Cage. Eternal Sunshine is Kaufman's masterpiece about relationships, memories, reality, and about intolerance, impatience, inability to listen to the others, to understand them. How easy it is to insult the one you love the most. How difficult it is to forgive yourself for that. How often we rely on the modern technology to fix our inner problems. How seldom we realize that painful and happy memories go together. You can not get rid of ones and keep the others. It may not be the best romance film ever but it is damn close. It is a tender and poignant Valentine Card that Kaufman sent to all of us  to remind us that the love exists, that relationships can survive, and even if they die, we have the memories of them, and nobody or nothing can take our memories from us. Is it just a coincidence that Kaufman references for the second time to the tragic and great love of Eloisa and Abelard in his works?I applaud to Michel Gondry for his brilliant directing; to the supporting cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet played their best roles ever and I hope to see Carrey more often in the dramatic performances. But in the beginning of everything there was a word  without Kaufman's screenplay the film would not have happened. Thank you, Charlie."
antonvan,"Feb 27, 2007",10/10,"It's approximately 4:30AM as I am writing this. I've just watched Charlie Kaufman's (as well as Michel Gondry's, of course) most absolute masterpiece once again, and I'm literally trembling with emotion. It saddens me that because of my lacking vocabulary there is no way I'd be able to express the state of mind that I'm currently in, but oh man, I have to try.For some people it's Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart's irresistible charm and Ingrid Bergman's divine beauty, for some it's Chocolat with the ever so handsome hippie-like Johnny Depp, but for me the greatest love story ever caught on film and the one film that I will be watching over and over again for as long as I shall live is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. With scenes filled with such emotion and such beauty, like the rain sequence with Joel's childhood coming to play, it triggers something so profound in me, that it's simply impossible to describe in words.I have recently gone through a rough patch with my girlfriend, and through my difficulties I find it even more satisfying to watch the main characters' story evolve (or devolve, actually) with such plausible dialogue and with such honesty in details.The heart and soul of this film really are the actors, mainly Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. They share such enviable chemistry and just seem so perfect for each other, even in moments of argument. Opposites attract, and with Carrey as the insecure and mellow Joel Barish and Winslet as the lively, slightly bipolar Clementine Kruczynski, they make the perfect on-screen couple. Carrey and Winslet are also supported by some great performances by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson.The film of course wouldn't be anything if it weren't for Michel Gondry and his unique visual style that gives the film the kind of hand-made look it graves. With little computer-effects, most of the work is done by hand, thus keeping the film even more in the ground as opposed to plunging into CGI-scifi. The color themes and the contrasts that Gondry uses are all coherent and brilliantly selected, and cinematographer Ellen Kuras is doing an amazing job with her raw visual style that fits seamlessly into Gondry's vision. The soundtrack is another thing that deserves endless praise, Beck's bittersweet ""Everybody's Got To Learn Sometime"" is just one of the high points.But it's the story of these two lovers, struggling through their difficulties only to once again find the joy they once shared, that makes this film the masterpieces that it is. It is only by a collaboration of remarkably talented individuals, that something like this can be achieved.""Love conquers all"" might be a worn-out phrase, but after seeing this film it's a little easier to believe that there might be some truth behind it after all.It is now 5AM, and I am already yearning back into the film's world, back into the lives of Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. I am in love all over again."

umarali-65266,"Sep 20, 2019",10/10,Wildly fascinating. Can't take your eyes off the screen. Carrey is at his best and is a perfect foil to Kate's eccentric character. Beautiful film.
Benedict_Cumberbatch,"Mar 12, 2007",N/A,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (cool title taken from Alexander Pope's poem ""Eloisa to Abelard"") is one of the most original, hilarious and oddly moving films about love and all its phases. Thanks to Charlie Kaufman's flawless, much deserving Oscar-winning script (co-written by Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth), and Gondry's spectacular visual talent, ESOTSM became a one of a kind masterpiece. Take Paul Thomas Anderson's gorgeous ""Punch-Drunk Love"", which features the overwhelming sensation of falling in love among chaos and depression, and go deeper, when the perfect couple don't feel so into each other anymore and their ugly side is evident, and you can have an idea of what expect from the V-Day card created by the same mind who gave us ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."".Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) discovers that his beloved Clementine Kruczysnki (Kate Winslet) underwent a bizarre procedure to erase him from her mind, and decides to do the same. But only after the physicians start to erase his memories, Joel realizes he loves Clem so much that he wants to remember both the good and bad times they had together - so our hero has to run with Clem from the doctors (inside his mind!) and struggle to stop them before everything's gone. Sounds crazy? It is. It's also extremely funny and poignant. Who never wanted to forget the one who broke our heart? What if you could really do it? Now, the hardest thing to know is whether it's worth it or not. A discreet Carrey and a garrulous Winslet are fantastic as the leads, and the supporting cast (Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, David Cross and Jane Adams) is equally brilliant.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is compelling for those who have just had their first heartbreak, AND for those who consider themselves experts in matters of the heart as well. It seems that (at least to me), when it comes to love and relationships, the more we seem to understand them, the less we really know about them. After seeing this movie, I realized I shouldn't worry that much... everybody's gotta learn sometime. 10/10."
PoeticProse22,"Aug 10, 2009",10/10,"""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."" - Alexander PopeMichel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliantly heartfelt and complicated tale that delves, rather flawlessly, into the labyrinth of human emotions and the pain often involved in trying to make a relationship work. Charlie Kaufman, the main writer behind Eternal Sunshine, often allows his ingenuity and talent to infuse the film with perfectly subtle touches of emotion and humanity. His understanding of relationships and the variety of complexities involved is often wondrous to behold.One day, Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey), after falling in love with Clementine (Kate Winslet), finds out that she, due to her recent unhappiness with the relationship, had Joel erased from her memory through a procedure carried out by the Lacuna company. Eventually, Joel, himself, wants the same operation, in order that he can forget Clementine as well. Through this procedure, the film delves into Joel's thoughts and past, chaotically revealing his memories as he eventually attempts to outrun the erasing of them, after realizing how much the lovely moments with Clementine rather largely outweighed the upsetting ones.The cast, from Kirsten Dunst to Jim Carrey, is superb in the portrayal of their characters. In one of his more dynamic roles, Jim Carrey presents Joel Barrish as a complex and three-dimensional character, and seems wholly convincing and sympathetic throughout. Clementine is played absolutely brilliantly by Kate Winslet. Her on-screen chemistry with Carrey is thoroughly entrancing and poignant. The entirety of the supporting cast deliver a subliminally nuanced and engrossing blend of emotions as well.The apparent surrealism deftly blends with the realism in a way that allows the viewer a more complete view of the tale. This subtle relationship between the director, the writer, and the screen is enhanced and brought to life with the assistance of the exceptional cinematography and the seamless transitions and edits.The feelings and expressions throughout the film cast a picture so hauntingly realistic, it's difficult not to see some aspect of a past relationship unfolding on-screen. The engaging and creative ways Gondry and Kaufman explore Joel's memories and dreams is humorous, chaotic, touching, and heartbreaking all at once.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is a consistently moving and thought-provoking film that remains my favorite film of all time. Simply perfect."
muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 21, 2025",7/10,"This film is a truly unique and heartbreakingly beautiful exploration of love, memory, and the complexities of human connection. Watching it, I was captivated by its innovative narrative structure, which takes us on a non-linear journey through the erased memories of Joel and Clementine. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet deliver incredibly nuanced and vulnerable performances, creating a believable and deeply felt relationship that resonates long after the credits roll. Charlie Kaufman's ingenious screenplay weaves together humor, melancholy, and profound philosophical questions, making for a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. The film's visual creativity and dreamlike sequences are simply stunning.Is it worth watching? Absolutely. It is a thought-provoking and emotionally powerful film that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. It's a modern classic that offers a profound look at what it means to love and to forget."
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Dec 28, 2008",10/10,"Films that intentionally blur the lines between the real and the imagined, that completely defy our most basic sense of narrative structure can often be off-putting and regarded as strange. Some people, no matter how outside-the-box their thinking, will always see ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" this way. The title alone is a red flag for conservative movie-goers. But the truth is that this film is not abstract merely for the sake of style, but it is abstract filmmaking with a clear purpose. Writer Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry make that purpose accessible the entire film and the result is a unique and special film about the connection between memory and relationship.""Eternal Sunshine"" is about the relationship between Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet), both of whom have decided to undergo a procedure that would completely erase the other from his/her memory. The majority of plot follows Joel as he seeks out the services of Lacuna, a practice run by a doctor (Wilkinson) and his staff (Ruffalo, Dunst and Wood). As they erase his memory overnight, the film plunges into a progression from most recent to earliest of all of Joel's memories involving Clementine. Things are complicated when a mostly unconscious Joel decides, while in his own memories, that he has changed his mind.As Joel goes through his memories, things disappear, his environment magically shifts from one to the next. Some of this is digital effects, but much of it is nifty camera-work. It's hard to understand exactly what's going on, but since the action takes place in Joel's mind, what happens is a mix of Joel's actual memory and his mind's interaction with it. It's a brilliant and surreal trip through someone's mind that exposes more and more about this relationship as it goes, also asking questions along the way about whether erasing someone is ultimately an effective way of dealing with loss.It's a pleasure seeing Carrey take on dramatic role successfully. He seems to be able to channel his goofy energy into the neurotic and self-conscious Joel. Winslet proves her own versatility in taking on Clem, who is a free-spirited fireball, not her traditional dramatic performance, but she really demands your attention. Wilkinson and Dunst also prove to be excellent dramatic side-fodder to illustrate another perspective into the memory erasing concept.Excellent, realistic character portrayal combined with surreal visual drama create a concept of love that while abstract, manages to identify with us because there's a wild, imaginative side of love that only exists in our individual minds. Through the entire film, Gondry makes sure we see the very high and very low points of a relationship and it creates a feeling that Joel and Clementine are meant for each other despite obvious proof that they are somewhat incompatible. This helps further push the film's themes.While ""Eternal Sunshine"" can get confusing and test one's limits at times, a concentrated viewing will show how honest and truthful this film is to not only human relationships, but to the human psyche."

It's almost magic.It gave me a feeling, and that's why movies are for, this is pure art. Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey are at the best. Those two actors have crowned themselves to Legend actors.Congratulations to Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, this movie deserves his Oscar and I think Kate Winslet could have won an Oscar too.If you didn't see the movie: WATCH IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
moviewizguy,"Jun 6, 2007",10/10,"On a Valentine Day, Joel Barish feels the impulse of going to Montauk instead of working. After spending the cold day on the beach, he meets Clementine Kruczynski on the train station and they have a crush on each other. Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the past. Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended. However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her, fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.This is a movie that makes you think and could break your heart at the same time. It's your different kind of romantic comedy and it's a great addition to Charlie Kaufman's writing. The great work of CGI and camera work draws in the viewers because they are so amazing! The acting by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are really fantastic. I never have anything to say about great films like this. It has an emotional core and one of the best films ever made."
lastliberal,"Dec 29, 2007",9/10,"I avoided this movie because I thought I would never see anything starring Jim Carrey (Dumb & Dumber, The Cable Guy, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls) that was worth watching. That was my loss.Kate Winslet(Little Children) was absolutely brilliant in this film by Oscar-winner Charlie Kaufman. And, of course, one of my very favorites, Kirsten Dunst, also gave a great performance.I have to admit that I have a new appreciation for Carrey after seeing this film. He was perfect for the role and pulled it off spotlessly.No matter how bad it is, there is always something special about that relationship. So, just remember the good times."
floralflowerss,"May 3, 2014",10/10,"This movie touched my heart.A unique deconstruction of man's innate desire to avert heartache. An unusual one but a great one, it will have you asking questions about the true nature of love for some time after wards. Still one of my favorites. I recommend this film for those who like something deeper and darker. This film made me to think about it almost a week! I was amazed with this movie. Most Hollywood films tell us we have everything we need within ourselves. This movie indicates that we need each other, even ... when togetherness disrupts happiness. I like the idea of this film. It's the kind of film that could mean more to people after they've left the theater and thought about it awhile."
chrissythecat,"Nov 28, 2004",10/10,"I don't know how to describe ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" Cliché, I know, but there doesn't seem to be words to describe just how exquisite a film I think it is. I feel like I shouldn't even comment on it because I can't do it justice. There don't seem to be enough adjectives, in any language, to describe how amazing a movie it truly is. But, I guess I have to begin somewhere. Eternal Sunshine is an indescribably marvelous film (isn't that an oxymoron? No, I think I'm probably the moron here,lol). It's a love story unlike any other I've seen before. It isn't filled with the typical Hollywood melodrama that so many so-called ""love stories"" possess where the perfect girl and the perfect guy love each other and want to be together, but they don't know it at first, and somehow, despite their perfection, they can't admit their true feelings until the end when they live happily ever after. Cue the doves flying into the sunset. Eternal Sunshine is nothing like that. It isn't the love story of two otherwise perfect people living in this ethereal and ideal world where the problems are so easily solved. It's a love story between real characters with real faults and flaws, quirks and idiosyncracies. Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) are human. He's shy, timid, and introverted, she's outgoing, vivacious, but yet somehow broken and sad, unable to maintain a sense of normalcy and familiarity. Clementine becomes bored quite easily, and Joel is threatened when Clementine cannot be exactly what he wants her to be. He gets annoyed at her for the very same reasons he fell in love with her, and their relationship suffers as a result of their incapacity to be what the other needs, and to keep their romance fresh. Clementine opts to undergo a new procedure to have her memories of Joel wiped clean, and he has to come to terms with that and decide if he really wants to erase her from her memories. I don't want to spoil the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, so I'll wrap it up here. You'll fall in love with them both. So, watch it because it's a great story, it doesn't have a linear plot but you will be mesmerized by the acting and the vivid visuals and the overall beautiful cinematography of the film. This film has left me with Eternal Sunshine of my Spotless Mind."
theforager,"Jun 4, 2020",7/10,"A romantic version of Matrix with no complex Sci-Fi.When the movie starts, you will have no idea what you are going to encounter. It starts from a simple memory erase to things being played in mind and physical world. I really took time to digest what i am really watching. If you are a real freak or geek, you really going to watch it again and again to understand the underlying concept.Story, although is mind bending, but you will enjoy and especially when it is played by Jim Carrey.One thing, I feel was not justified. The couple whose memories were erased fell for each other again with their changed personalities. May be they learned lessons and had a fresh start. But this part is not aligned with main idea of the story."
TXSteve,"Jul 8, 2005",1/10,"Someone recommended ESSM to me recently. I decided to give it a chance against my better judgment. Having been disappointed with ""Adaptation"" I had avoided this film. I should have listened to my gut.This meandering and boring film moves so slowly that it feels like an eternity. Jim Carrey looks lost as he tries to actually act without goofing off. It does not work. There is very little to keep your attention. The plot is paper thin and the premise could have been handled in 30 minutes to an hour. Characters seem like cutouts without any cardboard backing.The only joke in this movie is that people have been led to believe it is any good. If you must see an ""arty"" film, there are hundreds of better ways to spend your time."
george.schmidt,"Mar 23, 2004",N/A,"ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004) *** Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Jane Adams, David Cross. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman once again baffles the mind and logic of cinema with another patented loopy love story set on end this time with a sad sack (Carrey) who discovers his ex-girlfriend (Winslet) has had a procedure done to literally erase all memory of his existence which prompts him into a spontaneous spiteful choice to do likewise with unexpected circumstances to crop up, namely love is a powerful thing to try to forget. Filmmaker Michel Gondry (who adapted Kaufman's equally goofy 'Human Nature') manages to technically get the feel for a second rate sci-fi appeal to the film with some unique camera trickery but there is scarcely any believable chemistry between the two principals (maybe that's the point? If so then it works)  not to dismiss their excellent turns here; it just felt like something was missing to make it an instant classic."
GregDexter,"Nov 27, 2004",10/10,"I've watched several hundred movies in the past three years and haven't felt the need to write many reviews at IMDb.com, but for some reason I feel the need to defend this movie. Why that is I am uncertain, particularly since less than 10 percent of the ratings for this movie have been below a ""7"". But those who hate it...man do they ever seem to hate it.First of all, there are several reviewers who merely decided to say this movie was ""crap"", with no thought or reasoning as to why that is. They are irrelevant until they are willing to defend their opinion. Of those who pointed out specific deficiencies, nearly all of them were--in my opinion--incorrect. The editing? That's the style of this movie. If it isn't your cup of tea that's fine, but to act as though it was unprofessional of the editor is ridiculous. The acting? You must be joking. It's a wonderful cast, and in my opinion they are in top form. And you have never seen Kate Winslet and seldom seen Jim Carrey doing anything like this. Not original? Again, you must be joking. For god's sake, it has Charlie Kaufman's name on it and that's about all you need to know. Below average for Kaufman? I think that it's every bit as good a script as ""Being John Malkovich"" or ""Adaptation""--but I feel that this is a better movie than either of those. Not funny? There are a few laughs, but I'm unsure why this movie was ever classified a ""comedy"" in the first place. However, I don't think a movie is *required* to be funny, just good. Hard to follow? I knew little about the premise before watching the movie and had no trouble following it; that wasn't the case with several other movies I could name. If you listen before the opening credits when it's made clear that what is taking place happened on ""Valentine's Day 2004"", it helps immensely (although unless I am remembering something incorrectly, that would rather strangely constitute playing hooky from an office job on Saturday).What this movie qualifies as is a particularly original romance. And the healthy dose of skepticism and reality toward romance that are thrown in the mix (particularly at the end) doesn't detract from that at all. That's quite an accomplishment to me. It's worthy of one of the few ""10"" ratings I'll ever give on IMDb.com. And of the hundred or so movies I've seen from the 21st Century, I can't think of a better one. If it isn't up for Best Picture, AMPAS will have made yet another major blunder."
inovski,"Sep 18, 2022",10/10,"I am slightly late to the party with this movie since it is from 2004, but I must say that this movie is absolutely perfect. Top to bottom I could not see a flaw with this movie, at multiple points in the film I kept asking myself: How does someone come up with this idea and execute it to perfection?!The entire cast managed to tell 5+ stories at the same time in only 1 hours and 45 minutes. Today, most franchises use a whole trilogy to tell a story that has 10% of the weight that this movie does.It does such an amazing job to get you intrigued, then confuse you and lastly make everything so obvious and complete. When I watch movies, the ending has to be amazing for me to give a 10/10. Ending are in my opinion just as important as the whole story and this ending left me without a single piece of criticism. I'd love to review the story and how deep everything is but I tend to lean away from spoiler reviews.If you were like me and have been putting off watching this movie for no reason, drop whatever you're doing and go watch it right away."
sxmncgw,"Oct 25, 2024",10/10,"Absolutely loved this! The storyline took me on an emotional rollercoaster that left me stunned. It was intense, sometimes confusing, and really made me question everything. I felt invested in each character's journey and felt their struggles deeply. There was a lot of darkness, and at times it was heartbreaking, but it was also strangely comforting. The sadness felt overwhelming, but it brought a unique beauty to the story. By the end, I felt a surprising sense of peace. It's a story that stayed with me long after finishing. Brilliantly crafted, thought-provoking, and unforgettable!Highly recommended."
notemmastone,"Jan 5, 2022",10/10,"The things we don't want to remember aren't the things we need to forget.The world is a different place for the heartbroken. This line is notoriously said by Taylor Swift, one who's arguably had more heartbreaks (and songs about them) than anyone else on the planet. Anyone who's had a broken heart will tell you how they tried to forget the person they loved. I did it. I deleted the selfies we took together. I gave their sweatshirts back. I threw away the necklaces they gave me. I got rid of the physical objects that reminded me of that person thinking that if I threw away the parts of the relationship I could see I would somehow forget all of these things that I couldn't see. These feelings of love, companionship, joy, peace, comfort that were deep inside of me.Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) is living in this new world. Joel has been left heartbroken by his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet). Joel decides that he just can't take it anymore. The tears. The hurt. The memories. All of it. So he does what we all do. He tries to forget. He tries to forget their fights and arguments and everything that went wrong with their relationship. Fortunately for Joel, there's an organization that can help him do just that- forget that Clementine ever existed. It's a simple procedure. You go to sleep and BOOM! You wake up forgetting what you didn't want to remember, and you don't even remember that you forgot! A whole new and fresh life is ahead of you, free of tears, hurt, and memories. Well, mostly.As Joel undergoes the procedure, he realizes that Clementine isn't someone he wants to forget. He quickly sees that along with all the rough patches in their relationship, there were moments of paradise.Realizing he made a mistake, Joel quickly tries to reverse the procedure. The audience follows along as Joel gets to enter and relive his memories as they are being erased. The film's compelling plot is executed beautifully by the film's performances, screenwriting and directing.Both characters are all too relatable and portrayed beautifully by the movie's astounding cast. Jim Carrey impressively portrays a shy, creative, heart-broken Joel and dazzles the audience with his range, a far more serious role than he usually plays. Kate Winslet portrays a free spirited, impulsive Clementine with a truly awe inspiring performance. Kirsten Dunst appears in the film portraying a complicated character Mary (who works for the memory-erasing organization) with ease. All these actors give (in my opinion) their best performances to date.The dialogue is so beautifully complex that it gives the Bible competition, truly stunning work by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. So many lines sit in your mind long after the film is over. If I recited every line that made me think, your eyes would never leave this review.The timeline is beautifully unique with it's non-chronological format, an individual stylistic choice by director Michael Gondry. The very beginning of the movie is an event that happens almost last chronologically. It makes the movie exciting to watch, but it's also not too difficult to understand.What I love most about the film is that it shatters the conventional romantic comedy stereotype. This story is not all sunshine and unicorns. You see both the good and bad of the relationship. The film truly embodies what it's like to be in love, and what it's like to be heart-broken, and that makes it far from a typical love story.Love is a weird thing that gets ahold of us. When we fall in love, we never want to fall out of it, but when we do, we try desperately to forget it ever existed in the first place. But ultimately, we remember it anyway. The point of this film is that the things we don't want to remember aren't the things we need to forget. My breakup left me heartbroken, but it also left me with some of the most important lessons of my life. I learned that pain doesn't last forever. I learned that sometimes life doesn't stop sucking. I learned that if he's talking to 30 other girls on Snapchat, you're probably not his only girlfriend. Joel wanted to forget Clementine, but he needed to remember her.So many of us try to forget things that we could benefit greatly by remembering. The truth is, we spend a lot of time focusing on the bad parts of failed relationships. We remember how we fought over our future plans, how we became jealous of the guys that they were ""just friends"" with, how they left us at a hockey game on our first date. (Office reference anyone? Too obscure? My bad.) The truth is, there were good things too, and these good things are worth remembering. First kisses, dates to the very best restaurants, baking cookies, making snow angels, discovering favorite movies. These are things you're going to want to remember someday. The things that hurt now teach us lessons in hindsight. They can also make for some pretty great stories someday.Reel Rater Rating:

fernandoschiavi,"Jan 26, 2023",7/10,"What if we could simply erase the ones, we love the most from our memory? The idea is frightening, but it can be tempting in moments of greater suffering or longing. This is the premise of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, one of the most acclaimed love films of the 2000s. Mixing new technologies with a very old theme, the famous ""heartbreak"", the plot explores the past and the How we look at our memories.In his new feature film, Charlie Kaufman reprises the duo with director Michel Gondry, with whom he worked on The almost human nature. The French filmmaker, known for the music videos he made with singer Björk, manages to use his colleague's script very well, and in the denser parts of the film, he makes great use of the fusions of scenery, like George Clooney in Confessions. Here, however, they have a meaning beyond mere aesthetics, as we are inside the protagonist's head.Insecure and needy, Joel Barish (Carrey) is your typical Kaufmanian hero: as he makes eye contact with the beautiful Clementine Kruczynski (Winslet) on a beach, he thinks, ""Why do I fall in love with every woman who gives me any attention? "". However, right after we witness the friendly meeting of the two characters, the narrative jumps in time to show us that the stark differences between Joel and Clementine's personalities doomed the relationship - and, to get rid of the painful memories, the girl submits to a 'surgery', newly developed by a certain dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Wilkinson), able to selectively erase memories of his ill-fated marriage to Joel. Upon discovering what his ex-wife did, the subject decides to follow the same procedure, but, during the surgery, he realizes that he wants to keep the memories and does everything to prevent them from being removed from his brain.Surpassing, in inventiveness and intelligence, the sequence in Being John Malkovich in which a chase takes place in the subconscious of the title character, Joel's efforts to keep Clementine's memory alive is the great attraction of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: firstly, such memories are ""erased"" in reverse chronological order, and thus we see the last moments of the couple's relationship first - and, as the film progresses, we go back in time and discover the charm that initially existed in that marriage. Furthermore, by reliving the most remarkable moments of his life with Clementine, Joel concludes the obvious: we can only evolve thanks to our experiences (good or bad), and losing this reference is too high a price to pay for the comfort of avoiding suffering. For a while. From then on, Kaufman once again proves his talent by showing that he is not limited to creating interesting concepts, he is also a master at exploring them to the fullest, and transforms our ""tour"" through Joel's mind into a journey that borders on the surreal: the boy's memories are joined by his imagination, his reflections on past events and even the knowledge acquired during the surgery, since he is still able to hear (even unconsciously) what dr. Howard are talking.The film calls our attention for its incredible identity in the way it tells the story. The non-linearity is what determines part of the script's strength, after all, a lot of what we're looking at is a big extended memory. And, as the script presents subtle details, they end up having an effect at some point, no matter how small. In this sense, the montage works very well on the way in which it will intercalate these events. Everything is out of order, but is this necessary to work as a surprise for the viewer, such as: for what reasons are both of you doing this? How did they meet? In what period does this take place? The non-sequential way of answering all of this is what makes the film so thought-provoking. The scenes in Joel's head are impressive. The reality distortions, the blurs, the absence of light and the gradually disappearing elements have an immense capacity for immersion. It really feels like dreams disappearing, where only Joel and the audience understand, it's palpable and fantasy at the same time. Thus, when there is a transition and mixture of these memories, in that context it makes sense.Demonstrating that he has evolved as a feature film director since his debut in the role (precisely in ""Almost Human Nature""), Michel Gondry conducts the film with confidence, never allowing the spectator to feel lost - which is admirable, since, in addition to from the sequences that take place in Joel's mind, we are presented with two other plots: one involving Patrick (Wood) and Clementine; and another addressing Mary's (Dunst) interest in Dr. Howard. What's more, unlike silliness like ""Van Helsing"" and ""Haunted Mansion,"" which revolve around visual effects and ignore story, here Gondry uses effects as a function of the script's needs, which is admirable.What is most human in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is precisely the understanding of something that completely escapes any perverse or insensitive scientism, like what we see on the screen when Clementine and Joel try to erase all memories, indistinctly, of their finished relationship. I like the way science is presented in the film. The feature film peremptorily refuses the lure of presenting a hyper-technological face of science, capable of generating even dazzle and admiration for its futuristic achievements. In contrast, the clinic's team of scientists who promote the ""treatment"" are not presented with any pomp or seriousness. The very device placed on the patients' heads seems poorly made and somewhat silly, belonging to any uninteresting and unbelievable sci-fi children's story.And here is the main and most accurate criticism of Michel Gondry's film, with a strong dystopian flavor, to the idea of a science without limits. What most essentially eludes the film's scientists is the understanding that we are made, above all else, of affections. It is this indelible affectivity that Joel will discover during the pseudo-therapeutic process when he exclaims: ""No, not that memory! Let me keep this one at least."" The necessary question remains: what science do we want for the future? The one that leads us to technical progress without stripping us of our most basic humanity, or the one that erases our memories and, thus, erases ourselves as beings with history? The one that anesthetizes and infantilizes us or the one that allows us to feel the world and thus humanize it? And starting from what the film gives us, through a love story so loved by so many people, we can go further. Is it not the affections, good or bad, that teach us individually and, at the same time, allow humanity itself to improve collectively, even with enormous difficulties and setbacks?The star cast agreed to work for much lower amounts than usual. This type of commitment only happens when there is the possibility of working with renowned directors, different scripts, or roles completely opposite to what is usually offered to them, but which can yield strong performances and serious chances in the awards season. Jim Carrey proves once again that he is a great dramatic actor, as he had already done in ""The Truman Show"" and ""Andy's World"". The actor is restrained and never exhibits any trace of his usual histrionics, transforming Joel into a melancholic and real figure. Kate Winslet and her colorful hair are not at all reminiscent of her role in ""Titanic"". And among the secondary characters, all have equal importance and performance. For fans of Kirsten Dunst, the scene where she appears in panties and a tank top jumping on the bed is worth highlighting. The cast is completed by Tom Wilkinson (Girl with a Pearl Earring), Mark Ruffalo (In The Cut) and Elijah Wood (Frodo from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy).Perhaps the film deserved an ending that was a little more in-depth, which somehow touched more on these successive questions that it implicitly raises. Instead, the final scene shows the reconciliation of the protagonists with a rather cliché dialogue. But the slightly disappointing conclusion is not able to change a fact - the inventiveness of the script, the agile and vibrant direction of Gondry and the excellent performance of the main actors make Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind an original film, well directed and capable of think of several layers.For those who like to put labels on movies, ""Eternal Sunshine"" is a dramatic comedy with hints of science fiction, but mainly, it's a love story. That's the only way to define this script that mixes different influences and makes you laugh (intelligently), get emotional (without easy tears) and think (a lot). Just when you think you understand where all this is going, there is a twist and the story changes direction and even style. This time, in addition to messing with what is real or not, Charlie Kaufman also plays with the timeline of his short story. Are we at the beginning of a line or in the middle of a cycle? Is what happened really in the past? All this is detail. It's just a device he uses to make the audience think."
sddavis63,"Feb 10, 2008",1/10,"After almost 20 mind-numbingly incomprehensible minutes that seemed so much longer, it comes as a shock to realize that what one is suddenly seeing floating across the screen is (after 20 minutes, remember) the ""opening"" credits of the movie. This can mean only one thing - and it isn't good news: sweet Jesus, there's still an entire movie to come.I confess that I'm not entirely enamoured of Jim Carrey. I've seen him as a weak part of a good movie (Bruce Almighty) and as the strong part of a weak movie (The Grinch Who Stole Christmas). Either way, he doesn't turn my crank. I don't think I'd ever watch a movie just because the star was Jim Carrey. To be honest, in ""Eternal Sunshine ..."" I'm not sure if he's strong or weak, but it really doesn't matter because the story is absurd, disjointed and not really all that interesting. It had potential. The whole ""erasing negative memories"" had a vaguely Orwellian tone to it that intrigued me (which is why I rented it) but in the end it failed badly. When I find myself hoping (even yearning) for a movie to come to an end, I know it's been a disaster.The most intriguing thing about this movie is the following statement right off the DVD jacket it came in: [""Eternal Sunshine ... is] a memorable film that the Wall Street Journal calls 'a romantic comedy unlike any other."" I can't argue with that - it is ""memorable"" (no matter how hard I'll try to, I don't think I'll ever be able to forget it) and it is ""a romantic comedy unlike any other."" Give thanks for small mercies - this truly is one of a kind, and, in truth, there must never be another like it. 1/10"
TommyDeWito,"Apr 3, 2008",9/10,"The greatest thing about this movie is that there are really weird science fiction kind of staff going on but the movie doesn't feel like a science fiction movie or even a weird movie , it all feels natural. Reason for this are :1)Honesty : the actual love story is one of the most honest ones , it has its ups and downs like real life ,there are some serious things they don't like about each other , they will never live happily ever after , yet you feel like they might always love each other and its heart warming.2)Acting :very natural , staying away from overacting , Jim Carrey actually surprised me , he should have an Oscar nomination but ironically you need to overact for that.3)Lightning and camera : i read that Michel Gondry didn't want to use any lightning at all but they used some in the end , the camera also reminds you that it's there , it's shaking a little , these even sometimes make you feel like you are watching a documentary.While they tried to market it as a romantic comedy , i think this is an anti-romantic comedy , a very sad and deep movie. with the things falling apart in most of the time in the movie i felt like my heart was falling apart. and with lines like ; "" Clementine: This is it, Joel. It's going to be gone soon. Joel: I know. Clementine: What do we do? Joel: Enjoy it. "" it connects everything to real life itself in an upsetting but enlightening way."
jen_carlson_6,"Apr 24, 2007",10/10,"Amazing film that has changed and shaped my life. Highly recommended. The impact of Winslet and Carry's performances is completely unforgettable. If people have been through any sort of rift in a relationship they will completely understand the film. Though I am sure there are people who don't and with that in mind cannot fully comprehend the movie. Kaufman is brilliant. The scenes shot in New York (especially Grand Central) are amazing, and accurate. Montauk in the winter is completely isolated. Everything was done correctly in this film which is a relief. As well the film has a great soundtrack with very diverse music. I love this film."
prima-angkasa,"Jan 11, 2009",10/10,"I had shown Eternal sunshine for 10 times. Now, I get a chance to make a review here. What I like the film most? the chemistry between Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Unbelievable, that Jim Carrey can act like that. Not stupid but boring man. Usually I seen Jim Carrey movie like comedy such as Ace Ventura, dumb and dumber. But he is kind of different he. He really merge to Joel Barish character. Boring man but make us pity and love him at once. Kate Winslet, did a good act too here. I love the way Kate Winslet express the Clementine character. She made Clementine lovable, cheer full but also insecure. very human. Michel Gondry did a good job here and also Charlie Kauffman (I also like Being John Malkovich, very original).. the point is, eternal sunshine is the most romantic film ever...Two thumbs up."
mieriks,"Mar 19, 2022",7/10,"The story of this movie is both very beautiful and very sad. As a movie, it's good, but not amazing. Sometimes, it could get a little boring. Anyway, it was unusual to watch Jim Carrey as a more serious and natural person, but I think he was spot on in this one. This movie is definitely recommending!"
eskimotruth,"Feb 2, 2009",10/10,"With his first two successful screenplays, Charlie Kaufman established himself as one of the most creative and idiosyncratic screenwriters in the business. But with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind he builds on this reputation further, showing a soft side that had previously been barely hidden behind his oft-charming middle-aged neurosis. It helps that this script is just as groundbreaking as that of Being John Malkovich or Adaptation.Kauffman's stand-in this time around is Joel Barish, a sweet loser played with his best sad puppy-dog face by Jim Carrey. It is difficult to tell you anything about Joel's romantic situation as it stands at the beginning of the movie, because doing so could partially reveal the truly ingenious plot structure. Suffice it to say that Barish is unlucky and unconfident with women and Kauffman beautifully plays with how we view Joel's situation.The basic premise is that Joel finds out that his longtime girlfriend, Clementine, played vibrantly by Kate Winslet, has had him erased from her memory using a new procedure developed by Dr. Howard Mierzcwak, with Tom Wilkinson playing the doctor to perfection. Joel, who is so grief-ridden by this turn of events, impulsively decides to have Clementine erased from his own mind. Mierczwak gets the treatment going immediately.The procedure consists of Joel being knocked out, strapped to his bed, and having a strange device attached to his head, while technicians delete the unpleasant memories overnight. Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are the technicians, who along with Kirsten Dunst as Ruffalo's girlfriend raid Joel's liquor cabinet and start to have a good time. Ruffalo is a good-hearted loser, but Wood is up to something more deplorable, something that we begin to learn about gradually over the course of the erasing.Much of the movie takes place in Joel's own head, as he run through his distant memories of Clementine, who he gradually begins to realize he still loves. These scenes are executed with a perfect sense of surrealism by the talented music video director Michel Gondry, who establishes himself here as a true visionary. Unlike Spike Jonze he brings in mostly hand-held cameras which make the in-your-face surrealism of these scenes even more potent.But the movie's truest strength lies in the purity of the love story between Joel and Clementine. It is a realistic yet wholly uncynical portrait of a real couple. However quirky Clementine may be (and believe me, quirky she is), the couple has real problems, and their love is a viable force.To add to this, we get to see sides of Carrey and Winslet that have not yet been exposed until now. Carrey fully opens himself up emotionally. In every glance you see the self-doubt, the sadness, and the true love for Clementine, even when they first meet. Winslet feels more alive here than ever before, she has made what could have been a gimmick a person who feels intrinsically real, she inhabits the character entirely, making it her own and daring us not to like her despite her flaws.But it all comes back to Kauffman, who shows that he not only can blow your mind with his creativity, plot structure and surrealism, but he opens us up to his human side here and it is enough to break your heart and make you jump for joy."

SteveL,"Oct 1, 2004",1/10,"I looked forward with great anticipation for the DVD release of this movie that had received a 10 for 50% of it's viewer ratings - making it #37 on the all-time list. After having seen this drek, I'm wondering if we all saw the same film. It appears that lots of people are believing the Hollywood hype that, ""If you don't understand it it most be great"". Well believe me this isn't great; it isn't good; it's awful. Uneven direction, purposely choppy plot line and ssslllllooooowwwww (to the point of being boooooring) pace combine to make the one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I loved the idea behind the story and the acting was fair, but give me a break. This movie never comes together and certainly doesn't deserve to be rated any where near the company of ""Apocalypse Now"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""The Pianist"". Save your money, don't rent this trash; don't even bother with it when it comes on regular TV."
wilsonthornsberry,"Jun 29, 2022",10/10,This movie is incredibly charming with Jim Carrey leading as a hopeless romantic. Strong feelings throughout the whole movie. Ive seen this movie 4 times and each watch has me thinking for a couple days. Cinematography is very enjoyable and very accurately encapsulates the emotions set by the characters. I am excited for my fifth watch.
sillent-star,"Apr 5, 2012",8/10,"It's a good film that tell a story about a person who failed in his love.Joel(Jim Carry) is an introvert person who works in magazine and Celementine(Kate Winslet) is an extrovert person who works in a library and story is about this two persons and the relation between them and... .This is non linear film,the first scene is when Joel woke up and suddenly ditched his work and he went to Montauk.Then he fell in love with a girl (Celementine).Then movie continues with some romantic scenes and then suddenly you see Joel who found out that Clementine is with someone else and even she doesn't know him anymore(you'll find out that it was a flash back).the viewer can't understand why they separated.Joel decided to remove Celementine of his mind,in the process he remembered what happened to them (flash backs) and who should be blamed for this situation.He understood that made a mistake.then ...

danielgroza,"May 21, 2023",10/10,"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!The world forgetting, by the world forgot.Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resigned...That was 18th Century English poet Alexander Pope. This stanza is quoted by one of the characters of the film who makes the adorable mistake of calling him ""Pope Alexander"". It is quite the beautiful stanza, good enough to impress people, as that was what said character was trying to do. But besides that, the quote also makes a great point. It claims that happiness can only be found in nothingness because someone who demands nothing, needs nothing. Therefore, that someone has everything.But writer Charlie Kaufman alongside director/writer Michel Gondry challenge this philosophy by adhering to the ideology that man's happiness is, in fact, not found in having everything, but rather in their ability to want. Even modern philosophers like Jacques Lacan believed this. But I will not get into it. I will leave that to Kaufman, one of the greatest writers of this Century, to elaborate. He is a writer interested--like myself--in the place where the common and the esoteric clash. His characters are everyday working class people and he puts them through philosophical conundrums and thought experiments. It's one thing to put the question: ""What would you do if?""... It's another to live it.The main character is Joel Barish (Jim Carrey). But even while portrayed by the shapeless, flamboyant actor, Joel is anything but. He is a somber, bored out of his life downer. He then meets an exact opposite--the outgoing, colorful (in more ways than one) and ""impulsive""--as she calls herself--Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). You know the saying that opposites attract and the movie sticks by it, but Clementine is a handful and while she does her best to unwind Joel, she only succeeds up to one point. Even in the most playful scenes he can only relax so much. They make a great couple. Until they don't anymore.They eventually break up, and while the details for why are never disclosed, it's safe to say they both suffered greatly after. But there is a solution--an experimental medical procedure to erase the memory of your significant other and to cull the suffering. Joel, while baffled by the fact that something like this even exists, gets on with it. Here is an example of why this is a great movie. In any other film, the place where Joel goes to get his procedure would have been presented with all the sci-fi panache--perhaps it would've been a secret underground laboratory filled with bizarre research and visual conglomerates but in here it looks like any other doctor's office. The employees are also pretty casual about it. Mary (Kirsten Dunst) the secretary, Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) the guys who do the procedure and Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) take their job pretty casually--FDA approved and all, I suppose.Here's where one might argue: how come something like this is treated with such normality? It makes no sense in the real contemporary world the movie takes place. But no movie takes place in the real world. A new world is created every single time a script is written. Any movie takes place in a real world which simply warps reality in the areas in which the movie takes place. In sci-fi epics, an entire galaxy might me warped; here is only a town. So, can there exist such a medical procedure simply because Charlie Kaufman says so? Of course! Call it a new iteration. In here, Stan and Patrick go to Joel's house, they put a funny looking metal hat on his head while he sleeps, connect it to a computer and literally delete blocks of his memory containing Clementine. Nothing they haven't done before. Hell, they can even put the thing on auto-pilot. At one point, Mary arrives--she is romantically involved with Stan--and starts looking through Joel's fridge while he's asleep. Not soon enough both she and Stan get high and Stan begins to argue why The Clash was the only band that mattered. I love this stuff. This is not only for comedic effect, but also to keep things as unpretentious as possible, and let the philosophical implications of such a procedure speak for themselves rather than being pushed on through cheap dramatization.But while I thought that this might be why I adore this movie so much, while it certainly contributes to it, is not the biggest selling point. Nor is it the ending which states that no matter how lost they become, two souls who are made for each other will always get back together. No, it's the realization that it wasn't the bad memories that made Joel suffer, but the good ones; memories, constantly reminding himself of the great moments he spent together with Clementine and the impossibility of making new ones. During the removal process, Gondry and Kaufman treat us to surreal but not overly saturated scenes inside Joel's head as things, including Clementine, literally vanish around him. It is at that point when he doesn't want to go through with the procedure anymore. For him, it was better that he loved and suffered, rather than to not have loved at all."
RaccoonFella,"Jan 5, 2023",N/A,"This is without a doubt one of the most eccentric and weird films ever released - there is nothing quite like it. Without spoiling anything, the premise of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is fascinating and totally unique, exploring themes of fate and morality with an unforgettable tale of the mind.The visual representations of memory are beautifully presented and are in perfect harmony with the story, many of these scenes are engraved into my head because they are just so powerful. There are so many unconventional choices that this movie makes and it pays off so well every single time - several fantastic transitions and pieces of symbolism come to mind. It's well cast, with everybody really giving it their all; our two main characters played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are thoroughly entertaining and very well written. The tone is well balanced, managing to maintain the serious themes whilst intertwining elements of comedy and light-hearted romance. Perhaps an overlooked addition, the musical score is wonderfully unique and adds so much to the experience. Additionally, Charlie Kaufman's script is brilliant, layered with subtlety and things that you pick up on if you give it a second watch. It's a beautiful, surreal jumble of a film packed with emotion, drama, and romance, and deserves all the love and praise it gets.You really feel the emotion, and it's thanks to everyone involved in this bizarre production who gave it their all and created something that I would call a masterpiece. There is so much I want to say about this movie, but what I'm really trying to get across here is that you should definitely give this one a watch. 10/10."
mithilbhoras-103-581296,"Jun 14, 2012",10/10,"""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."" - Alexander PopeJoel and Clementine, once a happy couple, break-up. Joel can't take Clementine out of his head so he decides to patch up. He then learns an unbelievable truth that she had a clinic named Lacuna ""erase"" all of her memories related to Joel. Joel too out of anger decides to take on the procedure of erasing Clementine-memories from his head.Okay, I know what some may think. This is totally weird, right? But with Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, the screenwriters, weird stories always become entertaining that has undeniably smart elements. Eternal Sunshine remains their best work to date. It's an unforgettable psychological journey in a person's brain, his dreams, his desires captured with such contrast and vivid beauty that you will be left asking for more. At first, we feel quite envious of the technology that literally removes ""pain"" from our minds. The direction and screenplay capture this magnificently by taking us in Joel's head and actually showing us in their way how it happens. But soon this desire dies out with a deep emotion of dissatisfaction. Because Joel watches these memories fade away, he gets a second chance to relive them. He then understands that memories, however painful, are vital. I really wanted this erasing thing to exist in real life at first but then the film's extremely strong presentation made me change my mind. This impressive part makes the whole non-linear experience unexpected, thought-provoking and excites us to a higher level of curiosity.Once Eternal Sunshine grips us through it's smart allegory, it keeps getting better and better. What I loved most was the unexpected conclusion that forces us to wonder about the fate of the characters. What I loved more is that the film also never forgets the supporting cast, especially the ""erasers"" who work at Lacuna. During the erasing scene, which is the highlight of the entire film, the film kind of switches back and forth from Joel's memories to the real world. They show us the interaction of the Lacuna gang (Elijah Wood, Kirstin Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson). As we surge through Joel's emotions, theirs too is not overlooked. The screenplay smartly shows us how we human beings feel emotions, how we look at the person who's memory we are erasing and the person who's having it erased. In Short, Eternal Sunshine has a weird but differently smart screenplay that works which also won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 2005. The Direction has a wonderful ""flow"" in it. The Cinematography has a beautiful colorful saturation and the score, wow, it just syncs with the flow. The film has impressive visual effects too that adds to the stunning imagery of Joel's memories.Now, the acting. First of all, I have never seen Jim Carrey act a serious character before. Joel is boring, dull, seeks solitude. I still wonder how he did that. This proves that Jim Carrey is more of a versatile actor rather than a comedian. Kate Winslet portrays the energetic, over-talkative Clementine, a complete opposite of Joel. She was nominated for the Oscar for this role and it's quite worth it. The most difficult part is bringing two completely opposites together to love each other which is pulled off perfectly by the two artists. Then comes the Lacuna gang. Wow, another surprise here. Their acting was realistic, if simply put.In conclusion, Eternal Sunshine is a spotless masterpiece. It's that piece of cinema that tries to approach film-making from a whole new perspective and the result is memorable. The film convinced me of the moral fact that even if you put someone out of your memory, you can't put them out of your heart.

spackard,"Jan 12, 2009",6/10,"I usually only review movies that just came out but I just saw this film last night and it struck me in an odd way so I decided to review it. One of my judges of a good movie that you find yourself thinking about the film several days after seeing it, I saw this film like 8 hours ago and I'm convinced I won't get it out of my head for the rest of the week. In fact this movie had such a weird profound effect on me I took a walk after seeing it just to get it clear in my head, and you know what consolation I came to while walking, this film is not as good as it's first impression's make it seem.Oh don't get me wrong Eternal Sunrise is a good film, by many standards, but it pulls of the cleaver trick of being so weird that you automatically assume it's amazingly good. Vanilla Sky pulled the same trick, but I saw it for the piece of crap it was. This film is better than Vanilla Sky, but not better than say 12 Monkeys.After my mind swam through the weirdness I came to some realizations about this film. One is that it is a Romance; I know Wikipedia says it's a Science Fiction Neo-Surrealist, but it's a Romance. And my main judge for a good romance is, do you fall in love with the girl as much as the main character does? And for this film the answer to this is a resounding no. I know all guys are into different ""Types"" of girls but there are some qualities in women that most men like and incorporating those into one ""ultimate girl package"" is in many ways the job of Romances (innless you're a girl reading this then it's the ""ultimate guy package""). One of the reasons why I liked Yes Man so much was because Zooey Deschanel's character pulled this off so well, hell I still have a crush on her after seeing that movie. But you have to be delicate about this, if you try too hard to create ""Mega Girlfriend"" then the audience realizes what you're up to and the allusion is broken. This happened in There's Something About Mary, I really couldn't stand that film because Mary was so unrealistically appealing that I felt like meting Gandalf the Gray was more likely than meting her.Anyway the Point I am getting at here is that Kate Winslet's character has the right idea, as far as being universally appealing, but takes it too far. Thought there are many different kinds of ""Mega Girls"" one of the most popular forms is the ""Lively Spontaneous Girl"" and this is clearly what the movie is shooting for with Kate Winslet. But instead of being lively and spontaneous in a cute fun way, she overdoes it and comes off more like one of those weird smelly girls who works at Spencer's Gifts. OK I'll admit maybe the guy writing this film was going for that, but I doubt it. In fact most of the characters in this film aren't very likable, and beyond that they're almost impossible to identify with. Jim Carey is supposed to be shy and aloof, but to me he comes off more as needy and cowardly. The only real character I liked was one of the films apparent Antagonists, who I would give more info about if it didn't mean risking spoilers.But despite this flaw Eternal Sunrise is a movie worth seeing if only for the experience of it. Though the characters suck the actors playing them do a good job, unlike a lot of weird films it does a pretty good job of explaining itself to the audience, and if you can manage to understand the ending (which is hard) it's an extremely satisfying one. It's a good weird film just with some nasty looking smudges one it that I wanted to point out."
soranamicooper,"Sep 6, 2017",10/10,"What a story. Emotions in utter tumult after watching this. (What to do next? Well, I guess I'll finish the review. But why? What's the point?) It has a sci-fi premise that would ordinarily put me off but the whirling story never veers off its hub of exploring love. And anyway, the SF treatment is administered by Tom Wilkinson, who never disappoints. Speaking of actors, the ever brilliant Kate Winslet is at the top of her game here. It's so easy to go over the top when you're playing the crazy one and just take us into zany land and leave reality behind, but the story demands that she keeps it more real and she exercises such exquisite control. I wonder how Jim Carrey would have played that role! Don't get me wrong, he's fantastic too here as the more down-to-earth one - probably his best performance that I've seen and a clever bit of casting. Wait, I've got an odd feeling in my gut. Oh, dear! I think I need to go and run in a big open field for a bit. I might be back, ."

dashasamsa,"Jan 19, 2022",10/10,"A little sad, very touching and incredibly charming film. I find the parallels between these films more than apt, as both films are very similar both in their overall story development and in their portrayal of the power of love between a man and a woman on screen, they choose the same target as the Object. Influences are the heart of the viewer.I was pleasantly surprised by his playing with Jim Carrey, whom I had never taken seriously before. Kate Winslet very organically fit into the image of her heroine - the complete opposite of the hero of Jim Carrey, a reckless and emotionally unrestrained girl who, depending on the mood of everyday life, dyes her hair on her head. When two polar people find each other, love arises between them, and then neither the contradictions of characters, nor the new advanced scientific method of erasing memories from memory, which will eventually prove completely untenable, can interfere with their feelings. .
Visually, the picture is perceived very easily, and I think it will appeal to even those who are not particularly fond of films about love."
pauldewaal-32675,"May 6, 2022",10/10,"I really enjoyed this thought provoking film, which was really well acted and directed. Without revealing the plot, I found the film fast moving and was perfectly cast. This films proves that both lead Actors can turn their hand to very different roles to their previous films. Also the supporting cast has been well selected and all provide an extra level to the film. A must see."

tylerkom,"Jan 16, 2023",8/10,"For me there is always some great comfort in the grainy technically terrible looking films from the early and mid 2000's. Maybe it's the nostalgia, or maybe it's the joy of seeing now beloved actors working in their prime. But with this comfort comes the paired bracing for a bad film that needs the seasoning of nostalgia to be palatable. And for the beginning of Eternal Sunshine, this looked to be the case. The frantic and chopped up cinematography with a sickly sweet love story looked like the appetizer for some 2000's romcom mediocrity. Imagine surprise then when this turned into an Inception-before-inception trip packaged in a romantic drama.The acting from the two leads, Jim Carry and Kate Winslet are absolutely top notch. Believable, frantic, frustratingly real with their own stubbornness and idiosyncrasies. Simply great. And let me give credit as well for the thematics of the entire film. It is happy and hopeful yet tinged with a desperation in the passage of time and of decisions regretted. Moreover, the technical side of the film has aged surprisingly very well. The CGI special effects are used tastefully and sparingly and is possibly going to age even better than its 2010's pseudo analog in Inception. The scenes that probably never looked good were the ones that played with size and perspective; it was a fun try but ultimately not all that successful. Kaufman and Gondry make the non-linear storytelling a breeze to ride for the audience and should be applauded for their edits to the original schizophrenia of the original script. I also did not realize Mark Ruffalo was in this film until he took off his glasses which gave me a great laugh.There is not all that much to complain about with the film. I suppose there is some level of deus ex machina in the ending but with suspended belief, we can accept some of it. I think that perhaps one of the solutions that the main characters try seems more plausible, but I digress.I really wonder coming out of the film whether the writers knew they had a gem on their hands as opposed to a decent fun holiday(ish?) film. It certainly is only a few decisions from turning from Oscar-bait into a Hallmark film. Fortunately for us, we got the good ending."
vizli,"Jul 29, 2006",1/10,"It appears that Charlie Kaufman is a one trick pony. While he poses an intriguing concept, he does nothing of value with it. For some reason, the ""ardent"" movie denizens who frequent this site were mesmerized by this stunt, much in the same way that they uniformly loved the sequence stunt employed in ""Mememto"".Please. Can some screenwriter take an interesting concept and then actually develop it into something worth watching. Instead of developing a story, Kaufman simply plays mind games by distracting his audience with disjointed scenes that make little sense. And this is called genius? A complex story can be quite enjoyable if the screenwriter actually takes the time to make a coherent story with a plausible ending such as in ""The Usual Suspects"".Sorry, before one bows at the feet of any filmmaker, you should demand more than a clever proposition. Otherwise, ""The Butterfly Effect"" should have won an Oscar."

jdoan-4,"Aug 8, 2010",9/10,"Charlie Kaufman writes movies with uniquely bizarre premises and utterly human themes. In Being John Malkovich, he deals with identity, aspirations, and the hard reality of existence. Adaptation is about the creative struggle and the need to adapt and evolve with the circumstances. In Synecdoche, New York he presents us with a stylized look at our perception of life and other people. In Eternal Sunshine he searches through the meaning of love and memory. All of these descriptions are trite, insufficient, and probably inaccurate. They are, however, what I recall learning from and seeing in the films.I just re-viewed Eternal Sunshine. I think it is his best script, and one of the best scripts of the 00′s. In all his films, Kaufman is able to create a bizarre world filled with eccentric characters that are surprisingly like each of us. I have not had to deal with the rise and fall of a relationship like Joel and Clementine do in the movie. I have had to deal with the peaks and valleys of ones. I can most certainly understand the place memory holds in our value system.I recently saw a lecture on the meaning of happiness. The speaker noted that there are two main types of happiness: that which comes from experiencing and that which comes from remembering. This movie very effectively illustrates that there is a disconnect between the two. The lecturer noted that people who moved from Ohio to California would say that they are happier. They aren't. They remember the hard winters and are comparing their present experience to their memories. We tend to filter our memories to extremes, either very good or very bad. We tend to not place emphasis on the middle.One of the many problems with Joel and Clementine in the movie is that they place more emphasis on present experience rather than memory. In the end, Joel comes to realize the importance of memory, and its supremacy to the present. Even though he knows his relationship with Clementine will probably fail, he is will to move ahead, if only for the pleasant memories of pleasant times.The themes of this movie are similar to the themes of Dark City, another very good movie. The two might make an interesting double-feature, even though the forms of the movies are very different."
LLAAA4837,"Jan 25, 2009",N/A,"'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a film full of unique ideas, characters, situations, and philosophy. It is one of the most alive films I've ever seen. It's a film so full of life and love and graceful quality. It is a film that is as ripe and as fresh as any of the best romantic comedies. It is, at times, incredibly funny. At other times, it's just simply heartbreaking. It doesn't matter if you've been in love or not, because you will get something personal out of this movie.The film basically is about the human desire to want to erase unpleasant memories. In the case of this film, it is Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) who wants to annihilate the horrible memories of his ex-girlfriend, Clemintine(Kate Winslet). The film takes this premise to it's highest potential by placing the viewer in the mind of Joel as his memories are being wiped out. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play their parts as perfectly as any on-screen couple has. While most of their scenes together are harrowing and unpleasant, they are full of truth and clarity. Jim Carrey has that subtle pacing of how to react to things in a nondiscriminatory way while Kate Winslet comes across as more authentic and blunt as she can be without going over-the-top. They both do fantastic.The bulk of the film takes place in Joel's mind, as a matter-of-fact, and while this premise may sound like it is stretching credibility it still manages to achieve that rare feeling of nostalgia, chance, and hopefulness that we all have in our lives. The idea of losing these sorts of memories is a terrifying idea, but Michel Gondry, the director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, knows this and has strategically added a serious flaw in the film, not to make the film weaker, but to make the film funnier. Enter Patrick, Mary, and Stan, three people whose job it is to do the mind erasing. Throughout the course of the film, the character of Joel repeatedly regrets going through with the procedure and tries to escape the brainwashing. This causes these three people who are working on him to encounter technical problems with their equipment and even causes Joel to enter into a waking life state in which he is wide awake but his brain is completely asleep while his mind is being fried.The problem with this is that it is only natural for someone to regret this sort of procedure while it's happening, so these three people should be used to doing this. Michel Gondry knows this and he knows that the audience knows this because he adds in a level of self-parody on top of all the mayhem. This is such a risky think for a director to try and pull off. Add to that the fact that the film is in non-chronological order, the character choice of Clementine getting her brain erased first, and a borderline manic subplot involving a secret love affair between two of the doctors and a love affair with of the doctors and Clementine and you have yourself a very complicated sounding film.If you haven't seen the film yet, what I am telling you will go right over your head. Trust me when I say that this film is a lot easier to swallow than I'm making it sound. All of these elements are developed and played out very carefully and delicately, but not to the point where any of it becomes second nature. This is a real work of art. It is Michel Gondry's masterpiece, no question. The screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, as usual, is beautiful in it's simplicity. Michel Gondry really brought it to life though, and that is something of a miracle. Michel Gondry has the mind of a child. He's so full of life and love and his mind is so open to infinite possibilities. He has taken all of that, and, with the writing of Charlie Kaufman, crafted this beautiful and touching masterpiece of film-making, and I can't thank them enough for making it."

lewismusgrove88,"Feb 3, 2019",7/10,Finally saw this and I am not seeing how this could possibly get more than 7.0 rating at best. Love the cast but waaay overrated.
Rickting,"Nov 3, 2014",5/10,"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is one of the strangest romantic dramas you'll ever see. Jim Carry, hurt after his ex girlfriend had her memories of him removed, decides to do the same only to find he still loves her and it may be too late to correct his mistake. ESOTSM was a frustrating experience for me. This is full of beautifully acted scenes which are well directed and feel meaningful. Jim Carry has never been better and probably should have been nominated for an Oscar. Kate Winslet is completely superb. Those moments are strong and enjoyable and decently directed. That's what I want to see. I don't want to see what follows, which is a load of bizarre, surreal science fiction nonsense which is just confusing but that's what I get. I can enjoy beautifully acted scenes of drama or I can watch some nonsensical inside your head rubbish which hyper-actively zips from scene to scene like Twitchy the squirrel from Hoodwinked. I cannot do both at the same time.Easily one of the most overrated films of the 2000s, ESOTSM is an interesting film instead of a particularly good one. It's well acted, though Kirsten Dunst who is well regarded for some reason is pretty weak. The direction is OK and there is some very clever writing. Sadly, it's just a great big mess. As a result of the films insistence on surreal stupidity, it loses its message and its emotional impact. As Jim Carry races through his mind trying to avoid allowing his memories to be erased, 2 other characters are trying to find him on a computer. That is like me trying to keep up with the message of this movie. To be fair, it has some promising early scenes and there are various truths about love and heartache which feel genuine and important. Thankfully, the film doesn't veer into sentimental stupidity and isn't anyway near as unbearable as many other romantic dramas from the 2000s. There is definitely sunshine here, but it certainly isn't eternal. Everyone else seems to love this movie, so it seems I am alone in my opinion. It's well acted and written at times and I may give it another go. If I can even be bothered, which is doubtful.5/10"
Pausable,"May 2, 2020",10/10,This is genuinely the best movie I have ever seen.
mcsheehey,"Jun 11, 2007",10/10,"""Eternal Sunshine"" is one of the rare films that actually overcomes its flaws completely and makes itself into a great film without dishing everything out to the audience. There's no real format to the film. It jumps from place to place, often confusing the viewer for a moment, but creating a unique and rewarding experience.The acting in the film is great across the board. Jim Carrey gives a very good, but not quite Oscar-caliber turn as Joel, a quiet writer whose dull nature destroys any true fun in his relationships. Kate Winslet plays Clementine, an impulsive and energetic woman whose hair color is constantly changing as her relationship with Joel does. Winslet is really the shining star in the film. She is beautiful, vibrant, and full of life, bringing an edge to the film. It's truly a shame she wasn't put in the Supporting Actress section of the Oscars, where she could have had a win. Elijah Wood is annoying as usual, but he's playing an annoying character so it's passable. Tom Wilkinson is very good as the doctor behind the whole experiment that is the basis of the film, and Kirsten Dunst is surprisingly fantastic in a small role as the doctor's secretary. The plot itself is fantastic, truly delving into the mind and memories of Joel. Carrey is a little over the top at times, but he still moves through the film well with help from the leading lady. This is an extraordinary, Oscar-nomination worthy film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a smart film that is also funny and dramatic at times."
thatcar,"Jun 13, 2007",10/10,"Although packaged in fictional science and a pretzel logic plot, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is actually one of the deepest and most honest explorations of the risk, passion, irrationality and fragility of human relationships. Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) are both mismatched and perfect for each other. We feel the true attraction of Joel and Clementine, while also seeing how they trip each other up. These contrary elements can be found in most real-world relationships, but are seldom portrayed with such truth and reality as in this movie. Usually in movies the tension between the attraction of partners and the flaws that repel them is treated as a stock motivation for the characters. In Eternal Sunshine, these features are deeply explored by the characters and revealed to us in ways that more conventional movies cannot approach.This raw truth in the movie is created in equal parts by the performances of Carrey and Winslet and by the unusual technological challenge to their relationship and the looping and reversing narrative that results. Every moment that Joel and Clementine are together the electricity flows between them--both positive and negative. This movie is a high water mark for screen chemistry between actors, and all of the chemistry fills in the full and passionate relationship of the characters. Forget about the twisting plot and the memory-erasing technology; the relationship, chemistry and performances of Carrey and Winslet alone would make this a great movie.Nevertheless, the fictional technology at the core of Eternal sunshine allowed Joel and Clementine to make choices that we in the real world cannot; and the consequences for Joel and Clementine only serve to intensify and deepen the revelation of their characters and relationship to themselves and to the movie audience. It is the kind of technology that could have been a gimmick or a distraction, but instead was used by Charlie Kaufman (screenplay) and Michael Gondry (director) to explore what makes a relationship tick. Yes, the world of this movie is completely strange and the narrative structure is fragmented and looping. But the relationship between Joel and Clementine always remains central and every odd situation and every twist back illuminates the characters. The ""trickiness"" of the screenplay is never used just to be clever or throw the audience off.The strange and fictional science of Eternal Sunshine takes Joel, Clementine and us to places we have never gone in movies or in real life, but every aspect of Joel and Clementine as persons in a relationship are completely real and fully realized. One of the greatest relationship movies ever."
nurgalini,"May 21, 2023",10/10,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a cinematic masterpiece, deftly exploring the complexities of love and memory. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give exceptional performances, breathing life into Kaufman's brilliantly unconventional script. The genius of Gondry's direction is palpable in every frame, each scene imbued with poignancy and resonance. Its non-linear narrative demands engagement, weaving a tale that's both deeply personal and universally relatable. The visual effects serve as sublime metaphors for the fragility and transience of memories. Combined with a haunting soundtrack, this film is a profoundly moving, emotionally nuanced exploration of human connection. A tour de force and my absolute favourite."

It's a BAD movie full of people you don't like and don't care about.Mr. Carrey's character seems to be seriously over-medicated (Paxil, Thorazine, etc.), he has no personality! (Nicholas Cage must have turned the part down.) The false timeline (the beginning of the film is really the end of the film)is a poor story devise.  The inconsistencies show up quickly, but aren't explained until the end of the movie.Finally, although the science is very sketchy, the memory-erasing technology is the ultimate form of deus ex machina.  I only wish I could erase the memory of this total waste of my time."
justahunch-70549,"Nov 10, 2024",8/10,"For starters, I've never seen Jim Carrey give a more appealing performance. I so wish he had done more serious stuff. Between this, The Truman Show and Man On the Moon the Academy of Arts & Sciences have made clear they are not all that interested n him, which is a shame. He's great. Kate Winslet is at her loosest, Mark Ruffalo is fun in an early role and Kirstin Dunst shows all sorts of promise along with Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood. This is a dream cast in a film about a couple in love having their memories erased, regretting it and trying to stop it. The direction by Michael Gondry is extremely inventive, the Oscar winning writing oh so original and the production design is wonderful. Is this a great film? No, but it is one of the more original, imaginative and unusual films you will ever see. And I've said all of this without mentioning the key ingredient, Charlie Kaufman with his bizarre imagination."
gbill-74877,"Nov 8, 2021",10/10,"Sometimes breaking up is so painful that you wish you could just sear the memories of the other person out of your mind, to be done with them forever, irrevocably. Tenderness has turned to bitterness, almost as if they were another person entirely, when of course, you've been finding out more about one another, things have happened, and change is inevitable. To remove the memories of them entirely, as if you had never met them in the first place, might take away the pain, but it would also remove the things that make life worth living, the moments of genuine connection, the unbelievable rush of falling in love. Instead, if only you could hold on to the sweet memories forever, or to talk to the person at those critical moments in time but now with the benefit of perspective, and be more forgiving.This is such a powerful film, touching as it does on the emotions of the heart. The technology imagined by Charlie Kaufman is such a cool concept, and the way it's filmed by Michel Gondry is pitch perfect to the swirl of memories that make up what we think about, what we remember, about our life and the people in it. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are also perfect in this, and Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst give fine performances in their supporting roles (I also really liked how Dunst's character played out). The immature behavior of those performing the procedure is a fantastic contrast to how advanced the technology is, and isn't this often the way? All of these characters are deeply flawed, but there is such sweetness in the love story that it just hits me in the gut every time. The film is a magical blend of romance and science-fiction, artistically rendered, and simply brilliant.The verse from Alexander Pope from which the title derives, and its backstory, the secret love and marriage of Héloïse d'Argenteuil to Peter Abélard, her teacher, fits the film beautifully too:How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!The world forgetting, by the world forgot.Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."
zakharuu,"Sep 17, 2023",10/10,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, directed by Michel Gondry.An artwork that will make you think about your memories and whether it's worth getting rid of them to start a new life.The film Eternal Sunshine of the Pure Mind shows the love relationship of two people Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine(Kate Winslet). There comes a time for every couple when everything goes downhill and the problem is difficult to solve. The main character chooses the easy way to simply erase the memories of her beloved. The plot describes all the torments of Joel whether he will be able to return everything as it was , we have to find out.It would seem that we know Jim Carrey only by his roles in comedies, but here he appears before us in the role of a sad hero who does not understand what he did wrong. The film uses high-tech technology, which is atypical for such films. The plot twists are simply at the highest level and break all the cliches and patterns that we know. The cast is just perfectly matched. The actors play their roles 100% and it seems that they really feel the same as their characters. It also helps to convey the emotional state and the weather with its help, you plunge headlong into the film. But still there is one disadvantage - the complexity of the plot after the first viewing, there are many questions that the viewer can get answers to on the forums or when watching the movie again.In general, the film contains everything that an ideal drama should have. Friendship, hatred, contempt, fitting and well-being. I recommend watching this movie in order to fully immerse yourself in a story that goes on for only an hour and a half, does not convey such a palette and spectrum of emotions that it seems that you have experienced all the problems together with the main characters. What are you waiting for, start viewing soon."

vonnoosh,"Dec 23, 2020",N/A,"I suppose the 2000s was the decade of polarizing movies. The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, About Schmidt, Requiem for a Dream and this movie. Either these movies are loved or hated. Rarely are the opinions luckwarm. I was one that loved this because it was a uniquely different romantic comedy. A genre I do not enjoy. I was also not a fan of Charlie Kaufman's earlier story, Being John Malkovic. That failed for me in alot of major ways compared to this movie though it takes the same different approach. Felt the ending was flat in that.This is basically a romantic comedy with splashes of drama and sci fi thrown into the mix. Not too much of those elements get mixed in to change it from what it is. I suppose people have to relate to the characters desires early on to understand the plot enough in order to enjoy the movie. Ive known people who are perfectly happy trying to drag a friendship out of doomed relationship even if what they drag out is something like those creatures in Cronenberg's The Brood. I prefer to break clean and permanently and prefer to date someone who relates to that. Its less complicated to move on.Story does get a little corny at times and perhaps thats where my dislike for romantic comedies kicks in. As I said, not my cup of tea but this is unique enough to be entertaining despite that."
mo700,"May 26, 2004",7/10,"wow. *no spoilers* this film was good but also difficult to face at times.it started off slightly disjointed but after a while you understand why and begin to really appreciate the way it works.I like art house films, but this seems to go further than i expected. -not in a bad way, or good. the concept of erasing an ex lover (and all memories of them) might be appealing to some people and the way its made lets you relate to the whole story, you relate to the pain of breaking up too (if you've been there especially!)it was distressing at times because of all the emotions that are thrown at you, but overall it works well. it had left me feeling a little cold, but appreciating the story."
arkos4440,"Jan 31, 2012",10/10,"I've always found this movie fascinating for a number of reasons, but it's only been recently that I've discovered just what it is that draws me into this crazy story. I think what sold me on this film is the way it straddles and selects themes from many different genres. Overall it seems mostly to be a romantic comedy of sorts, though even this could probably be debated. But while mostly centering on romance with a comedic touch the movie seems to carry a strong message, which it conveys with events that seem to resemble psychological thrillers and maybe even sci-fi at a stretch.Because it uses so many elements of so many genres it is an interesting movie to look at from an analytical standpoint. It brings together many motifs to tell a compelling story that draws upon an entire range of emotions, making it very engaging to watch. Overall I really enjoyed it."
sol-,"Jan 13, 2005",7/10,"An interesting but far too complex film, which although full of many good ideas, does not execute them well. The subject matter would best befit a short science fiction story, and indeed the content of the film is so slim that it quite noticeably outstays its welcome. Like most short stories, the film would have best been told from a first person point of view only. The film threads in the story of the operators, just not just the operated too, however. This causes the film to become distracted from the more interesting part of the tale, and as a result, it is at times quite bland. It is not that the viewer does not understand  there is just no reason to care. All that said and done, the film certainly has interesting elements, and it will keep one watching for at least three quarters of its duration. It is not really a poor film; it is above average, but I feel it could have been done a lot better."

PierrotB-4,"May 30, 2025",9/10,"Jim Carrey gives the performance of his career - quiet, wounded, deeply internal - and Kate Winslet as Clementine is electric, chaotic, and unforgettable. Together, they form one of the most honest portrayals of a relationship: not perfect, but deeply felt. The kind you remember even if it hurts.The film's visual language is inventive and haunting - fading memories, collapsing spaces, disappearing faces - all reflecting how fragile our inner worlds really are. Jon Brion's score only deepens the ache, wrapping the film in a kind of gentle melancholy.So why not 10 stars? At times, the emotional detachment of Kaufman's writing can put a layer of glass between the viewer and the characters. The film is cerebral by nature, and some of its most powerful moments feel just slightly out of reach. But maybe that's the point - some memories, like some feelings, were never meant to be fully grasped.Still, Eternal Sunshine is a poetic, deeply affecting reminder that love is messy, memory is unreliable, and the pain of connection is worth the risk - even if we'd rather forget."
fnpatino,"Aug 11, 2022",9/10,"I think we have all thought of the idea of erase certain memories in our life...i found this movie really touching and the performances by Carrey and Winslet were superb, astonishing. The soundtrack was ok I guess but overall is a great movie you won't lose your time."
grozdanoww,"Aug 27, 2023",10/10,"The performances in this film are exceptional. Jim Carrey delivers a remarkable departure from his usual comedic roles, showcasing his dramatic range and vulnerability as Joel. Kate Winslet brings depth and complexity to the character of Clementine, portraying her as both impulsive and deeply wounded.The visual style of the film is also noteworthy. Michel Gondry's imaginative direction, combined with stunning cinematography, creates a dreamlike atmosphere that perfectly complements the film's themes of love and loss. The use of practical effects and creative set designs adds a whimsical touch to the storytelling.Overall, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a beautifully crafted film that challenges our perceptions of love and memory. It explores the idea that even the most painful experiences can shape us and that erasing them may not be the solution. This movie is a must-watch for those who appreciate thought-provoking storytelling, exceptional performances, and a touch of surrealism."
davispittman,"Mar 20, 2018",9/10,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is one of the best films I've ever seen. The plot revolves around Clementine (Kate Winslet) and Joel (Jim Carrey). They play a couple who's relationship has crumbled.Clementine ends up going to a doctor who specializes in this procedure that erases memories you would like to forget, and she erases all memory of Joel. After Joel finds out that she has done this, he also decides to have the procedure done. During the procedure, he starts to change his mind and doesn't want to let go of certain memories of her.This film features incredible performances by every single cast member. Kate Winslet in particular gives a remarkable performance, very deserving of that Academy Award nomination. And Jim Carrey is also great here, this is probably my favorite film of his filmography. If anyone thinks Carrey is only capable of doing comedy, then I'd suggest they watch this one, because he nails it. Kirsten Dunst gives a skilled supporting performance, as does Ruffalo, Wilkinson, and Wood.The writing is so well done and balanced. The dialogue between Clementine and Joel is very revealing and written in a beautiful way. When you cast great artists such as the two leads and give them writing like this, it's just bound to be a hit.I for sure suggest this wonderful film! 9/10."
xogamise,"Jul 28, 2024",8/10,"The film tells the story of Joel and Clementine, a couple who undergo a revolutionary procedure to erase each other from their memories after a painful breakup. But it turns out that it's not so easy to remain yourself after losing someone who shaped your soul.The comedy actor Jim Carrey delivers a surprisingly nuanced performance as Joel, diving deep into the complexities of heartbreak and vulnerability. His chemistry with Winslet, filled with both tenderness and turmoil, is the heart of the film, making their journey through fragmented memories both poignant and profoundly relatable.A classic for its thought-provoking narrative and emotional depth, this film lingers in the mind long after viewing, reminding us that our experiences, both joyful and sorrowful, shape who we are. It is a must-watch for anyone who has ever loved and lost. Or just for those who love good movies!"
Vincentiu,"Nov 2, 2007",N/A,"A fight against fear, love and shadows. Story of a special desire and ordinary traps. Grey images and gestures in a cold world, after a small miracle.It is the best character of Jim Carrey. The tension, the bones of dream, the colors of Utopian search, the figure of another Orpheus and the final victory are pieces of every man universe, with insignificant elation, angst or desire of self- destruction. The past is the same of every person, as temptation to create another place, time and gestures like pieces of memory. It is a subtle poem about sacrifice and error. Story of an old myth with another words, with same nuances. Story about games, looks and labyrinths, about desire and sense of existence, about lies and trust. About the selfishness and about repentance. About new day and its warmth."
interestingstuff,"Dec 1, 2024",7/10,How is this movie rated 8.3? Is this some sort of a sick joke or something? I guess we really do live in the post-truth society where facts don't matter anymore. While we are at it we might as well start giving Oscar awards to Youtube videos.There is no possible universe where this movie is worth 8.3 or even a 7 or 6. This is one of the most overrated movies I've ever watched. I had to force myself to finish it and even fastforwarded most of it.There is no cohesion in the plot and no lesson to be learned. No point and no character development. If you watch it as a comedy it's not funny either. There are no redeeming qualities about this movie other than Jim Carrey's acting.
mooyman,"May 15, 2005",7/10,"While I enjoyed this movie very much at first, in the end it was a bit disappointing. Like in a detective novel, the plot is hugely important in this film. And while the acting and camera-work are really outstanding IMHO, the plot just isn't up to par; when 2/3's of the movie was over the plot was completely clear to me and the final 1/3 of the movie played out exactly as I figured it would. In my opinion the producers of this film underestimated the intelligence of their audience, thereby making this film less interesting than it could have been. Nevertheless, this film really IS worth your while, because of the originality and irony of the story."
paulclaassen,"Jul 3, 2018",5/10,"Although uniquely different and praised by critics, I did not enjoy this film. Instead I found it very negative. I can only praise the acting and visual effects. Nothing else."
Silvi-blue,"Sep 20, 2013",10/10,"First of all, I'd say that you should have been in love and lost it to understand this movie perfectly and feel it for real.This movie is not a cheap romance. This is deep. It's about real love. About the love that finds itself even without you noticing it or knowing about it. About love that knows no anger or ending. About love that even after the last goodbye, says 'I love you'.Also the acting is perfect. You can really feel the love, and pain, and everything in their eyes. Not to mention that the whole cast is just amazing.This movie is pure love."
theyottaboy,"Jun 27, 2022",9/10,"I cannot get over how beautiful this film is, and I mean beautiful in every depth and angle. I think one has to see it more than once to fully appreciate (and potentially love) it. I always discover something new each time I watch Eternal Sunshine, and the 'moving' factor never falters. It's immensely moving in the way it depicts consciousness as a constant negotiation of pain and pleasure; the gradual slippage of memory removes essential parts of our personality. The script and visuals are particularly genius. This movie has been my constant favorite since my younger years, and most people I know misinterpret it. It's not about undying love; it's about remembering things even when it hurts. Because even love that fails is better than never having loved at all. That's real. Eternal love is usually a fantasy, but doomed love, love that's just good enough for now, that's real."

evandewangga97,"Dec 28, 2014",9/10,"What's teenage movie about? Yes, it's always about love, break-up, love again, and friendship. Seems boring, but love itself is endless. Let me give the border for ""love"" in this review. It's not about love that I usually write in my other review. Just love from man and woman for her/his couple. As simple as that, the way modern teenage know it too well. Contemporary love we can call it, and contemporary movies we often watched it about this kind of love. So, what's so special about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)? It is the unusual but still romantic idea about love. A science-fiction indeed, not about alien, computer, future, but simply about the way to move one from a man or woman. Ordinary teenage problem, and how this era help teenage to do it. Of course, it has been one decade since it was first released. And technology looks so different even just past 10 years. So, let us just focus on 2004, only cell-phone, and so few of social media. I think the more modern humans are, the harder they will move on, especially for young generation. It's interesting-subject for new-born era of the new-born century.First, let's dig about the very content of this movie. A stressful young man indeed who want to move on. Simple, humble, but there is something more. The fictional way to get it, that's the brilliant idea. I don't want to spoil about how or why, I just want to highlight the point of this teenage problem. Teens always want to be practical, instant, fast, by ignoring the way, and just focus on the results. They don't care how it would happen and the consequences, they just keep blaming, crying, and sad. Yes, it's a part of adolescence though. People gets wiser with it. And the point is the whole young- generation meets high-technology, although it's only fiction, but it's a picture of reality. Again, they don't really know the effect, they even don't really know what they really want. I mean it could be crucial for the next upcoming age, especially for our young-generation. The technology is done carefully, but the usage is not appropriate. I mean it could be no ethics at all in the next information era, when young people can do whatever they want instantly. But, that's the disastrous effect one. That's my thought, a mini-message of this movie, I recommend you to watch it to know what I really mean of those impacts.Go to the story, I adore, what a lovely story. Yes, with some feature of smooth visual-effects, I just can get the whole movie seamlessly. It's not complicated, added with twist, and full of sweet scene. However, what I really love is the touch of surrealism. A movie about dream must be surreal in my opinion. Let's accumulate all those stories of contemporary love, with the science-fiction- seasoning, great acting and cinematography, in the table of surrealism, and what a luscious piece do you really get. I give it nine out of ten, because of its genius and understandable, and it points toward the youth. Very educative, great motion picture of affection."
Jimmy_JimJim,"May 24, 2021",8/10,This film will resonate with everyone who has had a romantic experience. Excellent!
RollinAction,"May 17, 2021",10/10,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind once again proved that Jim Carrey is one of the greatest and most versatile actors in cinema history. The plot is refreshing and well executed, as well as the ending, which doesn't fall into the cliche of most love stories during the 2000s , and the score, omg the score, is just...sparkly. Easily one of the best romantic/sci-fi movies of all time."
debashish-89934,"Dec 12, 2020",N/A,The dream sequence and the conversation is so lovely that it makes the movie very re watchable. Shows both sides of coin and why love is so easy and difficult at the same time. Very deep philosophical movie. Must watch.
jamiehavill,"Oct 17, 2006",7/10,"I decided to finally bite the bullet and watch this film after many a recommendation from friends and colleagues. As I looked further I saw many familiar faces and institutions - Charlie Kaufman; screenplay writer for Adaptation (a nine out of ten for me), scriptwriter/composer of Being John Malkovich. Focus Films who were involved with a number of films I highly regard namely '21 Grams'.Charlie Kaufman presents, a film which promises to out do any of my expectations. It promises to take me by the hand and make me feel that anything is possible; reverse my psyche to a childlike state, and take me to a world of lost memories, undying love - a world where imagination overrules all. Let us dive in and see what all the fuss is about.I must say, approximately twenty four hours after pressing play, I keep having Freudian slips; my mind keeps re-living moments of the film, throwing them into my conscious for me to ponder, decipher. It is hard to pinpoint the magic of this film, as many aspects of it are somewhat flawed, yet it remains so, so beautiful. It leaves a feeling of contempt aimed at our ultimate creator; creating a being with so much feeling, and emotion, thrown into a nonsensical world and left to try to make sense of everything thrown there way. This is a quote which shall stay with me for some time:""Adults are a mess of sadness and phobias,"" Clementine.I feel that this film could greatly have benefited from being a short. It is a concept film, that should have been pondered more, been cut with more precision, and sucker punched the audience with it's a beauty. Instead we have a feature length film that whilst it retains its beautiful qualities, they only come in pieces, and not as a whole unit. This may be intentional, as the fragmented mind of our protagonist unearths, maybe this disjointed editing, and prolonged length is symbolic – I feel still, this film could have been so much more. Some of the set pieces are simply beautiful; the screenplay is, well, simply Kaufman – genius. The acting is SUBLIME. Kate Winslet simply blows the mind – not that I expected a bad performance. Her portrayal of a girl that will never fully commit herself, someone you can never truly know is inch perfect. You genuinely feel you never actually understand her character or what she wants, almost to the point of despair. Many a times in my life have I met people similar to this, and it is an identical melancholy feeling inside – it makes you question if you ever truly know a person, makes you feel useless.I fear I may be spoiling too much, too soon. A magnificent idea , executed well, but still – it could have been so, so much more."
avigailbaum,"Apr 30, 2022",10/10,This movie is one of my personal favourites. It has an incredibly sweet message and the acting is great!I am honestly struggling to think of anything to say about this one because it is just beyond words... it's just such a must....
alfiefamily,"Jan 22, 2005",6/10,"very good direction and good acting make this a very interesting film to watch.Kaufman proves once again that he has a brilliant mind for concept and vision.And he certainly comes up with interesting characters and plot devices. So why do I feel as though he's been a little too clever for his own good with this film. After viewing it, I find that I didn't really care for any of these people, or what happened to them, at all.I'm glad I saw it, but I still don't understand all of the hype about this film. I have a feeling that the same people who rave about this movie are the same ones who loved ""Lost In Translation"", and who think that Kevin Smith is a genius.Please.6 out of 10"
st-shot,"Mar 3, 2024",3/10,"Jim Carrey once again attempts to be taken serious as an actor along with Kate Winslet playing a Madonna manque in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Shapeless but with lots of tricks, writer Charles Kaufman's banal dialogue has to be rescued on cue by either a surreal happening or reversing course in jarring fashion. A romantic, science fiction hybrid, it fails miserably on both levels.Two misfits meet in Montauk one cold morning. Sad sack Joel (Carrey) and mercurial Clementine (Kate Winslet) somehow click and a romance begins. When besotted Joel visits her with gifts at the store she does not even recognize him. It turns out she's had a procedure to erase Joel from memory. Joel pained by the experience decides he wants to go through the same procedure under the guidance of a trio of irresponsible assistants.(Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood). In the interim the story confusingly switches from reality to Joel's haywire procedure allowing the director Michael Gondry to work on a variety of levels.Simpering and slovenly Carrey once again fails to register dramatically, his hang down demeanor and sheepish poor lugubrious me turn one extended self pity party of dealing with past, present and supernatural. Winslet is whimsically trying while Dunst, Ruffalo and Wood dimwit stooges spout insipid dialogue and act like 10 year olds.There's a handful of eye popping visuals but cinematographer Ellen Kuras lensing is pedestrian in moments, especially around lighting. Given the freedom of padding human emotion with sci-fi both writer and director make the most of these liberties but in doing so fail to tell a coherent, grounded story with this overall shallow and disheveled slight of hand film."
robelbiniyam,"Oct 16, 2021",10/10,"Most of the criticism I have been seeing about this movie is ""being boring"".the movie may seem a little messy in the first watch this was what I felt when I first watched it . Movies such like this should be watched at least a twice since in the first watch we can be confused and miss important points and probably the whole point of this movie.This from my personal experience I didn't love this movie my first watch but I didn't come to imdb go give a 1 and trash the movie I gave it a second watch and it was clear and I found the movie great , thought provoking,funny and entertaining .Please watch it repeatedly before you make up your mind."
hamzaarifshuja,"Oct 7, 2023",10/10,"When I first saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I wasn't expecting to love it, let alone like it. What a surprise when I saw it! I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful, and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don't mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.I especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography, which is indeed spellbinding, but also in the scenery, which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.I was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre, yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script, which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring, if at all, and the direction is adept.I have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's performances either. As good as the supporting performances are, especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films; The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy, and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.Overall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant, helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox."
