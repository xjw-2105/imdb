ccthemovieman-1,"Jul 15, 2007",9/10,"I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplin's nicest, most under-appreciated silent movie gems. Then I discovered it really wasn't underrated; it's rated very high on most critics' lists. It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this one.Part of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that I'm a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one. It's a romance between Charlie's tramp character (no name) and a blind girl, who also had no name in this film. Virginia Cherill, who played the blind woman and had a wholesome, pretty face which I found very attractive.I'm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton, but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as ""talkies"" were out in full force by 1931. Chaplin was at his best in silent movies, anyway, and his comedy routines are legendary. He gave me a lot of laughs in this film, as always, and I particularly laughed (I love slapstick) at the boxing scene. Kudos, too, to Harry Myers as the ""eccentric millionaire.""There's a lot of drama as well as humor in this 86-minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl, raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sight.Comedy, romance, drama (with suffering) all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment. It's hard to believe this movie was not up for one, single Academy Award."

Rokol,"Jan 13, 2005",9/10,City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there. Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of film-making. Chaplin's last 'silent' film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl. He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide. The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk. To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the man's wealth to make her fall in love with him. The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesn't recognize the tramp anymore. On top of this the flower girl has to pay 22 dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment. Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love. Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forth.The outcome of the movie is to almost all people known. It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film. The movie itself still is masterpiece more than 70 years after it's release. I personally rate this as Chaplin's second best I have seen so far. My favorite remains The Gold Rush. Still this movie gets 5/5 stars from me.
Quinoa1984,"Sep 12, 2004",10/10,"If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend, as others have pointed to in the past, City Lights is the one. Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies, like Modern Times and The Gold Rush, City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest, his bravest, his most romantic, and his most sympathetic. It's tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters, but it's pulled off.The film centers on three characters- the Tramp, the quintessential, funny homeless man who blends into the crowd, but gets caught in predicaments. He helps a drunken businessman (Myers, a fine performance in his own right) from suicide, and becomes his on and off again friend (that is, when it suits him and doesn't notice his 'friend's' state). The other person in the Tramp's life is the Blind Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill, one of the most absorbing, beautiful, and key female performances in silent film), who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception. The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money, which leads to a (how else can I put it) magical boxing match where it's basically a 180 from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull.Though there is no dialog, the film achieves a timelessness- it's essentially a tale of two loners who find each other, lose each other, and find each other again (the last scene, widely discussed by critics for decades, is moving if not tear-inducing). And it's never, ever boring- once you get along with the Tramp, you find the little things about him, the reaction shots, the little things he does after the usual big gag (look to the ballroom scene for examples of this, or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing). Truth be told, if this film makes you indifferent, never watch Chaplin again. But if you give yourself to the film, you may find it's one of the most charming from the era, or perhaps any era."
Thunderbuck,"Dec 6, 2004",N/A,"This is my favorite Chaplin film, but I don't want that to diminish his other work, either. MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire, THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick, and even the largely-neglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone. Chaplin didn't make a bad movie, and I'm not even sure that CL is his best, exactly. But it IS my favorite, if only for the ending.That ending has been the subject of much comment here. I think it's a masterpiece in a single scene. Chaplin's little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living, breathing human being. It's a monument to understated sentimentality.To me, the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid. Yes, the boxing scene is great, and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful, but it's that ending that makes us all love this movie."
Anonymous_Maxine,"Dec 22, 2000",10/10,"Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights, and the results are spectacular. The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights, and even though Charlie's performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes, the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant.City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked. Yes, you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene, but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really don't matter. Besides, let's keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago.Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp, and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk. His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious, but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol. This is truly a great film, which should not be forgotten."
lugonian,"Feb 15, 2003",10/10,"CITY LIGHTS (United Artists, 1931), written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin (1889- l977), is a silent comedy-drama released at the height of the sound era. Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad, Chaplin gambled with this production, and made it pay off. Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH (1925) as the one movie he would most want to be remembered, CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time, practically places his other silent masterpiece, THE CIRCUS (1928) to oblivion. CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time, balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama, but in Chaplin's case, pathos.Subtitled, ""A comedy romance in pantomime,"" the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city. After the unveiling, the crowd finds a little tramp (Charlie Chaplin) sleeping on the lap of one of the figures. As he tries to climb down, he encounters one problem after another. This opening scene alone is priceless. With such a great beginning, Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot. The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramp's love for a blind girl. However, there is a subplot, involving the tramp's involvement with a millionaire drunk, which, by far, takes up more time than the sentimental love story. These two segments actually set the pattern. First segment, set in the afternoon, finds Charlie walking down the street, examining a nude statue in a shop, being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing. He encounters a beautiful blonde girl (Virginia Cherrill) selling flowers. After she drops one of her flowers, Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it, thus, realizing she's blind. Smitten by her beauty, he picks it up and pays her for it. Minutes later, the slamming of a limousine door is heard, with the girl believing the kind gentleman, Charlie, to be a millionaire. Second segment, set at night, finds Charlie encountering a drunk (Harry Myers) trying to commit suicide by drowning himself. Just as Charlie is about to save him, he in turn falls into the river. The drunk, in gratitude for saving his life, takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn. By morning, the millionaire, now sober, fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion. This running gag that's repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious, but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges. By day, Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when she's not at her usual corner selling flowers. Finding that she's ill and being cared by her grandmother (Florence Lee), whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction, Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs, ranging from street-cleaning to fighting in a boxing match. Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind, Charlie gives the girl $1,000 for an operation, the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire, who, after sober, accuses Charlie of robbing him, has his arrested and serving jail time. The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missed.Featured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman, Allan Garcia, Albert Austin, and Hank Mann. While much has been discussed about Chaplin's performance, his co-star, Virginia Cherrill, as the blind girl (no name given), should not go without mention. Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers, and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor, Cary Grant, her performance is excellent by all means. Although it's been said that future film star Jean Harlow (1911-1937) appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence, she is visible in a surviving still photograph, but no such scene appears in the finished product.Unlike THE GOLD RUSH, CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years, and was never allowed to be distributed to television. Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York City's revival movie house, The Regency Theater, formerly located on Broadway and 67th Street, in 1979, the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience. There was one man, probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories, whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film. No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else. Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy, and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in 1931.After Chaplin's death in December of 1977, CITY LIGHTS, along with his other silent features, were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure, but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplin's 100th birthday, 1989. In later years, CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels, ranging from Turner Network Television (TNT) in the early 1990s, American Movie Classics up to 2001, and finally Turner Classic Movies. The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself.Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years. To learn more about the making, difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS, either watch Kevin Blownlow's 1980 documentary, Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film, as narrated by James Mason, or Brownlow's other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplin's career, including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrill's temporary replacement, Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in THE GOLD RUSH.

the-fearless-america,"Aug 14, 2015",10/10,"If i have to choose which movie have the best ending, it is very easy to choose city lights, it is very very easy. Chaplin was genius, seriously genius.This is the movie that truly inspire me. After i watch city lights, i just know there is such a movie power that exist in this world that can move and touch me really deep. I never feel such a sharp sensation ever from any hundred movies i watch before. and this movie, pierce me through the heart within silent. only gesture, eye- contact, and camera-works with no dialogue.sometimes i try to analyze deeply, why this movie have such a magnificent power. i think the reason is the connection between scenes. if we ask ourself what makes a good ending ? maybe the answer is how good you make the scene before the ending. how good you correlate the prologue and epilogue and also between them. how you fill the mid-duration of a movie. if the director took a right decision, a movie will not have any wasted scenes. its only genius film-maker can do and chaplin is one of them.silent movie such as city light is a hard-kind of movie to made. it needs next level of acting skill from the actors and actresses because there are no dialogue in it. and most of the duration, this movie is flawless in casting. and the ending scene were unbelievable and unpredictable. maximum genuine art-beauty of silent movie.i recommend everybody to watch this movie at least once. this movie is special. it definitely will pierce you."
Xstal,"Oct 10, 2020",8/10,"A good deal of silent black and white cinema is a chore to endure but the cream of that era still manages to rise to the top and compete, in its own unique and original way, with the cinema that followed over the decades up to and including today. A significant number of those films were written and performed by Charlie Chaplin and, if you watched nothing other than the films he made from that period, including this, your appreciation of his genius and talent would flower and grow, your vision of sincerity and generosity restore and your enchantment of the simpler and more genuine things in life embellish."
Snow Leopard,"May 29, 2001",N/A,"Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"" contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it.  Although made very much in the old-fashioned silent film tradition, much of it is timeless, too.After a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning, Charlie's ""little tramp"" character makes two acquaintances.  He meets a blind girl selling flowers, who mistakes him for a rich man, and the two become very fond of each other. Then he meets a real millionaire, who is drunk, depressed, and about to commit suicide.  In a comic scene, the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it, making himself a devoted friend.The tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight, and tries to think of some way he could help.  His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving, while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades - his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny, and one of Chaplin's best comic pieces. Meanwhile, when his millionaire friend is drunk, he dotes on the tramp, but when sober he forgets who the tramp is, leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for Charlie.All of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the best-remembered scenes in any film.  ""City Lights"" shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master, who without words can move his audience or make them laugh.  Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once."
Steffi_P,"Sep 19, 2010",10/10,"The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one. The first full-length talkies were released in 1928. By 1929 theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business. By 1930 silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism. But in 1931 a new silent picture was released that, far from being an embarrassing failure, became the fourth-highest grossing picture of the year, being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy. The picture was City Lights and its producer, writer, director, editor, composer and star was Mr Charlie Chaplin.Chaplin was of course primarily a comedian, and his humour was of broad appeal, but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy. The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front, and the ever-popular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound. What makes Charlie stand out, and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era, is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary, empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy. Of all Chaplin's silent pictures, City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes. The number of classic gags here is fairly small. Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence. City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance, but it's a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter. Within this story, the comedy becomes functional, often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone. Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights real.As if to snub the talkie, City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative, even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedy-driven moments. Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated, which gives the picture a continual smoothness – another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card. Out of necessity Chaplin's technical approach is more overt than his usual. He often cuts to a close-up to give us a necessary reaction, and there are even some whip-pans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet, but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture. Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment, and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvre.But what really makes City Lights work, what makes it connect, is the man himself on the screen. Those additional close-ups, once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body, now show off a capability for intense facial acting. An older, more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive, but his own career trajectory was entering new ground, where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal. The result is profoundly moving."
TheLittleSongbird,"Aug 14, 2010",10/10,"As much as I loved The Kid, The Gold Rush, Modern Times and The Great Dictator, City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplin's masterpiece. And there are several reasons why this is so for me.I love how City Lights is filmed, once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets. The music is also a delight(though my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times) with plenty of themes that stuck in my head, while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand. The comedy is brilliantly done, the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin movie(along with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush, the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator) but ever in a comedy, while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girl(played touchingly by Virginia Cherrill) he falls in love with. And I also found the close-up climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity. Chaplin is superb, his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with Cherrill.Overall, yet another Chaplin masterpiece, yet for me this is the best of them all. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Incalculacable,"Apr 17, 2006",8/10,"City Lights is probably one of the most well loved, along with Modern Times, Chaplin movies. The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp, one of the most lovable, truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time. Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps, like they are labeled lazy and troublesome. It is very hard to hate The Tramp, because he gives so much when he has so little. He spends his time and money giving to people - whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl. Undoubtedly, we all have a little bit of The Tramp in us.The plot is as follows: the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street. She is poor and by a mere coincidence, believes that The Tramp is rich. He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide, and despite his gratefulness, doesn't remember the poor tramp unless he is drunk.City Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history. It's poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time. Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy. I believe it is a strong mixture of both, and a great balance of the two. Both comedic and touching, City Lights should not be missed by anyone."
harry-76,"Jan 20, 2001",10/10,"Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema.  Coming up through the ranks, he gradually achieved a god-like stature, being awarded total control of every facet of the production.Not only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be (as in ""The Kid"") but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process.  This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days, weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even (in the case of ""The Gold Rush"") cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over again.He cleverly duped chief studio- and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his free-wheeling and gross inclinations, thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hit-and-miss schemes and trial-and-error ""madness.""In other words, Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush, with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases.  Fortunately, he was a genius, and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagence.It was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging, and there were no set rules.  People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium -- and Chaplin helped to establish its early parameters.He was certainly and autocrat, yet that doesn't really matter when it comes to film works.  It's the product that counts.  In the case of ""City Lights,"" all the blood-sweat-and-tears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort.Now that all the frustration, anger, and outrage associated with the behind-the-scenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past, what remains is a genuinely moving film classic.Sometimes great enterprises require considerable hardship to forge them into being.  The greater the achievement, often the greater the challenge and period of endurance. Whatever the case, we are the appreciative recipients of this masterwork, which takes its place besides ""Modern Times"" and ""The Gold Rush"" as one of Chaplin's consummate expressions."
Lechuguilla,"May 10, 2009",10/10,"Waddling along with his cane and derby hat, and that tiny mustache, the little tramp (Charles Chaplin) is visually unlike any character in film history. The tramp is kind-hearted, always dignified. He's a simple soul who in ""City Lights"" tries to help out a young blind woman (well played by Virginia Cherrill). This is a silent film, of course, but the tramp's body language is his speech.The really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life. He's more or less ignored by many, laughed at by others. The girl's grandmother never ""sees"" him at all. And only when the millionaire is drunk does he ""see"" the tramp as a friend. Curious ... and deep.The tramp gets into his fair share of trouble, but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl. The boxing match is a hoot, and very well choreographed, as are all the skits. And what a beginning for a film, with city leaders spouting gibberish, probably as Chaplin's dig at the ""talkies"". Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance ... just terrific!Melancholy at times, the film's music really tugs at your heartstrings. Maybe it's sentimental and manipulative. But given the abiding and Zen-like qualities of the tramp, some sentimentality is quite appropriate. And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot action.Production design is sparse and at times drab. That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obvious.Comedy here is simple and effective. The main character expresses heart and humanity. The little tramp is an unforgettable character. And ""City Lights"" is a wonderful film."
mullins_333,"Feb 8, 2015",10/10,"I watched this movie as part of a class project. I could have chosen any movie on the IMDb top 250. I chose this particular movie because I had never seen it. I was not expecting to like it or be able to get into it because it is a silent movie. I was completely wrong.This movie is basically a love story between a tramp and a blind flower girl. There is also the millionaire that the tramp saves and becomes friends with, sometimes.I believe that this movie would not have been as good with dialog as it is without. This is because Charlie Chaplin's acting and musical score were perfect. The music fits the action on screen perfectly and keeps you drawn in. Chaplin's character, a tramp, conveys his message through pantomime. The blind girl played by Virginia Cherrill was also done perfectly. The ending between these two characters is one of the best that I have ever seen.Harry Myers plays an eccentric millionaire, This part is also played very well. This character is a kind of Jeckyll and Hyde. When he has been drinking, he is the tramp's best buddy, when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him.The boxing scene is extremely funny. I won't give away any spoilers but the interaction between the two boxers and the referee is hilarious.Overall this is a masterpiece. The romance, humor, and drama were all very convincing and like I said before, this was all done with no words. This movie was so good that I will watch Charlie Chaplin's other work."
ArmandoManuelPereira,"Mar 3, 2020",7/10,"To be sure the ending is beautifully pathetic, and tear inducing (at least I cried.) And throughout their are funny and memorable moments, along with shots that are very prettily framed. But to be honest their are also boring moments, and scenes that aren't all that funny. (Which makes me wonder at the lavish praise some have heaped upon the film.) Overall, it's a good movie and in a sense a classic. But it is, in my opinion, a flawed classic."
MrskiViletic,"Feb 2, 2019",10/10,"Shot in a time when silent films were already vanishing from the big screens ""City Lights"" is a masterfully executed comedy by the one and only Charlie Chaplin. Even without dialog Chaplin manages to tell a story between two loners looking to companionship in a world that has almost forgot about them. Funny, emotional and timeless!"
michadny,"Oct 20, 2015",6/10,"Charlie Chaplin may be praised for his work nowadays, and rightly so, he was a pioneer in the silent film era. However, do his films stand out in today's standards: no. I'm not saying I disliked the film, I very well respect it, but it just didn't captivate me as much as I would of hoped for. City Lights may be the older version of Mr. Bean; a slapstick comedy with very little use of intellect.City Lights unfortunately didn't sit well with me, nor did it really entice me to chase more of Charlie Chaplin films. It wasn't bad, nor was it boring, I just didn't find much joy in what is considered one of the 'best brads of comedy'. Whilst I don't speak for everyone, this film just won't be for everyone."
Michael_Elliott,"Feb 26, 2008",N/A,"City Lights (1931)**** (out of 4)Charlie Chaplin returns as The Tramp and this time he falls in love with a blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) and sets out to help her. The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk (Harry Myers) and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he loves.Chaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made. Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but I'd also argue that it's one of the greatest love stories, if not the greatest. It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.I think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and there's really not a weak spot to be found here. Being 1931 it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound. He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point. The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point.The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success. The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water. In fact, the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own. Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film. What's so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really delivers.Chaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here. Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you can't help but be impressed with the actor. Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together. Then you've got Cherrill who wasn't a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughout.CITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history. There's really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year."
zsigomiklos,"Jul 13, 2007",10/10,"If I had to choose which departed film-maker I would want to meet, I would choose Charlie Chaplin. I think he is the greatest and most determining artist in the entire cinema history. City Lights is my personal favourite. It is so innocent, so warmhearted masterpiece, that fills me with zest for life, kindness and gives meaning to carry on living! Chaplin, as usual, is the unbelievably altruist Little Tramp who falls in love with a beautiful blind flower-girl.I read some other comments which said it was the greatest last 5 minutes in the cinema history. It was indeed, but it also was one of the funniest 86 minutes for me. Almost all the jokes landed even after 76 years... I can only praise the highness of Charles Chaplin: the Great Director, Stunning Producer, Outstanding Composer, Marvellous Editor, Brilliant Actor. All in one fantastic person.My rating is 10 out of 10."
leex1214,"Dec 31, 2003",10/10,"I've seen many of Chaplin's best films, and have just finished watching City Lights for the first time.  In my opinion, it tops even the brilliant Modern Times.  It seems to me that many who claim to be film ""connoseuirs"" stick up their noses at anything that does not have excessively complicated plots or incomprehensible imagery.  To these people I would say, ""I feel sorry that you are unable to appreciate some of the greatest works of art ever created"".  This movie is a nearly ideal case in point.  The story is simple: the Tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl and does anything to help her.  Although there are some very funny moments, the movie is not really what I would call hilarious.  But I don't see these as flaws.  The very simplicity of the story gives it enormous impact because it obviously comes straight from the heart, and the humor is present to soften the blow of the drama and make it bearable, the exception being the very end.  Much has been said about the ending, and deservedly so.  There is nothing outlandish, nothing over the top about it: everything is very subtle, but the way that it is set up, the subtle facial expressions, the lack of dialogue, and the music all have the impact of a sledgehammer.  It has to be seen to be believed.  I don't want to reveal any more details for fear of spoiling it. 	Well, I hope that was of some use; at least I hope it helped someone decide to watch this masterpiece."
dwrenn-1,"Jul 28, 2002",10/10,"Orson Welles once cited as his favorite movie Charlie Chaplin's tribute to the art of body language and pantomime, ""City Lights.""""I was determined to continue making silent films,"" Chaplin recalls in ""My Life in Pictures"" of his decision to make a silent four years into the talkie era, ""for I believed there was room for all types of entertainment."" ""City Lights"" features Chaplin's musical composition and various sound effects, but no dialogue. Chaplin opens the film with a lampoon of talkies: at the unveiling of a Greco-Roman stone statue, the dignitaries' speeches are heard only as unintelligible squawks.Smitten by a flower-selling Blind Girl (Virginia Sherrill) who has mistaken him for a dapper gentleman, the Little Tramp takes on odd jobs (including a prizefight, shown in a masterfully choreographed sequence) to raise money for an operation to restore her vision. After the Tramp intervenes to prevent the suicide of an alcoholic tycoon, the tycoon befriends him; but it is an on and off friendship, as when sober the tycoon doesn't even recognize the Tramp. Despite a series of mishaps, the Tramp pays for the operation. But in the process he lands in prison. On the Tramp's elease, the Blind Girl learns the true identity of her benefactor in one of the most rarified scenes in cinema."
nyp01,"Aug 15, 2011",9/10,"It may be the haze of all the intervening years, but I don't think Chaplin made anything but 'Classics' from 1916-1936. You can pretty much watch anything from these couple of decades and see, if not an entire classic, at least frequent moments of brilliance. Such was the man's genius.Of this oeuvre, some items stand out as especially worthy of praise: all the full length features in this period, for example, are worth seeing today. Most live on in the work of other directors, cinematographers and actors who were influenced by these films. In fact it could rightly be said that Chaplin lives on in innumerable moments on screen and in the attitude he brought to the project of making films - raising it from a novelty to it's status as art today. No filmmaker did more to advance the art of film.City Lights is certainly one of his masterpieces. It resembles his other features from the 30's (and throughout is career) in it's utterly distinctive look and feel. Due to the unique style of directing, his absolute control of all aspects of the production and the use of his collaborator/cinematographer, Rollie Totheroh, all Chaplin films have this 'look' that the film wears almost like a brand.The most striking thing, to me, about CL, is the pure symmetry of the story. Everything is pared down to the double story of love story/infatuation and friendship/exploitation. The love story is predicated on deception, while the friendship is predicated on alcoholism. The parallel stories take place almost independently of each other. It is this lack of cohesion that to me at least makes it less of a great film than, say, Modern Times.Nevertheless, there are many great moments in the film to admire. The two best scenes, IMO, are the boxing scene which is genuinely one of the most hilarious sequences ever filmed (if you want to know where Jackie Gleason, Lucille Ball and other masters of physical comedy got their chops, a good place to start is right here) and the final scene/fadeout.The ending is beyond genius, almost as if God had AD'd this scene for Chaplin, it is so profoundly moving. That said, a great ending, even one as great as graces City Lights, does still not resolve the issue of the un-meeting story lines which proceed along parallel tracks for the whole film.It is still worth your time to watch this supremely gifted physical comedian at the top of his game, and even more so, IMO, in repeat viewings. No silent actor rewards the repeat watcher more than Chaplin, as his constant, offhand improvisations often escape first or second notice and only become apparent upon repeat viewings."
Vartiainen,"Jun 26, 2017",6/10,"The Tramp, once again played brilliantly by Charlie Chaplin, returns to live out his life in the hands of whimsy and general good luck. This time the stage is the city where our lovable scamp has to contend with alcoholic millionaires with bad memories, boxing opponents that keep changing and changing, grumpy butlers and enchanting flower girls.In have to admit that I find myself comparing these silent funny films to each other more than anything else. And why not, they're almost the same. They're all good, I'll give them that, but the plots are often almost identical. The Tramp is introduced, followed by some physical comedy, The Tramp meets a girl, physical comedy, The Tramp does something stupid to impress the girl, physical comedy, and a happy ending. It is all very well done, but is it any wonder that these movies start to blend with one another in my mind.That being said, this is the best Chaplin film I've seen so far. Because while the rather detached comedy sessions are still there, the central characters and the central romance are both brilliant. Harry Myers is very good and funny as the millionaire, but it's the growing and tested romance between Chaplin and the flower girl played by Virginia Cherrill that keeps us interested. Especially the ending scene, which is called one of the best romantic scenes ever. And rightfully so.They say City Lights is the one film you should see if you haven't seen any Charlie Chaplin in your life.Yeah, I can't argue with that."
beejer,"Mar 25, 1999",10/10,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time. Chaplin's use of humour and pathos are unparalleled in this, his greatest film. Who among us can say that they didn't shed a tear when watching the final scene of the picture. A true masterpiece."
refresh_daemon,"Sep 29, 2006",7/10,"Ah, a Charles Chaplin film. I remember watching my fair share of the silent clowns back in film class and here I watched another. City Lights is about a tramp who falls for a blind girl and works to help her out. That's basically the story; here's the twist: she thinks he's a millionaire and he wants to help pay for an operation that will give her sight (which means that she finds out he's not a millionaire). Okay, the story is done.Honestly, I have to say that I like Chaplin, but I don't love him. This film does nothing to change my mind. There are many cute clowning sequences and they are strung together, although early on, they don't do a whole lot to help the story out and serve almost as distractions. However, taken as individual scenes, they are entertaining, although nothing that caused me to laugh out loud.The film is helped in that it doesn't resolve too neatly but leaves a little room for our own projection of how we think things happen after we see ""The End"". And it's a bittersweet plot twist which allows for some empathy, rather than just clowning for the sake of clowning. So, City Lights is enjoyable and human, but suffers from gag-stringing and being a little drawn out. Decent, but not a must-watch. 7/10."
princebansal1982,"May 17, 2011",5/10,"I was first exposed to Chaplin as a kid, through his short films. And though I enjoyed them a lot, when I grew up I mostly put him in same league with Lauren and Hardy, Three Stooges etc that is really good at visual gags but not much else. Though I liked him I couldn't understand him being considered one of the greatest directors, I thought maybe that was due to nostalgia people have about their childhood.How wrong I was, when I finally did see a full length movie, I was amazed. Chaplin certainly deserves his reputation. And this is my favorite Chaplin movie. It is one of most poignant, touching love stories. It has its funny parts too but those were overshadowed for me by the touching parts."
BYUmogul,"Feb 6, 2001",N/A,"Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia.  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are.  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works, it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation.  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new.  In City Lights, and other silent works of film, a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere.  While watching the film, I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story, the sets, the crew; the whole project.  While this may not have been the complete reality, it felt that way, and thus made the film more enjoyable.  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional response.Since film is at its very core a visual medium, I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium.  I don't use the word basic here in a demeaning sense, but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art, before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance.  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced, but they were, and are, beautiful.  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic. There is a warmth found in City Lights, and other Chaplin films (The Kid, Modern Times) that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today.  Maybe it's just that with simplicity comes honesty, and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer."
Enrique-Sanchez-56,"Aug 24, 2004",10/10,"No words can describe the majestic nobility of this movie.  Every time I see a new movie coming out that is touted as the greatest thing since sliced bread, plastic and microwave technology, I sink deeper into an unspoken depression because this movie has not surged forth as one of the truly sublime creations of the entire film era.It's simplicity cloaks a recondite whole that few will admit to understanding.  Yet Chaplin speaks in an easily understandable language: the speech of human movement and emotion.To say that Chaplin was a master is understating the breadth of his gifts. He combined comedy with pathos, added a hefty dash of physical comedy and threw it all into a bowl of drama.  Deep, personal drama.  The kind of drama that envelops our daily lives but we are too aware of the rest of the world to discern it for its full worth.  The result is a delicious meal perfectly and equally suitable for a gourmet or a gourmand.Many mistake his brand of comedy for vapid sentimentality.  But they are missing the reality that life is full of sentiment...pure and noble sentiment.Chaplin's passion is universal and it has lasted for nearly a hundred years -- there is no doubt that his brand of life's basic truths will endure until there is a new heaven and a new Earth.CITY LIGHTS mixes the very best that Chaplin had to offer.  A gentle story, comedic interludes, human tragedy and a sense for the grandiloquence in the most innocent and tender emotions that humankind can conjure.SIDE NOTE:  One of Chaplin's gifts was his musicmaking.  Although I treasure all of his creations, I am glad that IMDB.com finally headed my suggestion and gave credit to, José Padilla, the Spanish composer of the famous ""Flower Girl' music as it should be.  The correct name of the song is ""LA VIOLETERA""; which means the ""girl who sells violets"".If you treasure human feeling and human comedy in all its veils and ramifications, CITY LIGHTS is the movie for you.10+/10"
st-shot,"Mar 4, 2008",10/10,"Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote, performed, directed and scored one of film's finest masterpieces.The story is about the ""Little Tramp"" befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich. Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the woman.In an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy. Drunk, dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty, a comic ballet. Chaplin's performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent. By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession. Some sound is used sparingly (brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard) but no intelligible words are uttered. The track and Chaplin's score is lyrical, energized and integral. The film is perfectly constructed.In the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment, saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale. Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to."
X990,"Apr 25, 2021",9/10,"This movie that i watched today was the first classic movie ever for me, it really was fantastic. And i highly enjoyed it, the comedy was also unique!"
baroudii,"Feb 6, 2011",9/10,"The movie is a brilliant movie with simple approach, face expressions and body language delivered the message louder than words. Charlie Chaplin manages to expose the contrast in our lives between rich and poor and between dreams and reality. The first point has been delivered in the first seen, when group of politicians were celebrating a monument that has been built by donated money. Charlie Chaplin (a homeless man) was sleeping under the cover of the statue. This seen highlighted the contrast between money spent for cosmetic projects that does not add any value to eliminate hanger and improve the life of the neediest parts of the community. The message is that we are spending money and willing to provide funding for project that at most just cosmetic, and ignore funding to fight hunger, homelessness and curable diseases in our own backyard in the US. We see the same today, almost seventy years after the movie. The willingness to spend many billions on wars, supporting dictators, stadiums, art, and music, on the other hand, the community organized huge resistance to provide health care service for every American. The movie continued to highlight the wide gap between the rich and the poor in our community. The movie showed how a $10 can buy whole day worth of work for the blind girl and send her home for the day. The rich mane has many of those bills in his pocket as pocket cash. The same point is emphasized when the drunk rich man wanted to help and offered a $1000 to help. This amount of money was part of the pocket cash again. The movie proceed to show that portion of the rich man pocket cash was able to keep the blind lady and her old grandmother at their rented home, and cure her vision in addition to opening her own flower shop. The idea of just a portion of a pocket cash of someone can make this huge impact on someone else life is sad reality. It applies to all of us today, the few dollars we spend every day on coffee, cigarettes, and other unessential expenses can make huge difference in someone else life, in this country and in other countries. The culture of spending money we don't have to buy things we will never use is a very well established culture, proved by a simple trip to the nearest Costco or mall. The rich man drives a Rolls Royce (that he was willing to give it as gift in exchange for few happy moments with his ""friend"" Charlie Chaplin) and he has several servants at his home. The movie succeeded in denying the association between money and happiness. The rich man was not happy and was trying to end his own life; however, unintentionally he was able to introduce major happiness to others. The fact that he was drunk when he offered the money is an indicator that people are good when they are at their simplest form, and turn to monsters when they are back to their complicated personality.At many points, the movie highlighted the harsh reality of the tough job market. The humiliation of cleaning after horses and ""elephants"" and the job as a boxer to make money were stretched to make the message louder. My personal believe is that money and wealth belong to god, wealthy people are just in control of the wealth in behalf of god and spending money is regulated on the basis of helping the bigger benefit of the community. Over spending is discouraged and greed is discouraged. The spending is to be balanced between the extremes. God like to see the signs of his gifts on his creations. The movie did not touch directly on the social justice and the lack of it; however, it highlighted the dark side of capitalism, homelessness, eviction, medical coverage, and low end jobs brutality. The movie triggered thoughts in many directions due the lack of the sound conversation. This may lead to stretch of what really the movie is trying to say and deliver to the viewers. It opened the door for multiple interpretations for the same seen based on one's background and believes. In conclusion, the movie is intellectual and it is everything but just a popcorn movie.The movie successfully delivered the message that capitalism comes with heavy price. The dark side of capitalism can be minimized by having social justice and implementing social services to benefit the least fortunate among us and the sick.Advance social services do not contradict with capitalism as far as I understood capitalism. Advanced social services may hurt certain business like insurance companies and other business that makes money from the misery of people. The contradiction is how such a religious country like the US denies social services and support for the poor and the sick. It seems to me that money rules, and money map our lives much more than out believes. I always support my claim with our consistent attempts to cash in our ethics like legalizing gambling and certain types of drugs. Some communities went further and legalized prostitution. As I am living in this free country, I am always amazed how major issues are not negotiable and taken granted forever as in the availability and abuse of alcohol and ""right"" to have sex without restrictions. We choose to deal with the end effect of alcohol but never question its availability and accessibility equally to under-aged and mature abusers. The same applies to our solution to the teen pregnancy where the best we did is making condoms available.This movie was one of the intellectual movies that managed to deliver a clear message by highlighting contradictions in our daily live. I enjoyed the movie and it made it to my favorite movies list."
jewelch,"May 10, 2021",7/10,"Excellent acting by Chaplin and Swain. Their struggle for survival is perfectly depicted with a liberal dose of hilarious physical comedy masking its severity. The physical comedy that Chaplin performed was both creative and captivating. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Charlie Chaplin, the history of films, or just looking for a light-hearted film. Chaplin plays his classic Tramp character. This is an absolute must-see masterpiece from the ""Roaring '20s"". Loved it James Welch Henderson Arkansas. 5/8/21."
mikel weisser,"Jan 20, 2002",10/10,"amazing comic derring duo, tremendously powerful romantic epiphanies, and stinging social commentary all without saying a word, Chaplin's ""City Lights"" is justly considered a classic and enthrallingly entertaining more than 70 years later. Watch it for the slapstick or the romance each is immensely fulfilling. watch with the sound off or on for chaplin also wrote the sumptuous soundtrack. watch it for the classic routines (which were plainly the model of much of the cartoon comedy that would follow): Chaplin on a statue, in a boxing ring, trying to save a suicide, or for its iconographical final shot of him with a rose. but watch go out rent it so you can watch it, immediately if not sooner."
Bored_Dragon,"Nov 7, 2018",4/10,"I'm not a fan of silent film and, to me, Chaplin is creepy, like something that escaped from a nightmare. But the final scene of this film is rightfully considered one of the best movie scenes in the history of cinema.My overall impression: 4/10

bob the moo,"Jun 22, 2008",N/A,"As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside. While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot. However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn  if the two of them can sober up long enough.In response to seeing some modern trash posing as ""comedies"" recently (Little Man, Norbit, Pluto Nash  I'm looking at you) I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time  a few Chaplin films being among them. City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not. I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start. As was often the case, this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic. And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole film.The statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring. Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at. His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good. Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character, while Myers, Garcia, Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside Chaplin.City Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made. The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent set-pieces that tickle and also stick in the mind. So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead."
the_standard_mental,"Jun 22, 2001",10/10,"Sometimes movies disastrously complicate themselves with convoluted language and incessant dialogue ( sometimes movie reviewers do it too. )  But Charlie Chaplin, proving he is truly one of the greatest actor/directors ever, shows that linguistic simplicity speaks volumes. With CITY LIGHTS Chaplin has created one of the greatest movies of all-time, using sparse dialogue and constant hilarity.The boxing scene is one of the best pieces of cinema ever, comedy or not. In those seventy years, since CITY LIGHTS came out, movies have come a long way, but that one scene has not been equaled.  The comic genius of Chaplin shines vibrantly in this masterpiece.This is a movie."
MissSimonetta,"Aug 19, 2014",10/10,"The answer is yes, yes, and YES.City Lights (1931) may be the sweetest film ever made. A gentle romantic-comedy with a great ending, this movie is unforgettable. Unlike a modern comedy or rom-com, there is not a trace of mean-spiritedness here.I'm not sure if CL is Chaplin's funniest movie, but some of his most hilarious moments are all here. The comic highlight is the boxing match, which is great all in and of itself.Though Chaplin had a hard time with Virginia Cherrill on set, she is perfect as the flower girl the Tramp seeks to help. He considered casting Georgia Hale in the part, but I don't think anyone could have exuded innocence and tenderness in the same caliber as Cherrill.This is a fine movie, truly great."
panchodh_12,"Nov 4, 2014",6/10,"I can't say I didn't enjoy watching this movie. Specially with all this rush of modern times (to quote another Chaplin movie), it feels good to watch a movie that is not very mentally demanding. The plot could be followed by a five-year old, which is also a breath from all the complicated, deep movies I've been watching recently. And yes, it has some very funny parts, though it seems that the whole plot was written by putting together a bunch of gags that Chaplin had thought about, with no connexion whatsoever but that he made an effort to making them look somehow of a coherent story. I cannot say he wasn't successful.I guess the year it was written (1931) explains the somehow political implication of the tramp and a poor blind lady being the main, good characters, while the butler and the rich man when sober are not likable at all.That being said, is not my favorite comedy, by far. It is also not my favorite Chaplin movie, as he pulls of a much better performance at The Dictator. But hey, it is still remarkable that a movie can still be enjoyable 80 years after it was made: I guess that definitely makes it a classic."
RKharlamov2001,"Mar 19, 2015",6/10,"It's important when I give my opinion on a movie to note that my 6* out of 10, no way implicates the artistry, the technical genius that is a Charlie Chaplin movie. It purely is my level of enjoyment during my experience of watching the movie.As a 23 year old in 2015, with limited experience in watching silent movies, in fact, just this and ""The Kid"" so far. It's hard for me to truly appreciate the movie. Unfortunately as time goes by, City Lights (just like all movies this old), will slowly fall down popularity lists like the IMDb Top 250. That is not to take away anything from what is so obviously a masterpiece of it's era. The movies that came before our times will always have their place, and people intrigued enough by our history in general, and the history of cinema, will always give movies like this, time, even if 6 out of 10 does seem like I am dismissing it.During my time watching, I had fun in parts. There were parts where I was bored, tired. This is down to where I am at in the comedy evolution scale. I'm in 2015, I love ""The Office UK"". Me personally, I'm not going to laugh anymore when I see someone hit their head constantly. This is not ALL that happens in the movie, but you get my drift. Though luckily enough for older fans, i'm a rare breed these days; just because something doesn't entertain me to the highest possible level, I won't just brush it off and call it ""shit"".My 6 stars come from a respect of the entertainment and therefore intrigue to watch. The freshness of it to someone who is new to silent movies. The freshness of watching a screen legend like Charlie Chaplin for only the 2nd time. The powerful ending. What it leaves me with, for example, I will have more fun thinking back to this movie, than I had actually watching it. The reason for that is I can cancel out the bits that bore me. I am left with some great characters, and my imagination. The Blind Girl, there is a beauty about blind people that only blind people can attain. An unfortunate but also fortunate naivety about the world. I love the story of the tramp and the blind girl. It's something that i'll remember.If you like silent movies, you've already seen this movie. If you don't like silent movies, you'll hate this movie. If you're not sure whether you like silent movies, try watching a master of his generation, if only for that reason. See what happens. I did, and i'm glad that I did, as Charlie Chaplin is now floating around inside my mind for a while, and I like him there."
Kdosda_Hegen,"Dec 22, 2020",2/10,"This film just like all other Chaplin movies sucks.

flickershows,"Nov 29, 2013",9/10,"Making Jack Lemmon cry is a delight reserved for demented people, but---when he was alive---there WAS a way to make the man weep. Just show him the last scene of City Lights. If you can get hold of the American Film Institute's Top 100 Laughs TV special, you can see for yourself. Lemmon cries while describing the end of this movie. Then I cried. My wife laughed. She's such a little trooper.I won't give away what that last scene is, but it's easy to see how it could make a person bust up just thinking about it. Charlie Chaplin was certainly not afraid to hit those maudlin notes. His Tramp character was lovable enough and Chaplin the artist was talented enough to get away with milking you for every emotion you've got. Funny how some people can mix tones in the same movie and make it work so well while others can't even get one tone right.The story: the Tramp makes friends with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) and works various jobs to help support her. She doesn't know he's broke, instead thinking he's a rich benefactor. Along the way he tries his hand at a few different vocations, including a hilarious attempt at being a boxer. He also parties a lot with an actual rich man (Harry Myers) who spends most of the movie drunk as a monkey. Whenever he sobers up, out goes the Tramp. No one can ever see our hero for who he truly is.City Lights is a short and pithy movie, as were most of CC's works. He knew how to tell a compact story with oodles of hijinks, a little drama, a message and plenty of feeling. The AFI definitely had l'amour for this picture, ranking it 76th and then 11th on their 1998 and then 2007 Top 100 lists. That's a remarkable leap in the span of 10 years. Do you feel that strongly about City Lights too? I'm not quite as enamoured with it as the AFI, but it's a wonderful picture. Jack Lemmon's sloppy tears are proof.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the ""Podcasts"" section for our 23-minute City Lights 'cast...and many others.

braddugg,"Sep 20, 2014",10/10,"Comically the most hilarious and dramatically the most moving film.How many times, one may see it we all shall fall in love with love, honesty. simplicity and sincerity again. A man's quest to keep a girl whom he just likes happy, to give her some light is just so delightful a journey. His interactions with a drunkard, a very funny boxing match, a flower girl's love are so well interlaced that never for a moment is a laugh lost or a smile broken. Yet it ends with the eyes left moist. A great movie and an emphatic achievement in films.The style is Slapstick, where each scene is just so comical. Each time he meets the flower girl, she welcomes him hilariously, each time he is away from her, he does something extremely funny. The romance is just filled with expression of eyes and it is so very subtle. I must say the whole movie is like a poem with sublime lyrical beauty. It's very fluid as the scenes just flow. I surrender myself to the genius as Charlie Chaplin and to a great movie as City Lights. Please please please see it as this movie would still stand the test time of time and I am pretty sure, it would still be loved a 100 years later.It's flawless and 5/5 from a little movie buff. I loved this greatest Romantic Comedy ever. I think who all have seen it, shall surely love it. Silence is a great language coz few things are beautiful when expressed silently"
realdealholifield,"Feb 14, 2006",9/10,"Unlike most of the other reviewers, I'm not really a huge Chaplin fan. In fact, to be perfectly honest, most of his movies bore me to tears. But this Chaplin film was different. It had a much warmer feel to it. There was something special about it. It's hard to describe, maybe because it isn't so much any specific part of the movie, but rather the feelings that the movie brings out. I watched it, as if I was hypnotized and when the movie was finished I found myself thinking ""Now that's a nice movie!"" I believe the mark of any truly great film is the emotion it's able to evoke. So this movie is nothing less than a huge success regardless if it makes it on any top ten lists or not. If you're looking to see Chaplin at his best I highly recommend you start with this warm, light-hearted film."
didi-5,"Oct 17, 2009",9/10,"One of Charlie Chaplin's best films, 'City Lights' presents him at his best. It is funny - the scenes with the millionaire and at the boxing ring are priceless. It has that ending which is one of the best in cinema, and thus makes this film a great love story. It has a wonderful score by Chaplin himself with a number of themes which pinpoint the action and manipulate the audience into reacting to what they see in a particular way. And it is a silent film, alone is a sea of early sound features.All of this adds up to make a special experience. If you are seeing this for the first time, you won't know what to expect and you'll probably laugh, cry, and every emotion in-between. If you're seeing it after many previous viewings, you'll spot things you haven't seen before. Such was Chaplin's inventiveness."

Right! Howls and heart tugs. Follow the battered derby and shuffle along with Charlie to that happy hunting ground of his own creation !One of the most eloquent and sensitive films ever shot , due to Chaplin's keen balance between comedy and tragedy . Chaplin didn't always achieve the difficult double of successful comedy and hit pathos for which he often strove , but this movie , released silent after almost three years in the making , was a triumph for him on both fronts . Chaplin gives an awesome and sympathetic performance as a tramp who triumphs over adversity , including some comical set pieces in all Chaplin's distinguished contributions to the cinema. Here delivering his ordinary trade mark : A tramp with toothbrush mustache, undersized bowler hat and bamboo cane who struggled to survive while keeping his dignity in a world with great social injustice. His scenes with the blind flower girl are genuinely stirring and the sequence in the boxing ring one of the most hilarious in his long career. This is a vintage flick much in the fashion that sound films offended his pantomimist's sensibilities . Chaplin also composed the score which incorporates the charming tune : Flower Girl Theme with music by composer José Padilla.The motion picture was masterfully directed by Charles Chaplin .This was one of the longest ones to that date . Chaplin previously directed 2 or 3 reel short movies, such as : Our hero, The fireman, Night at the show , The adventurer, The floorwalker, The cure , The inmigrant , The circus , Burlesque on Carmen , among others . After that , he made long feature films such as : The gold Rush , The kid , City lights , The great dictator , Monseur Verdoux , Limelight , A king of New York and his last one : A countess from Hong Kong . Rating 8/10 . Better than average . Well worth watching ."
Seraphion,"Aug 9, 2014",6/10,"The story is quite nice. Although, having watched a few works apparently inspired by or outright copying the plot from this movie, I kind of predicted the rest of the movie after the millionaire and the girl appeared. Comparing this movie to the older Chaplin work in The Kid, I feel that the interweaving between comedy and romance here is not as smooth as the interweaving of drama and comedy in The Kid. Yet I must say that still having the limitations of sound, Chaplin's directing skills quite improved in terms of set selection and the other casts using their facial expressions better. Seeing how the plot ends nicely, though a bit fantastically, I agree that this movie obtains a spot as a classic."
hasanxenith,"Jul 13, 2021",10/10,"This movie defined the actual love . Love is not a ""Give and take"" thing . You can only call yourself lover when you can love someone without any hope to gain anything. Tramp went too far for this poor flower girl not for any return . It is also remarkable for me because of it's silent beauty , It proves a interesting thing which is for expressing art you don't have to be loud or you don't need deep dialogues , but all you need to express the feelings that is common for all human being. This movie glued me on screen every bit , and the ending was one of the perfect ending I ever watch .I am not a regular romance genre fan but this movie placed itself in a totally different level of beauty for me ."
jameslinton-75252,"Apr 19, 2016",7/10,"This was my first Charlie Chaplin and first silent film. I wasn't sure what to expect and I was surprised that despite the lack of dialogue, it was easy to follow. The storyline wasn't particularly complicated or difficult to understand. The humour also worked well too. Charlie Chaplin is a great comedy performer and here his talents for physical comedy are showcased well.That being said I did feel like the comedy was overdone at times. There were occasions where the same joke was repeated again and again and I got a little bored. I also didn't find the film entirely engaging. My interest did wander a little at times.Read my full review here:http://goo.gl/V1YfzS"

loricossette-20061,"Oct 2, 2021",10/10,"I hardly know what to say about this beautiful film. It is so exquisite, moving, perfect. The last five minutes are the most moving minutes in film history. No sound, but it is not needed, Charlie and the absolutely glowing performance of Virginia Cherrill will reduce the coldest of hearts to tears. A wonder of a film, one for the ages."
bigticket-36199,"Mar 14, 2025",9/10,"""City Lights"" is a comedic-romantic drama and one of the most beautiful films directed by Charles Chaplin.The plot follows a ""tramp"" who falls in love with a blind girl who selling flowers.After a series of comedic situations, he decides to help her regain her sight.Mr. Chaplin masterfully combines comedy, uncertain fate, and sincere emotions.Let me try to be clearer, creating a combination of physical comedy and emotions with an uncertain outcome in a spiritual sense is not easy at all.Some scenes are truly brilliant, particularly the sequence of the first encounter between the tramp and the blind girl, as well as the final sequence.This film explores themes such as love, hope, misfortune, chance, and tranquility, among others.The tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is an awkward but kind-hearted character who brings love, hope, and his small desires to be accepted by the girl he loves into their relationship.The film's ending offers a certain cathartic expression in his character, alongside a series of comedic misunderstandings that alternate from sequence to sequence.The blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) is a pleasant protagonist who sees hope and a way out of her situation in the kindness of the man who approaches her, even though she is unaware of who he truly is, but hopes that he is what she desires.Seemingly simple emotions in this film are incredibly touching, as the main protagonists are quite vulnerable in their relationship with each other.Therefore, this humor, which is intertwined with happiness, sadness, hope, and sacrifice, can show us the importance of kindness and humanity even today.This is definitely one of the best silent films I have ever watched in my life."
KFL,"Jan 31, 1999",8/10,"Arguably the best thing Chaplin ever did. The physical humor is mostly outstanding, particularly the boxing scene, yet it brings poignance not found in his earlier work. The last and greatest of the old-style Chaplin movies, before the spoken word changed everything forever."
hall895,"Mar 26, 2016",7/10,"City Lights is a film which is beloved and revered. And it is easy to see why. As comedies go, it may not be among the funniest films ever made. But if there is any shortfall of laughs the film more than compensates with an overabundance of charm. And it is not as if the film is totally lacking in laughs either, there is plenty of good humor here. But in this case it is the story, more than the jokes and gags, which really is the key to the film's success. That story draws you in, makes you root for Charlie Chaplin's famous Tramp. It's a beautifully unique love story which will definitely bring a smile to your face and ultimately maybe even a tear to your eye. City Lights is the brilliant result you get when you have a master of his art form at work.The simple, though thoroughly captivating story, follows The Tramp as he falls in love with a beautiful, blind flower girl. She can't see him for the lowly hobo he is, a misunderstanding upon her initial meeting leads her to believe he is a wealthy gentleman. The Tramp is more than happy to allow her to maintain that illusion. He gets some help in this endeavor from a drunken millionaire who befriends him. The Tramp gets money from the millionaire, stays in his house, drives his car. All very helpful in keeping up the ruse of wealthiness for the blind girl. Unfortunately the drunken millionaire is only friends with The Tramp whenever he is in fact drunk. When he sobers up he doesn't remember The Tramp at all. This of course causes awkward, and funny, complications. Meanwhile the flower girl has problems of her own. She's behind on the rent and, unknowingly since her grandmother hides the notice, about to be evicted. The Tramp is determined to save the day, pay the rent and also somehow pay for surgery to cure the girl's blindness. How will our shabby little hero pull this off?Chaplin is a master of his craft at the peak of his powers. When City Lights was released the era of silent films was at its end, the talkies had taken over. But Chaplin was determined to tell his story his way, really the only way a story of The Tramp could ever be told. Who would want to hear The Tramp speak? The brilliance of the character is in the pantomime, the expressions. Chaplin tugs on the heartstrings without ever saying a word. Other performers in the film, most notably Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl and Harry Myers as the millionaire, play their parts well. Cherrill in particular deserves much credit for the film's ultimate emotional wallop. But this film is Chaplin's through and through, his fingerprints are on every frame. A brilliant performer, a brilliant director. Every moment is so well thought out. Maybe the film is not outrageously funny but there is plenty of humor to appreciate. Even if you think a scene may drag on too long, like a boxing match late on in the film, you can't help but appreciate the effort that went into it. It may be a little long but the scene is undeniably worked out beautifully, Chaplin showing an absolute mastery of choreography. It is a comedy film in which ultimately the comedy is secondary. Yes, there are jokes and gags and no, not all of them work perfectly. But there are definitely enough good comedic moments to keep you entertained. But more importantly there is a story to keep you enthralled. The love story between The Tramp and the blind girl warms your heart and makes City Lights a true feel-good movie, one worthy of its status as one of the most beloved films ever made."
www-vitaphone-org,"May 1, 2003",1/10,"This is A Film of A Conservative Man Who Is Stuck In The Past - Unlike Harold Lloyd who was open-minded and progressive and who eagerly produced his first talkie in 1929 - Chaplin continued to live in his fantasy world of the past and released a silent film in 1931 which could have been made in 1890 - The Synchronized Score could well have been replaced with a violin playing ""Hearts And Flowers"" because the story is as interesting as a revival of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" I give this a 1 - Don't bother watching this film - read a good book instead."
LynneSin,"Feb 8, 1999",10/10,"This is probably in my top 5 of all time favorite movies.  Chaplin made us laugh, he made us cry, he created one of the most endearing masterpieces in moviemaking.  And to top it off, he did it without talking, something so rare in 1931.  Men, if you want to impress a loved one this weekend, rent this movie - she'll melt in your arms!"
trminator-35198,"Jan 17, 2019",8/10,All chaplins films and most silent films feel short regardless of run time. This film is funny as all chaplins usually are and has an easy to follow story line. I remeber more laughs in this one than in some of his others
bump69,"Aug 17, 2000",10/10,"City Lights is my favorite Chaplin feature; the climax is a cinematic masterpiece, as other contributors here will attest.  No matter how many times I view the ending (I own the film on videotape), tears still well in my eyes at the close.  I consider it one of the best films of all time. The plot contrivance of the ""Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde"" personality of the millionaire is sheer genius.  Others have spoke of the artisty of the boxing match, but my favorite scene is where Charlie, while driving the millionaire's car, sees a discarded cigar butt on the sidewalk.  Before he can get to it, a panhandler happens by and leans down to pick it up.  Charlie dispatches him with a kick in the pants, grabs the cigar butt and jumps back into his luxury automobile.  He leaves the bewildered panhandler scratching his head, wondering why a wealthy man would be so mean as to snatch a discarded butt from the curb.  Of course, if one is aware of the grinding poverty Chaplin endured while growing up in south London and of his stingy reputation with a buck, the joke is all the more significant.  Certainly The Kid, The Gold Rush, The Circus and Modern Times are all classics, but City Lights wraps pathos, superb pantomime and comic gags into a seamless display of artistry that Chaplin never was able to surpass."
Delmare,"Aug 29, 2008",9/10,"The infamous Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) befriends a sightless flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) and vows to cure her blindness. Every penny as poor as the girl is, he embarks on a series of misanthropic adventures that transport him from the center of a boxing ring to the house of an eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers), who shuns the Tramp when sober and treasures his company when drunk. All the while, the flower girl, unable to see his face, mistakes the Tramp for a rich philanthropist, unable to believe that one so destitute could care so deeply for the woes of another.City Lights joins an embarrassingly long list of films that moved me to tears, though not, perhaps, for the typical reasons. On an absolute level, there's something profoundly touching in the Tramp's devotion to the blind girl, but I found myself even more caught up in what Chaplin seemed to be saying about class. That the rich characters are only capable of empathy when alcohol levels the playing field is only one part of the critique. That the Tramp exists in a moral vacuum, that the needs of others are a constant inspiration for everything he does, that his lack of attachments enables him to come to the rescue not only of the flower girl but of the millionaire himself, whose attempted suicide would have been successful if the Tramp hadn't intervened . . . these are just a few of the reasons for why Chaplin's hobo-protagonist is, ironically, the wealthiest character in the movie. Thematically speaking, it's a well-worn path (the charitable bum versus the miserly aristocrat) yet Chaplin attacks the subject in such a simple, exacting, and unobtrusive way that we forget we've encountered it before. We don't come away feeling like we've swallowed a sermon with characters attached to it. We feel like we've witnessed something fresh and new, something funny and tearful and void of baggage.Rare is the movie that combines comedy and drama quite so fluently. While farcical sequences often distract from the film in question, Chaplin's slapstick actually underscores the drama, since the more ridiculous the Tramp's situation becomes, the more impressed we are at the lengths he'll go to in the service of his friend. And the performances in the final scene are about as good as any of seen, if only because they work with so little, and still say so much."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jun 21, 2023",10/10,"A Tramp falls in love with a pretty, young, blind flower seller, later that evening he also prevents a charismatic millionaire from committing suicide.I'm not sure if I can put a bit between City Lights and Modern times as my favourite Chaplin movie, maybe this one shades it because of that incredibly moving climax.I was very fortunate a few years ago to see this film on a relatively large screen, and it was amazing to see how captivated a mostly young audience was by this classic movie, watching people that had hardly seen a black and white movie, let alone a silent one, laughing joyfully, quite something.It's worth realising that by 1931, Silent movies were on the decline, the talkies were on the rise, audiences were now getting used to films like Whoopee, but City Lights was a massive success, and remains loved by fans to this day.The slapstick humour is still a joy, but it's the essence of the story, the romance that makes this film so endearing.The boxing scene is something to behold, strings and all, it's so funny, what a contrast to that tear inducing climax.Magical.10/10."
James L.,"Aug 11, 2000",N/A,"The basic plot: The little tramp saves a drunken millionare from suicide and then becomes his friend when drunk and enemy when sober. He falls deeply in love with a blind flower girl,whom he tries to pay for her sight operation by taking unsuited jobs and trying to milk off the millionares money.The praise: A classic and a true great. Chaplin is funny and moving as the tramp,and the entire movie has a charm and lovable sweetness to it.  Parts of the movie happen to be comic masterpieces , especially the boxing scene and every one with the drunken millionare. All perfectly rythmic,staged, and timed in a kind of angelic way,with a great ending. I love it! I also am surprised that the academy didn't honor it!"
henry8-3,"Mar 4, 2022",6/10,"Chaplin's Tramp is entranced by a young, blind flower girl and spends the film going across town having many comic adventures in a bid to get money for her rent and maybe more.Generally regarded as Chaplin's finest film, it is certainly full of clever comical vignettes and the usual sprinkling of pathos. I should say I'm not a great fan of the man, dazzling us with lots of separate little scenes which show off his 'extraordinary' timing and 'amazing' dexterity and which scream look at me, look at me and are then sewn together into a very basic plot. On that basis I'm probably not a person to pay attention to if you like Chaplin. That said, I did laugh at the party and the boxing and the final scene was genuinely quite sweet although at no point did I feel the need to weep uncontrollably as most people seem to. Enjoy."
dmyrwood,"Feb 13, 2025",7/10,"Another silent film that I watched! I was familiar with Charlie Chaplin's ""The Tramp"" character before so I was excited to see a feature film with the character. The film has solid visual storytelling (as was necessary with silent films) with a scene as simple as introducing the female lead with a flower stand, not selling much. She drops some flowers, and feels the ground around them to show that she is blind. That tells you all you need to know about the character. And throughout the film with it being Charlie Chaplin there are some fun visual gags. I do love the simple story of the tramp saving money to help the blind girl but I do wish they focused more on it. The film does seem to get sidetracked with Charlie partying with his suicidal drunk rich friend for a good half of the movie in my opinion. Which like, not all of that side plot is bad (some of it is weirdly sweet seeing the tramp making an unlikely friendship after saving him from suicide) but after a while I was ready for them to return back to the plot with the girl. When they do it is well done and the ending is touching. A fun silent film I would have enjoyed it more if it was tighter and more focused."
Zooha-47207,"Mar 4, 2024",3/10,"City Lights, directed by the legendary Charlie Chaplin in 1931, is undeniably a significant piece of cinema history, but it scores a mere 3/10 in my book due to its limited appeal for today's viewers. The film, a classic from the silent era, showcases Chaplin's skill in visual storytelling and physical comedy. However, its style and pacing present a challenge for those accustomed to the more dynamic, dialogue-driven movies of the modern era.Chaplin's performance is a testament to his talent, perfectly capturing a range of emotions without uttering a single word. However, the absence of dialogue and reliance on exaggerated physical expressions, while groundbreaking at the time, might not resonate with contemporary audiences who prefer subtler and more verbally nuanced performances.The pacing of City Lights is another aspect that may test the patience of today's viewers. The slower narrative and extended scenes, typical of early 20th-century cinema, can feel drawn out compared to the brisk pacing of current films.In essence, while City Lights is a celebrated classic and an important part of film history, its silent, slow-paced nature and old-fashioned storytelling techniques make it more of an educational piece than an entertaining experience by current standards."
tomgillespie2002,"Feb 13, 2013",10/10,"By 1930, the silent era was coming to a rapid end. All doubters thinking that the 'talkie' craze would not last were having a wake-up call, and silent geniuses such as Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin, were potentially seeing their highly successful careers melting away. Chaplin began work on City Lights back in 1928, yet a troubled and stressful shoot caused production to run until 1931, when Hollywood had all but given itself over to the new talkie era. Refusing to let go of his most famous creation, The Tramp, Chaplin endured with his vision and kept City Lights silent, seeing no hope for his beloved character in sound pictures. Chaplin shot sporadically, seemingly around one central, and very simple, idea, and managed to create his greatest work, and undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time.After a chance encounter with a poor, blind and humble flower girl (Virginia Cherrill), The Tramp falls in love. Smitten, he sits down by the sea where a drunk and eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers) is trying to commit suicide. The Tramp opens the millionaire's eyes to life's simple wonders, so the millionaire treats him to life's luxuries, getting him extremely drunk in the process. After a memorable night, the millionaire sobers up and throws the Tramp out, where he spies the flower girl being visited by a doctor. Desperate to make money for her, he takes a job a street sweeper and gets involved in a winner-takes-all boxing match. Yet everywhere he goes, the drunk millionaire is there ready to whisk him off on another wild night.The juxtaposition of the two central stories in City Nights is relatively strange in terms of relevance to the narrative. The film is clearly a romantic one, which makes it peculiar when it repeatedly cuts to the Tramp's escapades with the millionaire. But Chaplin seems to have incorporated this for two reasons, and two aspects that Chaplin is remembered and adored for - comedy and social commentary. This is Chaplin's most laugh-out-loud film, with the standout being the scene in which the Tramp and millionaire, both highly intoxicated, arrive at a formal party. The Tramp walks across the dance floor, slipping in unfamiliar shoes, trying desperately to stay on his feet. It's a five- second gag, but for me it incorporated all of Chaplin's breathtaking physical ability and subtle energy. Every moment seems like an endless maze of possibilities for Chaplin, squeezing instants of virtuoso out of simple things like lighting a cigar or eating spaghetti.The Great Depression had recently struck the country, and Chaplin uses City Lights as a gloomy insight to the lives of the people hit by poverty. The blind flower girl seems to have nothing, yet is rich in soul and spirit that the Tramp is uncontrollably drawn to. The millionaire is emotionally vacated - miserable, angry and intolerable when sober, yet boisterous and care-free when drunk. By contrasting the poor girl with the empty millionaire in his lonely mansion, Chaplin is championing the human spirit over material wealth, a beautiful sentiment brought to life by some fine scenes of comedy, and a profound statement given the harsh, demoralising times. This no doubt was one of the key factors that led to the film's surprising commercial success, with a hungry and unemployed audience given a sense of hope through Chaplin's magic.It is the most satisfying cinematic experience I've ever had - frequently hilarious, awe-inspiring and exquisitely moving. Although Chaplin would carry on making movies and make another masterpiece in Modern Times (1936), this is the last great 'true' Chaplin, his farewell to the era that served him so well. The final scene is the work of a true craftsman, a moment of sheer beauty. Without ruining anything for those who haven't seen it, the close-up of the Tramp's face overcome with emotion is one of the finest displays of acting I've ever come across, and it is easy to see why this scene is now so widely celebrated. A simply magical experience.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
RodrigAndrisan,"Oct 3, 2021",10/10,"Made just 90 years ago, ""City Lights"" remains the ""youngest"" movie ever, thanks to its immortal freshness. Comic scenes, sad scenes, everything is excellent and current, like a real piece of eternal art. The tramp and the blind woman remain the most recognizable and charming characters in the history of the film. I think it's useless to write that Chaplin was an actor, director, screenwriter, producer, editor and author of music. Is that called genius or something more than that?"
CJBx7,"Sep 30, 2015",10/10,"The transition from silent film to sound is undoubtedly the most significant change to affect the cinematic medium. The commercial success of 1927's THE JAZZ SINGER, the first mainstream film to feature talking segments, prompted other studios to either add sound segments to already existing silent films, or create full-length ""talkies."" The public eagerly embraced this new form, but not all were so enthusiastic to abandon mute film. Perhaps the most ardent promoter of silent cinema at this time was Charlie Chaplin.Between 1928 and 1931, the number of silent features steadily dwindled until. In 1930 and 1931, Hollywood produced maybe 4 silent pictures, among the hundreds of sound features that came out in those years. One of them was CITY LIGHTS (1931). If CITY LIGHTS (as well as Chaplin's 1936 MODERN TIMES) serve as an epilogue or elegy for the silent era, it can also be said that Chaplin's film provides a passionate and effective argument for the aesthetic and emotional value of cinema without spoken dialogue.Once again, Chaplin uses his Little Tramp character in a tale that blends humor with pathos. The Tramp makes the acquaintance of two very different characters - a pretty, blind flower girl who lives in poverty (stunningly played by Virginia Cherrill) and an eccentric millionaire (Harry Myers) who only remembers the Tramp when he's drunk. Chaplin, who wrote and directed the film as usual, plays off of the contrast between rich and poor, and once again his Tramp character shows humor and resilience in the face of adversity. When he realizes that the flower girl is in dire financial straits, he does everything possible to help her, and an unexpected love blossoms between the two. There are many funny scenes here - the opening scene with the Tramp sleeping on the statue as it's unveiled, the Tramp and the millionaire attempting to dance in the restaurant, the comical boxing match - all displaying Chaplin's trademark command of visual humor. The flower girl is the emotional anchor of the movie - happy despite her blindness and poverty, she takes in the Tramp as well as the viewer with her incandescent charm. Neither she nor the Tramp have much materially, but their concern for each other illustrate how love can make every life better despite hardship.The acting is superb. Chaplin could seemingly do no wrong on screen, and he shows humor, flamboyance, tenderness and warmth in his portrayal. The biggest revelation is Virginia Cherrill, in her first major film role. Cherrill is wonderfully natural, understated and charming, beautiful and luminous, the center of all of her scenes. She convincingly portrays the blind girl and contributes a performance full of feeling. The interplay between Cherrill and Chaplin at the end of the movie is extraordinarily moving and memorable. Harry Myers is funny and memorable as the millionaire whom the Tramp befriends.Chaplin always employed a rather minimalistic style of cinematography as director. He didn't care to have the camera draw attention to itself, but used it to capture the story in a way that would emotionally involve the audience. Chaplin also composed the score, and it effectively draws out the right emotions from each character and situation.Overall, CITY LIGHTS is a definite classic. SCORE: 10/10"

evanston_dad,"Dec 21, 2005",9/10,"I had the pleasure of seeing a screening of this film (silent, though it came out well into the sound era) with live music accompaniment by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. As you can imagine, this added a tremendous amount to the overall effect of the movie, which I had seen once before on video. This is Chaplin at his most unabashedly sentimental, but darn it if it doesn't work like a charm. This feels the most dramatic of the Chaplin films I've seen, with the most ""plot,"" but that doesn't mean there aren't wildly funny bits, like Chaplin's brief stint as a boxer. I don't cry especially easily at movies, so the ending didn't have me in tears, but you're excused if it has that effect on you, and you might want to have a handkerchief handy just in case.Grade: A"
ilikeimdb,"Apr 13, 2014",10/10,"It certainly helped that I saw this movie (for the first time) with the score played by the San Francisco Symphony. If you ever have the chance to see/hear this performed live (and with an excellent print), don't miss this opportunity. The score by itself is a marvel and really enhances the movie.So, Chaplin plays a tramp who has mostly funny travails in this bitter- sweet commentary on the Great Depression. Chaplin's comedic timing and sense of light fun is still enthralling, even in 2014. All actors play their roles perfectly. Sure, everything's stilted and nothing's real, but contextually the slapstick all hangs together.I commend the SF Symphony for a note-perfect and perfectly timed score. As said above, don't miss the chance to hear/see this performance in your city."

Fun, tender and satire all together in this well rounded piece. Bravo!"
crossbow0106,"Jul 6, 2011",10/10,"Simply put, this is one of the greatest films of all time. Chaplin, playing the familiar tramp, meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) and is touched by her. He also meets a millionaire (Harry Myers) who only seems to be able to tolerate the tramp when he is drunk. The tramp looks to raise money to cure the girl's blindness. The film is funny, poignant and heartwarming. Its full of Chaplin like pratfalls and sight gags, but it also has a tenderness that is both welcome and inspired. A ""silent"" film (Chaplin composed the music, also wonderful), it just doesn't have any dialog. Its so much better for that, it means more. The last scene is probably the greatest in movie history, but watch the whole film and just get immersed in the artistry and brilliance that was Chaplin."
IngmarTheBergman,"Jan 11, 2012",7/10,"I've seen for Chaplin's, I've placed them in this order: 4. The Gold Rush, 3. Modern Times, 2. City Lights and 1. The Great Dictator.When you think of it, City Lights has everything people look for in a movie - comedy, romance, tragedy, action. The one thing City Lights misses is the true meaning that everyone should hear - The Great Dictator has that.The plot is about a tramp (Charlie Chaplin) who falls in love with a beautiful young flower girl. Being blind she suspects the tramp to be rich.There's a great range of humour in the great dictator - ranging from a scene subtle making fun of talkies (City Lights is a silent film) to a blatantly slapstick boxing match. This film could be enjoyed by people of all ages.When you think of a modern comedy you get slightly disappointing, because they have nothing on City Lights. Well, Bob Dylan had it right, The Times They Are-A Changin'.I give City Lights 10/10 for being there to cheer me up and doing that job better than most movies."
bkrauser-81-311064,"Sep 13, 2016",10/10,"City Lights is without exception the most romantic film ever made. What can be more perfectly idyllic and altruistically beautiful than a movie about a big-hearted Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) who falls for a blind flower girl and tries in vain to raise money for an eye operation. The Tramp does so by depending on the largess of a carousing millionaire whose drunken debauchery at one point convinces the girl (Virginia Cherrill) that the Tramp is in-fact a wealthy benefactor and not just a homeless Tramp eager to find love.Effortlessly funny in the way that only Charlie Chaplin can achieve, City Lights has the audacity to once again give voice to the voiceless while being a treasure trove of timeless comedic scenes. There's something about Chaplin's unabashed humanism and sincere romanticism that strikes a cord that willing audiences won't soon forget. While the best of films can make you jump for joy or shed a tear, City Lights and the genius of Chaplin can accomplish both within the same reel.While some may not be keen on silent films, Chaplin's Tramp persona has achieved cinematic immortality through his universal appeal as a struggling but always chipper, limber and silent vaudevillian. His ""Comedy of romance and pantomime"" may just stand the test of time better than any of his films, which is saying a lot since most of his feature films are not just good but visually near-perfect."
redryan64,"Sep 5, 2007",10/10,"Filmed mainly during 1930 for an early 1931 release, CITY LIGHTS stands as a sort of stubborn display of Mr. Chaplin's determination to stick by the Silent Film form. Charlie still preferred a protracted sight gag to 2 pages of scripted ""jokes"".The project had started out to be a ""Talkie"", but somewhere between the start of the shooting and a dispute with his Leading Lady,Virginia Cherrill, the plan was revised in favor of the old way, the method that the Chaplin Company knew and even had been innovators in so many aspects of the Siilent Form.Following his tradition as a sort of Traditional, Classic Story Teller, his cast is credited with portraying characters with no names. The credits in CITY LIGHTS, as in so many of his films up to the 1st true ""Takie"", THE GREAT DICTATOR(1940).The story in a nutshell takes us to the City, any Metropolis would do. The city scape looks much like a huge tank of tropical fish, with the various inhabitants scurrying to and fro, going to thousands of destinations, all moving at variable speeds. The fellow next to you is barely visible to you as you are to him.On occasion, usually quite by accident, two of our urban denizens ""collide"" one way or other, and things slow down enough for some meaningful interaction.The first such occurrence happens when The Little Tramp meets up with a beautiful, young Flower Girl(Leading Lady, Virginia Cherrill), who he soon discovers is blind. Because of the proximity of some Limoseines, the Girl mistakenly believes Charlie to be a Rich Millionaire(and that's the best kind!) The Tramp is obviously smitten by the Girl, and his heart also sympathizes with her affliction.A chance meeting with an intoxicated Millionaire(Harry Myers), who befriends The Tramp, and is his best buddy. There is nothing that he won't do for Charlie, unless of course, he is Sober! When the Millionaire is not under the influence, he does not know the Tramp, nor does he remember whatever promises he made to him! Following a meandering odyssey of menial jobs and incidents follow, in which Charlie both helps to support the Girl and her Grandmother, but at the same time, has hopes of saving up money enough money in order to send her to Europe and a cure for her blindness! In getting the money, The Little Tramp winds up in prison for a ""Robbery"". Once released he is back in the City, where he again meets the Girl.It is at this point that Chaplin gives us his most unusual ending, is not one of the most different wind ups in film History. (If you don'y know what I'm talking about, JUST SEE IT!!) All of this serious talk might lead one to think that there is no humor here. Far from it, as we have a most impressive array of out and out comic action and great gags ever seen, and together in one movie! A few good examples (without giving it away)follows: 1. The opening scene of an Official, White Tie Dedication of a new piece of Public Art*, a new Sculpture in a City Park. 2. An extended bit of interplay between Sanitation Department Street Sweeper(Charlie) and some large animals. 3. The Boxing, the Prizefight between Professional Boxer, (Hank Mann)and the Little Tramp! (about the funniest thing on the screen!) This is one rare Movie, being so well liked by the Public and the Press Boys alike! When the people(Box Office)meets such as written by the Movie Critics(The Film as Art), we are left with a truly, one of a kind only, Comedy Masterpiece.THANK YOU, SIR CHARLES, and may THE LITTLE TRAMP Rest in Peace.NOTE: * Which reminds me: QUESTION: What is the difference between Obscenity and Art?ANSWER: A Federal Grant! (I know it's not germane to the discussion,but the ""Art"" reference brought it up in my mind.)"
grantss,"Oct 25, 2014",9/10,"A Charlie Chaplin classic. But then, many of his movies are classics, and rightfully so.Has the usual Chaplin traits: fantastic, ingenious, ultra-creative visual comedy, plus a great emotional angle.The comedy is brilliant. Some of the scenes are iconic, and have been copied by many great movie makers.Where this differs from his previous movies is that the drama side gets more weight than before. After the almost-continuous comedy of The Circus, his previous movie, the lulls in comedy found in City Lights to advance the plot and develop the characters come as a bit of a shock. Even a let-down. But they are worth it, as the movie builds up to an incredibly emotional final scene. Plus the breaks from the comedy make the comedic scenes even more impactful.An absolute must-see."
dshep,"Feb 27, 2002",N/A,"This, Charlie Chaplin's best full-length film, is perhaps better today than it was to audiences even in his own time. Today we not only see the touching love story play out to a beautiful, bitter sweet ending, but it also serves to take us back in time to 1931. Something of the age vibrates in all of Chaplin's movies; somehow he preserves their style, their grace, and perhaps in this silent movie demonstrates a sensitivity, a gentleness that we've all but lost in todays films. The relationship between the Little Tramp and the flower girl touches the heart so tenderly, yet so deeply, that the viewer comes away a little more human, and perhaps a little more sympathetic to the human condition. Virginia Cherrill is marvelous as the blind flower girl, fragile and wanting, yet wholesomely full of life. This was her first film, and she only acted for five years before marrying and retiring from the screen. We can only sigh and dream of what she might have given us movie buffs if she'd continued. Still, we have the marvelous Charlie Chaplin."
questl-18592,"Jul 27, 2022",6/10,"So, second Chaplin movie I've watched now and I'm starting to think he might not be for me. The man had an obvious talent to him, charisma and energy that's hard to deny but this just didn't land right for me. In all fairness, it might be the time involved. I have seen this story, the lower class person who appears fancy, woos the girl only for her to realize he's not rich and they still live happily ever after. This definitely had a slight variation on that but it's still a very familiar story and, even if it did it first, it's hard to reconcile that with how many other stories have done this.I feel like this is a situation where HE is great but the pieces around him just weren't doing it for me. Oh well, still glad to have seen it!"

We then follow his antics as he falls in love with blind flower girl Virginia Cherrill. He wants to help her get a better life and goes out of his way to ensure this. Does it work out for him?This film is a love story that touches the emotions, especially at the end. Up to that point, the love aspect is sentimental but each sequence contains elements that will make you laugh. Chaplin is very funny. His balance is outstanding for the comedy he performs and his timing is spot on. An amazing talent - no-one to match him since."
chera_khalid,"May 10, 2025",6/10,"Charlie Chaplin's City Lights (1931) is often considered one of the crowning achievements of silent cinema, blending humor and pathos in a way that transcends language. However, with a 6/10 rating, your reaction is in the sweet spot of recognition without total immersion. It's a film that offers brilliance but doesn't necessarily reach every viewer's emotional core.Chaplin's Little Tramp is as endearing as ever-here, he is a man of humility and heart, falling in love with a blind flower girl (played by Virginia Cherrill) whom he believes he can help, both financially and emotionally. The heart of City Lights lies in its tender and poignant moments, especially when Chaplin's character tries to raise enough money for the girl's sight-restoring operation. His performance is a marvel of emotional depth without words-his gestures and expressions speak volumes, and the slapstick humor is tempered with a quiet vulnerability.However, while the film's emotional highs are undeniable, its pacing can feel a little drawn-out. The length of some comedic sequences, which were undoubtedly groundbreaking at the time, can feel excessive in a modern context. The emotional tug of the final scene-arguably one of the most iconic moments in cinema-is powerful, but the build-up to it can feel repetitive.Visually, the film has a grace and elegance that few could match, especially in its handling of the contrast between comedy and pathos. Chaplin's direction and attention to detail create a dreamlike world, full of humor but also tinged with sadness. The use of light and shadow is masterful, emphasizing the Tramp's struggle against the vast city landscape, which mirrors his emotional isolation.The score, which Chaplin composed himself, is sweet and supportive. It enhances the sentimentality of the film, but without being overly manipulative. It's a simple yet effective accompaniment to the gentle comedy and poignant moments.Still, for some viewers, City Lights may not fully resonate. While it holds a monumental place in film history, the emotional and comedic elements may not strike the same chord with modern audiences used to more complex narratives and faster pacing. The film's beauty lies in its simplicity, but sometimes that very simplicity can feel a little too measured.In summary, City Lights is a film you admire rather than wholeheartedly love. A 6/10 reflects your recognition of its historical and emotional significance but acknowledges that it didn't quite hit all the right notes for you."
NateW,"Sep 22, 2002",10/10,"There's some good competition, but City Lights gets my vote as Charlie Chaplin's greatest film. The story of The Tramp and his love for a blind flower girl is simple but the emotional impact is overwhelming. At times hilarious and always touching, the film is a wonderful testament to the power of unconditional love and what some are willing to do for it. It's impossible not to be affected emotionally by the celebrated final scene when The Tramp is reunited the flower girl after she regains her sight.Modern Times, The Great Dictator, and The Gold Rush all come close, but City Lights edges them out with an unforgettable story and celebration of the human spirit that the others can't match. 10/10"
Number 9,"Jul 27, 1999",10/10,"The ending where the the flower girl realizes whom her anonymous benefactor is will make the most hardened film goer break down and cry. No need for sound to hear the most powerful lines to come out of a closing scene: ""you can see now?"" asks the downtrodden tramp. her reply, "" yes. I can see now"".One of only three films in which I have been brought to tears.Perhaps one of the first full length comedies to incorporate drama into its story line. City Lights is a masterpiece."

Does it take the viewer places they didn't think they'd go and make them reassess their idea of film making? Yes. What I am outraged by is that only 1/10th of the IMDb viewers who reviewed ""Memento"" bothered to review City Lights. (No, I haven't reviewed ""Memento."") This film barely beat out an animated movie from 2001 in the IMDb Top 250 but only made it # 42 out of 250. Is it better than many films above it? Yes. Should more people comment on perhaps the greatest love story in the history of film? Yes. That's why I'm outraged. But at least it beat out ""Citizen Kane!"" Kids!"
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mar 5, 2018",6/10,"This silent cinema staple doesn't quite have the heart of 'The Kid (1921)' or anything quite as brilliantly entertaining as the final slapstick set-piece from 'The Gold Rush (1925)', but it does have its lion's share of memorably mute moments proving that Chaplin really is the king of this kind of comedy. 'City Lights (1931)' is enjoyable throughout and tells its story deftly, but there are several slow segments - perhaps somewhat expected from a film of this age but not excused, considering that the era and talent have produced pieces superior in this regard - ultimately making this a fun watch which often represents uproarious cinematic entertainment in its purest form but isn't the best of the bunch. 6/10"
johnnymonsarrat,"May 19, 2004",7/10,"City Lights has many limitations: film-making was new, it's shot in black and white, and it's a silent film. So it's really unfair to say that it compares poorly with the modern film, ""Shakespeare in Love"". But it does. When you watch City Lights, you're doing so not for the story itself but for a glimpse into the past.It's a glimpse worth seeing but there are many problems. Lacking speech, there isn't much plot, and with just gestures and facial expressions there are limits to how much emotional impact the film can have. The high point is some good physical comedy along the lines of what we'd see in a modern Jackie Chan film.Who should see this film:-- Those interested in classics only-- Tramps who can read, drive, and always wear a suit and tieIf this film were made today it would get zero. But as a short peek into antique film-making, I'll give City Lights a 7 out of 10."
Falko_h1,"Jun 10, 2024",5/10,"""City Lights,"" directed by and starring Charlie Chaplin, is a 1931 silent romantic comedy that showcases Chaplin's iconic character, the Little Tramp. The film follows the Tramp as he falls in love with a blind flower girl and endeavors to help her regain her sight through a series of humorous and heartfelt antics.The film's charm lies in Chaplin's masterful blend of comedy and pathos. His physical comedy and expressive acting convey a wide range of emotions, making the silent film format remarkably effective. The narrative is simple yet touching, with moments of genuine sentiment that resonate even today.However, for modern audiences, ""City Lights"" might feel slow-paced and its humor somewhat dated. The lack of spoken dialogue can be a barrier for those accustomed to more contemporary films. Despite these aspects, the film's historical significance and Chaplin's performance remain undeniable highlights.Overall, ""City Lights"" is a classic that offers a glimpse into the early days of cinema, with a mix of humor and heart that can still be appreciated, albeit with some patience from today's viewers."
Kirpianuscus,"Aug 1, 2015",N/A,"an ordinary story. few gags. a love story. and the Tramp. a film who preserves the spirit of a form of cinema who use carefully the emotions of the viewer. because not the great themes are the key but the manner to translate each in a delicate way. the gags, the confusions, the last scene, the box match are embroideries of a special project who not use only the social message or the comedy's solutions but a profound humanitarian message. a film about the other as part of yourself. more profound than other Chaplins. more precise than other Chaplins. because it is an admirable remember about the emotions who defines us. and the great homage to human race."
KubricksRube,"Jun 20, 2004",10/10,"There aren't very many movies with which I can't find a single fault, but this is one of them.  Perfect in execution, in every conceivable way.  This is a film to put in a time capsule.STORY:  A poor, seemingly homeless tramp bounces from one mishap to another, eventually meeting and falling in love with a poor blind girl selling flowers.  She mistakenly assumes he is wealthy and falls genuinely in love with him too.  As her health worsens, he learns of an expensive operation that can bring back her sight.  He sacrifices everything of himself in order to get the money, his time, his effort, his health, his freedom.  I won't spoil the rest of the movie for you, but suffice it to say the ending is probably my favorite of any movie."

It has everything I look for in a film: great comedy, superb story, excellent direction, wonderful acting, even creative cinematography, despite the era. But most of all, it is by far the single best film to depict the nature of unconditional love. And what lesson is more important than that, for all of us?"
uorrett,"Sep 12, 2011",10/10,"I love black and white films, it's amazing to see history before your eyes. It's always great to see the passion of these early actors/directors. Charlie Chaplin was both an actor and a director and did well in both roles. So many think that Chaplin was a simple jester, just making people laugh. But he was much more than that, and this movie attests to that. It can be seen in his movies that Chaplin carries meanings in his roles and this movie is about loving someone more than you love yourself. It's about how a kind man remains kind regardless of the mistreatment that come his way. It's about how love for someone can provide purpose and meaning in someone's life. It's about how miracles can come in the most strangest and unlikely forms. The movie is filled with laughs, joys and tears. For those who like the simplicity of first time cinema, I recommend this movie."
Cinemayo,"Jul 3, 2004",10/10,"My first Chaplin film was a rousing success! I really liked the funny yet heartwarming story, which came very close to putting a tear in my eye at the very end. What was very interesting to me was learning that Chaplin preferred to make this film as a silent, when sound films were now the order of the day. My favorite moments, ""comedy-wise"" had to be the zany boxing match, and the moments just before it where Chaplin is in the room getting nervous prior to the bout. It's not hard to see why so many love Chaplin and consider him a genius. Indeed, I have heard from many Chaplin fans that CITY LIGHTS may be his crowning achievement. This one was so enjoyable the first time around that I imagine it would be hard to top for me! Funny and Heartwarming; A Great Film! **** out of ****"

jlgriffey,"Dec 14, 2006",9/10,"****May contain spoilers***** City Lights is yet another great example of Chaplin's greatness. This film contains many of the Chaplin's usual comedy numbers. In fact, the boxing scene in this film is even better than those from Cinderella Man. However, I think that this film has a very serious message behind all of the comedy.Chaplin was never a man who feared making social commentary. This is more obvious in films like The Great Dictator and Modern Times. Even though City Lights messages are a little more subtle, I think they are still present. The film touches on everything from poverty to wealth and even race.I think the main social commentary in the film can be found in it's views on wealth. The film actually opens up with the city unveiling a large monument. To their surprise, when the pull the curtain the homeless Tramp (Chaplin) is sleeping on the lap of the statue. His presence is seen by the crowd as an unwelcome blemish on the face of their monument. Physical comedy aside, this scene sets the tone for the rest of the film. The whole concept is how the rich want to ignore the poor and pretend they do not exist. This is made completely clear in the relationship between Chaplin and the eccentric millionaire. In fact, when the first meet the millionaire is attempting to kill himself. He is actually saved by a homeless man telling him that ""the birds will sing tomorrow."" This total irony is the kind of tool that Chaplin uses to illustrate his point. Another aspect of the this relationship that illustrates the same point is the fact that when the rich man is drunk, Chaplin is his best friend. However, when he sobers up he wants nothing to do with him. He even pretends not to know him some times. This shows in no uncertain terms, that Chaplin saw the rich as being afraid to help the poor.In fact, one of the only people that will actually talk to Charlie is a blind girl who sells flowers. This seems like a typical screen romance. However, when you delve deeper I think that you can see it is not. Through out the film, I think you can confuse this relationship as puppy love. Then as the plot unfolds a couple of apparent thoughts surface. The blind girl actually thinks that Charlie's character is a millionaire. I think that in hind sight it is easy to see that the more Charlie pretends to be rich, the more she likes him. In fact, this can perhaps be seen in the ending sequence. The girl now able to see and the owner of a whole flower store thanks to the money that Charlie provides is always waiting on him to arrive. The catch is, that she has never seen Charlie before. At one point a rich man walks in, and the girl gets a look on her face that shows she thinks that her prince has arrived. When it isn't him, she says she hopes he comes soon. Then ironically, a totally beaten down Tramp walks by her store window. From inside the store, she actually laughs at him when local paper boys pick on him. Then we he sees her and is obviously madly in love, she taunts him even further. In fact, when she does realize that this tramp is her knight in shining armor comes the clincher. The girl's face shows not love or gratitude. There is no hug or kiss, for the man that saved her. Only a disappointed look and her saying that now she can see. I think that this more than any other point in the film is where the message is really hammered home. When Charlie's only friend now has some money, and sees him for the poor person that he is she is saddened. It is really quite a dark thought. I mean this is a man, who got beaten up in a boxing match and even shoveled fecal matter off the street just to try and help his love pay her rent. I think this sad thought is one that Chaplin hoped would open the audience's eyes to this problem.Besides the obvious economic views in the movie, we have other examples of social commentary. The boxing scene has a very interesting one to me. Not only does it show these boxing people turning the poor into punching bags, so they can fill their arena but there is a race issue as well. In this scene the black boxer is shown not only as superstitious, but he actually gets pummeled by a white boxer. Then there is also a major homosexual under current in this scene as well. Charlie is shown as seemingly gay in the locker room. He makes gay gestures as well as faces towards his opponent. If you think this is not true, then why does the man change his pants behind a curtain? I think the fact that Charlie and the black boxer are shown as outcast in the locker room is some kind of commentary on the thoughts of the time. In fact, the homosexual theme is also prevalent with the millionaire and Charlie. Always hugging and drinking. At one point Charlie actually wakes up in bed with the millionaire. I think the film at times shows the desperate Charlie as a male prostitute to the millionaire. I am not sure if this is what Charlie meant to do, but it is definitely something to look at when you view the film.In closing, this film is just as much a masterpiece as everything else that Chaplin has done. The comedy and commentary mix together to form one very striking and memorable film. I think that is why is is still held in such high regards, even to this day."
mjneu59,"Nov 10, 2010",10/10,"Say what you want about his politics, his love life, his Victorian sentiment, or his overwhelming ego; if Charlie Chaplin had never made another film he would still be justifiably famous, not only for creating a masterpiece, but for single-handedly keeping the art of silent comedy alive long after its untimely death. It's ironic how the passing of silence liberated Chaplin to a point where he could fully express his pantomime genius and find, at long last, the elusive tertium quid between laughter and tears. Was there ever a more unpredictable companion than millionaire Harry Myers, matching the Little Tramp drink for drink until the sober light of dawn revealed the callous Jekyll behind his generous Hyde? And was there ever a more heartbreaking moment than the final, devastating close-up, when the once blind flower girl confronts the shabby vagabond she thought was her handsome young benefactor? ""I can see now"", her poignant last words, leave more unsaid than Chaplin would later be in the habit of leaving, and however unintended reveal striking insight at a time when every other movie was saying, ""I can hear now""."
lacrossezombie,"Jul 26, 2011",10/10,"The first time I saw this movie I fell in love, and it instantly became one of my favorites. I just watched it the other night again and it still had a similar effect. This masterpiece directed by the great Charlie Chaplin is his best I've seen so far. It tells the tale of a poor tramp who meets a beautiful women selling flowers, and quickly finds out she is blind. When she begins to believe he is a wealthy man, the poor man goes along with it and begins to try and impress her. This may sound like some kind of romantic comedy that no one would want to see, but trust me, its far from that.The tramp starts off with his antics right from the get go, and even though its all through the movie, they never get old. It is always something new, and it keeps it interesting. That's the thing about this movie, its not like The Kid or The Great Dictator where all or most of the gags revolve around a certain topic or event, this story was made where the lead character can go on many adventures during the film, but it still ends up coming full circle to the most important story of them all. That's why this isn't just a romantic comedy, its more than that.For people who have never seen a Chaplin movie, or at least a full length film of his, it may seem like this movie would be all slapstick. Yes, there is slapstick, and a lot of it. However, the comical time is perfect and I found myself laughing at a lot of these gags, and I normally don't find that type of humor funny, Also, if you look deeper, you will soon see there is much more depth then one would think. It tells the story of a kind poor man trying to help everyone he meets and especially the ones he cares about. The Tramp meets this young women and soon goes to great lengths to help her when she is in need, more then most people would ever do. This loving side of him brings him through hilarious and memorable journeys. Along with the amazing score, this movie is prefect.For anyone who even is CONSIDERING watching this, I strongly, strongly suggest you do. With gags that will leave you laughing for weeks, but also a heartwarming tale that will leave you satisfied, it is enough to make any movie lover happy, no matter what kind of person you are.The only person I could think that would not enjoy it would be someone who hates slapstick, but really, I was never a fan of it, but when I found Mr.Charlie Chaplin's work I realized how funny it could actually be when done right. 10/10, one of the greatest movies of all time."
Petey-10,"Jun 20, 2007",10/10,"In the beginning you find our poor little tramp sleeping on a statue.Then he runs into a suicidal and drunken millionaire, whose life he saves.And what would our poor little tramp be without love? Even poorer and more miserable.The woman he falls for is a flower girl, and she's blind.And this blind flower girl thinks the tramp is a rich man.But he's only rich at heart.He wants to help the girl, he wants her to see.But if she does see, would she love him? Our poor little tramp? Nobody is better at combining tragedy and comedy better than Charles Chaplin was.This is a fact I have mentioned in previous Chaplin reviews and this is something all the movie lovers have probably noticed.City Lights (1931) is one great example of those movies where comedy meets tragedy.Take the scene with the Eccentric Millionaire for example.He is there ready to jump into the water when our little tramp wanders to the spot.Soon they're both in the water.Comedy meets tragedy, laughter meets tears.I could mention plenty of other examples but you can see it all by watching this movie.If you already have, watch it again.It's a true classic that will not age.And the acting performances...they're all superb.Besides Chaplin there is Virinia Cherrill as A Blind Girl.She is so beautiful...such a good actress.And then there's Florence Lee as her grandmother.Harry Myers is fantastic as the moody millionaire.And so is Al Ernest Garcia as his Butler.The Keystone Kop Hank Mann plays A Prizefighter.The big man Henry Bergman is known from other Chaplin films also.Here he plays the Mayor/Blind Girls downstairs neighbor.Jean Harlow can be seen as an Extra in restaurant scene.The original music made by Charlie himself is masterly.Chaplin didn't want to give up silent pictures.And why would he have? Things could very well be told without words.He did use some simple sound effects in this film and then Modern Times (1936).City Lights is filled with memorable scenes like when Charlie goes boxing.And when he goes dancing drunk is hilarious.And let's not forget the ending.The ending is beautiful."
marceldunay,"Dec 28, 2023",7/10,"A genuinely funny and charming movie. The slapstick comedy was incredibly creative and the score was really great too. This was the first Chaplin movie and the first silent film I've ever watched, so it took me a while to really get into it and go with the flow of things, but once I did, I enjoyed it quite a bit. The boxing match is probably what I'll most remember from this film. The choreographed movements between the fighters and the ref was mesmerizing and this scene had two or three of the best slapstick moments. Only have this as a 7 because I'd have a hard time rating a silent movie any higher than this, given that it is so different from what I'm used to, but maybe after watching a few more silent movies, my opinion could change."
Shilo_R_A,"Nov 29, 2022",5/10,"City Lights is a silent film made by the one, the only, Mr. Charles Chaplin. The film is quite straight forward plot-wise: there's this tramp guy who falls in love with a blind girl who's selling white flowers. She's quite nice to him, in strike contrast to almost every other person in the whole city, and so he can't get her out of his mind. That night he meets a weird, suicidal rich guy, saves his life and so begins a peculiar friendship (of sorts) between the two. These are the main plotlines, which of course affect each other at all times.This film is...well...it's okay. I don't have a lot to say about it, but I'll try my best to explain my feelings here. Some moments here made me smile, alright. Some moments were quite fun. I particularly enjoyed the ""let's burn the city"" scene, at the party. Fun dynamics and good flow all around. The way this film utilizes sound is also pretty cool, and I can definitely appreciate how the score emphasizes many comic moments, similar to the way old Disney films do it.However, I can't say that I'm emotionally invested in the slightest, that the comedy always hits (as I said, mostly amusing but nothing more) or even that the characters are more than a bunch of clichés. That's just the way it is. Again, nothing bad, but many things are just mediocre at best.So, yeah, I definitely don't understand the disproportionate hype around this piece of cinema. It's amusing, yeah, it has some fun moments, but it's mostly dry and full of clichés. The humor is nothing more than okay most of the time, and I'm just not that invested in the movie. Extremely overrated. I'm feeling a 5.7/10 on this one."
hrg68,"Dec 9, 2008",N/A,"I realize this review is a little late- I apologize. Saw the Chaplin flick ""City Lights"" last night, and I was really impressed. It was full of socialist commentary and beautiful women. The last scene made me cry (well OK, maybe just get a little maudlin). It was great, because it was all about good karma. I really enjoyed the scenes of Chaplin working on this film on the ""Special Features"" disc of the ""Chaplin Collection"". Especially enlightening was the story of Chaplin's conflict with his ingénue Virginia Cherrill. The outtakes of his replacement for her character, Georgia Hale, after he fired her (temporarily) show that as good as an actor/actress is, they are not perfect for every role. Sometimes you need someone totally outside of the game, as Cherill was, in order to create perfection on film, which the last scene is."
Boba_Fett1138,"Jan 25, 2008",10/10,"The jokes and comical moments are all performed in such an incredible high pace and very well timed and choreographed. The comical moments follow each other very rapidly. Big over-the-top hilarious situations as well as small subtle ones. You have no time to think about the one joke, since the next one is already occurring at that very moment. The movie is that fast going. Blink once and you'll miss something funny. This is slapstick film-making at its very best.Charles Chaplin performs his role with great charisma and agility, It's a quite psychical movie for him. The movie features jumping, falling and climbing, as you would obviously expect from a '30's slapstick movie.I must admit that a few of the Chaplin movies don't live up to their reputations but this one on the other hand really does. It's certainly one of the best comedies of the '30's and of all time. A true timeless comedy classic!But as you would expect from a Chaplin movie, it also is a movie with lots of heart and humanity. No matter how crazy the movie gets in parts, the movie never loses any of its credibility when it comes down to its drama and pureness. The movie is also made in a more realistic style, rather than a comical one that clearly and also predictably builds up toward a comical situations. This makes the movie all the more hilarious and strengthens the comical moments.The movie just doesn't only rely on its jokes and Chaplin antics but also has a great and compelling story of its own. It's a quite well written story, that moves over to a lot of different places and locations throughout and is therefore also loaded with lots of characters and situations. It makes the movie also very original.An absolute delightful movie!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
moviestics,"Aug 7, 2014",9/10,"City Lights, made back in 1930, is a love story featuring our favorite funny character, the Tramp. First time,I watched this movie two years back with my friends. That time we laughed very much. But as I was watching the movie, I felt that I have to watch this movie alone sometime to get the feel and the message of the movie. Unfortunately, I was very busy those days and couldn't watch it back then but I watched it again yesterday. And this time there was much more than just laughs I got. I loved this film. And I can challenge everyone who says A Walk to Remember or The Notebook are the best love stories! The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is introduced to us sleeping in the lap of a large statue. People, who have come to watch the giant statue, shoo him away. He is just wandering when he sees a girl selling flowers. He stops and buys a flower. But the girl drops the flower by mistake. He sees that she is looking for the flower in the wrong place and he realises that she is blind. He feels bad for her. He is also very poor and he can well understand her situation. He wants to say something but instead he leaves.At night, he sees a guy trying to kill himself. He convinces him in giving up this idea. The guy takes the Tramp back to his home. He is a millionaire and the Tramp can't figure out why he was trying to kill himself when he is having every pleasure. They become very good friends and the Tramp asks him for some money. The next day, the Tramp buys all the flowers from the blind girl. She is happy, and he is happier than her. The blind girl reaches her home and tells her mother about the millionaire customer she has had today. She thinks him as a millionaire as well as a very big hearted person. She is also having many problems at her home. The rest of the film is pretty much about the Tramp trying to help the girl and sometimes asking the millionaire for some help. Will he be able to help the girl? How will things end up with the millionaire and the Tramp? All the answers are lying in the movie further with a heart-touching ending of the film. Along will all these, there will be many scenes where there will be tears in your eyes just because of laughing.Charlie Chaplin, as most of the times, is the director-writer-producer- composer-editor-actor of the film. And he wins, again as most of the times, in everything. First talking about Chaplin the director-writer, he is brilliant. Needless to say, the story of the film is amazing. Comedy scenes are superbly written and directed and also there are few fighting scenes but Chaplin knows very well how to make them funny. And when I say funny here, I mean hilarious. Though I loved every scene in the film, but still I would like to mention a couple here: Of course the last scene in the film, then the scene where the millionaire invites the tramp for dinner and the fight scene between the Tramp and the boxer who was changed when the original had to flee and with the original one, the Tramp had a pact of 50-50 if he lets the Tramp win. Both the scenes are insanely funny. And I think I won't be able to stop my laughter even if I'm watching them for 10th time. I don't have to say much about Chaplin the actor. I will definitely fall short even if I write a page in his praise. According to me, there have been only one actor who has delivered every performance with no more scope of improvisation: Charlie Chaplin. He has played the Tramp for about forty years. To tell you the truth, I can't imagine him otherwise. I have watched many of his movies and I have loved his performance in all of them. In this movie, he is excellent. In emotional scenes also, he is brilliant. He has had a great impact on the film industry and it won't be an oversaying that he actually revolutionized the genre and the industry.Chaplin the composer does a swell job. Music changes accordingly with the requirements of the film. This is a silent movie and so music becomes a very important part. It supports the funny scenes brilliantly. The movie is black and white so there is not a question of brilliant visuals. The cinematography is good overall. About the other actors in the film, the blind girl is played by Virginia Cherrill and she is very convincing in the role. Her later films didn't see much success and she dropped her film career. The millionaire Harry Myres and he is good. As required, he is very funny. He trusts our Tramp and helps him very much, with his money of course. All other actors are fine.City Lights is definitely one of the best Chaplin movies, if not the best. I loved this movie and while writing this review, going back to every point and remembering everything is making me watch this movie again. You know what? I will watch the movie again after I finish this review. There has been a lot of discussion about the movie title ""City Lights"". Many believe that ""city lights"" are allegorical for the types of shallow luxuries and excess that can be found under the lights of the city, e.g., the rich man's drinking, cars, and clothing, when compared to the life of the Tramp and the blind flowergirl. I am kinda satisfied with this theory. City Lights is a very special film for me and I will remember this film for a long long time. And I will definitely watch it many times."
SAMTHEBESTEST,"Apr 5, 2021",9/10,"City Lights (1931) :
Brief Review -Another Emotional Masterpiece by Chaplin whose Climax will haunt me FOREVER. You know I often try to separate the films which have left me speechless with their haunting climaxes, and guees what? Chaplin has the most number of such films in my list. The Circus (1928), City Lights (1931), The Great Dictator (1940) and Limelight (1952) are those 4 films of Charles Chaplin that left me stunned with their climax scenes. City Lights is so emotional, impulsive and generous by nature that any person with the heart at right place just can't hate it. And beyond that, can't stop crying in the those last 5 minutes when your heart will be going through a massive pain attack. That face Chaplin makes while accepting the flower in the climax is just wonderful, unbeatable and unthinkable. Believe me, i will never forget that one moment as long as i am watching films in this life. So, City Lights is another social plug-in by Chaplin but this time without any negative effects. This one is full of positiveness and kindness. With the aid of a wealthy erratic tippler, a dewy-eyed tramp who has fallen in love with a sightless flower girl accumulates money to be able to help her medically. Charles Chaplin delivers one hell of a performance which is beyond any award trophies and critics listing. The audience will remember his act in City Lights FOREVER and that's the biggest honour any actor could ever receive. With the terrific dose of comedy and pacy screenplay City Lights passes the time quickly and you don't even get time to prepare for that heart-wrenching climax. It hits you and it hits you so hard even before you realise that it has just happened and it stays with you for a while even after the screen is gone blank. Overall, A MASTERPIECE beyond emotional measurements.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest."
Spondonman,"Aug 5, 2004",9/10,"A truly marvellous film, one to watch over and over again (as I have) and not tire of. If I remember right Chaplin basically made it up as he went along, with only the bones of the story and the ending in mind, tens of thousands of scene retakes later. This put the lid on silent films for good, CL could not have been bettered if they'd tried - and Chaplin did of course but failed with Modern Times.There's so many gags in CL it's pointless to pick any one out - the boxing match hardly counts as a gag, more a work of art - overall it's a relentless 80 minutes, the usual Chaplin roller-coaster of emotion. The dedicated know all this, the ones who only like violent colour talkies will scoff after having wasted their time trying to understand why this movie is so highly regarded. I wonder if they switch off before the end?The original for the set for the outside the blind girl's home still exists in Lambeth today, along of course with many other surviving places of Chaplin interest."
UR60x,"Sep 12, 2006",10/10,I just finished watching this movie for the third time in this month and wow what a great movie is it. Charlie Chaplin was a great comedian and everybody knows that but in this movie along with some great comedy you get to watch some amazing story of romance with emotions and love. In those days there was no sound at all in the movies and the actors have to perform very well in order to convey their messages to the viewers and every single artist in this movie did it beautifully. Virginia Cherrill portrayed the character of blind girl beautifully. I have seen many movies that were made before 2nd world war but with all do respect those were nothing as compare to this movie.On the whole this movie is great and I recommend it to everyone especially who likes classics and comedy. I give it 10/10.
CinemaSerf,"Jul 14, 2024",7/10,"Virginia Cherrill charmingly plays a young, blind, flower seller whom the tramp (Charlie Chaplin) falls for, hook line and sinker. Later that night, he is crossing a bridge when he encounters a suicidal, dipso, millionaire (Harry Myers) whom he convinces to hang about for a while longer, and who by way of appreciation invites him to a party at his mansion, then to a series of evening entertainments. Thing is, when he wakes up with the mother of all hangovers next morning, though, he has never a clue who the tramp is and so gets his butler to send him packing. Meantime, still determined to help his new love, our kindly vagrant reads in a newspaper that there might be might be a cure for her blindness - but it will be expensive. His boozy buddy offers him $1,000 to help but when, as usual in the morning, he sobers up and denies all knowledge of the ""gift"". The police are called and things now take a series of unhappy turns that force the tramp to think of other ways of raising the cash. This challenge is especially spurned on when he discovers that she has left her usual selling spot and is now quite poorly and being taken care of by her grandmother (Florence Lee) - and they are facing eviction. It's probably his attempts at boxing that provide for most of the entertainment here, but there are plenty of other humorous exploits - especially between him and Myers and the scenes with Cherrill are touching and joyous, too. Chaplin keeps the pace moving along well with plenty of variety in a film that's a gem to watch."

cmtenasitas,"Dec 10, 2024",7/10,"Chaplin always makes beautiful films, with messages that aim to be good, not profound, but good nonetheless. The problem is that in this film and in the previous one, The Circus, I felt that he no longer manages to surprise the audience. In a way, his jokes are expected, and what used to be a big laugh is now just a smile. That is to say, it's still a good movie but it can't compare to his first feature films, when he shone the brightest. In this film, it was the whole fight scene, which unfortunately isn't very long, the rest doesn't compare. Maybe I'm too demanding, but geniuses should be held to a higher standard and not just praised for anything they do. I'm not saying this film is anything, but I think you understand what I mean."
pghmoe,"Oct 6, 2001",N/A,"I just saw this film for the very first time-on the big screen during a summer film festival. And I consider myself to be very fortunate.A true testiment to Chaplin's genius, there are many set peices such as the opening statue dedication and the boxing match that one cannot describe; you just have to view it. And the story is a brillaint mixture of comedy and pathos all wrapped up in the final, touching and haunting scene."
planktonrules,"Mar 23, 2006",10/10,"This movie is artistically beautiful--with nice cinematography, music, etc. Some of this can be attributed to this being a sound-era movie (hence better equipment) but I've gotta admit Chaplin had a great eye--the film is quite pretty and exquisitely made. There were some cute little skits and laughs spread throughout the film. During the boxing match, I barely laughed (though it was well done) and my wife almost fell on the floor laughing. However the film was able to provide a decent number of laughs---even though the story was also brimming with pathos. And wow...it will definitely bring tears to your eyes. I could say more, but I think it's best you just see it for yourself. It's not my favorite Chaplin film but it is amazingly good.One final observation about this film as well as Modern Times: While these films are firmly stuck in the past (silent movies well into the sound era), it was a smart decision on Chaplin's part to do this as well as to only make a few films he could really devote his energy into. Lloyd and especially Keaton strongly embraced the sound era and churned out quite a few films in the late 20s-early 30s--and some of them stunk when compared to their silent films. If I were watching any of these three comedians in a film from the sound era, it would definitely be Chaplin, as he didn't try to change the basic formula. Unfortunately with Keaton in particular, as MGM paired him with the very very very talkative and pushy Jimmy Durante and completely tossed out what had been great about Keaton's earlier films, his film quality plummeted."
Elizabeth-328,"Aug 10, 1999",10/10,"This is the greatest of all of Charlie Chaplin's ""little tramp"" movies.  I was never a fan of silent movies, but Chaplin's were so great, that he kept them going until the late 1930's.This movie is so brilliant.  I adore the love story between the tramp and the blind girl.  The things he does to try to raise money for her rent are really funny!  Everyone recalls seeing the boxing match, one of the most famous scenes.The ending is so sad, when the girl is no longer blind, but does not recognize the tramp because she thought her benefactor was wealthy.  This always breaks my heart!!~""City Lights"" is a great movie, and my favorite movie featuring Chaplin's famous character.  This movie gets a 10 out of 10!"
piperian396,"Aug 6, 2008",10/10,"This movie is just plain beautiful. This movie proves how Charlie Chaplin could make you feel for a character without saying a word. This movie may not be the funniest Charlie Chaplin movie, but it is the most dramatic. It is amazing that even with all of these silly physical comedy bits you can still get caught up in character development. Chaplin was truly a master of his craft.No need for me to explain the plot, other people have done that (and they do better than I would)No matter who you are, see this movie!!!Watch this movie and be amazed."
Loring,"Aug 14, 2002",10/10,"As it becomes clear how the film is going to end you want to yell at the screen, ""No, don't let it end that way!"" except you know it has to end that way.  The best Chaplin film and one of the 10? 5? 3? best films of all time. You want to know what it means to be a human being? You want to teach your children what it means to be a human being and can't find the words?  Do two things:  set a good example for them every day and watch this film with them when they are old enough to understand and appreciate it. Superb."
behnamboogi,"Nov 18, 2024",6/10,"Chaplin gradually used the ""Vagabond"" character from 1914, and today everyone knows his movie character with this famous face. His mustache, coat, and cane quickly became popular among American audiences, and he also used the same character in the city lights. At the beginning of the film, we see a millionaire being saved by a vagabond who does not allow him to drown. Meanwhile, the tramp has fallen in love with a blind girl who sells flowers and spends his last money to buy her a flower branch. The love story of the vagabond and the flower girl continues until it reaches its famous ending. The scene in which Chaplin and Virginia Cheryl's brilliant acting makes you deeply affected by the emotional burden of the film. Many critics in the history of cinema have considered this ending as the greatest example of the power of silent cinema, but in fact, you can understand the emotional intensity and body games of the actors only if you see it in the context of the film as a whole.Although City Lights has powerful emotional moments, it is still primarily a comedy, and contains some of Chaplin's best moments of physical comedy. When you think about the memory of watching the movie after a long time, you don't remember it as a silent work and your mind goes to the impressive narration and unique music of the movie. ""City Lights"" is the pinnacle of Charlie Chaplin's art in cinema and does not need any dialogue, a lasting film that will keep the memory of this genius of silent cinema alive for years to come."
Primtime,"Nov 25, 1998",8/10,"I must say once again that Chaplin has met and exceeded my expectations for his film-making greatness. City Lights is a cinema masterpiece in which the little tramp falls for a blind girl, befriends a rich man and must find ways to make money to send the blind girl away to get her sight restored.There are many memorable scenes in this film, most notable are the scene in which the tramp and his friend hit a party on the town, the scene in which the tramp and his friend come upon burglars in the rich man's house, the boxing match and the ending in which the blind girl realizes who the tramp is.I wouldn't rank City Lights above The Gold Rush - another Chaplin masterpiece - however, City Lights will remain as one of my all-time favourites and a must-see for anyone who loves films.8/10 stars."
songweilonglatiao,"Jul 4, 2020",7/10,"Black and white movies are too boring and boring for many audiences who are used to Hollywood blockbusters. But there is a person's work will not, his work, can make people laugh from beginning to end."
Mr Wade,"May 10, 2002",N/A,"The film often considered to be Chaplin's masterpiece, and one of the true landmarks of cinema.  ""City Lights"" may not be the most skillfully constructed of Chaplin's Little Tramp movies, but it is undoubtedly his most powerful and satisfying.Chaplin has been known for the sentimentality that coexists with the comedy in his movies, but rarely has he used as many pathos as he does here. Chaplin, however, refuses to manipulate his audience with weepy, overblown sappiness.  He instead plays out his dramatic scenes in a genuinely convincing manner with a dose of humor sprinkled into it.Although there are some classic scenes in the first half of the film (most notably the scenes with the Tramp befriending a rich drunk), most of the movie's greatness comes in the second half.  One of Chaplin's finest moments has the Tramp boxing for a fifty-dollar purse.  It would be useless to try and describe how beautifully and hilariously choreographed the sequence is; one simply has to appreciate it on their own.The film's greatest moment is, undeniably, the final scene.  Everything about it (acting and music especially) is masterfully executed.  The scene is so sublimely uplifting and inspiring, it leaves one in a state of mild euphoria, if only for a short time."
aron-stoner,"Feb 9, 2015",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin's City Lights is about the Tramp who has fallen for a blind flower girl and tries to come to aid. This has to be one of the most beautiful movies i have seen! both visionary and story wise. It features some of the best acting I've seen from Chaplin ever, mixed with tons of giggles romance and a beautiful score also written by Chaplin! and just to add on to that it has in my opinion the best ending to a film period! City Lights should be seen by anyone, both by people who watch silent films frequently and by the general public alike. It is a film with so much charisma that you can't help falling in love with the tramp and the blind flower girl. This is truly a one of cinema greatest achievements and a stepping stone in film history."
ciao77,"Oct 2, 2007",10/10,"I have loved Chaplin's work since childhood, and through the years have grown to appreciate his art and talent more and more. The plot is simple: the tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl, played by Virgnina Cherrill, and goes to great (and humorous) lengths to raise money for a surgery that is to restore her sight. This is the classic Tramp character at his finest. In City Lights, Chaplin brings such depth to the character, but never fails to amaze with his brilliant comic talent. Cherrill also does a magnificent job; it's almost as though she was really blind, without a hint of even seeing her surroundings.This film was rated as one of the top 100 films of all time (AFI, 1998), within the top 20. At the time of production, nearly all filmmakers turned to films with sound. But of course Chaplin did not cave in, and produced a fantastic silent film, at a time when adding sound was all the rage. Thank goodness for that!I recommend City Lights to absolutely anyone- it never fails to amaze."
marioxavie,"Oct 14, 2001",10/10,"This movie can be considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made.  A comic masterpiece, and perhaps Chaplin at his best.  I cannot help but cry every time I see it.  This has perhaps one of the deepest endings in movie history.  We tend not to recognize the influence Chaplin has had on us all and how many people he has inspired.  A touching movie that shows us the true meaning of love."

jwalzer5,"Jun 1, 2002",10/10,"Let's face it: Chaplin's ""City Lights"" is a great film, but it's not flawless.  The inspired bits: Charlie making the acquaintance of the Flower Girl, the boxing match, the achingly beautiful, ambiguous, close of the film where Chaplin walks an emotional tightrope between sentiment and sincerity, and succeeds brilliantly - these are incredible and unforgettable moments in cinema, and Chaplin deserves the plaudits he's received.  But such moments are interspersed throughout the film, which is punctuated with long stretches of tedium. Chaplin's inspiration was fitful, and it shows. Nevertheless, on balance, ""City Lights"" is a masterpiece, rising above it's author's shortcomings to become a cinematic landmark which any student of Film would do well to study."
willieb,"Jun 20, 1999",N/A,"Older and especially silent movies get short shrift because we all like the 'new.' There is nothing new under the sun. This Chaplin masterpiece is variably maudlin, silly, tendentious, unbearably funny and sad. Scathing indictment of capitalism without a soul,  the Little Tramp gives us an idea of how we should feel about others; alas, an impossible goal--even for Chaplin, in real life. I stand by my statement that the ending is the best in movie history. Period. --if one has a human heart."
alpmusluoglufrc,"Apr 2, 2021",10/10,"Charli Chaplin tells us that almost none of our problems matter. As you can see in the movie, Chaplin's problems are impossible to see, as he is happy and kindhearted.Also, love takes on an extra reality in this movie."
octamember,"May 10, 2006",10/10,"I was lucky enough to see a live big-screen performance of this movie featuring the St. Louis symphony. Not being a film-buff by any stretch I knew of Charlie Chaplin mostly by his mustache and little else. For Christmas my girlfriend bought me tickets to the performance by the St. Louis symphony, she hadn't seen the film either but thought it would be an interesting cultural experience... Turns out it was more than interesting, it was superbly entertaining as well! Its a funny thing, the movie on one hand is full of campy physical comedy, but there is nothing saccharin or over-done about it... I believe its because Chaplin is so genuine. Charlie Chaplin can make you laugh with his characters foolishness in one scene, wit in another, and then touch your heart with genuine compassion that is absent from today's movies.For purity of story its hard to beat this superbly crafted film experience."
Horror-yo,"Dec 27, 2016",8/10,"Chaplin can be chaotic, he will be outrageously original, he can be a great cinematographer (music composer, directing, script etc...)...but at the center of it all is his humanity, the warmth of his heart, the ""real"" that he had. He was such a sensitive man, everything he made turned to gold it seemed.This film here is of the most chaotic of his arsenal but as always, an organized well tamed chaos at that. From the very get-go, that film is just an absolutely surrealistic highway speedrun, while never failing to make that plot exist with clarity.Here, it's the same formula: Chaplin starts from knowing absolutely no one, he comes into contact with..someone who can help him in one way or the other. Then, that girl.There's as much laugh out loud material as there is strong cinematic craft, never a dull moment despite the fact Chaplin has in places very little to deal with (still makes a hilarious science out of it). You'll absolutely find yourselves forgetting you're after all watching a fully silent film, there's so much fun on display. Ending is very touching, although indirectly inspired from Dickens' Great Expectations in spirit.Beautiful little Chaplin film."
I_Ailurophile,"Aug 31, 2023",10/10,"How many comedians can possibly claim to have found monumental, enduring success and respect in the way that Charlie Chaplin did? Why, how many famous persons, generally, can claim such success and respect? How many films have ever been made that are greater than 'City lights?' The number cannot possibly be very high. From the opening scene it's so terrifically clever and funny as to inspire hearty laughter; within but minutes it also proves capable of such heartfelt beauty as to inspire tears. Scarcely has it begun and there can be no dispute that one of the best movies ever made, or that ever will be made, was a silent movie released in 1931, a solid few years after talkies had already been introduced.What sparing non-synchronized sound the picture does employ is utterly brilliant, a stroke of genius that only ever adds to the comedy, and the music is an utter joy as it bolsters the mood at any given time. The sets are gorgeous in their detail, and the costume design, hair, and makeup could hardly be any sharper. Meanwhile, as Chaplin himself writes, directs, and produces in addition to starring, I truly don't know which element of his skill set is stronger. The story he penned is nothing if not magnificent; all the endless gags he wove into the proceedings are simply outstanding, and when the saga aims to be sweet and stirring there is precious little comparison. At the same time, Chaplin was such a tremendous performer - in his range, nuance, personality, and emotional depth, absolutely, but also in his unflagging willingness to put himself in any situation, and sacrifice his body, in the name of entertainment. Yet for the intricacy and many moving parts of the gags, and even more so for the incredible buzzing energy that this sustains at its most outrageous and at its most sincere, it might be his direction that is most admirable of all in 'City lights.' Then again, the very last moments are so entirely perfect - surely one of the most exquisite endings in all of cinema - that maybe it is, after all, the acting that stands out most. Every last facet and small moment is shaped only with utmost care and intelligence, and the result of the man's undeniably stupendous vision is plainly stellar.Whenever there might be a slight pause in one capacity or another, it is fleeting and only engineered to set up the next bit, whether that be another illustration of exemplary wit and humor or another major beat in the earnest, compelling narrative we get alongside. Just as much to the point, as one scene follows another Chaplin illustrates a shrewd mind for finding the best way to twist the next moment to serve the comedy, the underlying tale, or both. It's noteworthy that such pauses do not particularly include the intertitles, for though these are indeed used, mostly to impart pieces of dialogue, the overall approach here is definitively visual with little need for any but the most minute of exposition. And the sum total of all this, especially given the excellent stunts and effects, is a viewing experience that is wonderfully fun, satisfying, and rewarding, and that goes by smoothly and all too quickly. Of course the title's reputation is all but peerless, as is Chaplin's, and one can assume enjoying themselves here. It cannot be overstated, however, what a marvelously smart, funny film this is, and there are genuinely very few that can come close to matching the superb, flawless blend of mirth and heart. I can understand why older movies don't always appeal to all viewers, but some classics transcend any squabbles about personal preference: no matter who you are and what you generally like in cinema, 'City lights' is an essential must-see, and that's all there is to it."

aidaneccleston,"Jul 13, 2024",7/10,"Chaplin's still got it. The guy's a legend at slapstick, and he throws down some seriously funny scenes that had me laughing out loud. The boxing match? Classic. It's cool to see how well the humor holds up, even if it's all silent and black and white. Plus, the way he mixes the goofy stuff with some sweeter moments is pretty clever, though sometimes it gets a tad too sentimental for my taste.Overall, I'd give City Lights a 7/10. It's definitely worth a watch for the comedy alone, and Chaplin's charm is off the charts as the Tramp, especially when he's bumbling around, trying to help out the blind girl. But while the heartwarming bits are nice and all, they kind of slow the pace down and make parts of the movie drag a bit. Still it's a solid film that shows why Chaplin's considered one of the greats, even if the mushy stuff isn't really my thing."
andysevenfold,"Nov 3, 2019",8/10,"City Lights (1931) is a silent comedy movie that is directed by Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin plays a Tramp who falls in love with a blind girl who believes he is a rich man. He then saves a rich mans life, who proceeds to pay him money on multiple occasions. The Tramp gives the girl this money to save up for an operation that can bring back her sight. What follows is an emotional rollercoaster of a movie that fills you with laughter and sadness. This really is Chaplin at his best. This film was made in 1931, when movies had sound in them and a lot of companies were now producing talkies, rather than silent movies. Chaplin, thinking that sound would be a killer of the industry, decided to make City Lights a silent film anyway. Whilst he may have been wrong about sound being the end of the movie industry, this film being made as a silent movie was a very good idea. I really enjoyed the way he incorporated tiny bits of sound into his humour. One of the scenes involved him swallowing a whistle and every time he breathed out, he let out a toot."
Capracorn384,"Feb 17, 2002",N/A,I am 17 years old and I like silent movies. I bet not many teens could say that.  City Lights was the first silent movie I ever saw.  I saw it mainly because I wanted to see a Charlie Chaplin movie.  It was beautiful and poetic.  This is the way movies should be made.  The boxing scene is a classic and the end scene was sad but touching at the same time.  Go see tis movie!!
ikxabraham,"Oct 20, 2025",10/10,"City Lights is Chaplin's most exquisite blend of comedy and heartbreak, a silent symphony of tenderness where every gesture speaks volumes. Through the Tramp's unwavering devotion to a blind flower girl, the film captures humanity's purest beauty: love that asks for nothing in return. It simply shows the gentle art of kindness."
TheMovieDiorama,"Nov 4, 2018",9/10,"Having not much experience with silent films, this is admittedly my first venture into Chaplin's filmography. A renowned master and auteur during the 20's and 30's. Suffice to say after just one film, I can whole heartedly state that the man was a comedic genius. This puts all modern comedies to shame. I laughed more watching this classic than I have done all year, and that in itself proves that this 1931 silent masterpiece has stood the test of time. A tramp encounters an enigmatic blind woman who he tries to impress. In doing so, he befriends a turbulent alcoholic millionaire and starts to utilise his wealth to win her over. It's easy to dismiss Chaplin's films as slapstick humour. An array of silly sketches stringed together to evoke laughter. This dismissal is unjustified. There is a reason why City Lights is regarded as one of the best of all time, because it makes you experience a variety of emotions. The romance between the tramp and the woman is sweet and tender. The commentary on alcoholism, although not as thematically powerful as one would've hoped for, makes for adequate drama. The misfortunes of the tramp, particularly the swallowing of the whistle and well-choreographed boxing match, create the expected humour. Then the touching final scene adds a sprinkle of melodrama to surmise the story in two minutes. It's a tale about kindness. Being a gentleman no matter how small or large your bank account is. Aside from the overlong boxing match preparation scene, which should've been shortened to keep the pace up, I found no faults. The amount of personality seeping through the screen from the characters was astonishing. Nearly every scene felt fresh, introducing new and innovative gags to maintain the hilarity. The exaggerated acting assisted in producing chemistry between the characters. Briskly paced, consistently funny and just enough drama to retain viewer engagement. City Lights is (so far) the best silent film I have seen, and a true testament to the power of silence in an era where ""talkies"" were prevalent."

MattDevivre,"Dec 25, 2004",N/A,"I more and more turn to appreciate classics like ""City Lights"". It's a welcome change to all those new pictures you can see these days. No need for complicated explanations.This gem is a great Job done in the year 1931 by Charles Chaplin who (as very often) directed, wrote, edited, composed and produced. The ""City Lights"" plot in my point of view is very well considered and done representing the symptom of an extremely conflicting time in history. Many humorous idea's conclude an excellent comedy which for me didn't get boring. If you get the chance to watch this don't miss it.In a short: One of the best silent movies (a part of a movie history, that shouldn't be forgotten frivolously) !"

alainaoboza,"Aug 4, 2023",10/10,"A truly charming, heart-warming, and ecstatic film, full of sincerity and hope where love truly dares to spread its wings. Charlie Chaplin encapsulates the shy, daring, and hardworking characteristics that the world has fallen in love with, over the decades in which he blessed the silver screen.The 'Little Tramp' is a lovable character. He is energetic, eccentric, and above all, emotional. Like the 'Little Tramp', humans are naturally sympathetic, and once 'Blind Girl' enters the frame delicately holding her handful of handpicked roses, you will immediately fall in love with her true inner beauty. The 'Little Tramp''s motives are above heroic, and Chaplin demonstrates how powerful love truly is, and the commitment of saving and cherishing one's life; it can't be seen, but it will always be felt. This is what makes humanity.And with a story so genuine, you will forever grasp what truly makes life important, alongside understand what true love means to many. A masterpiece of cinema, and a landmark for Physical Slapstick comedy, Charlie Chaplin proves his sheer vibrancy in a world that he presents as poor, yet fruitful. A true demonstration on what he achieved within his lifetime, he Directs, Produces, Writes, and Stars in one of Cinema's greatest comedies. The 'Little Tramp' does it again! True cinematic joy."

Chris Stuckmann, a YouTube film critic is working on reviewing a pre-1970 movie once a month and recently did this and gave it an A+. Now, about MY thoughts. The Tramp, Chaplin's character, falls in love with a blind girl. That's what I did with City Lights. It was originally in my top 10. Now it's lower since I have seen more movies. Maybe I will change my mind when I see it again-WHICH I WILL! I have seen few silent movies and this is the best out of which I have. See City Lights, you shall not be disappointed!"
sreethered,"Dec 20, 2013",9/10,"Chaplin movies are always concentrated on the misery and sorrow of ordinary people. His famous tramp is presented as the core common man in most of his movies like Gold Rush, Modern Times, etc. According to me, the best Chaplin movie is The Great Dictator. But, as tramp, it's City Lights which captures the grace of Chaplin at peak.Story picks a tramp, and his romantic interest, a flower girl. His attempts to support the gave gives way to so many hilarious situations. As an addition, there is an eccentric millionaire, his butler, and a boxing match. Behind every laugh, there will be a stinging pain, and Chaplin successfully captured the woes and worries of the men who lived in this world, with the best as he could.Words won't be enough to praise the artist in Chaplin, since he is one of the pioneers of world cinema. There are no wonder that he made these movies brilliant, because that what he had experienced in his childhood. He conjured his suffering days into the celluloid, and we are calling them classics. Even after all these years, we wonders, sighs, laughs with the tramp, and the master behind all these will be laughing too, from heavens...."
christiam-51976,"Jun 25, 2022",9/10,What can i say about this film that hasnt been said before. I didnt expect a silent film to be this good. The ending was so filled with emotions and the boxing scene is insane.
mrushkoski,"Mar 3, 2018",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin's 1931 film is considered one of the most iconic movies of the twentieth century (number 11 on American Film Institutes list of best American movies ever made). The ""talkie"" movement started in 1928 and older silent movies became almost obsolete, City Lights proved that to be wrong. The way sound is used to amplify movement (even something as simple as walking down stairs) or a situation creates a type of magnificence that only Chaplin can portray. It was pre-code and yet was never risky, even during Chaplin's boxing match they kept it relatively clean."
ninja-23760,"Apr 25, 2019",10/10,Sir charlie is really a amazing actor...director...producer....a best man i hv ever seen
estebangonzalez10,"Apr 22, 2014",8/10,"""Tomorrow the birds will sing.""Before Raging Bull or Rocky, Charles Chaplin brought us one of the most memorable boxing scenes in film history. The scene is so well choreographed and performed by Chaplin that it proves what a genius he truly was. It's been more than 80 years since the film was released and it still remains as one of the best romantic comedies ever made. City Lights has a lot of heart, several funny moments, and a perfectly executed final scene that will touch even the hardest hearts. I've seen many famous scenes from Chaplin's work, but this is the first time I sat through a full movie of his. It was a unique and joyous experience despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of pantomime and some of the gags run a bit too long. Chaplin was not only a great actor, but he also was an excellent director, writer, and composer. The film is well edited and the technical achievements are surprisingly good. In the midst of the talkie revolution Chaplin decided to remain silent despite adding some amusing sound effects and he proved that powerful stories could be told without dialogue. It's a work of pure genius and a film that all film lovers should experience on their own. City Lights has encouraged me to begin a Chaplin marathon during this week and I think it's going to be a lot of fun to get to know one of cinema's most beloved characters: the tramp.Charles Chaplin plays the Little Tramp once again in City Lights and this time he meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) with whom he falls in love. Without her knowing it, he follows her to her home and discovers she is in financial troubles, so being the selfless little tramp he is he decides to try to help her out. Despite not having any money, the tramp tries to find ways to help her out while she mistakenly believes he is a millionaire. The tramp begins looking for work and even enters a boxing ring in order to make some money to help the girl pay for an operation that will restore her sight back, but he is unsuccessful in most of his endeavors. While searching for a place to rest one night near the city's river he accidentally runs into a millionaire (Harry Myers) who is about to commit suicide. The tramp saves his life and the two get drunk together and become friends. The only problem is that when the millionaire is sober he forgets about his friend so their relationship is on and off depending on the amount of alcohol he has had.City Lights has a simple premise, but the way Chaplin tells the story is very captivating and heart warming. His physical performance is among the best I've seen and his facial expressions are priceless. There is also an underlying message behind his funny and touching tale and the tramp represents the best side of humanity. The themes of selflessness, kindness, and classism still resonate in our society today. If you weren't won over by the story in general I am sure the ending will touch everyone and the hilarious boxing scene will tickle even the most grumpy hearts. City Lights is a film full of grace and you don't see movies like these made any more. During a troubled time after the Great Depression, Chaplin managed to maintain a sense of humor and bring joy and laughter to an era that was very much in need of it."
twobellsilence,"Jul 10, 2001",10/10,"Sir Charles Chaplin was an amazing artist and after seeing City Lights for the first time, I have to hand it to him. Everything is great about this film, especially the way it could communicate its simple but moving message without sound but through the emotions and expressions of the actors, all of whom richly deserve an applause. Certainly a great film to watch with a loved one."
Markie_Mark99,"Feb 7, 2019",8/10,"City Lights is a comedy-romance that excels in both respects. It starts off with a hilarious moment that got me laughing and the ending was a very heartfelt, romantic moment. The relationship between the Tramp and the rich man is one of misadventure and hilarity. On the other hand, his relationship with the blind girl begins with tragedy and ends with a beautiful conclusion."
bcasey-0856,"Jun 30, 2017",9/10,"Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"" contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it. Although made very much in the old-fashioned silent film tradition, much of it is timeless, too.After a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning, Charlie's ""little tramp"" character makes two acquaintances. He meets a blind girl selling flowers, who mistakes him for a rich man, and the two become very fond of each other. Then he meets a real millionaire, who is drunk, depressed, and about to commit suicide. In a comic scene, the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it, making himself a devoted friend.The tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight, and tries to think of some way he could help. His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving, while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades - his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny, and one of Chaplin's best comic pieces. Meanwhile, when his millionaire friend is drunk, he dotes on the tramp, but when sober he forgets who the tramp is, leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for Charlie.All of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the best-remembered scenes in any film. ""City Lights"" shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master, who without words can move his audience or make them laugh. Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once."

judemcrobbie,"Feb 19, 2021",9/10,"For me this is Chaplin's best movie because of the more connected story and overall film making, from the foreshadowing and call back and other techniques that have translated to today.
Has a darker tone than the majority of Chaplin's movies, dealing with suicide as a lot device but except that there isn't much else.
Has the usual hilarity of his movies, from the cap flip greeting to the the iconic walk. But this movie contains much more complex and developed comedy than the rest of his movies, making for a better laugh that will definitely stick with you for longer.
Two of the scenes in this film are probably two of the funniest Chaplin scenes and probably some of the funniest ever.
These scenes are:
The opening scene, which has this hilarious robotic feel to it with him feeling the need to repeat the action of saying hello to everyone and everything. The is has a sense of idiocy and lack of mediocrity throughout causing you to belt out with laughter.
The other scene is the scene in the boxing ring. The hilarity of this scene comes from the role reversal, and every time that one of the boxers has to break up the clinch between the referee and the other boxer, I laugh so hard.
This movie has surprising depth as well, being a criticism of capitalist society. The theme in this is so clear and obvious that a child could understand it. Maybe don't show this to a child as the silence might be a little boring, I know as a child I wouldn't have been able to sit through it, but as a teenager I couldn't recommend it more.
As with all of the Chaplin movies, his acting is less acting and more a well performed and choreographed dance or mime showing and conveying a very clear and obvious narrative.
The only thing holding this movie back is the score. Considering the emotional investment the score brings in these movies, I don't think its quite up to scratch and definitely worse than modern times. This is. A huge shame as everything about this movie has aged better than modern times, predominantly the jokes.
My personal favourite Chaplin movie so far."
kurosawakira,"Jan 8, 2014",10/10,"I have always loved ""City Lights"" the best of all the wonderful gems Chaplin has made. And after revisiting it recently, still do. In fact, the more I see films, the more this one stands apart as the quintessential comedy on what not only making films is about, but loving them as well.The circumstances in which Chaplin made it are well-known, as well as the ironic use of sound. In other words the war between the image and sound that in the early 1930s seemed all but lost. But the crystallization of this concept is in how everything in the film is about seeing or not seeing. There is a review here on IMDb (""Seeing and Being Seen"", April 30th, 2002, by ""tedg"") that I'd encourage you to read, since it analyzes this exact topic so astutely I have really nothing more to say, other than it truly is remarkable how every little thing in the film seems to be conveyed visually, be it a gag at the expense of the Tramp or the the blind girl's loneliness depicted in the birdcage.There is a fine Blu-ray for this film, released last autumn by the Criterion Collection. Had I any influence on you, I'd urge you to see it. It's a marvellous presentation of a marvellous film, and is there any higher compliment I could give any film than that seeing ""City Lights"" makes me love it more, and not only it but all film? I think you know my answer.I love you, Charlie."
ssssgelojun,"Aug 27, 2020",9/10,"The blind girl is the love and hope of the whole film. On the one hand, her existence makes what the tramp does become meaningful; on the other hand, the encounter between her and the tramp after her eyes are restored is the transcendence and sublimation of the theme.After adding the destiny of every ordinary individual, the film completes the extension of the character's emotion, which is no longer simply an allegory of social reality. Their meeting shows that all human stupidity results from a disregard for beauty.In the last scene, the girl asks is that you? Chaplin nips the tears that are about to come out of his eyes and stares at the girl with all his love in his eyes.This is a silent film, all the emotions are in the eyes, if love can not be said, it will overflow from the eyes.At the time you were born, it is hard to see the beauty of the world, but you cannot deny its existence."
Kubris,"Sep 5, 2012",8/10,"IMDb Top 250: 51City Lights- arguably Chaplin's greatest contribution to film. It completely could be, just not for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, but looking at my record with his films- The Great Dictator is one of the best of all time and Modern Times was hilarious, while The Kid was boring, I have to say this one is just below Modern Times.I watch a Charlie Chaplin movie to see slapstick primarily and watch a very high quality silent film. City Lights is more of a drama, due to the primary storyline of the blind flower girl. The story is incredibly touching. The actors involved put on the performances of a lifetime, especially considering their off-screen relationship. But it reduced the laughs, and not once did I laugh out loud like the food machine in Modern Times. The subplot about the millionaire was funny though.I think a second viewing in the future will be very rewarding, knowing what the film really is. That's my advice to you: recognize this as a dramedy. The film will be much more fulfilling. 8.4/10"
elizabethkaren,"Oct 10, 2018",8/10,"I generally thought this was one of Charlie Chaplin's most delightful, most overlooked quiet motion picture diamonds. At that point I found it truly wasn't underrated; it's appraised high on most commentators' rundowns. It might be that I for the most part catch wind of a portion of his different motion pictures than I do this one."

gbill-74877,"Aug 20, 2020",8/10,"Along came the Depression and it gave Chaplin's Tramp character an extra layer of meaning to go along with his comedy. When those kids are mercilessly picking on him in the street, when he's desperately trying to swipe some food as he's being escorted out of a mansion by the butler, when he's dealing with the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde nature of the rich, filmgoers in 1931 surely must have empathized all the more with the downtrodden man. Nowhere is he more touching than when he says ""Tomorrow the birds will sing"" to talk a man out of committing suicide, or that final scene, which is stunning. Before the close-ups, the mid-distance shot of the young woman (Virginia Cherrill) reaching out to him and Charlie looking beleaguered, vulnerable, and yet happy is absolutely spine tingling, one of my favorites in cinema history.The film may seem to have less of a message to it than some of Chaplin's other great works, but it's there, just more subtle. We see him mocking Herbert Hoover's line of ""peace and prosperity"" in the opening scene of the statue dedication, and we see the heartlessness of the wealthy, one of whom climbs into his car without even looking at the blind girl selling her flowers in the street, after the tramp has given her one of the few coins he has. We see the wealthy out partying all night while people are struggling to pay their rent. Through it all we see themes of generosity, humanity, and grace in the characters of the poor. In the end the young woman can see in more ways than one, e.g. the raw truth of the tramp's frailty, shown at a time when the nation was so frail, and yet with the sense that they will persevere together. It turns out I like these types of things about the film even more than the famous boxing scene or the rest of the comedy, since they seem so pitch perfect for 1931."
The_Greyback,"Jan 17, 2013",10/10,"Before starting the film ""City Lights"" by Charlie Chaplin, I was a bit apprehensive if I would be able to last the whole movie. Let's just say my last effort with ""The Great Dictator"" didn't go very well. Fifteen minutes into ""City Lights"" I knew that won't be the case.The film is full of comic situations topped off by a good performance by everyone involved. It starts out with an unlikely friendship between the tramp and a millionaire borne out of ironical circumstances. The tramp falls in love with a flower girl and tries his best to win her love. We even get to see the tramp in a boxing match which is equally funny.This is a silent movie but it talks to us in many ways. The unending vigor and affirmative outlook of the tramp which teaches a lesson or two, the tramp-millionaire relationship with its classist undertones, the girl's relationship with her benefactor whom she can't see. All this amalgamates to form something wonderful. A classic in every respect. 10/10 :)"
stuttgart20111,"Oct 12, 2012",10/10,"I still cant believe how funny this movie is. Laughing out loud the entire time. And if you think that I was sitting and watching this movie with a lot of other people(which makes movies way funnier), you are wrong. I was watching it alone and I just couldn't stop laughing which led to stomachache after the movie.I couldn't understand Chaplins Humor when I was a Kid or a Teenager, but now I acknowledge: He is the Master of Comedy! Forget Carlin, forget Gervais, Chaplin rules 'em all. And all this without saying a word. Can you believe it?This is his masterpiece! 10 stars truly deserved."
HaydnEngel,"May 22, 2020",8/10,"This is my 3rd favourite film of Chaplin's. Modern Times and the Great Dictator, rank higher for me personally. Though to the man himself, this is his favourite film and Welles, Kubrick, Tarkovsky and Woody Allen agree. It is strange though that Chaplin's 3 greatest works came after he was deemed obsolete, but being the artistic Luddite, he was. He pushed forward and did not allow modern technology to steal his craftsmanship. In a way, you must applaud that, but at the same time from a critical analysis standpoint, you must also detract marks for it. For is it genius? Or a has-been doing their best to cling on to a world that has moved beyond them?BE: With a Chaplin film you have to ask yourself can you really comment on the directing. Given that he does a large percentage of the workload himself, it would be like applauding Michelangelo's overseeing of the Sistine Chapel rather than the painting itself. The editing is decent, and the transitions move swiftly and give a sense of speed and the story with what limited cinematography we have for the time.W: The writing is simple but effective. Some claim that the pathos as they put it is limiting the film and not allowing it to be as good as it can be. However, we have seen the Tramp 12 times prior to this, and this is the last outing. Giving this comedic character a sense of compassion and sympathy at this stage is where the story should progress. Rather than leaving it in the purely farcical realm. We have completeness and sadness that often appears in great comedy, and from the very first scene with the Tramp and the blind girl, we have a pleasant mix of longing with pratfall comedy.C: It is 1931, and Fritz Arno Wagner is continuing to put Hollywood cinematography to shame. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Chaplin has brought along his old standby in Roland Totheroh, and he provides the standard for a Chaplin outing. The angles on some shots are nice, and some of the shadow work is pleasant, but nothing outstanding.A: At the beginning of the film, it says it is in pantomime, which implies over the top acting and with subtly and nuance removed from the piece. Which would be fine, save for the fact that it does have these things due to the previously mentioned pathos. Which forces me to be meaner on some of the more weak acting exhibited by the rest of the crew. Chaplin is excellent and very few people have such command of body language as he. The blind girl did not always feel blind, but we are still in the early days of cinema, so it is slightly excusable.S: The opening of the film is annoying in terms of sound. We have mumbled audio from several characters, and then the Tramp appears and then silence. Which seems to imply yes films have dialogue now but let us enjoy this nostalgic throwback. Which is an excellent way of presenting the film, but in terms of audio quality, it is weak, and we could have had that same effect while presenting clear audio to the viewer. The rest is standard silent film fare.PD: The sets are sets of the era, and they took effort, but nothing stands out, especially when one knows what is coming in the 1930s in regards to set design.BA: Costume design is again very Hollywood and of the era. Nothing makes it feel all that special save for the Tramp himself.EVO: Thoroughly enjoying and while the comedy is not on par with the circus or modern times. It offers the viewer so much more and allows us to see how romantic films should be done. I kid you not. Look at most of the great romantic movies, and you will find that the romance in the film is left in the background and only adds to the overall work. Like a lovely sauce over a delicious meal. Rather than your standard romantic movie which is like eating a 15 kg bag of marshmallows in a single sitting."
llltdesq,"Nov 15, 2001",10/10,"This is one of the best film of all time and yet it is arguably only the third best film Charlie Chaplin made, after Modern Times and The Gold Rush.

Chaplin's sense of timing was wonderful, as always. Wholeheartedly recommended."

raptorclaw,"Jul 23, 2009",10/10,"People say a lot of things about Chaplin's immortality. Actually, they say only one thing many times, over and over again: he is eternal, his films will live forever, a hundred or two hundred years from now humanity will still turn to Charles Chaplin for joy and relief from whatever burdens they may have, as like or unlike our own as those may be. My gut tells me there is truth in this belief, but I don't think with my gut. To be honest, I am not that optimistic. And my doubts don't spring from common sense, either; common sense says, of course, someday everything disappears - so will Chaplin. But other than that, I, as a 17-year-old, know absolutely no one of a similar age that likes Chaplin or remembers having seen any of his movies in recent times. All kids in Pakistan used to see them, and maybe they still do, but no one bothers to stick to it as the years pass. Tom and Jerry et al are still on TV - their place in public consciousness is continuously reinforced; they can legitimately claim timelessness. But what about all the 17-year-olds that would rather watch 'Transformers' and have only dim memories of a funny little man in a shabby top hat, ones that like movies only in passing, without passion? How will these poor people - and they are poorer for it - find 'City Lights'? This is a truly magnificent film. Its enduring greatness (if not enduring popularity) can, of course, be attributed to nostalgia - but only in part. You need never have heard of Charlie Chaplin to enjoy it. It also has the common advantage of all silent films in that it knows no linguistic boundaries; the story, unlike that of a Buster Keaton film, is simple and silent enough that one does not really need even the sparse title cards to follow it. Keaton's films, while silent, tended to be rather talkative, requiring the viewer to do quite a bit of reading. Chaplin is perhaps more widely known than Keaton because he, unlike the latter, can be understood by people who cannot read English or any language at all.Chaplin's comedic timing is flawless. This is not, perhaps, Chaplin's funniest film, but it strings together sequence after hilarious sequence of classic slapstick nevertheless: the opening scene on the monument, the one with the suicidal millionaire, the one in the restaurant (my personal favorite), the boxing match - each is immediately familiar and unfailingly funny. (Sophisticated humor? No doubt it has its skillful practitioners and talented writers. I love it. But is it, when you get right down to it, actually any funnier than watching a chair pulled out from under someone's descending rear end? Not on this evidence.) But what sets 'City Lights' apart from other Chaplin films, and classical comedy in general, is its heart.The story is, as I mentioned, disarmingly simple. Chaplin plays The Tramp, a homeless man with an odd mustache, a top hat and a cane, who is always in trouble because of his social ineptitude. He is persecuted because of his shabby appearance. He meets a girl that sells flowers who is kind to him, possibly only because she is blind and thinks he is a gentleman. He saves the life of a drunken millionaire, whose help he needs when the girl has trouble paying her rent. Obstacles arise. The obstacles are the comedy.That really is it. It does not, on paper, sound like masterpiece material, but it is brought to life - partly by humor, yes - but primarily by Chaplin's persona as the Tramp. The Tramp is one of cinema's greatest personalities, the people's champion to end them all. His perennially good intentions, his unflagging good cheer, his clumsiness, his social inadequacy, his underdog status and his constant bedevilment by ridiculous misfortune make us cheer, cheer, cheer like we never have for any other character. It is quite possible that of all the great people invented by the silver screen, Chaplin's Tramp is the easiest to love, and love the most.The movie is, of course, a great technical achievement. It is boundlessly entertaining. Each quirky character, from the flower girl to the millionaire to the class conscious butler, serves its purpose in moving the story towards it conclusion. The conclusion, of course, is one of the finest emotional scenes in movie history; in fact, in its length and low-key conclusion, without fanfare or fireworks, anticipates in a strange way the French New Wave. The ending is abrupt. I spoil nothing by saying you will be joyful when it comes.One of the greatest of all movies. Most highly recommended."
francpsantos,"Nov 13, 2018",10/10,"If there were any doubts that Charlie Chaplin was way ahead of many of his contemporaries, this work of art will shed them away. The man did it all, and did it expertly. The classic comedic gags are not scarce in the movie and they are great as well. The comedy may not be extremely witty or even funny by today's standards, but honestly, it manages to bring a smile to my face quite frequently. A special nod to the box fight scene, which manages not only to be a smart piece of practical comedy, but also an uneasy moment, because of how much is a stake. You can't help but to feel yourself so expectant and deeply involved that it almost as if you forget the silliness of the situation for a moment. The personal interactions, in my opinion, are also undeniable proof of Chaplin's genius. Be it the interesting intermittent relationship between the Tramp and the millionaire or the tender affection between a blind woman selling flowers and a lowlife with ragged clothes. Chaplin's character is someone who is used to be looked from above, and his sincere happiness is truly poetic, when he finds gratitude from someone who, ironically, can see behind his flawed facade. That's why, to me, it came as shock when I read about the tense relationship between Chaplin and Cherrill and how she got fired from the production at some point. The connection between their characters just oozes out of the screen, in such a way that it seems unbelievable that, actually, it was almost the opposite in ""real life"". On top of all that, for the ones that find silent movies scary, rest assured that the score (composed by Chaplin himself) fits the tone of each scene so perfectly, that, a few minutes in, one already forgets that this is not a 'talkie'. I grant it that the ""speech sounds"" at the first scene of the movie are somewhat off-putting but, luckily, they do not appear for the rest of the movie, and the rest of the sound design is actually pretty well done.I can understand that the way I feel about this movie may sound exaggerated to most people. Even I question myself when I fell so strongly about a work of art and I admit that the nostalgia factor may be playing tricks on me. But sometimes, one must not question their feelings too much, and, in my opinion, the way a number of people feel about City Lights is just like the movie itself: pure and sincere without pretensions. I am usually a thick-shelled ""insensitive"" person when it comes to movies, especially the ones purposefully designed to bring that little tear out. But the ending in this one made my eyes watery. And that says a lot.""Tomorrow the birds will sing. Be brave. Face life."""
diac228,"Nov 3, 2008",8/10,"Believe it or not (especially nowadays) there was a movement of actors, producers, and directors that didn't like the addition of speech to cinema. While most of these ""voices"" didn't hold much weight, they did have one frontrunner that could definitely dent the industry of ""Talkies,"" and that was Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin was so strongly against movies with dialogue, that he continued making silent movies (then eventually with sounds) way after the fad had died. Among his films that defied the industry was the charming City Lights. City Lights is a good bubbly film that has easily one of the best endings in the history of motion pictures. Combining slapstick comedy with good direction, a nice musical score, and a dosage of drama, City Lights is another tour-de-force from Chaplin.There are two plot lines to City Lights, both of them involving The Tramp (Chaplin of course). In one tale, The Tramp tries to help and win the heart of a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill). In the other tale, the Tramp experiences a series of antics with a millionaire that gets drunk every evening with him, but then doesn't remember him the very next morning. Both plots mingle a few times, and complement each other as they advance the story forward. The Tramp in the latter half of the movie falls for the flower girl so severely that he begins working any sort of job to come up with the money to fix her vision.Chaplin was one of the most talented men Hollywood has ever had the privilege of supporting; the man can act, direct, write, and even compose music. The music helps make up for the total lack of dialogue and very limited sound. His story at the time was a bit original, as the lead female couldn't see, which adds a dimension of innocence to her character. She represents purity, kindness, and what's right with the world. In the meantime, the drunken millionaire represents all that is wrong. The balance between the two gives City Lights its roller coaster feel, much like the city-like atmosphere setting in the movie. Most of the sight/humorous gags were with the millionaire, while the drama was saved for the scenes with the flower girl. Chaplin himself provides all the funniest moments in the movie, especially the incredible boxing scene.With that being said however, City Lights gets a little repetitive in its jokes, which makes it overall a weaker comedy than The Gold Rush. Whether it's the joke about the amnesic millionaire, the repetitive moments of the kids spitting at the Tramp, or the scene with the chairs; City Lights has a lot of good funny scenes, but they lose flavor and quality once you see them again and again. The Gold Rush doesn't have this problem, as their gags are very varied and never repeat. The Gold Rush also has a much better cast of supporting characters, and has better cinematography.But, the one thing The Gold Rush doesn't have is the incredible ending that City Lights has. In my opinion, if you can't end the movie on a good note, you better be sure to craft a masterpiece of a flick throughout the first two acts. A great ending can save a movie, and a bad ending can utterly destroy a good movie as well. City Lights has the perfect ending for the content presented; it could not have ended in a better way. At this moment, the directing, editing, acting, and music was at its best; its as if Chaplin had saved his best efforts for last. The payoff is grand, and the tears just might stream down your face. That is, if you know what love is.Bottom Line: As a modern, bitter, out-of-the-box independent critic, I try to step away from the expected boundaries of the typical film critic; I try to not give in to the regular mannerisms of the people that get paid to criticize movies past and present. The usual film critic shall state that City Lights was Chaplin at his prime blah blah blah. This isn't the case, as Chaplin has done better work before (Gold Rush; his best work) and since (Great Dictator, a long monologue away from perfection). But, this is a good movie, and is one of the earliest examples of a spectacular ending. City Lights is better and ages better than the typical silent movie, it can hold its own with romantic comedies of today. Its charming story will keep you entertained, and its ending will leave you breathless, wondering why movies of today don't try to end in the same fashion (or at least with the same amount of effort). City Lights is a nice ""comedy romance in pantomime."""
theognis2,"Feb 28, 2024",10/10,"After the start of the sound era, Chaplin maintained his faith in silent films, with his greatest production. The gamble was successful, as audiences appreciated his effort, with strong box office receipts. It is a sort of homage to the Little Tramp character that made Chaplin famous and wealthy. Made in the final days of Prohibition, it recounts the story of a wealthy alcoholic, who befriends the tramp, who saved his life. But the tramp is more focused on saving the life of a young, beautiful, impoverished, blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill, age 23). The comic techniques seen here draw upon and summarize the history of silent film comedy, while moving beyond it. The balletic boxing match is wonderful, but the powerful, poignant climactic scene is most suspenseful and magnificent."
jamesjustice-92,"Apr 15, 2022",10/10,"I may be mistaken because it was a long time ago but if I remember correctly ""City lights"" was the first movie starring Charles that I watched and since then it has been my absolute favorite. Although being a silent movie in the already moving forward ""talkies"" era it was a complete financial and critical success at the time and ever since is regarded as one of the best movies ever made with which I couldn't agree more.Charles perfected his formula of tragic comedy with ""City lights"", managing not only to make us laugh almost every scene but also touch our hearts and make us weep with emotions at the end (or is it just me?). Tramp is out on the streets again and falls in love with a blind girl, played stupendously by Virginia Cherrill, who mistakenly takes him for a millionaire. And being hooked up by this wonderful feeling he goes all the extra miles and runs marathons to help her selflessly; he even agrees to a boxing match just to get some money for a person in need.People got used to other people walking by or walking out when someone is helpless but Charles shows us another way, a better way to deal with life. He also shows us that looks don't matter when it comes to love: even with your eyes wide open you can miss the love of your life even if he is right in front of you - all you need to do is reach out your hand toward another human being and try and feel him. Most of the people aren't blind but they are when it comes to the simplest and very often the most important things in life and Charles will always be there for us to lead the way.""City lights"" is not just another masterpiece of Chaplin's (which it definitely is) but is also his most ultimate, touching, meaningful and undeniably best body of work before he slowly let himself step out of his role of an underdog, matured, became more political but not less revealing and powerful."
Chaser923,"Jul 20, 2021",8/10,"Yeah nahhh this was really good. I prefer Modern Times by just a little bit though. This is now the oldest film I've ever seen as of July 18th, 2021.

Combining pathos with an endearing strength of humanity it is shattering, tear jerking, and beautiful.

The final scenes are both shattering and heartwarming and perhaps one of the most romanticly brilliant in film history."

My father actually showed this film to me saying it was one of my grandfather's favorite movie. Now this is one of my favorite movie.  The emotional expressions, physical movements, and acting of Charlie Chaplin is just incredible.  If you like all of Charlie Chaplin's short flicks, you'll love this feature-length film. This film is a comic genius and is very touching."
nukisepp,"Jan 2, 2021",8/10,"To most 'City Lights' is their favorite Charles Chaplin movie. It is said to be the great auteur's personal favorite amongst his movies. I might be the rare individual in this case - 'City Lights' is not my favorite for some reason. Although, I can consider this as his BEST movie. Perhaps, because here the Tramp character is most nuanced than ever. And the writing is the most complex and complete Chaplin has ever achieved. Physical comedy is precise - just look at that fight scene (I wonder, were Buster Keaton jealous of that?). There aren't many stand-alone gags, every joke is there to move forward the story or develop the character. Funny and touching, but the most important is (one of) the message the movie carries - only an outcast can help an outcast. Psychologically and philosophically 'City Lights' is much more complex than its slapstick exterior shows at the first glance. The pantomime only enhances the magical fairytale feel - the real love never needs words. In 'City Lights' the Tramp is at his most romantic adventure ever, where he shows utmost bravery and selflessness. He doesn't only try to help his love interest, a blind flower girl (ever so charming Virginia Cherrill), but he also puts his own life on the line to save a millionaire (Harry Myers makes convincing alcoholic and is funny in his own right) from suicide, although, when sobered up, the millionaire doesn't want to make any dealings with the Tramp. Even there, Chaplin has written more complex social criticism than just pointing out the gap between the rich and the poor.Sweet, hilarious, and sad, delightful, and thoughtful movie. If you don't find yourself moved by this movie, my friend, then you are no longer my friend."
basketkokibowl,"Oct 11, 2018",9/10,"This movie was my first silent movie I have watched. 
Needless to say, performance by Charles Chaplin in this movie is really hilarious. And the way the story proceed is flawless. Every scene is important has meaning to following ones.
I knew Chaplin's performance was funny to watch and that's what I expected before. But there was something I didn't expect so much. It was romance story of this movie.
Blind girl by Virginia Cherrill, was really charming. The story of Charles and Virginia was really romantic. As of 2018, everything still holds up."
Will3451,"Jun 7, 2010",10/10,"This is what you can call real art because this movie really is a piece of real art. People frequently call many movies of current age 'work of art' or 'masterpiece' and in a sense those movies are. Me too label many of today's movies with words like these but when I compare those movies with real classics like City Lights those movies seems nothing to me. Charles Chaplin was a true genius, the way he executed the story of this movies is just amazing, the way he directed that movie is just exceptional. I won't try further to tell how great this movie was because words can't really describe how great this movie was, words can't describe art. You have to see this movie to acknowledge the greatness of this movie and Charles Chaplin."
indrajeetchutia,"Feb 28, 2020",9/10,"City Lights is my debut of Charlie Chaplain's filmography, I'm not used to silent movies yet but I definitely can say City Lights is a great start for me. While I didn't laugh a but was still funny and it was heartwarming, it actually made me care about the characters and their relationship, the movie made me happy and sad at the same time. This movie is almost 90 years old and yet I never felt once that it outdated, while watching the movie I realised how to this film or maybe Chaplain particularly inspired many movies and also many cartoons. This movie has lots of memorable moments that will remembered forever in film history."

ethanbresnett,"Jan 15, 2025",8/10,"City Lights is my first foray into the films of Charlie Chaplin and it was a very delightful experience.Chaplin commands the frame with his impeccable comedic timing and physicality. An expertly crafted boxing sequence really demonstrates his ability in a hilarious scene, but he is marvelous throughout.The story is charming and doesn't feel particularly dated at all which was a surprise. It follows Chaplin's famous Tramp as he woos a blind woman and endeavours to pay for surgery to repair her sight. The musical accompaniment to the whole film is lovely as well and matches the vibe and tone of the film perfectly.Overall a truly lovely experience that has me excited to dive into more of Chaplin's filmography."
Billy_Boy_,"Jul 22, 2025",9/10,"City Lights might just be my favourite Charlie Chaplin film. I went in expecting some classic silent comedy (and it definitely delivers on that), but what really surprised me was how touching and emotional it turned out to be at the end.Chaplin's Little Tramp character is as funny and charming as ever, stumbling through life with his usual mix of chaos and kindness. Even nowadays, the scenes with the drunk millionaire are fun to watch, and the boxing match is still one of the funniest slapstick sequences ever filmed. But underneath all the laughs, there's this really sweet, heartfelt story about his relationship with a blind flower girl. The ending also completely caught me off guard. It's simple, but so powerful and beautiful. One of those rare movie moments that just sticks with you and Chaplin at his absolute best!"
Mnemosyne15,"Mar 18, 2020",8/10,"This is both a love film and a comedy film. The film has no dialogue, and completely relies on Chaplin's genius performance and the right soundtrack to show us a love story with tears in laughter. Inferior to the current sound film. Feeling that simple touch in the laughter, you don't need to use words to express it, you can feel it slowly. The perfect combination of music and plot in the film has further sublimated the plot."
Ruskington,"Apr 10, 2020",8/10,"City Lights is a charming film, centred around a compelling and uniquely engineered love story that is beautifully enacted by Charlie Chaplin and Virginia Cherrill. It leads to an incredibly poignant final scene that many consider to be one of the greatest moments in cinematic history.As great as this film is, I didn't enjoy it quite as much as Modern Times. It felt somewhat slow and repetitive at times and there weren't as many great slapstick moments (hilarious boxing scene aside). However, I can fully understand why it is regarded as one of the all-time greats and everyone who likes good cinema owes it to themselves to see that finale."
filipemanuelneto,"Jun 10, 2018",8/10,"The story of how a generous Tramp tries to help a blind girl for whom he's in love is famous since its release. Its probably one of the most acclaimed and famous films of Chaplin's career, who was already an accomplished actor when he made this silent film, released in the midst of sound era, in a conscious choice of Chaplin, which saw many successful silent film humorists sink when they began to talk and decided not to have the same fate. For us, its one of the most remarkable films of Little Bum, the most iconic character of this actor.Visually beautiful and elegant, it has a careful cinematography and music, as well as sound effects, dispenses well any vocal addition. Scenarios and costumes were carefully thought out and created. In all the technical details Chaplin's taste and meticulous hand is visible. The comedy is created through the most unlikely situations in which the character stands, and it is delicious. Even if it fails to tease out laughs it will certainly make the audience smile. There is also a naive and pure love story that permeates the entire film, as a thread of history, and that is deeply touching."

Both Chaplin's directing and score are marvelous. The way Chaplin brought the character of the tramp to the canvas once more can hardly be topped, presenting such a precise yet relaxed kind of acting to the viewers. Virginia Cherrill, his love interest, is just wonderful. Hard to believe that she and Chaplin could not stand each other, as the story goes. A movie to be watched again and again and again..."
springfieldrental,"Sep 7, 2022",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin's script concerning a blind woman who meets and befriends his Tramp character needed a special actress with a distant gazed look. The director/actor had auditioned several actresses, and was unhappy with all of them. During a boxing match, Chaplin sat near Virginia Cherrill, who was nearsighted. He noticed her squinting to see the action in the ring. His instinctive impulse in slotting her in as the blind woman was bold since she had no acting experience. He approached her during intermission and asked if she would be interested in the part in January 1931's ""City Lights."" She didn't hesitate and said yes.That's one account. The other was while he was at a film shoot observing some bathing suit models on Santa Monica beach, Chaplin was approached by Cherrill. She reminded him of their boxing match meeting, and asked if there would ever be a chance to work in one of his movies. She screen tested perfectly for the part.Ever a perfectionist, Chaplin put the raw actress through the wringer. In one of his first scenes with her filmed early in 1929, the sequence calls for her while selling flowers on a sidewalk when she mistakens the Tramp for a millionaire emerging from a limousine. Chaplin shot hundreds of takes before moving on to other scenes. Several months later, he resumed filming that early shot. In all, Chaplin called for a total of 342 takes, shattering the record for the number of takes for one scene. Needless to say, Chaplin and Cherrill had a rocky relationship throughout the production. The now-actress recalled ""I never liked Charlie and he never liked me."" The director took part of the blame, saying ""I had worked myself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection."" Deep into the movie's production, Cherrill showed up late at the studio because she wanted to get her hair done. Chaplin fired her on the spot and considered replacing her with actress Georgia Hale, who played the female lead in 1925's ""The Gold Rush."" He shot the script's final scene with Hale. But once advised on the great amount of filming and high costs required to reshoot Cherrill's scenes, Chaplin reluctantly brought her back. Friend Marion Davies coached Virginia to ask for more money to complete the film, which sent the director in an even more frenetic tizzy. He finally agreed to her demands and completed the film with her in it.When Hollywood had moved on to talkies in the late 1920s, Chaplin chose to continue to make silent films with an accompanying musical soundtrack and sound effects. He witnessed his friends Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks having an incredibly difficult time making the transition to talkies, and decided to keep his Tramp character mute. From the inception of ""City Lights'"" script, Chaplin visualized the ending as the keystone of the movie. Its conclusion, cited as the best finale in cinema, shows the blind girl who the Tramp paid for her eye operation recognizing her benefactor for the first time. The ending inspired Woody Allen to duplicate Chaplin's expressions in the final sequence in 1979's ""Manhattan.""Film reviewer Roger Ebert described ""The last scene of ""City Lights"" is justly famous as one of the great emotional moments in the movies,"" wrote film reviewer Roger Ebert. He recalled seeing the movie in 1972 in Venice during a Chaplin film festival. ""When the flower girl recognized the Tramp, I heard much snuffling and blowing of noses around me; there wasn't a dry eye in the piazza. Then complete darkness fell, and a spotlight singled out a balcony overlooking the square. Charlie Chaplin walked forward, and bowed. I have seldom heard such cheering.""
At ""City Lights'"" premier in January 30, 1931, Chaplin had personally invited Albert Einstein and his wife Elsa to sit with him. Once the movie ended, he saw Einstein's eyes tearing, surprising the comedian that the genius was so sentimental.""City Lights"" has been called a synthesis of the entire body of Chaplin's work. He has a number of classic episodic skits contained within the movie: from its opening with The Tramp sleeping on a city statue, to an unforgettable boxing match, to a wild New Year Eve's night spent with a millionaire he befriends.""City Lights"" was rousing success with both the critics and the general public. Orson Welles said it was his favorite movie. Stanley Kubrick listed the Chaplin film number five of his top ten movies he most loved. Playwright George Bernard Shaw described Chaplin as the only ""genius to come out of the movie industry."" The American Film Institute members ranked ""City Lights"" in a number of categories: The 11th Best Movie of All-Time, The 38th Funniest Movie, the 10th Most Passionate, the 33rd Most Inspiring, the Number One Best Romantic Comedy of All Time, and The Tramp as the 38th Most Heroic Movie character. The feature film is also in the ""1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die."" Strangely, ""City Lights"" didn't receive one Academy Award nomination in any category, one of the organization's more ignoble slights."

Firstly, the scenario is pretty good, it shows poor people with clear and kind heart and not good rich one. It shows that true love doesn't have any obstacles.

kaaffilm,"Mar 27, 2023",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"" is a timeless masterpiece that still captivates audiences almost a century after its release. The film tells the story of Chaplin's iconic ""Tramp"" character who falls in love with a blind flower girl and goes to great lengths to help her regain her sight. The movie is a perfect example of Chaplin's ability to blend humor and pathos, creating a touching and emotional story that still manages to be incredibly funny.What makes ""City Lights"" such a remarkable film is its ability to convey so much without any dialogue. Chaplin's physical comedy is second to none, and he uses his body language to convey everything from joy to heartbreak. The film's final scene, in which the flower girl finally sees the Tramp for the first time, is one of the most iconic moments in cinema history and is a testament to the power of silent film.The film's score, composed by Chaplin himself, is also a standout element. The music perfectly captures the emotion of each scene and adds an extra layer of depth to an already moving story.Overall, ""City Lights"" is a must-see film for anyone who appreciates the art of cinema. It is a timeless classic that has stood the test of time and continues to be relevant today. Chaplin's performance is unforgettable, and the film's themes of love, friendship, and the human condition still resonate with audiences around the world."
ghostninjafire,"Sep 29, 2013",10/10,"The beginning of the end of an era, City Lights was created as a reaction from Chaplin to ""talkies"". Chaplin knew that a film consisting in only sketches would not cope with the new films so he had to introduce a story that would unify the film from beginning to end. Hence City Lights was the first Chaplin film with a decisive argument and thanks to its enormous success, for a short time, Hollywood returned to make silent films but sound had come to stay. Also good to mention, the sketch in which Chaplin swallows a whistle and starts beeping every time he coughs, the sound was not applied after the film was completed, it was the true sound recorded during the filming."
jeanmichellavoie,"May 1, 2019",9/10,"This film is made of two parallel stories. One is a beautiful love story, the other is a very smole slapstick comedy. Even though these stories are barely connected... they stangely fit with one another and as a whole, the film is extremely charming."
RohitRajkumar,"Feb 14, 2010",10/10,"When sound movies were being made around that time, the silent movies always had that slight element of risk of not working due to them. But Charlie Chaplin proved all of them wrong with this one.The story is simple of a tramp falling in love with a blind girl and the various comedy sequences to follow. And I guess this is the only Chaplin film I have seen in which the film doesn't end in a tragic way.Chaplin shines throughout the film and perhaps it is his career-best performance. The music is captivating, easily one of the best scores that he has composed till now.The supporting cast along with the lead actress contribute significantly in this superb movie. More importantly, the comedy sequences are so well handled that you feel that you have never seen anything like this before in a Chaplin movie.Easily one of the best romantic comedy movies ever made. Don't miss this one. This sure is to leave a smile on your face."
SteveF,"Oct 16, 1998",9/10,"The scene where Charlie becomes a prize fighter in order to win some money to help the blind flower girl is a comic masterpiece.  The humour comes from the wonderful music (composed by Chaplain) which turns the choreography of the fight into a dance. The expressions of Charlie, his opponent and the referee say more than words ever could. Watch it and smile."

sr_wolfrider,"Nov 12, 2008",8/10,"Orson Welles once cited as his favorite movie Charlie Chaplin's tribute to the art of body language and pantomime, ""City Lights."" ""I was determined to continue making silent films,"" Chaplin recalls in ""My Life in Pictures"" of his decision to make a silent four years into the talkie era, ""for I believed there was room for all types of entertainment."" ""City Lights"" features Chaplin's musical composition and various sound effects, but no dialogue. Chaplin opens the film with a lampoon of talkies: at the unveiling of a Greco-Roman stone statue, the dignitaries' speeches are heard only as unintelligible squawks.Smitten by a flower-selling Blind Girl (Virginia Sherrill) who has mistaken him for a dapper gentleman, the Little Tramp takes on odd jobs (including a prizefight, shown in a masterfully choreographed sequence) to raise money for an operation to restore her vision. After the Tramp intervenes to prevent the suicide of an alcoholic tycoon, the tycoon befriends him; but it is an on and off friendship, as when sober the tycoon doesn't even recognize the Tramp. Despite a series of mishaps, the Tramp pays for the operation. But in the process he lands in prison. On the Tramp's elease, the Blind Girl learns the true identity of her benefactor in one of the most rarified scenes in cinema."
Dustin Dye,"Feb 19, 2000",10/10,"In my opinion, this is Charlie Chaplin's best film.  I think it is every bit as good as ""The Gold Rush"" and it is defiantly more satisfying.  This movie is about a Tramp that falls in love with a blind flower girl.  She thinks that the Tramp is rich but he really just has a millionaire friend that he mooches off of.  Well, as you will see, he will do anything for this girl. He even resorts to fighting to raise money for her to pay the rent.  The conclusion is one of the best that I have ever seen.  Overall, it is a heart warming tale and I highly recommend it."
bryno92,"Aug 10, 2017",9/10,"You're probably deciding to watch this because it's in the Top 250 movies of all time. Let me tell you that it totally deserves its spot at #25 for Top Rated English Movies. I'm not a huge fan of Charlie Chaplin or silent movies in general, but this one surprised me. It was funny, but yet had a serious tone at the same time. My only wish is that the ending would've had more to it. It wasn't a bad ending by any means, I think it's just me wanting to see more since the movie was so good. Just do yourself a favor and watch it already!"
e-07232,"Apr 18, 2020",10/10,"Among the many films still shot in black and white, Chaplin's work is shinko's favorite. Due to the limitations of The Times, black and white works, no matter how beautiful, how good, are unable to get rid of the fatal defect compared with the modern film: dull. Black and white movies, for many audiences used to Hollywood blockbusters, are too boring, too boring. But there's one man whose work doesn't, Chaplin, and I love him"
jeanagarcia-01693,"Apr 22, 2020",10/10,"No doubt, it is the best movie of Charlie Chaplin. Can you imagine about the story-line? The writer must be a genius one. The girls acting makes my eyes wet. I wish if I could give it to 11 star. Would like to see it again in the next weekend."

bholland,"Dec 1, 1998",10/10,"What can one say about the perfect film, especially considering it's a silent film, made after the advent of sound.  The average moviegoer only thinks of Chaplin with a few cliched aspects of his Little Tramp character, but in City Lights, Chaplin lays out an astonishing, positively delightful, and phenomenal masterpiece of cinema which still today says as much as any other film I've seen.I count City Lights in my top three films of all time, and I've noticed that a recent national critic survey has placed it among their top 100.  The bottom line is that if you haven't yet seen it, watch carefully with open eyes and heart, and understand the genius which is Charles Chaplin."
Honest-John,"Mar 1, 2014",10/10,"Charlie was good in this but his dialogue was lacking, his main strengths are his vocal prowess and his domineering speech but overall a jolly good film shame they didn't shoot it in colour tho and the tramp related to me on a personal lever as I think it does everyone When I think about this film I literally LOL as with all of johns films.One of the great play writes of our time a true Willy Shakespeare I've used this as inspiration for many of my songs and original material, I have remade this exact film 8 times but using different cameras but I cannot seem to do it the way that Ol' Gregg manages too one of the best producers in US living history and not a CGI tiger in sight!The special effects are out of this world for when this film was made and well they still are today hehe"
editor-28875,"Apr 28, 2018",9/10,"If you've ever felt you should one day watch a Charlie Chaplin film (or a silent film in general) and you're a rom-com fan, then this is the one for you! It is even credited as a ""Comedy Romance"" in the opening credits, and is among the very first of the genre. Chaplin, in his persona of The Tramp (replete with disconcertingly Hitler-y moustache), falls in love with a beautiful flower seller (Virginia Sherrill). She is blind, and mistakes him for a wealthy benefactor. Across the course of their love story, the Tramp goes from low to high to low to very low and ultimately, to one of the purest moments of joy ever shown on screen. It's funny, it's charming, it's wacky, and above all, it is dreamily romantic. A true classic, in every sense of the word.This review appears in Romantic Intentions Quarterly #1."
ptsj-music,"Nov 12, 2017",10/10,"Well into the beginning of the sound- and ""talkie"" movies era, Charles Chaplin made another silent movie, though with a musical soundtrack, also written by Chaplin.It was to be his perhaps greatest film of all, though it's hard to put it above both Modern Times and The Great Dictator. Like in others of his masterpieces it's hard if not impossible not to be emotionally moved. Tragedy and comedy is woven together at it's highest level of performance.I won't review the film any more than the above, but would like to make a general statement on the greatest film personality of all times. In 1999 The American Film Institute somehow managed to rank Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, James Stuart, Marlon Brando, Fred Astaire, Henry Fonda, Clark Gable, James Cagney and Spencer Tracy above Charlie Chaplin on the List Of Greatest Screen Legends. With all due respect of the nine mentioned, but placing Chaplin as No.10 is a meaningless parody of disgrace. Not only is he in a class of his own, he was perhaps more than anyone else responsible for making their stardom possible.﻿Thank You!"

gcrokus,"Apr 24, 2009",8/10,"I am a child of the Sixties, and many of the attitudes I formed were based on essentially special moments, it seems to me. One of my parent's friends opined one evening, stridently, vigourously, something to the effect that because Charlie Chaplin was a Communist everything he ever did was therefore artistically inadmissible. There are times in life where something you hear you instantly know is either completely wrong or right. I knew then that this had to be wrong, even though I had never seen anything more than a snippet of Chaplin's work.Many of what are considered great films were not shown anywhere, not on TV, certainly not on the big screen, for most of my early life. So it is that in my recent viewing of ""City Lights"" I saw my first full length Chaplin film. And I was not disappointed.In this movie there are only a handful of main characters. Chaplin's little tramp is of course prominent, but the key supporting players certainly get a lot of screen time. Among them is the blind flower girl who becomes the center of the tramp's attention, her grandmother, and a very rich and also very boozy benefactor of sorts. The rich man's butler has a significant part. There are many, many players with brief parts.As far as a plot goes, the tramp meets the blind flower girl and of course he is able over time to appear to her as a wealthy kind-of boyfriend; he helps her when he can. He is smitten with her. In the meantime the tramp has run into the rich man, their initial meeting being the tramp's intervention in the others suicide attempt.But the benefactor has mercurial fits of memory loss and gain, so his generous gestures are at best unreliable. In the midst of the tramp's efforts to do what we would term the right thing, other confounding moments occur. Which leads us to the comedy part.In effect the tramp runs into troubles at every turn. His helpful and often unsolicited attempts make things right do not necessarily provide a real advantage for him or those about him. He does get the money to help the flower girl and grandmother, but at a price.It is fun to watch the little tramp and his antics. Chaplin could certainly do physical comedy, and his attempts at this are very honest, involving tremendous eye to detail touches in all scenes. At one point he briefly eludes two policemen; his quickness and well-rehearsed reaction is actually difficult to follow.I have read about the ending previously from a few sources, but no spoilers were among them. I appreciate this because the last few moments of ""City Lights"" deliver a terrific payoff. And its nice to know a boyhood suspicion was well-founded.Three Stars"
CubsandCulture,"Dec 31, 2021",10/10,"I don't have much to add here-this is such a well known and well regarded classic there's no need to opine on it. But I did want to say that the boxing match sequence is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. I think it gives Duck Soup's mirror scene a run for its money as *the* classic bit from this era.The overall film is just the right mixture of sentiment, romance and laughs. This film is life at its best. It is in love with being alive."
lagudafuad,"Nov 27, 2012",8/10,"After being opportune to see many of the old Charlie Chaplin classics, this movie City Lights stands out as the best I have seen him in. Charlie's films will always stand out in the history of film making as he brought something new to the silver screen. City Lights is an exceptional silent film that showed the simplicity of romance and the length of ideology any one will go to keep it, from living a lie, to going to jail all in the name of love.The final scene in the movie has been sighted by many to be one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. I to accept that claim, the tramp's melancholy look as all the walls of lies fall apart will touch you in ways that will make you smile; the acting that followed it was masterfully done.Next to that scene my second favorite scene is the boxing fight, if you have not seen this movie before get ready for the laugh of your life, the screenplay is masterful, the acting is wonderful and the sound effects just enough. Such scenes make you wonder what Charlie movies would have been if he had all the gadgets and money that studios are pumping into movies this days.Like other Chaplin movies, this is a slapstick comedy done in 1931. He wrote produced and directed the movie. By the time of its release talkies were already in vogue (sound) but Chaplin took a shot in the dark making this movie a silent movie, he did fear though that the reception will not be good, but this movie did well in the box office and also was well received.The story plot as others is about the tramp (Charlie Chaplin) this time tramp meets and falls in love with a beautiful girl who happens to be blind.While the tramp was taking his leisure stroll he runs into a wealthy man, whom he befriended but the relationship was on and off, as the man will at times recognize Charlie and later forget that they know each other. The tramp on the other hand used his connection with the wealthy man to help his love as she was going through financial trouble.Holding the eleventh place in the AFI greatest film of all time, City Lights is one classic romantic comedy that will leave Charlie's name in the lips of many film goers for a long time. No matter what your take is concerning silent movies, make sure this one does not pass you by.www.lagsreviews.com"
H4wke,"Apr 10, 2025",8/10,"I was looking forward to my rewatch of 'City Lights'. It's a film I loved more than I expected the first time.I was initially shocked at how timeless the comedy was.Usually, comedy films age quite poorly in my eyes compared to other genres. I've seen a lot of classics from decades as late as the 90s that just completely fail for a modern audience.'City Lights' avoids this, with its wonderfully crafted practical sequences and heartfelt story threading them together. I grew up with Mr Bean, and the qualities I adore with that character are to be found here. The humour is universal, built mostly off of misunderstandings by the tipsy, idiotic characters that you can't help but love. I haven't checked, but I can imagine these films did incredibly well internationally.Chaplin's 'Tramp' is a ratbag, more than anything else, and his cheeky antics are still funny to this day. I have yet to watch his other films, I'm sure I have plenty to look forward to, nearly a hundred years later."
smathis-97928,"Jul 26, 2015",9/10,"At the start of the 30's ""talkies"" or movies with sound synchronized with their films like they are in modern films, really started to take off. Charlie Chaplin resisted that change and we are forever thankful.This is the true romantic comedy, with absolutely superb acting and a fun score to go along with it. Chaplin's humor still hold up, 80 odd years later, with some slapstick tactics that Adam Sandler and the lot should pick up on. The jokes/humor are excellently displayed, and will constantly leave a smile on your face. The ending is one of the best in cinema history, and i'll leave the rest spoiler free.Rating: 9/10. Really short (<90 minutes!!) great, silent film that will hold to the test of time. Really great flick to start enjoying silent movies."
ACitizenCalledKane,"Dec 13, 2004",9/10,"After having seen Chaplin's The Gold Rush, I felt compelled to see more exhibitions of his genius. After having seen City Lights, I am that much more interested in seeing even more of his work. Let me reiterate, Chaplin was a genius! His timing was flawless. His ability to evoke emotion was extraordinary, and he knew how to tell a story! Actor, writer, director, producer, composer; it was not unlike Chaplin to do it all in his movies, but to do all of these, and to do them so brilliantly - it can only be described as genius. This film, is a wonderful place to start for anyone interested in the work of Charles Chaplin. While I feel that The Gold Rush is the better film, I would still recommend this just as quickly. It contains the wonderful sight gags, pratfalls, and classic comedy for which Chaplin's films are so renowned. From the opening scene, the unveiling of the monument, you know that you are in for a treat. The film is not all comedy, though. There is romance and drama as well. Yet, this is where this film shines so brightly; it IS comedy, it IS romance, and it IS drama. All three genres are presented here, purely, and yet, they are intertwined so exquisitely that the viewer hardly realizes the shifts in emotion! This film exemplifies the lost art of ""classic"" comedy, standing today as a monument to what contemporary comedies should aspire to. And just as it was with the monument in the film, it is The Tramp, Charlie Chaplin who makes it all worth-while!"
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Oct 14, 2009",9/10,"Wish that today's romantic comedies full of superficial blabber and polluted ideas about love and sex would just -- shut up? Hold on to your ten dollars and rent the Charlie Chaplin classic ""City Lights,"" a heart-warming romance and physical comedy -- where no one talks.It seems like the era and even the idea of the silent love story has been long gone and forgotten. Relationships and courtship are full of drama, selfish sexual desire and prejudices and attitudes about what's attractive. In a modern context, ""City Lights"" can be viewed as an hour and a half trip back to innocence.The already famous Chaplin returns to the screen in ""Lights,"" his first silent film in the dawn of the ""talkie"" era. Chaplin once again plays the Tramp, this time befriending a suicidal drunken rich man and taking a fancy to a blind flower salesgirl. As a social commentary, Chaplin picks on the snootiness of the upper class and their fancy parties that only mask their unhappiness, as well as championing those who are not as wealthy but don't create social prejudice. But ""Lights"" is a love story at heart.Maybe it's only because he knows she won't judge him by his appearance that the Tramp is immediately infatuated with the blind flower seller, but his unblinking kindness toward her is just heart-warming. As he tries to find the money to pay for her rent, (leading to some hysterical scenes, namely a boxing fight) you know deep down that he'll never fully be repaid for his kind deeds. That is until the classic ending that could win even the coldest of fish over with its simple but perfect execution.There's plenty opportunity here for us to laugh at the Tramp too, but it's just not what you take away most from ""City Lights.' You can name the classic comedy scenes without problem, but the impression does not follow them. It's the beautiful story of two seemingly nobodies who treat each other with unconditional kindness amidst a city of superficial and judgmental people that makes you stop and wonder. The fact that in all honesty we still search for that ideal today despite an even greater setting promoting the opposite, and that's what makes ""City Lights"" a classic. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"
Hitchcoc,"Jan 22, 2017",10/10,"In this film we have an overriding story. It is the story of a blind flower girl who is approached by a little tramp and who accepts him as a worthwhile human being, because she can't see his tattered clothes and sad being. He is compassionate and loving and giving to others, and yet he is despised by the haves. He is under constant attack from kids in the street, and the law won't leave him alone. When he prevents the suicide of a rich man, he is taken in, but because the man is a drunk, when sober he doesn't even recognize the little tramp. Charlie is on a revolving door with this guy, doing great physical comedy with grace and an ethereal loveliness. He manages, at great sacrifice, to get money for the girl so she can have surgery. The final scene is one that cannot help but bring a tear to the eyes of the viewer. Beautiful."
Jerm-2,"Nov 10, 1998",10/10,"This is my favorite Chaplin and my 3rd favorite movie ever. It is such a great comedy and romance. It's sort of indescribable. The last scenes of this movie amaze me they are so genius. Plus the boxing scene and all the scenes with the drunk are absolutely hilarious. This is beyond words, just watch it laugh and enjoy the movie."
drqshadow-reviews,"Sep 24, 2018",8/10,"Charlie Chaplin falls for a blind flower girl and lives the high life with a lush, amnesiac fatcat, sampling and exploiting various urban lifestyles along the way. Playful and carefree, like all the classic auteur's best pantomimes, this is more of a loosely-related collection of skits than an all-enveloping story. The sidetracks are all great, of course - The Tramp and a late replacement swinging for the fences in the boxing ring, all manner of drunken hijinx in a ritzy club on New Year's Eve, slapstick encounters with a newly-unveiled statue before an outraged audience - but it doesn't get quite as deep under the skin as Chaplin's other masterpieces.That he doesn't share a wealth of chemistry with his leading lady, Virginia Cherrill (who endured a contentious relationship with the star during production), isn't so much to blame as their too-swift courtship and her disappearance during the second act. We never really get a chance to grow into loving them as a couple, though their sweet parting shot serves as proof that such spoils were within reach. Stuffed with ideas and ingenuity, City Lights still makes for an endearing, if scatter-brained, early romantic comedy."
r-48240,"Apr 28, 2020",8/10,"City lights, let us believe that there is good in the heart. perfect performance and moving plot. Lens switching and movement arrangement are in place. Chaplin was a great master of the early 1930s, when he had such a structure of the story and choreographer of the performance."
wwjd1983ad,"Jan 21, 2002",10/10,"Awesome movie.  The first silent movie I have watched in whole.  I loved it. Beautiful, considering that sound movies were all the rage by then.  But, if it was a sound movie I am sure it wouldn't have been as good."
AlsExGal,"Nov 29, 2025",9/10,"... and for Chaplin that's saying something!Chaplin's Little Tramp character encounters two people who end up impacting his life greatly. One is a beautiful blind flower girl. Due to nothing The Tramp does deliberately, she thinks he is a rich man. The other person he encounters is a wealthy man who, one night, is determined to kill himself because his wife has left him. The Tramp stops him, befriends him, and gets him back home. The entire time the rich man is drinking heavily. But when the rich man sobers up he doesn't remember what happened when he was drunk and therefore has no memory of The Tramp or their friendship. That's not so unusual as a plot device. What makes it odd is that the wealthy man is more of a Jekyll and Hyde drunk than a blackout drunk. When he's drunk he remembers everything he's done in past drunken episodes, including who The Tramp is. When sober he remembers none of this. From both of these relationships, complications ensue.There's a boxing scene mid film that's one of the funniest scenes of any film, ever. It's perfect physical comedy, wonderfully choreographed and I laugh out loud every time I see it. To me, it's the funniest Chaplin scene in any of his films. That scene alone raises it high for me, and then Chaplin's adventures with the millionaire and the sweet romantic scenes with the flower girl seal the deal for me.For me, it's grander in scope than The Kid, but tighter than the other works in combining both comedy and drama."
hukaiqun,"May 11, 2020",9/10,"I loved city lights. Again, the cinematography was amazing, and the costumes and scenery were great. Many of its theme songs linger in my mind, and the sound effects combine perfectly and the subtitles are easy to understand. The comedy was brilliantly done, live in the boxing ring was not only one of my favorite scenes in the Chaplin movie, in a word, it was one of my favorite movies"
creativesris,"Feb 4, 2022",9/10,The boxing scene is golden. The end is eloquently moving. The movie needs to seen in the context as and when it was made. Being cognisant of that makes it an utter masterpiece (does the same apply to citizen kane too?)
jzappa,"Jul 25, 2007",8/10,"Chaplin's City Lights has several funny vignettes, including the climactic boxing match and the scene near the beginning where one of the characters is trying to commit suicide. They are the epitome of slapstick. They're largely unvocal and entirely physical. They're unreasonably against reality, and common sense. This kind of humor can be full of laughs, or simply grin-filled appreciation.What I found the most interesting about this film, and the even later Chaplin film that I previously watched, are the mechanics of the earliest kind of cinematic storytelling. The story threads are so simple, and even close to singular. You can hardly call anything a subplot. There is a single journey taken by a character who encounters several others. I found myself engrossed by this sort of plot. Sometimes the most simplistic stories are the most effective. You really find yourself yearning for Chaplin to get the money for this blind girl's rent. The film may be light, and how can it not be? But while you're watching it, you can't treat the story lightly, which is very impressive for such a threadbare film.Also, having already known that Charlie Chaplin was a multi-talent, a performer, a writer, a director, I had no idea he'd written the score playing over the entire film's action. Most silent film scores are not as beautiful as the score in City Lights. Chaplin pumped his score full of hopeful, naive emotion, which suits the tone of the movie perfectly."
meltemenroute,"Aug 8, 2025",10/10,"Every time I watch City Lights, it awakens the same deep emotions in me. At some point, I even started testing myself to see if that spark still lingered-and yes, it does. This one is a match for life. City Lights is raw, honest, and real-pantomime woven into philosophy. Chaplin's silent gestures speak louder than words, revealing love, dignity, and humanity in their purest form. It's timeless because it doesn't just tell a story-it makes you feel it, every single time."

I just saw this film for the very first time in the class because it a part of class assignment and I'm glad that I had seen the movies.City Lights is a silent film produced in 1931 by Charles Chaplin, In it , he plays the role of his famous ""Little Tramp"". This is a great movie with a deeply toughing message about love and human frailty. The Little Tramp is a great slapstick comedian. This is one of the best moves I've ever seen, and I would recommend renting it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet."
lee_eisenberg,"Jun 22, 2005",10/10,"Charlie Chaplin always made great movies, and ""City Lights"" is no exception. He plays the Tramp, befriending a blind woman (Virginia Cherrill) and helping her out in her life. He also befriends an eccentric millionaire. Unfortunately, the millionaire only recognizes him when he is drunk; whenever he is sober, he considers the Trump some kind of intruder. The Tramp spends much time in jail, basically as punishment for being homeless.Once again, Chaplin has used humor to show the plight of the disenfranchised. A particularly funny scene is when he is helping the blind woman make yarn (you'll never guess what the yarn is). Either way, this is a movie that everyone should see."
Leofwine_draca,"Dec 16, 2024",8/10,"CITY LIGHTS is the first full-length Chaplin film I've watched, and I found myself really enjoying it. It's a silent film (with added sound FX) made during the talkie era, and like the classic Laurel & Hardy films, the star makes excellent use of his medium. This one's a romance between the Tramp and a blind girl, and along the way are the usual misadventures and pratfalls, including a memorable encounter in a boxing ring. I particularly enjoyed the protagonist's relationship with a Jekyll & Hyde alcoholic, leading to an unforgettable party where spaghetti is served and merriment ensues. CITY LIGHTS has left me wanting more."
chapttr,"May 2, 2020",8/10,"Well, it's in this kind of film that we can see how music is important in a movie ! That's a beautiful love story. The girl is a blind person and Charlie is a poor man who does everything for her. So sappy and fun, I love it !"
daisystar,"Feb 22, 2016",10/10,"The theme of this movie is love - the purest form of human love. Not the contrived romance after a lot of ups and downs,as you typically see in a love story. The movie does have its twists but the key message is loud and clear - when you love another person, you value him/her with care, sympathy and a commitment to helping them thrive at your own expense. It also to some extent defies our 21 century notion of love about finding the perfect match. The encounter between the tramp and the blind girl was simple. They didn't even go on dates.Their mutual affection started with the tramp's sympathy for the girl, and evolved as the tramp started to get more involved in the girl's life. The tramp appeared as a weak little man but being in love made him brave enough to tackle a boxing match.The movie conveys something very pure and clean about love, and makes you ponder that love is most beautiful when it's simple.The movie didn't make me burst out laughing. But it's amusing and moving at the same time."
jose-cruz53,"Nov 17, 2012",8/10,"This is pretty much the oldest feature film that I have ever seem from beginning to end and it is a truly engrossing experience to watch a very old film, for several reasons:1 - It gave me a better understanding of how our cultural perceptions evolved over time. Interestingly, our modern culture can be seem as an offshot of the culture displayed in the film, in other words, our modern world can be seem as a more ""refined"" version of the world displayed in this film.2 - The quality of this film is extremely high, in fact, I would say it was almost as good as Citizen Kane, which is my gold standard for films made before ca. 1950. The way that this film builds up a marvelous story without the use of dialogue is very impressive and refreshing, considering the abuse of dialogue in films made later (such as Chinatown)."
leosmith-11166,"Nov 22, 2015",9/10,"Charlie Chaplin made many fantastic films, from The Gold Rush to the Great Dictator, but none are better than City Lights. Charlie Chaplins comedy(written, directed and starring) is almost as much touching as it is humorous. The plot is about Charlie Chaplins tramp character, who finds many different ways of producing money for a blind flower girl whom he has fallen in love with. The perfect comic timing, the brilliant performance of Charlie Chaplin, the Wonderful music and the touching themes combine to make one of the greatest films ever made.10/10 for this Film because of not only its comedy, but it's themes. I doubt you won't cry during the movie, I and I even more highly doubt that you won't laugh. 84 years ago it was made, but it's still making people laugh. That's got to be something worth watching."
midriff99,"Apr 8, 2003",N/A,"While I was watching this movies, I felt incredible warmth even without the speaking dialogue.  The movie gives not only laughs but also tears.  I appreciated watching this movie because I had not had many chances to watch old movies before watching this movie.  I recommend this movie if someone wants to be deeply moved in their heart."
seignonarielle,"May 1, 2016",9/10,"City Lights by Charlie Chaplin is a silent film released in 1931; it can be clearly categorized in a comedy genre. The movie director and lead character (the tramp) is Charlie Chaplin. The blind girl is played by Virginia Cherrill. Those two characters love grown all along the movie, but during the hour and a half, the film lasted, the tramp set you on another journey full of laughs which were the main purpose of the film in my opinion.The theme is: life is worth living and can be much better with your smile on. Since it is a silent movie the names of the characters are not known. The fact that the tramp was the person that give his life back to the millionaire and the blind girl, is one aspect that illustrates why life is worth living is the theme of the movie. It is a silent movie. Besides the story itself, the choice of the director to go for a silent movie even though at that point it was possible to do the movie with sound is to emphasize the theme. That choice was made to distinguish the other movies front this one ,and to show how great and exceptional it could be. Even though it was a silent movie it is a classic American film, because of its simplicity and it the theme; regardless of the time period is a theme such as life is worth it, will always be an up to date theme. The historical context is also great because it was after the first World War; it gives hope. Those three points helped to illustrate the theme.In 1992 , the Tom and Jerry movie was released; the theme of life is worth it can be also found in this movie. because of the story , the humor and the simplicity of the story, the both movies are similar in key points that that support the same theme.There is two specific technique used in the film that has retained my attention. The absence of any dialogue is most obvious. To compensate with that the director used the transitions to let the watcher know what is happening when it was essential . For instance, at several moment in the movie, there were black screens with a simple sentence written on it. The second point is the angle there is very few close up scene, only with the pretty girl and the hug scene at the end of the movie. That choice for the angles helps the watcher to concentrate more on the facial expression, emotional and non-verbal communication to compensate the non-dialogue when it is close up scene. When the camera is far the actions of the characters are more put in the spotlight..I personally liked this movie a lot, loved to laugh for an hour and a half and adored to watch it again."
gavin6942,"Jan 23, 2010",8/10,"A poor man (Charlie Chaplin) falls for a blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) who mistakenly thinks he is wealthy. After rescuing a man from a drunken suicide attempt, the tramp befriends him and soon he finds himself able to help the girl get eye surgery. The catch? The rich man forgets the poor man's existence every time he sobers up.Upon my first viewing, I had no strong background in Charlie Chaplin films. Aside from ""Modern Times"", I cannot recall really seeing all that many before. And I freely admit I had a bias towards Buster Keaton, the earlier, ""better"" silent comedian. But their comedy is somewhat different: Buster is more physical, whereas Charlie seems to be more of as prop artist.Upon further review, Chaplin's work is better appreciated. We see in this film that he mocks the motion picture industry as a whole, which has now embraced the talkies; the only ""dialogue"" here is a stream of squawks, and Chaplin noted that ""dialogue is superfluous noise"". Of course, he eventually gave in, but this film proved that silents could compete -- and sometimes exceed -- the talking films. (Just as today black and white is not common, but can still have its powerful impact.)The bulk of the comedy here, besides falling down, could be called ""bait and switch"" routines. The tramp is presented with an item, and then it switches to something else (such as pasta turning into confetti). It is funny, and you have to give the film credit for keeping audiences entertained when they cannot verbally tell jokes.One of the greatest things about the film is the casting of Virginia Cherrill. Prior to this film, she was a complete unknown, and through Chaplin she was launched into the stars. Not that her name is well-known today, but she was married to Cary Grant and later George Francis Child Villiers, 9th Earl of Jersey. That has to count for something for a Chicago native!If you have not seen much Chaplin, see this one. Almost all critics agree that it is one of his best, and this was also Chaplin's favorite of his own work. Jeffrey Vance believes it to be his ""most perfect film""."
johnnyboyz,"Aug 19, 2006",8/10,"Charlie Chaplain's comic outings are very well known, even today and given the amount that he made, it's difficult not to come across one of his classics every now and again. I happened to stumble across 'City Lights', in which the comedy still holds up.What makes the film still good is the simplicity of the comedy. The situations are common, everyday and relatable to and most things that MIGHT go wrong, do; given the circumstances. These apply to going to a restaurant, fighting in a boxing match and spending time in someone else's home. Early on during the statue scene, everything is placed into context and the scene serves as a good introduction to the film and its content. This is good for people first encountering Chaplain and this is the perfect introduction to his world of 'slapstick humour'. The things that could possibly go wrong; do and everything has an eerie sense of realism. 'What would happen if a tramp was indeed sleeping during a statue unveiling?' or indeed, got involved in any of the other situations in this film. One thing I found particularly interesting was the instance where everyone paused to respect the national anthem, even the tramp amongst the chaos. Nobody moved during the anthem and although they were trying to get him down initially, everything stops for the anthem  everything. I found this an interesting little piece of propaganda but very humorous at the same time: No matter what's going on around you, always stop to respect the nation when given the chance.What's also interesting is the narrative in the film. Narrative film making was around but was only about a decade or two old. In other films from around the time, narratives were still pretty basic but they got their story across, albeit maybe jumbled. In City Lights, the love story is put across effectively and the whole side story of the drunken millionaire/Chaplain trying to raise money is well sewn in; this adds to the effectiveness of the ending, also. What I like is the feeling of the character just wondering around, living day to day life, encountering people and things. There is that feeling of chance throughout. The backgrounds, given the date, are equally as interesting.Although you do see some gags coming, for instance the spaghetti scene where the similar looking decorations lurk menacingly above, City Lights does enough; with its love story, simplistic and comic situations mixed with actual humour such as the 'I thought you were driving' scene and the bad effect the lucky charms have on the boxers prior to the fight scene and the fact that there's enough in the film for you to take it seriously, especially the ending.'City Lights' will remain a classic."
jack_o_hasanov,"Aug 26, 2021",10/10,"There's very little chance of a movie being bad if it has Charlie Chaplin. Being silent became a movie that people all over the world understood and laughed at. It's a great movie, but also emotional. This movie has also been adapted into many movies."
Lorenzo1950,"Jun 21, 2004",N/A,"There is not much more I can say that has not already been said. This is one of the best films ever made and I would rate it 10/10. What moves me the most is that the little tramp is the essence of decency. The fact that he is a tramp does not make him lazy or not trustworthy. There is a subtle message here about giving of yourself, sacrifice and kindness. I also think the true meaning of love is expressed very well in the relationship between the blind girl and the tramp. And the saddest thing is that even though she will find out he is her benefactor, there is the probability that any true relationship between them is doomed once she has her sight. Could you allow yourself to offer someone the gift of sight knowing as the tramp does that it will end your relationship forever? This is the true meaning of love and giving. I think this film should be required viewing for everyone. You will never ever forget the last 5 minutes of this movie. Great."
ankitbbd,"Feb 26, 2016",8/10,"Story - A tramp falls in love with a blind girl and want to help her medically.Charlie Chaplin is considered as one of the best comedian of all time.This is his first movie that I have watched and I believe that he was brilliant as an actor.Virginia Cherrill who plays role of a blind girl was superb.She was convincing as well as charming.Movie movie was funny as well as emotional in the end. Film has no dialogues but background score has done its job.Background score is composed by Charlie Chaplin himself.Restaurant scene was funny.But best scene of movie was the boxing scene.I laughed too much during that scene.It was perfectly directed and executed.I haven't seen such a funnier scene in a long time.I mean you can't expect that a boxing match scene can make you laugh.Although movie is little slow in the starting,but its a great entertainer. Overall I give it 8/10."
lukecon-63436,"Aug 15, 2020",10/10,"Definitely a movie worth seeing. The ending is really well-shot, especially with its useful close-ups that help convey and evoke emotions. City Lights also has some other good camerawork in it that tries to save time.
The story is great as well, filled with gripping conflict that grips us from the start. I found the story's concepts to be very good as well, especially the ending.
Watch City Lights. You surely won't regret it."
tutuchew,"Feb 27, 2017",8/10,"Today movies are filled with fast paced dialouge, zipping car chases, and complete CGI casts. In all of this the true storytelling of movies has been lost. When we return to the time when the screen was indeed silver we find honest stories that put many modern movies to shame. In this silent film, Charlie Chapman falls in love with a beautiful blind flower girl. Without using any words, he wood both the flower girl and the audience with his sweet actions and selfless sacrifice."
caspian1978,"Jun 27, 2001",8/10,"Jack Lemmon had every right to love the ending of City Lights. Especially for 1931, Chaplin delivers the most powerful ending in any of his early comedies. The entire film is filled with one comical situation after the other. But, the ending, the ending is perfection. The entire audience is crying while still smiling at the Tramp."
