JFHunt,"Jan 27, 2007",10/10,"Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like It's A Wonderful Life.Does it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it's just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be.Everything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst.Sometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen. And I'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. I'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year. I've watched it 3 times since. The only movie to ever make me cry. I probably wouldn't have all the answers for you, if you asked me why. I'm still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was Reed.What can I say? This movie is a life changing experience.Makes me feel good to be alive. What a wonderful little world it is. And if I waited my entire life, it would not be a waste of time."
jon-larsen,"Mar 14, 2010",10/10,"When I heard about this movie for the first time, I thought it was just a forgettable and funny movie. But I was wrong. I saw this movie last Christmas and I did not find it funny, but I loved it, though! Everything is so great in this movie. The story is amazing. The characters are great, and the character's development is fantastic! the cinematography is grea, and the acting is fantastic. James Stewart was mind blowing. The whole movie is amazing,touching and encouraging. You cannot describe how good this movie is. Nor can you describe how good the message is.This is the best feel-good movie ever. It's a life changing movie, actually. It makes you feel good to be alive. Do me a favor and watch this movie as soon as possible! When you're sad, think about the message this movie delivers, because you will get a smile on your face! I'm 14 years old. My English is not very good, but I hope this review was useful!"
Coxer99,"Mar 4, 1999",10/10,"No movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic. I had the honor of doing a play version of it about 5 years ago. I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.Stewart gives the finest performance of his career, in one of the most difficult characters ever portrayed. A character all of us are familiar with...a person looking to find himself/herself. It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful..."
dweck,"Dec 9, 1998",N/A,"I am a film lover from 'way back, having even served a stint as a newspaper movie critic. Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include ""Fantasia,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and ""The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is ""It's a Wonderful Life.""I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as ""...the richest man in town."" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time."
bkoganbing,"Dec 25, 2005",10/10,"I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the ""richest and meanest man in town"", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save.Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you.And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it."
FlickJunkie-2,"Dec 6, 2000",10/10,"This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas."
brianlion,"Nov 5, 2002",10/10,"I am so glad Frank Capra had a vision to make ""It's A Wonderful Life"". I'm glad he chose Jimmy Stewart to play George Bailey. There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie."
PyrolyticCarbon,"Sep 13, 2002",10/10,"This is one of the best films of all time, without a doubt. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!James Stewart is one of my favourite actors, and in this film he acts so naturally you even forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it."
msaz12,"Jul 1, 2012",7/10,"Reminiscent of the story of Scrooge of A Christmas Carol, the movie in itself is predictable and slightly less haunting. Similarly, the center of the film is also focused on the Christmas holiday, making it much more dramatic because contemplating suicide on a night where everyone is celebrating is such an irony. Throughout the film, you feel powerless for George, as if all the world's problems continue to fall unto him, a character that most people can relate to regardless of age or generation. Dreams come with sacrifices.Supposedly a feel-good movie, its one of those where you are made to feel bad so you can feel better after. It has you cringing and falling flat on your face before you get picked up. Though the ending may be touching, it does not do much in terms of solving the main character's personal issues and is unconvincing in a real-world setting. Perhaps in an ideal world, that is all it takes to be happy.A movie with a big case of 'you don't know what you have til its gone'. All it takes is an imaginary slap and you're back to accepting the life you have been dealt, only this time, you're happier about it.From an optimistic point of view, the movie is a good reminder to everyone that happiness isn't a checklist you have to accomplish, but a state of mind you attain when you feel content.7 out of 10 stars, because it's a classic and has a better storyline and script than most movies these days."
Aidan McGuinness,"Feb 11, 2002",9/10,"Here's a new definition of cold-hearted: a man or woman who remains completely untouched by the 1946 Capra classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". You can't not be moved by this wonderful little gem.The acting is all great. One of the film's greatest strengths for me is making George Bailey - the star of the movie played by James Stewart - a nice normal man. He's not perfect and that's pretty much essential to the film's success because Bailey could be *any* man. The lesson of the movie is fairly simple - we all have our role to play in the world and we are all important. Most movies would make this into a schmaltzy affair but Capra delivered a touching, heart warming tale. Bailey consistently denies himself to allow others to live as he sacrifices his life to make sure people can have enough money to avoid having to sell-their-soul in debt to the evil H. Potter (alas not a Harry Potter...). His complete and utter humility is great - he doesn't see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel Clarence shows him. Again Clarence isn't played in the usual clichéd manner but more as a believable character who honestly loves Bailey for his strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter. The music, the set pieces, all the touches add to a wonderful movie and give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful. A lovely mood-lifter. 8.8/10."
Irene212,"Jul 28, 2009",7/10,"Criticizing It's A Wonderful Life is almost an act of treason in this country, but if ever a movie deserved a closer look, it's this one.Far from being a celebration of the importance of the individual, or of small-town life, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" depicts most citizens of Bedford Falls as timorous weaklings. Moviegoers identify with the hero, George, of course, but he's the exception in this movie, not the rule. If any general lesson is to be learned from the story, it's that a willful leader is the only thing preventing ordinary small-town folk from losing not only prosperity, but morality.The evidence is plain: Without George Bailey to hold the town together, it becomes Pottersville, which is a Hays Code version of Gomorrah. The townsfolk haven't got the courage or sense to manage their own affairs without a leader. In Bedford Falls, that's either corrupt Potter or long-suffering George. The only other characters with any backbone are Harry Bailey and Sam Wainwright, and they both left town. What remains are virtual ciphers like Mr. Gower, Uncle Billy, Ernie, and Bert.America doesn't exactly burst at the seams with self-reliant citizens, according to Frank Capra. So why does this movie merit a healthy 7 rating? Two reasons:First, it is beautifully made, every frame reflecting the lives of post-Depression, post-war Americans, and their vulnerability to the powerful forces of financiers.Second, because it has undeniable power. Capra was a good director-- but a great propagandist. He made patriotic short films for the U. S. Army from 1942 until 1948-- and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was made in 1946, smack in the middle of that period. The film is a masterpiece of manipulation. People love it, watch it over and over again every year, never noticing that its real message is deeply cynical, presenting little hope for mankind, and almost no faith in it. Indeed, it is almost fascistic in the way it champions the idea of a single leader (or worse, divine intervention) taking charge over ineffectual ordinary middle class people. Capra is skilled enough to make generations of Americans cry and cheer at his movies, no matter how much he insults us."
TheLittleSongbird,"Mar 28, 2010",10/10,"It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers?Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently. Bethany Cox"
salemalissa,"Oct 14, 2021",10/10,"Wonderful acting with an outstanding story, if only its possible to show this movie to everyone who is feeling down at the moment because of financial issues.People sometimes forget that small good deeds always pay off and that's always better to be known as a nice person than a bad person no matter what."
bradman2000,"Apr 18, 2000",N/A,"After strong performances in films such as ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"", James Stewart confirmed his status as one of the greats with his performance as George Bailey in ""It's a Wonderful Life"". This movie is, without a doubt, the best of all time.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a movie that you can watch over and over again. It's movie that makes you think, about life in general and how each person makes a difference, and about how great life can be (hence the title ""It's a Wonderful Life). Whilst making you think, it also entertains with many light hearted moments, particularly towards the end of the film.The direction, sound and casting in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are second to none.  Yet it is the fact that almost any person can watch this movie and come away feeling inspired that makes it easily the best movie of all time!A 10/10 without a doubt!"
Sunsphxsuns,"Dec 15, 2021",10/10,"If you were to ask me what Holiday-themed film I enjoy the most and never get tired watching, my answer would invariably be, Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946).Of course, there are many other great holiday movies that are also genuine cinematic treasures, even though they're not as well known as ""It's A Wonderful Life."" My ""must watch"" holiday list includes many of the black and white classics I have previously reviewed on IMDb such as, ""Holiday Inn (1942),""It Happened On 5th Avenue,"" (1947), A Christmas Carol (1951),"" ""Christmas In Connecticut,"" (1945) and although it's in color, ""White Christmas"" (1954). And for good measure I still immensely enjoy watching ""Home Alone 1 & 2"" (1990-1992) and the charming trilogy, ""The Santa Clause"" (1994-2004-2006).Nevertheless, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the singular holiday film that continues to resonate with me on multiple levels. It is a supremely powerful story of self-worth and destiny, bolstered by superb acting, laced with unforgettable characters like George Bailey, Clarence Oddbody, and Mr. Potter, thoughtful cinematography which perfectly captures the small town ambiance of Bedford Falls, sharp editing (no surprise since Capra began his film career as an editor), a beautiful score by Russian composer Dimitri Tiomkin, and more memorable quotes than could ever be listed here.Ironically, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" may never have popped up on anyone's cinematic radar screen had the proper copyright ownership documents been registered. How this error occurred is fascinating.The original 1945 ownership of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" belonged to Liberty Films, an independent motion picture production company created by the film's brilliant director, Frank Capra. The following year, Liberty was purchased by Paramount. Ten years later, in 1955, M. & A. Alexander subsequently purchased the rights to the short story, ""The Greatest Gift,"" on which the film was based. With the purchase also came the rights to the film itself, television syndication, and the music score. Shortly thereafter, National Telefilm Associates (NTA) became the new owner. Amazingly, a clerical error meant NTA had neglected to renew its copyright. By 1974, the movie fell into the ""public domain.""In essence, Capra's masterpiece no longer had copyright protection, and therefore, anyone could make copies of the film, package it anyway they chose, all without having to pay for it. Because of this, television studios began broadcasting ""It's A Wonderful Life"" during the Christmas holidays, while dozens of other companies packaged and sold the film in various media forms such as VHS, and later, Laser Disc and DVD. The good news- This nearly forgotten film was now being seen for the first time by millions of people. The bad news - Many of the reproductions were of poor quality, with some crudely edited down from the original 131 minute run time into a shorter length to accommodate TV scheduling. Nevertheless, these unusual series of events managed to breathe new life into Capra's stunning film for future generations.As often occurs with films destined for immortality, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was initially a financial box office failure, although it was nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and has been revered by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made.There's nothing more I can add to this review that hasn't been covered already by other astute IMDb reviewers, but I will say that if you have still not seen ""It's A Wonderful Life"" by now (2021) then stop whatever you're doing and buy the BR, DVD, or stream it. I'm confident even after your first viewing you are going to feel like you've just seen one of the greatest films ever made, and you would be absolutely right!No spoilers here as usual but I will reveal that while much of the film happens in the fictional town of Bedford Falls during a very cold, snowy, Wintery Christmas holiday, it was actually filmed in Southern California which was experiencing a sweltering record heat wave!"
scotthardman-95012,"Dec 25, 2020",10/10,"I'm a 51 years old typical Australian knockabout male and somehow throughout all my years have never seen this Movie before.After hearing about the best Christmas movies ever made on my local radio station I was blessed with accidentally seeing it was being shown on a little local tv station on Christmas night.Well it is most definitely one of the best movies of all time I have ever watched & I can't wait to watch it again (Christmas Eve)but please if it's shown on a commercial station then wait to watch it without adverts interrupting this classic piece of cinematography.All the human emotions are in play for both the characters and the viewer so if you haven't been blessed to watch it then jump on board as ""A Wonderful Life ""awaits you."
samraff-86689,"Dec 19, 2019",7/10,"Now, I don't think it's perfect. I certainly don't think it's a masterpiece, but it's got a lot a stuff going for it. Credit where credit is due, I can see why this is a classic.
It's characters are infinitely loveable, and all of the performances are damn good. Pretty great direction and dialogue as well.
The editing was certainly a little off sometimes, and that was noticeable, although this is a really minor complaint. It has a good deal of subtext, and manages to convey George's feelings very well with the cinematic medium. However, I felt that his feelings were a little too simple and on the surface towards the end, but I'm not saying he had didn't have good reason to be upset, it's just with an act such as suicide, you'd expect George to be completely and utterly tired of life. And the film was saying he was, but it didn't TOTALLY convince me. My main complaint really had something to do with the time period. The angels at the start being stars was certainly funny, but they could've shown a little more, which would be hard to, but it would make the film a bit better.
That aside, this is a pretty great film, and a great experience at the theatre, which was where I saw it."
LeahJoyRivera,"Dec 17, 2022",10/10,"To say this is the greatest movie of all time is an understatement. It's not Christmas if you haven't watched this movie, it changed my life in so many profound ways, it tackles so many real-life issues even during the 1940s. I never thought a 2 hour and 11 minute film would change my outlook in life. We should be grateful for the life the Lord has given us, truly, you have not lived if you have not watched this movie. I have watched almost all of the top 250 imdb movies but this film here is something very different. I have never been able to pick a favorite movie but I can unequivocally say this is it. Go watch it now! Best decision of my life!"

I have watched it over 40 times now and I still get tearful towards the end of the film. If anyone wants to find out why life is worth living, this is the one to watch."
r96sk,"Dec 26, 2020",8/10,"Lovely film.'It's a Wonderful Life' is enjoyable, hearty and well crafted. It takes longer than I would've predicted to get to 'the event', but it's very much worth seeing the journey that comes before - as we see the arc of James Stewart's George. It all crescendos with an ending that you can't help but smile at.Stewart is excellent in the lead role, you really do see every single emotion that his character goes through. He is, by far, the standout performer, but there are of course good performances from the likes of Donna Reed (Mary), Lionel Barrymore (Henry) and Henry Travers (Clarence).I did notice a few weird cuts in there, not that I hold that against it or did it affect my enjoyment - it's just noticeable. I see, via other reviewers, that there's a colour version - Channel 4 showed the black-and-white version over here in the UK. I can't say I felt the need for colour, which is always a good sign.Wholesome. Not that it, evidently given the average rating, needs to be said by someone like me, but: I'd certainly recommend this."
thelandofoo,"Dec 20, 2022",10/10,"Shortly after the end of WW2, the tastes of the American people yearned for something more real like the war, which lead to the underperformance of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life as it was deemed too sentimental. After years of being played on television, it eventually got the attention it rightfully deserved. George Bailey, played by James Stewart, yearns to leave Bedford Falls, but one unfortunate event after another calls for George to make sacrifice after sacrifice, until it all culminates to one crucial moment on the night of Christmas Eve when he is at his lowest and most vulnerable. James Stewart presents a wide range and a layered character and one we can root for as his dreams go further out from his reach. How the writers brought Christianity into the story was appealing to me and is approached in a way that makes it universally digestible. We have ourselves a great cast of memorable characters that show some growth and then there is the easily detestable Mr. Potter, who seeks to take over the town and is continuously at odds with the Baileys. The tone of the movie itself I found to be perfectly balanced as we get plenty of heartfelt moments, but also some dark and intense ones as well. It's a Wonderful Life proves to be more than a holiday classic, as it excels with its story that everyone can take something away from. Final verdict: 10/10."
fistofgonzo,"Dec 25, 2021",10/10,"This story gets me every time. The themes of gratitude, family, and self worth are timeless and touching. It also has messages regarding materialism, and how money and ""things"" aren't really what's important in life. Despite George's failed dreams, he still touched people's lives in ways he couldn't measure until his guardian angel showed him. It's a beautiful reminder of what really matters in life, and the remastered color version looks really damn good. This movie is legendary and should be mandatory annual viewing."
evanston_dad,"Mar 23, 2006",6/10,"My apologies to all of you ""It's a Wonderful Life""-ers out there. Please believe me when I say that I've tried multiple times to develop warm feelings for this movie. But it's just not meant to be. I've seen this film a couple of times, and I never want to see it again.I want to beat James Stewart's George Bailey about the head and shoulders every time I watch the movie. Perhaps the most passive-aggressive hero in motion picture history, George Bailey spends half of his time sacrificing his own happiness for the sake of others, and the other half whining about his hard luck. No, George, it's not hard luck...it's the result of your own decision making skills. Either be selfless and stop complaining, or be a bastard and screw everyone else. But make up your mind, and don't take two hours to do it.Ahhh, perhaps I now live in too cynical and jaded a world to tolerate George's namby-pamby indecision. But maybe that's a reason better than any other to keep this film around. Character aside, however, the one thing I can unequivocally praise about this film is the performance of Stewart. He provides a welcome bitter edge to combat Capra's sugary-sweet corn. His breakdown scene in a bar, where he desperately prays to God to help him keep himself together, is a tour-de-force.Drag it out every Christmas and enjoy...I won't begrudge you that small pleasure. Just don't expect me to join along.Grade: B-"
CainCrow50,"Jan 11, 2022",9/10,"An absolute classic of ever there was one. A movie that, thankfully, transcends being a ""Christmas movie"". If you removed the minuscule reference to Christmas you would still have the classic as it is today. A film about caring for your neighbour and your neighbour is everyone. A film about sacrifice for those you love and even your community at large. It won't make you rich in money but it would make the world a better place. Never forget the YOU, like George Bailey, matter. You matter to more people than you know. It's a Wonderful Life if you can see that."
Mr-Fusion,"Dec 15, 2016",6/10,"This isn't the first time I've seen ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but it still leaves me cold. And it's primarily because the Dickensian ""what-if?"" hook that redeems George Bailey in the end isn't enough to make up for the brutal treatment of that character up until that point. I know that's a minority opinion; my family thinks I'm nuts. But look, Bailey's a dreamer, brimming with a youthful ambition that gets snuffed out time and again by his obligation to Bedford Falls. Sure, there's a message here, that he protects the town from predatory capitalism, but to see the man struck down by one cruel twist of fate after another is beyond frustrating; and the payoff feels cheap in comparison.This is a classic for a reason, and who knows, maybe I'll grow into it. But as it stands, its charms are wasted on me.6/10"
oneillrobyn,"Dec 28, 2009",5/10,"I am definitely in the minority regarding ""Wonderful Life"". I have avoided seeing this movie for years ... and I finally gave in just before Christmas 2009. It was Christmas Eve and I discovered why I was so depressed on the holiday. I really can't stand this movie. The original problem I had with it was when I first saw it many many years ago. I didn't like the idea that ""Mary"" needed glasses and was ""ugly"", and a lonely prim librarian without Jimmy Stewart in her life. No, I am not a librarian, but I love spending time in libraries with all the knowledge books have to offer. I felt this was gratuitous and insulting. In addition, couldn't ""Mary"" have found another husband? I resented those old movies where all the those poor, struggling people live in large, comfortable old houses, even if the hero's mother ran a boarding house. I think Frank Capra's films are phony and the products of an immature mind. Another Christmasy movie is my favorite one: ""The Bishop's Wife"". It's sophisticated, witty and beautiful, and has much stronger actors than any of Capra's films, with the exception of Henry Travers who, as far as I am concerned, is the real star of ""Wonderful Life"". Even Lionel Barrymore is wasted in ""Life""."
evanfwambeke,"Jan 12, 2021",10/10,"Watching this movie has been an annual holiday tradition for me and every year it's as poignant as the first. It's brought to life with many fantastic performances, dialogue and story to create a truly romantic, heartfelt, feel-good movie. A timeless classic deserving of all the stars allowed."
SPZMaxinema,"Dec 17, 2021",8/10,"This is what one would call a genuine feel-good movie, especially if you're looking to get into the Christmas spirit with loved ones! The humor in this film still works and the main actor James Stewart puts on a great performance. One of the best black and white movies I've seen!"
claudio_carvalho,"Jan 5, 2007",10/10,"On the Christmas Eve at Bedford Falls, the guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is assigned to convince the desperate George Bailey (James Stewart) to not commit suicide. George is a good man, that sacrificed his dreams and his youth on behalf of the citizens of his small town. He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining the university as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and has never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive. When Clarence sees that he is not able to persuade George to give up his intention, he decides to show the life in town if George had never existed. George concludes that life is wonderful.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is certainly one of the most beautiful movies of the cinema history ever. This masterpiece has a touching and moralist story, showing that the famous sentence that a man can make the difference is true. Everything works perfectly in this movie. The original screenplay develops the situation and the characters accurately, using flashbacks and magnificent lines. The direction of Frank Capra is outstanding as usual. The cinematography in black & white and using shadows and lights is fantastic. James Stewart leads an amazing cast, showing a perfect chemistry with the gorgeous Donna Reed, in the role of a compassionate and enlightened good man. Lionel Barrymore is also amazing in the role of the despicable banker. I do not recall how many times I have already seen this film, but last time was 16 Dec 2000. This is the type of movie that a lover of cinema will never get tired of watching many times. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Felicidade não se Compra"" (""The Happiness Is not Bought"")"
LinkinParkEnjoyer,"Dec 25, 2019",9/10,"This is basically my only Christmas tradition movie. I have to watch this every Christmas or else I would go nuts. James Stewart really steals the scene with his acting and beautiful charm. He was great in every movie I've ever watched him in. It is wonderful, it is funny, it is touching and it is human."
Piedradura,"Dec 25, 2018",10/10,I've seen this film at least 20 times over the years and it never fails to move me. It Is so relevant more than seven decades later. Our wonderful nation could very well face the same future that Mr. Potter wanted to inflict on Bedford Falls. Amazing how its basic premise of redemption and good winning over greed resonates in 21st century America.The older I get the more emotional this film makes me. It is simply that good.
daveisit,"Dec 1, 2000",7/10,"This movie is like eating your vegies. You don't like them but you know they are good.I didn't really enjoy this movie. George Bailey gives so much in life and suffers because of it. He then starts complaining and having a cry over it all. Get over it mate. What was happening in his life happens a lot more often today, so he may have won the battle but he didn't win the war. Business is business and if you can't move with the times, you are almost bound to be unsuccessful.I didn't enjoy it because I found his personality so annoying. What this does mean is the movie got me thinking and Jimmy Stewart played his part well. I have only kind words to say about the production of the movie and definitely recommend it to all.7 out of 10."
buiger,"May 9, 2014",5/10,"Now, here is one movie where I will have to disagree with almost everybody. I do not care that this film has become a Christmas staple, and notwithstanding my love and admiration for Frank Capra and James Stewart, this movie is far from even being particularly good, let alone a masterpiece. This is a movie that somehow got hyped up with the passing of time, and now exists in a universe of its own. It is telling that at the time of its making, it did not even receive a single Oscar. Apparently, at the time, nobody thought it to be so special...Now, if you look at this picture objectively and without the typically ""small-town-America do-good pink-shaded sunglasses"", you will find a very simple, obvious and at times boring story. The characters are so simplified, that most are just caricatures of real people (just look at the local villain). Technically, there is nothing to write home about either. The sound, as a matter of fact is terrible, one can barely discern the (sometimes confusing) dialog.And then we come to (according to the masses, and not only) the most important part of the movie: the message. Here is where I have another major problem... I may be cynical or stupid, but I do not see what this all-important transcendental message is; If it is simply 'be a good person', this could have been (and has been) done much better. This movie is a mix of slapstick Hollywood 'feel good' and of political correctness '1947 style'. No wonder it fares so good in our modern times..."
dowdosean,"Jun 20, 2006",10/10,"I had fond memories of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" but, somehow, it never made my top ten. The other night I felt the urge to see it again, from beginning to end, after that fun compilation from the AFI, 100 movies, 100 Cheers. The most surprising thing about this perennial classic is that it's not just a good movie but a sort of miracle. Age has made it more relevant, more powerful. Frank Capra is, without question, its miracle worker. His narration style was a first and in a way unsurpassed. As you may very well know, the film wasn't an instant success. A peculiarity it shares with most of the great works of art. The truth is something that needs time to be confirmed even recognized. James Stewart's performance lived from a 2006 stand point is, quite simply, extraordinary. Capra's films were known as ""capracorn"" in their day. Strange to think about it now because its sentimentality wasn't really sentimental but a need to find goodness in the darkest places. The great Capra not only found it, it unmasked it with the same relish that he unmasked evil and greed. My only regret is that on this times of technical prowess we'll never see again the likes of ""It's Wonderful Life"" But, trying to look on the bright side in the most Capraesque kind of way. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" will be around for ever."
kbncyk,"Sep 4, 2006",10/10,"On one crisp December evening, two decades ago, my husband and I celebrated our very first Christmas together as a married couple. One of our yearly traditions, which we established that very Christmas season, has been to settle in front of the TV with a large bowl of popcorn and sodas for a quiet evening enjoying the holiday classics.That evening, my husband flipped the channels and excitedly noted the film ""It's a Wonderful Life"" had just started playing. After learning that I'd never seen it, my hubby enthusiastically said, ""You have to watch this movie - it's one of the best films EVER.""I guess my prejudice toward black-and-white TV was rearing its ugly head. I was in no mood to watch a dated film that I thought was of no relevance to us. I encouraged my hubby to see if he could find one of the many holiday classics that we enjoyed as kids growing up in the late 1960s, early 1970s timeframe.My husband chuckled and said, ""Trust me, you'll love this story. It's about this guy, George Bailey, who..."" After relating a brief synopsis of the film, he warned me that I might find the first 45 minutes or so to be slow-moving. Still, he encouraged me to pay attention closely. ""Remember everything happening now to this guy, George,"" he advised, ""It'll pay off in the second part of the film.""As I watched George struggle with his devoted wife to raise their kids and pay the bills, report to a job that he never really wanted, battle his devious nemesis Mr. Potter, and yearn for a life that might have been, I thought - okay, there are some universal themes here. But this was a Christmas film? I couldn't make the connection, and really wasn't in the mood to continue watching anything that wasn't about Christmas.I was getting ready to go into the other room to finish my Christmas wrapping when, suddenly, finally, it was Christmas Eve in George Bailey's little world. I remembered looking at that serene little town, decorated for Christmas and bathed in fluffy white snow, and wishing that I lived in such a place.And just as my husband had promised, over the course of the next several minutes, everything started to come together. By the end of the film, as I watched George Bailey come to the realization, with his cherished family and lifelong friends gathered around him under his Christmas tree that George Bailey, representing every man and woman, ultimately realized that he surely had had a wonderful life. I wiped away a happy tear from my eye, knowing I'd viewed something very special.Then two and then four Christmases later, as I sat in a rocking chair, at first with our newborn baby girl and then her baby brother, I watched It's a Wonderful Life with my babies. I have subsequently repeated this tradition with friends and relatives of all ages. Many of them, like me at first thought they were dealing with an out-of-touch film from the mid-1940s, only to come to realize the timeless, wonderful gift we've all been given by Frank Capra.Since Christmas 1985, I have watched ""It's a Wonderful Life"" countless times. I agree with many other viewers - it is not only hands-down, the best Christmas movie, but perhaps my most favorite movie of all. I love and cherish it for so many reasons, perhaps most of all because it really makes you stop to think about what's important in your own life.And the most special moments of all are those times when I get to share ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as my husband did that one Christmas so long ago, with someone who is watching the film for the very first time."

My mother would talk about her and say she knew she was going to be a star even at 17 years of age. I remember going to their 65th high school reunion in Portland Oregon and meeting Virginia for the first time she was warm gracious and friendly and obviously the star of the 78-year-old crowd that was gathered.I remember her signing my VHS copy of it's a wonderful life and she wrote "" Steve it really is a wonderful life"" I will all miss you Virginia !

sergiuraica_ro,"Dec 24, 2018",N/A,"In my opinion ""It's a Wonderful Life"" can be considered one of the greatest movies to watch this time of the year. Actually we can say that it's even one of the top 100 greatest films of all time you should watch in a lifetime.The acting is all great, and the same goes for the story. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" it really is a movie that you can watch over and over again and that makes you think about life in general and how each person makes a difference.I recommend it."
kamringortney,"Dec 9, 2022",7/10,"A Wonderful Life was not one of my favorites and did not really keep my attention...the concept of the movie was very interesting but not filmed as well as the idea. The movie followed a man put through a stressful situation to prove a point to him and humble him. The angel that puts him through this loop that makes everyone around him forget who he was and he was in shock. The acting in this movie was not the best and could have been improved by a lot. The movie was good quality for its time, just wish the writers would have improved the idea and dialog. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys older movies or people who enjoy Christmas movies."

It is the best movie which tells us about the real meaning of life that you would understand only after seeing this movie otherwise you will ignore it like any other quotes you read. It's my humble request to everyone reading this please give it a try and you will certainly learn something new about life. You will certainly see a flaw in today's society thinking and I pray to god that if your mindset changes do help others as much as you can as I will.
Sleepin_Dragon,"Nov 4, 2023",9/10,"George Bailey gives his all for the people of Bedford Falls, big hearted and selfless, George puts the needs of others before himself, pushed to breaking point, he contemplates suicide.I feel almost guilty watching this grey film in November, as it's definitely one of my Christmas watchlist, but with the decorations appearing, and the mince pies in shops, I thought, why not.Nobody does it quite like Frank Capra, there is a depth to this movie that's quite something, it's a story of greed, hope, compassion and humanity.The story resonates as much today, a tale of the little guy taking on the unscrupulous, wealthy greedy big business (some things never change, right!)It's light hearted for the most part, but there are some very bleak moments thrown in, that scene where people demand their money, and that heart stoping moment where George vents his frustrations on his Uncle.So many moments tug on the heartstrings, it's no wonder it's a festive favourite, but it deserves its place as one of the greats, not just a Christmas great.9/10."

icu_999,"Apr 20, 2006",6/10,"I think it's an average movie. It's got classical Hollywood propaganda- and politics. I think people tend to ignore the undertones of trying to get people to stay in the 'homeland' of America. There's also political messages about democracy and individualism, as well as small messages about family life and propaganda about the war. It's good in that it gets people to appreciate life, yet it seems to discourage people to aim higher. For some people having a wife and kids and friends is nice, but for some they have other goals. Seeing the world and achieving ones goals is important, we can't all accept second best. We have to be selfish in some ways if we are to get what we want. There needs to be a balance, but in this movie George lives more for others."

arthur_tafero,"Jan 23, 2023",7/10,"Frank Capra excelled at films where socialist values (not the political ones, but the social ones) were extolled by several characters within his films. It was a time when people cared about other people instead of just themselves and their own families. That, unfortunately, is a bygone era in the US. That US no longer exists; we are now all out just for ourselves and our families, and everyone else will just have to fend for themselves. Of course, there are exceptions, but for the most part, the mentality of these films are long extinct. The family and friends of Jimmy Stewart rallying around him in his time of need is just what this film is all about; a fantasy. In real life your FAMILY MIGHT rally around you, and that would be it; maybe even a friend or two. But an entire community? I don't think so. Watch the film around Christmas; watching it at any other time will lessen its impact."
son_of_cheese_messiah,"Dec 25, 2013",2/10,"Watching this film in the wake of the banking crisis, it is apt to have a different effect on the viewer than that intended. The actions of George Bailey and his father amount to a long justification for ""sub-prime"" mortgages,""sub prime"" being a euphemism for ""lending to people who have no chance of paying you back"" which has lead to the present day bank bailouts which means that responsible people now must pay for the actions of the irresponsible. Why does doing this make George and his dad the good guys?Why, for that matter, are we told that George's father only made enough money to send one of his kids to college? Is that meant to be good? Surely, in the real world, that would make him a poor father? He has clearly never heard the truism ""charity begins at home"" although he did have enough money to hire a black servant..perhaps he should have saved the money he spent on her to put his kids through college? Just a thought.Obviously Hollywood will never get to grips with the real life implications of the Bailey's irresponsible lending policies, ie people being lumbered with unpayable mortgages and losing their homes. No, this is the land of magic pixie dust where good intentions always lead to good outcomes. The reality is transformed into a one dimensional baddie, an evil capitalist who could come straight out of the Stalinist propaganda of the period (in fact this film could have easily be shown in the USSR without a single cut whereas it was -rightly- a box office flop in the US). Oh, if only there weren't these greedy evil people, if only banks could lend money to good people without worrying whether they could pay it back, then how much nicer the world would be!Around this childish morality, a sanctimonious and saccharine story is built. Even by Hollywood's golden age standards it is extremely sentimental. I must say in passing, I've attempted to watch this film many times, but this this is the first time I've managed to make it all the way through and only through gritted teeth."

caudwellpj,"Feb 18, 2012",N/A,"Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed are terrific as the main leads in this Frank Capra movie. Set very close to his own working class roots ( supporting cast and characters bear this out) and some nasty people thrown in to boot, this film holds the viewer's attention without getting overly sentimental.. Ever said to yourself "" I wish I had never been born?"" This film will clearly answer that question.It just goes to show that movies do not have to have all the special effects bells and whistles, deafening sound track and Dolby digital to capture viewer interest. Movies like this were made in a time when violence was often only suggested, not played in grizzly detail. There are certainly some dark themes. However you can't help being uplifted by the ending.."

It's all in one small town, which feels like one stage. But that works beautifully and we enter into a parallel universe.The black and white allows us to kind of dream. We are transported. It's so lovely being in this little American community. Meeting the characters and slowly going on a journey with them. It reminds me of Back to the Future with its friendly narrative - like the film is taking you for nice ride and time stops for an hour or so.It has a real moral core, a touching core."

Theodorum,"Apr 15, 2018",6/10,"What do we have here? Could this be the most positive film ever conceived? Was this made for children or for the whole family? Was it crafted for suicidal maniacs maybe? No, no, it can't be that; too dark for children and too childish for adults. I don't like to use the word ""dated"", but this is what I would call a dated film with a dated (now cliched) message.
Well, it has an intensely naive positive message, but maybe necessary for that period. But why so much optimism? Could have been because of the post-war overoptimism? The Post-World War II economic boom? Could be.
The film is clearly flawed, objectively speaking. The main problem is the protagonist. With just a few occasionally bursts of anger towards the end, he has a flawless character. Altruistic, nice, tolerant, idealistic, etc etc. He is the perfect white boy. The antagonist is pretty much the antithesis of the main character. Stereotypical Walt Disney cartoons-like characters? Well, almost. Almost! Also, this is a fantasy film not because of the fantastic elements, but because characters act unnaturally during specific events. Some moments are too cartoon-ish and unrealistic. At least those moments are funny, so I can forgive this aspect (this is actually the case in many classic American movies).
Well, I appreciate the subtly dark undertones of the film and even the cartoon-ish humor.
I repeat, this film may be too dark for children, too light and naive for adults and too cliched for today; objectively, this is a dated film."

It might have been appropriate 65 years ago, but today? Storytelling in cinemas changed and that is not always a bad thing. The setup took to long and the struggle of the hero was not believable for me. The acting was good (more or less). The moral of the story was lame. ""Your life makes a difference!"" It is a calendar motto, the message of a cheap self-improvement book. Maybe I am not romantic enough to enjoy this movie. To me it was OK, but it was not a ""revelation"". Not a movie, that I want to watch ""over and over""."

jellopuke,"Dec 13, 2018",10/10,"I've watched this probably 6 times over the years and it's perfect at Christmas. Life affirming and relentlessly hopeful (and cynical) it portrays a world where people matter and life is worth living. Beautifully shot and acted, it's brilliantly written, even if the angel stuff can get a little clunky. Even after all this time, it still works and might even bring a tear to your eye. Watch it every year or so to feel replenished."
TrulyOnFilm,"Dec 19, 2025",10/10,"This was a first time watch for me and I honestly wasn't expecting it to hit as hard as it did. I'm always surprised when I finally watch something this old and it turns out to be such a powerful story. It shows the highs and lows of an entire life in a way that feels incredibly honest and human.The message really stuck with me. No matter how low things get, giving up is never the answer and even the smallest choices can have a huge impact on the people around you. It's such a simple idea, but it's handled so beautifully that it never feels cheesy or forced.The performances are exceptional, especially James Stewart, who brings so much warmth and vulnerability to the role. The whole movie feels cosy, comforting and emotional in the best way. The atmosphere, the pacing and the heart behind it all still work perfectly, even almost a hundred years later.It's genuinely incredible how well this movie has aged and how relevant its message still is. A beautiful story about love, life and the importance of just keeping going."
filipemanuelneto,"Jun 26, 2021",7/10,"This film is one of those that any movie lover sees at least once in their life, if only because it is so talked about and so respected among moviegoers. However, I got the feeling that the movie, despite being really good and entertaining, doesn't justify so much buzz. It's a good movie, and there's no doubt about it, but it's not exactly a work of art, as many good commentators have argued. In fact, from the filmography of those involved, it's a film that doesn't even stand out: James Stewart is much more interesting in Hitchcock's films, who knew how to get the best out of the actor, and even Frank Capra made films as or more remarkable than this one.The script is very simple: an angel is sent to help a man at the most difficult moment of his life, when everything indicates that he will be arrested after sacrificing his life and dreams to maintain the firm that his father left him, and that prevents an unscrupulous local millionaire from completely taking over the city and doing what he wants with the people who live there. We are, therefore, facing another Christmas movie, where faith and hope are the main focus. The script, well written and effective, is one of the film's strong points: in addition to bringing us a good story that appeals to the whole family, it is based largely on a main character so pleasant that it is impossible not to like her and just watch. The movie just to see how she will overcome the challenges that lie ahead.The cast is headed by James Stewart, one of the great actors of this time, in another excellent work. At his side, however, are other excellent actors such as Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore or even Henry Travers. The cast's overall performance is good, but that's not what makes us want to see this movie. Deftly directed by Frank Capra, the film has a leisurely pace but doesn't waste a lot of time in exaggerated consideration, doing its best to keep the story going.Technically, it's a regular film that makes the most of the resources available at its time, without overshadowing the story it wants to tell, nor going to the director's head, determined to keep the film in a direct and relatively frank record. The black-and-white cinematography is very good and pleasant, and everything was excellently shot, with sharpness and clarity. The editing work was also well done, and the cuts are barely noticeable. The sets and costumes are well done, the dialogues were very well written and there are many memorable moments."
ags123,"Dec 17, 2017",5/10,"Sorry, this film just doesn't move me (and I cry a lot at movies). I find it long-winded, heavy-handed and rather preachy. It takes an awfully long time and a sledgehammer to get its message across. And I have little patience with the old conceit of an angel coming down from heaven to show us the way (""Here Comes Mr. Jordan,"" ""Heaven Can Wait,"" ""Stairway To Heaven,"" ""The Bishop's Wife,"" ""Forever, Darling,"" the list goes on). For a more touching look at the meaning of Christmas, and certainly a more concise one, see Twentieth Century Fox's 1952 anthology film, ""O'Henry's Full House."" Henry King's episode, ""The Gift of the Magi,"" has Jeanne Crain and Farley Granger portraying newlyweds whose well-intentioned sacrifices backfire, but teach them (and us) an important lesson."
dm-62539,"Dec 30, 2020",10/10,"Never gets old and is forever young like the Wizard of OZ. Saw it first in the 1970's. Decided not to watch it since the turn of this century, but recorded it and re watched it at the end of 2020. George Bailey is still relevant in our time.
Pottervilles run by corrupt megalomaniacs still exist. that includes Bloombergsville where I have lived all my life. Bailey stands up for the common man, oppressed by the Potters of this world.
The acting is top notch and this story has stood the test of time."
ethanbresnett,"Dec 22, 2024",9/10,"At the ripe old age of 29 I was yet to watch It's a Wonderful Life. I'd obviously heard about it and knew it was considered a classic, so when it appeared at my local cinema this Christmas time it seemed like the perfect opportunity to tick it off my list. Now, having watched it, it is easy to see why it is considered a classic.It seems silly to say but it really is just a wonderful story, following building and loan manager George Bailey as he grapples with what he has achieved and missed out on in life. It is jam packed full of sweet, heartwarming moments as we follow him from his youth to a fateful Christmas Eve night.The performance by Jimmy Stewart in the lead role is marvellous and the entire cast are brilliant throughout.There isn't much more to say really! A lovely film that is very heartwarming, entertaining and funny."
Innsmouth_Apprentice,"Oct 16, 2014",9/10,"It's a Wonderful Life is an epic story of the life of a man named George Bailey. George spends this life living in a small town, with his nose deep in the lives and problems of its other citizens. He dreams of seeing the world, of conquering it, but somehow always postpones that in order to battle his arch-nemesis - the ruthless local businessman Mr. Potter. Potter perpetually has his sights set on utterly dominating the town's cash flows and, effectively, its life. The idealistic and charitable Bailey family, especially George, are the one thing that persistently prevents Potter from succeeding.However, George has his share of troubles, and they eventually begin to take their toll on his good nature and optimistic outlook. It's now up to his guardian angel, Clarence Goodbody, to open George's eyes to how wonderful his life really is.IAWL promotes friendship, empathy, optimism, and love of life. You can't but admire the excellent way in which it does this. The story, the sets, the actors, the dialogue, the music are all top-notch. Highly recommended!9/10."
tex-08654,"Dec 15, 2019",10/10,"( This is my 1st review)! It's A Wonderful Life is my favorite movie! Jimmy Stewart is my 2nd favorite actor (Spencer Tracey). I have seen it 50+ times & never get tired of it. During the year if I feel a little down I will pop in the DVD, (B&W only), watch a few scenes or the whole movie & I will feel much better!
The acting, directing, script & cinematography are spot on! It deserved to win many Academy Awards but had the misfortune of being up against The Best Years of Our Lives, also a very good movie. I recommend anyone not having seen it to give it a look see 👀!"

churchtwatters,"Dec 9, 2022",7/10,"It's a wonderful life is a classic. Most of the reason people really enjoy this movie is because of the sentiment they have while watching it with family and friends. Although, while watching the movie, I wasn't constantly thinking about how old the movie was. The story and the acting was captivating enough to make me forget about the old style. I've seen some reviews about how the movie told a depressing message about why you shouldn't take risks in your life and just stay where you're needed. However, I think the movie just tries to tell a message that there is meaning in life even when things are looking down; a slight change of perspective can change your whole outlook on life. Overall, a lighthearted movie with a meaningful message.Also the wink at the end was foul ;D."
karenseeley-49456,"Nov 19, 2021",10/10,I watch this movie every year as I simply love it. It's a good movie for family and the younger generation. It's a tradition that we have done yearly for decades now.
Shilo_R_A,"Sep 19, 2023",6/10,"So I went into this film almost completely blind - I knew that James Stewart is there and that there's a famous scene regarding taking down the moon or something like that, and also that its main genre is romance. After watching it I realized just how much this film is referenced in Christmas-related media, and, well, that it's one of the most famous Christmas films ever, probably even at the top of that list.It's a Wonderful Life is a 1946 Christmas film that follows George Bailey, a man loved by everyone in the town, in the most fateful Christmas eve of his life - George Bailey is considering taking his own life. Everyone's prayers make something move up there, in the heavens, and an angel named Clarence is sent to save the lad. Most of the movie we learn, alongside Clarence, how George has come to this harsh situation, and the big question is hovering in the air: will Clarence be able to save George?Honestly, there isn't a single aspect of this film that I see as truly phenomenal, or even above ""pretty good"". It has its enjoyable comedy-oriented scenes, its witty dialogue bits from time to time, and I'd even say that the film does a pretty good job showing us George's desperation, the way that his dreams escape him because he's too involved in helping the townsfolk. The main cast is also solid, but that's about it.The film's conclusion is supposed to be moving and endearing, but I couldn't help but find it cheesy and artificial. Not only that, but the whole final act of the scene, the part that's supposed to be the climax (and is also the most famous part of the movie) feels rather dull and cliché. Sorry, just couldn't get into it. Also, the relationship between George and Mary feels forced, too, when it comes to some pivotal moments in the film. They have their cute moments, but moments that are supposed to be cute or romantic in the late parts of the film just feel slightly off to me.This is a simple review for a simple movie. I get why the movie is being referenced so much, since it has some iconic moments, and the first half of the film is pretty fun indeed, but I just couldn't get emotionally involved when it came to the emotional core of this movie. I guess it was worth watching anyway, if only for the pop-culture value, but this one's truly overrated in my opinion. Feeling a 6.3/10 on this one.P.s
I watched the colorized version, couldn't find the black-and-white one in good quality."
HotToastyRag,"Dec 9, 2021",10/10,"The wonderful (pun intended) thing about this Christmas classic is that you can appreciate and fall in love with it all over again as you age and reach different stages of your life. When you're a kid, you enjoy the fairy-tale elements of the story, and you laugh at Clarence the Angel's lines. As a teenager and young adult, you identify with George Bailey's famous speech: ""I know what I'm going to do today, and tomorrow, and the next day after that."" He has so much hope, idealism, and the time to spend on righteousness. But the older and older you get, you see the tragedy in George's journey. You feel sorry that he never achieves what he wants and that he spends his life taking care of other people and holding down the fort for the reserves that never arrive. That's why, no matter how old you are, you always cry at the end of It's a Wonderful Life, and that's a wonderful thing.The sentiment of this story is truly timeless. There are no cell phones, people use trains as transportation, and the Great Depression is only mentioned in history books - but every part of it is still incredibly relatable to modern audiences. Youthful crushes, idealism before you gain experience, defending your family without understanding the consequences, and seeing ""the bad guy"" without any backstory to his life. No matter what generation you belong to, you live through all these phases when you're young. Bravery, loyalty, regret, frustration, and gratitude don't expire on a certain year. So even though the movie is in black-and-white, the appeal of wiping the slate clean on your life still hits home.Sentimentality aside, it's still a great movie. James Stewart gives the performance of his career as George Bailey. You believe him every single step of the way, and you feel that you've actually gotten to know him, rather than the character. When the camera films his vulnerable prayer scene in Martini's Bar, you're almost embarrassed to be watching such a private moment. Thomas Mitchell also gives a career-best performance as the stereotypical drunk family uncle. Despite his enormous flaws, he really does mean well. Beulah Bondi, as the long-suffering mother, Henry Travers, as the affable guardian angel, and H. B. Warner, against type as the emotional drug store owner, provide a steady supporting cast to the film. You've seen all these actors in dozens of movies before, helping to set the stage of a small town where everyone knows everyone. Ward Bond and Frank Faylen, playing Bert and Ernie, are also familiar faces. Even the smallest impact is still an impact, like the friendly local cop or the one taxi driver in town.Lionel Barrymore is a hilarious villain, and unrecognizable in his disguise. He rattles off his venomous lines with such wisdom, and even though he's supposed to be the bad guy, you know that a lot of what he says is true. In a rare occurrence, you'll be able to hear Gloria Grahame before she stuck the cotton in her mouth. This was only her third movie, and her adorable turn as Violet makes you wish she never got self-conscious about her lips. Finally, there's Donna Reed, the epitome of the American housewife. If James Stewart is the perfect everyman, Donna Reed is the perfect everywoman. It's no wonder she became the iconic television mother after being the backbone of the Bailey family in It's a Wonderful Life. She sacrifices, steps up to the plate, and gives generously, all with a smile on her face. Plus she's really pretty, and she keeps her figure after four children!I know you've seen this movie before. You've probably seen it a dozen times by now. But if you're thinking of skipping it this year, don't. Don't you want to see ZuZu's petals one more time? Hear, ""I wish for a million dollars - hot dog!"" Feel the cold, oppressive rain during the run on the bank? Don't you want to get a new lease on life just as the calendar year comes to a close? Of course you do, and millions of Americans will experience all those wonderful little moments with you this Christmas."
marqitawolber,"Nov 13, 2021",9/10,This to me is one of those nostalgic films. I would watch this every year growing up during Christmas time. This film always makes me cry and I feel like is a beautiful reminder to us of what should be important.
lawrencej-2611,"Dec 24, 2020",9/10,The truth is we all live in Pottersville and men like George Bailey often end up at the bottom of rivers with no Clarence to save them.
Michael_Elliott,"Dec 29, 2008",N/A,"It's a Wonderful Life (1946)**** (out of 4)This timeless classic has James Stewart playing George Bailey, a frustrated businessman who gets the chance to see what the world would have been like had he never been born. I've lost count of how many times I've watched this film over the years but it keeps getting better with each new viewing and I can't help but notice new things each time I watch it. There's really nothing I could add that hasn't already been said about this movie but it's certainly one of my all time favorites and I'd argue that it's one of the greatest ever made. This movie has been called timeless by many people but I really can't think of too many movies where this is more true. I can't possibly see how this movie would ever grow old fashioned or out of touch because there's always going to be people who feel like the main character here. The most amazing thing to me is that the film perfectly captures how someone might begin to feel that they're worthless and I can't help but think that anyone who watches this movie will have a better look on life or themselves after watching it. I really can't think of too many movies that contain as much power as this one but I'd say that's why new fans are gained each and every passing year. The greatness of the film is certainly its heart but Stewart also deserves a lot of credit for his marvelous performance, which is certainly one of the best of his career. There are countless scenes in this movie where Stewart just nails it and I'm sure everyone knows the praying in the bar scene but there are many other great ones as well. On this viewing the scene on the bridge when Stewart begs for his life back hit me unlike any other time. There's also the scene in the bank where George has to bargain with the people not to take all of their money. Lionel Barrymore was always great playing bad guys and I can't help but think he's one of the greatest villains in movie history. The evilness that Barrymore is able to get through this character makes it among the actors best work. Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell and Harry Travers also add great support. Every inch of this movie works flawlessly and that includes the sequences where George gets to see things as if he were never born. I think these moments contain Capra's greatest work as a director as the darkness and atmosphere he creates is so think and depression that it perfectly puts you in the mind frame of George. Then you've got that priceless ending, which ranks right up there with City Lights and Psycho as being the greatest for any movie."
Prismark10,"May 27, 2014",7/10,"In It's a Wonderful Life, George Bailey (James Stewart) is man who wants out from his small town life but something always keeps him from breaking out and fulfilling his dreams. Instead he ends up working in the family loan company, helping other people out. He has a wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four children in an old house which they make their home.On Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Bill loses $8000 while he is attempting to deposit the money in the bank but loses track when he brags to the town bigwig Mr Potter. The Bailey family nemesis, Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore) finds the cash but keeps it to himself. George realises when the bank auditor finds out that the accounts do not match he might lose everything and go to jail. George decides to kill himself However an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent to save him and to show him how valuable his life is to the people around him by taking him to the time as if he was never born where he sees an alternate timeline. George discovers that he has made a positive contribution to many peoples lives.The story has been told many times since then in television, books and films. Even the last episode of Classic Dallas was a variant of this movie based on the Ewings if JR was not around!The film is regarded as an all time classic and it does have merits for being novel such as the beginning of the picture with a supreme being calling for an angel and the angel being one who has yet to gain his wings that is another story done many time since.The film is charming, winsome but also a shade too long. The alternate timeline where the town becomes a cesspit looks improbable with Mary being a spinster librarian, a friend of George (Violet) becoming a good time girl and other townsfolk becoming nasty and rather brutish.Also Mr Potter never seems to get his comeuppance, even during the days of the code Mr Potter still managed to find a way round things!"

It's now not just one of my favourite Christmas films but one of my favourite films of all time.It has everything. It has a strong story (inspired by a Christmas card no less), heart and mixes comedy and drama effortlessly. It's also a beautiful love story between Mary and George as well as showing us the importance of friendship and loyalty.I can't fault this film - wonderful."
thefan-2,"May 19, 1999",5/10,"...but not a great movie, and certainly not one of the greatest of all time.  I realize you can't say that without being accused of kicking kittens and other atrocities, but that's the way I feel.  Sorry.I mean, really: ""Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings""??  Puh-leez.  If a Robin WIlliams movie were made today with such a line -- not to mention the cartoonish characters, the sappy plot, the false sentimentality -- it would be laughed out of the theaters.  Are we supposed to make allowances because this movie was made back in 1946 when they didn't know any better?  Believe me, they knew better.The only reason to go out of your way to see this movie is that Drew Barrymore's great-uncle Lionel is in it.  You should always show respect for Drew Barrymore."
sinankose84,"Jan 15, 2021",10/10,"I was not accustomed to such stories before watching this movie. Let's to be honest, any kind of directors or moviemakers may have serious worries before shooting it. The story is absolutely unusual and fantastic and if you are not able to handle the scenario very well, the result possibly would bring you the scandal about profit. The success definitely belongs to Frank Capra and the star of the movie, James Stewart.When the movie has released 1946, it is amortized to his budget due to the indifference of the audience. I think the reason was the low popularity of those kind of movies during their period. During 1940s', people were mostly preparing love stories which focused on a couple's relation with simple details. Additionally, it was moved up by the following of the second war. In that period, the war had brought a lot negative emotions and the audience was willing to see the reflection of their daily lives. But, today, everybody knows that this movie categorizes as one of the best in the movie industry."

richard-tunnah,"Dec 23, 2005",10/10,"The first time I am aware of seeing IAWL I managed to catch the last 5 Min's of the movie. It seemed to feature a character running around shouting 'Merry Christmas' at everybody, followed by a party where everyone handed over money To be frank, I wasn't in a hurry to see the rest of the movie.Then several years later, I started to watch IAWL from the beginning, unaware that it was the same movie. I was struck by how comprehensive the character study of George Bailey was. He was a good man, but his ambitions were frustrated at every turn. He wanted an Education, that was just outside his grasp. He wanted to travel, life conspired against him. At every step of the way, one person saw George 'rolling with the blows', that was Mary Hatch. This woman loved George and wanted to stand at his side, so they can face the slings and arrows of misfortune together. This is love of the purest kind.But even Mary's love cannot prevent George contemplating suicide. A single bad day that sees George on the top of the World at the beginning and thinking that taking his own life is the only way out by 10.45 pm.I was stunned when the ending turned into the movie I had seen some time before. But this time I understood, this wasn't just sentiment for it's own sake. To understand the ending you need to have gone on the same dark journey that George Bailey had been on.Many others have commented on the feel good aspects of the movie, so I won't. What I would like to say is that there are a number of scenes which live in the memory long after the end credits.Young George trying to persuade Mr Gower that he had prescribed poison (with young Mary Hatch Looking on).George hurrying home when he heard his father had had a stroke (with Mary Hatch looking on).George waiting at the station with Uncle Billy for Harry to come back from college (only to find Harry is already married and has a job that will keep him away from Bedford Falls).That kiss (I have to check that I am earthed, there is so much electricity in the air).Mary giving up their honeymoon money, to keep the Building and Loan out of Potters grasp.The Bridal Suit (with Ernie & Bert).Trying to talk to Mary in the alternate reality, but managing frighten her.The Ending.I don't think I have seen a better character study, or for that matter a better movie."
Christmas-Reviewer,"Dec 17, 2016",8/10,"BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST ABOUT THESE FILMS""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of the most beloved pictures of all time. The film core idea however has been stolen several times in less worthwhile television films. In fact the film was remade in 1977 for television with Marlo Thomas. That film however not only not have Jimmy Stewart it also lacked the Capra touch.However this is the classic movie that everyone loves and for a good reason ""It's the best film ever to capture the Christmas Spirit"".In this film George Bailey is at the end of his rope is contemplating suicide. The man is played by Mr Stewart. After a life of dreaming of leaving Bedford Falls and never able to do so. He wants to see the world and be an explorer. After a rough day at work he finds himself about to jump of a bridge but at the last moment an angel does a few tricks that prevents George from suicide.When Angel tells George ""that he is there to rescue him"" George laughs. Finally the angel shows George what his presence has meant to not only his family but to the people of Bedford Falls.This film has does not have one false moment. The casting is perfect. The story moves along at a brisk pace. The child actors are just as good as the adults.If you buy the DVD or Blu-Ray Set the colorized version should be avoided. This film plays better in black and white!"
allysonoplinger,"Dec 22, 2022",10/10,"In my humble opinion, Jimmy Stewart gives the single greatest acting performance ever put on film. The scene that really gets to me is after Uncle Billy has lost the money and Jimmy rages at his family at home. It's so real that it's uncomfortable to watch. That's true acting. The whole sequence right after that where he is praying to God for help just chokes me up every time.I dare you to name a modern day actor who could do it so well.And wasn't Donna Reed the perfect wife? Their honeymoon in the broken down house is so adorable and romantic! Who wouldn't want to come home to her?A must watch every year. Saw it in the theater yesterday- not a dry eye in the house.Thank you, Mr. CAPRA."
s-tb,"Nov 15, 2011",N/A,"I have seen some very good films in my life, of that there is no doubt. This one though, Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" I remember the first time I watched it, it was the holiday season I think my sophomore year of High School. Being a high schooler I tried extremely hard not t let my tears show, but it was no use, and I could see similar failures around the classroom. I haven't seen a movie that could reach such an emotional level with me since, probably the only one that ever came close was Lion King, when I was 5. This movie will always be on my top 5 list, and so far no contender has got even close to removing it from the #1, and 64 years after this movie has been made there still isn't, that is really saying something."
steveheroan,"Dec 24, 2023",6/10,"I guess I'm just a simpleton who ""can't appreciate"" older films and the acting and technical achievements ""in context"". These actors are absolute caricatures of themselves IMO, and I find Jimmy Stewart insufferable in general. This movie is overlong, overrated, overacted, and overhyped. This is NOT cynicism regarding the message, I actually love the sentiment of the film despite its religious propaganda overtones. I just find the movie saccharine beyond belief and cringy at every ""hee-haw"" turn, and Donna Reed is about the only actor I don't want to spontaneously combust. My rating would be a 2 if the movie weren't trying (pathetically) to inspire people to be more generous, and appreciate what they have in life. For the same message, I'd rather watch Mr. Destiny, at least it has Michael Caine. Yeah, I said that."
d-knowland1969,"Dec 19, 2018",10/10,If this is simply one of the best films ever made. It's the story that does it
strong-122-478885,"Dec 1, 2016",5/10,"Believe me - This decidedly heavy-handed, Christianity-driven, tear-jerker (from 1947) is so loaded down with underlying religious propaganda that (depending on which side of the bible your ""daily bread"" is buttered on) it's either gonna warm your heart, or else it's sure to freeze it.This film's story-line also preached (and I quote) ""No man is a failure who has friends"" - (Yeah? - Isn't that nice to know?) - But, with that in mind - (I ask you) - What about all of those out there who have no friends? Does that render them as failures?Anyway - From my critically observant point of view - ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was so incredibly over-sentimental and highly manipulative (as it zeroed in on the idealism of small-town, American life in the late-1940s) that its storytelling repeatedly veered right off the radar into the stratosphere of pure surrealism.And, with that - This film ended up coming across like an extended (and rather creepy) 2-hour-10-minute episode of The Twilight Zone. This was especially so during the film's ""Pottersville"" sequence - As well as in its final climatic moments of total jubilation."
Hitchcoc,"Oct 4, 2001",10/10,"Once again, my two cents' worth of a film that is the darling of so many people, myself included.  It has its uplifting conclusion, and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things.  George Bailey is in trouble.  He has decided to end it all.  The thought of jail and disgrace is more than he can handle.  George's life has been a continual parade of missed opportunities.  There is a layer of pain just above the surface of nearly every scene.  George is a victim and this series of disappointments takes its toll.  He eventually becomes hardened and frustrated, but because he is honorable, he goes about the business of living.  He has gifts he doesn't realize.  He has family.  He has status, and while not often appreciated, he is.  Unfortunately, we don't always share our love and admiration with those who deserve it.  His sense of adventure from birth has been clutched from him over and over.  His bad ear makes the army an impossibility, his father's death forces him to run a business he wants to run away from, and even his honeymoon money is used to prevent a run on the bank.  George never knows his importance until Henry Travers' well meaning angel comes along.I love this movie, but I also take it seriously.  It can be painful to watch sometimes.  The best scenes are the ones where George never existed.  His despair is evident and the tension builds higher and higher.  When he comes back, such a weight that is lifted. Jimmy Stewart is at the top of his acting form; I loved him as a living human being and as an actor; he portrays the kindness I believe the world should have.And then there is Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, and all the others.  They are superb.  It's a question all of us have wrestled with: ""What if we had never existed?""  There is no peer in Capra's canon.  I truly believe that this is a necessary part of our heritage.  We need to see things as they should be.  I love Christmas because it at least portends to be the time we all look at our gifts.  This movie is a gift to the world and one we can learn from over and over, even if the events never took place."
pmtelefon,"Dec 23, 2018",10/10,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of the Top Ten movies of all time. It's almost a perfect movie. I can't think right now of a reason why it's not a perfect movie. There must by a flaw in there somewhere but right now I can't think of one. It truly is a movie that gets better every time I watch it. I find new things to focus on each time I see it. Sometimes it's the dialogue. Sometimes it's religiousness. Tonight I focused on Jimmy Stewart. Wow, he gives a performance of a lifetime. As I watched him tonight, I wondered about Stewart losing the Best Actor Academy Award. Who beat him out? Fredric March in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"". March was great but I'd give the edge to Stewart. He's in almost every scene. It doesn't matter which way I approach watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"". It's one of the greatest movies ever made."
SnoopyStyle,"Dec 21, 2013",9/10,"George Bailey (James Stewart) is at the edge of financial ruin. He thinks his life has amounted to nothing and is about to jump off a bridge. An angel named Clarence is assigned to give George a second chance by showing him what if he was never born.This is an unabashed sentimental tear jerker. The movie starts with George's life as it is. His dream is to travel the world, and create great monuments. He is constantly dragged back to the unimpressive little Bedford Falls and the family Savings and Loans. He is a good guy who constantly does the right thing.This is classic Frank Capra. The nice guy struggles but always win in the end. This sentimental melodrama is especially fitting for the Christmas period, and derives its iconic status from the constant showing during those times. The failure in its original run is a long forgotten memory."

Smells_Like_Cheese,"Dec 20, 2005",10/10,"I know this is going to sound ridicules, but seriously, I have not seen this movie since I was a child. Even though they play it every year for Christmas, I never really had an interest to see it again. I was complaining to my mom the other day how sad it is that people just look at Christmas as present time and just getting what you want, I almost cried over it because I miss how my family would get me presents, but we'd go the homeless shelter to help out people who couldn't have a better one than us, I always thanked my parents for those wonderful experiences. It taught me that there is always worse and we must help those not just on Christmas, but all year around. Well, we did it again this year, but I'm now in the retail business and when I complained about this to my mom, she lent me the movie and said to watch it.Watching this movie truly touched my heart and brought me back to the true meaning of Christmas. I mean, your heart just goes out to George and his wonderful little town of Bedford Falls. He and his wonderful wife Mary together do whatever they can to make it in life and support their 4 darling children. But when a horrible mishap goes on at the bank that George works at, loosing $8,000, he starts to wonder if his life is worth living. But there is one angel who will not give up on him and shows him what life would be like if George had never been born. In Bedford Falls without George, turned into Pottersville because of the very greedy business man Mr. Potter, no one is happy and Mary is all alone. George realizes that maybe life is worth living and comes home to this loving town that is willing to do anything to help him and his family out.""What goes around, comes around"", I couldn't stop tearing at the end because it's just so loving. I hope future Christmas's will go back like this movie's examples, where people are just happy to have what they have and realize some are not so lucky, but we must all do our part. Cheesy, I know, but if one person can raise their hand, we all will do our parts in the end. Merry Christmas, everyone! :)10/10"

It affected my feelings of joy, crying, and laughter. A wonderful story. Remember, my dear, that failure does not know who has friends, and you have a family and children, that is very enough and friends and be satisfied with what God gave you, just do good, and you will find its effect.

amikhalyuk,"Jul 28, 2011",N/A,"In a movie It's a Wonderful Life, George Bailey (James Stewart) goes through out his life trying to help people in his home town living with his wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four children in an old house. Even though he understood that his father's business does not bring much income, people were his main focus. He lived with a dream that one day he will travel across the globe and will come back to build new buildings. Despite of his dream, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) prevents him from leaving his home town and is forced to take over his father's loan company. On the Christmas Eve, George's uncle Bill (Thomas Mitchell) loses $8,000 while he is attempting to deposit them into the bank account. Mr. Potter is the one who discovers the money but hides them from Mr. Bailey. As George realizes that after bank examiner finds out about missing money, he might go to jail and will loose his company, therefore he decides to ask Mr. Potter for help and give up his company. As he thought about his family, he was told that he is worth more dead when he is alive, and decided to commit suicide. Because of his family prayers, an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) was sent to save him and to show him how valuable his life is to the people he cares about by taking him to the time as if he was never born. I loved this movie because of its positive attitude. Some of the main characters are just perfect for their character in the movie. Even though James Stewart won an Oscar for his George Bailey character, my favorite character is the Mr. Potter. His bold head and cricket eyes are perfectly underline his grouchy character. Bailey's wife Mary is a perfect character as well. Her facial expressions are very clearly expressing her feelings. Her face did show an expression that she is deeply in love with George. Also you can see when she figured that George is in money trouble."
PaulusLoZebra,"Jan 12, 2023",10/10,"It's a Wonderful Life is a film about pure Goodness. In our world we need to watch a film like this from time to time, to remind us that we have agency and that it matters what we and each individual does every day. Even if we think that do-gooders can cause problems, that what they do is not perfectly good, we need to see this film, because it reminds us to think about values. Frank Capra believed in social responsibility, in the community, in ordinary people helping each other. Jimmy Stewart's performance is justifiably legendary, but I was drawn to Donna Reed, because she is the true moral compass of the film, even more than the angel Clarence ! Jimmy is torn and goes back and forth about what to do with his life, although he always makes the humane decision, never the selfish one. But Donna is quietly decisive, unerring, instinctive, intelligent and radiant - no angst."
mattatthemovies,"Dec 24, 2024",6/10,"The final 45 minutes is really the movie and for some reason it takes an hour and a half to get to that point. I went into this film with a general knowledge of what the plot would be, so I was shocked at just how long it took to get the ball rolling.The final act of the movie is quite good, which is why it's the only part that people talk about today. I just can't in good conscience give it a score any higher due to how slow the first half is. I get why people love this movie but it's just not for me.Synopsis:
George Bailey has so many problems he is thinking about ending it all - and it's Christmas! As the angels discuss George, we see his life in flashback. As George is about to jump from a bridge, he ends up rescuing his guardian angel, Clarence - who then shows George what his town would have looked like if it hadn't been for all his good deeds over the years."
manuel-pestalozzi,"Mar 29, 2006",3/10,"So, if Jimmy Stuart had really lived I wouldn't sip a Martini now - but I would know and maybe even befriend a valuable citizen called MISTER Martini who lives because Lionel Barrymore died at the right moment? Or is it the other way round? I liked to speculate along those lines, when I was a child.Watching It's a Wonderful Life made me quite mad. The message is pretty cruel. It goes like: you are needed here and don't you dare planning to go on a world trip or anything like that. It's for other folks only. This strongly smells of Calvin's doctrine of predestination which, some say, is one of the foundations of the spirit of the USA. The main character is practically denied a free will, due to the circumstances a non too benevolent god arranged for him. I must admit, Stewart's hysterical shrieks on the bridge, as it dawns on him how valuable he is for the community, sounded to me like the first signs of full fledged madness.Ironically, the Potterville Stewart's character prevents through his sacrifice seems to be a much more thrilling place than the Bedford Falls he preserves, at least to a modern day audience. I am not against modesty, a good community spirit and loyalty, but inertia and values that are declared absolute and unchangeable will not help to solve the world's problems. I don't know how Frank Capra weathered the HUAC hearings, but the rigid categorizations of the citizenship this movie makes in order to propagate American values could well have pointed at him as a Commie sympathizer"".James Stewart's George Bailey is the exact opposite of Gary Cooper's Howard Roark in The Fountainhead, made three years after this movie. The both represent American extremes in movies that I find overbearing and simplistic."
itsTheRolyPoly,"Mar 12, 2018",10/10,NBC shows this movie every year and I can see why... its one the best classic movies that's out there.This is one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies and it can relate to my life in various ways I cried at the ending of the movie once he found his angel and the twinkle.

keitharilet,"Aug 17, 2019",10/10,"I have see this film about 40 times,
I absolutely love it.
The story has everything you could want in a film.
Watch it with your children at Christmas"
zkonedog,"Mar 6, 2017",10/10,"One of the hallmarks of a truly classic film is its ability to make the viewer contemplate the genre's existence before the experience. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a case study in this, as perhaps no movie in the history of cinema has concocted a better mixture of acting, emotion, seasonal--holiday--relevance, and a story that will reach into the very depths of your soul.For a basic plot summary, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" tells the story of George Bailey (James Stewart), a simple man from a simple town--Bedford Falls--who desperately wants to escape his father's ""Building & Loan"" business and travel the world. Every time he is about to take that ""next step"", however, George (through both external and internal devices) remains in Bedford Falls managing the family business. Along the way, he marries childhood sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed), morally clashes with iron-clad town business baron Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), and eventually ends up building a life in the very place he once so desperately wanted to escape from. On Christmas Eve, however, George is dealt a horrific blow and is on the verge of ending his own life until he discovers he has a guardian angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) looking out for him and showing him what a sad place a George Bailey-less world would be.The main reason this movie works so well is because we all have a little bit of George Bailey in us. That is why the poignant moments of this film capture our deepest emotions and promote serious life-reflection during the holiday season. Because we know how easily each one of us could be (or even are) living out the actions of Mr. Bailey on a daily basis. In this way, one could view the film as a character drama through and through.Yet, at the same time, there is more than a touch of fantasy here. The opening scenes feature angels conversing with each other, while the ending is an alt-universe trip that provides much of the emotional punch. Very much Twilight Zone-esque (and even 10+ years before that series). Far enough ahead of its time that the film was a middling success--if even that--at the box office in 1946. It truly took decades for the plot and themes to be re-examined through a more modern lens, if you will.That incredible plot is then bolstered by the perfect casting choice of ""everyman"" Jimmy Stewart to play the lead. Truly one of the greatest acting performances ever put to film both in scenes of jubilation or intense despair. The other cast members (especially Barrymore as the nefarious Potter) are brilliant as well, with each knowing just how to coax the right amount of emotion out of his/her role.In short, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is easily one of the greatest motion pictures ever constructed. I can--and do--watch it every holiday season without fail, and each viewing I pick up something I hadn't seen or considered (i.e. the sign of an extraordinary screenplay). It is completely genre-diverse, can be enjoyed by the entire family, and will thoroughly entertain you while also prompting some deep introspection. If it isn't my favorite single movie--and it might be--at the very least I can't imagine a world in which it doesn't exist (much like George Bailey himself)."
josiahhartjh,"Sep 2, 2021",10/10,"A classic story of a man who is torn between pursuing his childhood dreams or staying home and becoming the leader that his family and community needs.This movie is all about a young adult becoming a man. George Bailey must set aside his foolish hopes and dreams to answer to a higher calling to save his family business and his whole town from being taken over by the greedy Mr. Potter.This movie is not only very entertaining, but it is a challenge to every man to give up the temporary pleasures of adolescence in order to accept responsibility. Responsibility is what makes George Bailey a man and a local hero."
aviloks-37049,"Jan 8, 2021",10/10,"This goes right at the top! This movie will make you laugh, think, joy and cry.. so pure and touching! Emotional roller coaster ride.. god bless the movie team.. its 2 am, just finished it and i'm sure i'll wake up with thoughts of George Baily.. loved it!"
moonspinner55,"Mar 29, 2006",7/10,"Heartwarming Frank Capra film which has become (quite unintentionally, I presume) a Christmas perennial. Set in small town America, James Stewart stars as a discouraged and suicidal banker who learns a lesson about life from an angel anxious to get his wings. Fantasy with a holiday theme took many years to garner its classic status, yet it's a shrewd mixture of comedic, dramatic, and emotional elements. Capra's direction is quite sensitive, creating an evocative overview of middle America and the struggling working class. Stewart gives his usual sterling performance, and Donna Reed is a good romantic screen match for him; Henry Travers is the perfect twinkle-eyed old angel. Capra also co-adapted the screenplay based on the short story ""The Greatest Gift"" (which seems to have a touch of Dickens as well). Later remade as the 1977 TV movie ""It Happened One Christmas"", which featured Marlo Thomas in the lead. *** from ****"
tommy-97761,"Dec 7, 2022",4/10,"How is this a Christmas story? Perhaps it is my different cultural background or the fact that we were fed other movies for christmas over the limited broadcast of my youth. This movie is never shown in TV where I live so I had to go out of my way a bit to see it, but I just had to watch this timeless masterpiece as many call it.I don't get it.It is sooner a drama about recession and life in general(a pretty OK at that) that happens to feature Xmas and an angel, but I feel like it has very little to do with the actual plot. They could have used any other supernatural plot device instead of the Angel and the majority of the movie isn't even about that. Most of the movie is setup and rather depressing at that. The part of the movie which deals with the premise only comes around in the third act and is over rather quickly. In the end the bad guy even gets away with it.My theory for the cult of this movie is that for a time, this was the go-to movie to broadcast (for whatever reason). Thanks to nostalgia, people watch this movie with their own children and the circle repeats. You won't remember the movie for it's quality or plot, but the feeling you had while enjoying the holidays and that is fine I guess. Coming to a movie fresh with no nostalgia from an another background though? It did not resonate at all."

kids-2,"Feb 25, 1999",N/A,"I hate to be the lone dissenter here, but I think It's a Wonderful Life stands right up there as one of the most overrated movies of all time.  Not that it is a particularly bad movie, but I cannot see how it rates on everyones top ten list. True, the story is interesting and a bit intriguing, and it has a couple of good scenes.  But you take out the scene where Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed are dancing and they fall in the pool, and you take away the last five minutes of the movie, then there is not much left.  And speaking of the last five minutes of the movie, that is the only reference in the whole movie to Christmas, yet this movie has been branded a Christmas movie.  To me, in terms of Christmas movies, it does not belong in the same category (or class) as Miracle on 34th Street, White Christmas, A Christmas Story, and yes, Even Home Alone, Parts I and II.  I will give it one thing, the ending to this movie is truly one of the best of any movie ever made. But to me, a movie has to have more than a good ending with a Christmas setting to be called either a classic movie or a Christmas movie. Oh well, the minority has spoken."
FlushingCaps,"Dec 22, 2020",10/10,"Saw this again last night. There are nearly 1,000 reviews of this on IMDB, so there's no need to fully go over the plot again here. My comments are directed at some of the other reviewers' comments, specifically the ones that seem to really, really miss the point of the film by totally misinterpreting what the film's message was.One reviewer from this year says it is ""possibly the most depressing movie ever made."" I dare say there are over 100,000,000 people who completely disagree with that notion.That review says that other people with serious financial problems will be troubled by the movie because they don't have a town full of people who will come to their rescue.He/she goes on to discuss the portrayal of the town if George had never been born, saying Capra considered bars and nightclubs to ""be the worst thing that could happen"" to a town, lamenting that in 2020 we'd ""all be lucky to have them going again NOW."" This person points out that ""we can't all have these incredible effects on others' lives like George did; so this makes the viewer...feel like HELL.""That reviewer finishes with the thought that the note Clarence wrote in the book he left with George, that ""No man is a failure who has friends"" is ""something to really kick you in the gut if you are down.""There were other reviews I read that made some of the same points, saying things about the film that simply are not accurate.On the finishing point, about nobody being a failure if they have friends. It is a mistake to assume this film is also saying the opposite is true-that anyone without friends is a failure. That sort of thinking would make one think that the man who wrote the book saying ""If you play golf, you are my friend"" is saying if you don't he doesn't want anything to do with you."" Not at all. The statement is simply saying that this alone makes you his friend, even if nothing else does. In our film, the point is that even if you feel you have failed to accomplish the goals you had (like George Bailey, who never got to build things or travel around the world), and even if you have fouled up things so that lots of people are mad at you (the school teacher's husband who punched him, and also George's wife), if you just have some (one) friends you are NOT a failure.I dare say this is a tremendously positive message (opposite of that reviewer's thoughts) that can inspire the people he's writing about, one having all sorts of troubles in the year of the China virus: Even if your personal world is full of money woes and family bickering, and you feel bothered that life hasn't turned out at all like you thought it would when you were a young adult with all sorts of plans and goals, if you have at least one friend, you haven't totally failed, you are a success in some manner.Some have actually criticized this film for its portrayal of the town had George never been born, saying what's wrong with nightclubs and saloons? Did they fail to observe that this town seemed to be loaded with nothing but such places? Do they not understand what characters said, about how without someone giving these people a loan so they could buy their own home, they'd be renting crummy houses and apartments from Potter, or people like him? You go to any town today that has neighborhoods with few businesses except bars and tell me if it's not obvious the neighborhoods around these areas are full of empty stores and abandoned homes and are definitely not areas where anyone wants to walk along the streets-day or night-because of a terribly high crime rate.Capra didn't suggest a saloon was a bad place-he had one-duhh!-featured in the good town, Bedford Falls, where tough guy Sheldon Leonard was a friendly bartender.The claim that the film is depressing because people know they have not had the tremendous influence on a whole town the way George did. He really did do important things for many, and others feel depressed because they haven't-that's what these critics are saying. I guess they think Capra cold have made an interesting movie if the best thing George ever did for someone was help them fix a flat tire or give them a dime when they couldn't quite pay for the groceries they wanted and he was right behind them in line.If anything, Capra was drawing his audience in to empathizing with George. George, like the typical viewer, felt like he hadn't done anything important in his life. He hadn't gotten to do the great things he dreamt of. He hadn't even become wealthy at all, earning barely $2000 a year in the mid-1940s. He was like these other people who feel they hadn't done much for others. He was shown how he had done far more for people than they realized, and the movie viewer may well think the same of him/her self after watching this film.That makes it the opposite of depressing, at least for most people. The idea is that all of us can be a good influence on others, even if not in such dramatic ways as literally saving lives. I think if you find this film's message depressing, you can easily find any film or TV show or novel to be depressing: ""I can't stand ""Seinfeld"" because those people find attractive new people to date almost every week and I haven't had a date with anyone in quite a few months,"" or ""I hate that King of Queens show because Doug seems to enjoy his boring package delivery job, while I absolutely hate the similar job I have!"" If you are not looking to be depressed by a movie, you will not feel that way watching Wonderful Life.A great part of what made this such a great film is the oft-criticized first half, where we saw all the events of significance in George's life. He led the other boys in saving his brother's life, then stopped the grieving druggist from accidentally killing a customer, then gave up his plans after his father died to save the family business, etc. It's not easy to portray someone as being a big influence when that someone has not risen to some manner of material success-e.g. a businessman who is fairly wealthy but gives lot of money to charity, or spends lots of time helping others in a charitable way. I thought the Building & Loan association was a great vehicle for this. Only a few employees, mostly family members, essentially portrayed as one where money comes in from customers and is used to help others get ahead. If Frank Capra had not taken the time he did to show us how much George had to keep changing his plans when tragedy struck or other things went awry, we wouldn't have had much reason to be concerned about his well being later on.Capra wanted everyone to feel as though their life had value, from whatever friends (including family) they had, and whatever other good deeds they accomplished in their lives. If you think some are depressed because they haven't saved lives or helped someone buy a home like George, then I guess those people would also be greatly saddened by the Miracle on 34th Street movie because they haven't had the good fortune to find someone to marry like Fred and Doris. Christmas Vacation would be a hugely disappointing movie to them because they don't have a joy of a big, loving family, or a job where a Christmas bonus brings enough money to put in a swimming pool and more. Heck, Home Alone could be an emotionally troubling movie for anyone who had a horrible vacation trip around Christmas, possibly made worse by discovering their homes had been ransacked while they were away.In other words, to people with serious depression, ANY movie can make them feel worse, either because their lives are not as good as the characters in a film, OR because seeing sad, unhappy people with serious problems reminds them of their own dismal lives. The criticism leveled at Wonderful Life could fit ANY movie, Christmas themed or not. If a film producer cannot make a movie about people who are troubled, or people who have good things happen, there isn't much left about which you can make a movie.I find this to be about the most uplifting movie of all time, one that points out many of the joys of life-intertwined with the saddest times of life, depicted realistically. George had a fabulous time with Mary at the high school graduation dance-and the pair were really enjoying their conversation on the walk home, when George was suddenly summoned with news about his father having a stroke. I know that almost any year of my life when I can think about something really good that happened, I can also remember something of significance not good happening too.If anyone reads my thoughts here, and reconsiders the movie and decides that it really is a good film after all...then I guess I have made a small, positive contribution today."
aruslanzhabbarovkrut,"Jan 19, 2022",6/10,"I don't want to offend anyone, and I certainly don't want to say that It's a Wonderful Life is a bad movie, although I think its significance is too exaggerated. And this is not surprising. As in the case of the 'Irony of Fate', these films are no longer perceived objectively. It's more of a tradition: on New Year's Eve we watch the adventures of Zhenya Lukashin, in the USA - George Bailey."
Qanqor,"Mar 10, 2006",1/10,"Count me among the proud minority who think this movie is drek.I love old movies. And I like Jimmy Stewart a whole lot. But this thing is just awful. And the fact that we are barraged incessantly with it, and that people rush to gush over it, just makes it all the more unbearable.My big problem with the whole thing is that I vociferously *reject* the movie's main premise, the moral premise that it is somehow good and right and wonderful to live only for others. George Bailey is a *doormat*; he never pursues the life he really wants, instead suppressing his desires in order to serve every other yahoo in town. He's a fool, and the only ending I would consider truly happy for him would be if he were to decide to close his pitiful, practically non-profit business, and go off and make something of his life. I'm sorry, but having a lot of people be grateful to you for being a willing doormat is just not making something of your life.I'm sorry, I just can't like a movie that takes altruism so far as to say that the only value of your life is how you helped others."
jamesjustice-92,"Apr 23, 2022",10/10,"I've got my own Christmas tradition: every year on December 25th I watch an amazing and very kind movie called ""It's a wonderful life"" which always makes me burst into tears - first, the tears of hopelessness and sadness and then the tears of joy and happiness. No other movie that I've ever watched was capable of that and that says something.Every once in a while every one of us was frustrated, angry, sad or sorry about this and that in our lives that we hadn't achieved, or hadn't done or hadn't gone out somewhere we wanted to. Every one of us had thought the same thought: are we worth the life we are living? Are we good enough? Would it matter if we were gone or hadn't been born at all? This movie is the answer to all of these questions. This movie is the medicine of all the inner illnesses and aches. It's a wonderful movie!People sometimes forget what a great gift life is. We shouldn't let it go to waste, live it in full, let all the joys and sorrows count, cherish every moment, every person who has come in and gone out of our lives - they're all gifts! Just let it be known and never forget it and even if you do - go watch ""It's a wonderful life"" where one of the greatest actors ever, Mr James Stewart, does the impossible and throws the lasso around the moon and pulls it down. Nothing is impossible if you're a good man in heart."

andrea-brianna91,"Oct 11, 2018",10/10,"I could never talk enough about how wonderful this movie really is. Jimmy Stewart is such a darling. I love everything about this movie. The acting, the town, the story, the ending... just goes on and on. It's a movie that makes you feel so much and ponder what your purpose is here and how you have changed history with your presence."
thealchemist-05132,"Dec 18, 2023",10/10,"Arguably the best movie ever made. Nothing else need be said (of course, I need to reach a certain word requirement to post my review). One of the ways you know a story is truly great is that other stories are born from it. It's a Wonderful Life is one of those. Yes, some stories are so original that they inspire a new form. Because of it's a Wonderful Life we have movies like Family Man with Nicholas Cage and Groundhog Day with Bill Murray. It's a Wonderful Life will continue to inspire retellings and the creation of similar stories for eternity, and that is a powerful thing. On a side note, I read a number of the negative reviews, at least as far as the ones I read are concerned, I found their rationale in leaving a negative review to be rather strange."
jr-59504,"Dec 25, 2020",10/10,This is one of those movies that should be watched at least once every Christmas season. Well cast and acted. Good cinematography for the time. A story of what is really important in life.Bring your family around the TV and watch this one together and enjoy this movie.
mermatt,"Aug 1, 1998",N/A,"Though this film is associated with Christmas because it has been shown at Christmas time, it is really a dark study of the insides of the human soul. George is driven to the point of wanting to die and wanting not even to exist.Frank Capra takes us through the life of a man so that we can see why someone would be willing to choose oblivion rather than existence. Then we see that, even though life may seem meaningless, we, like George, have choices and that these choices can make a great difference in the world even though we may not realize that fact. The film helps us to realize why we are alive. That is its real enduring appeal."
msmuffintop,"Dec 22, 2020",10/10,"This is my most favorite movie of all time, not just as a Christmas movie. Sure, it has its morality plot points - but if you watch it carefully it is also a primer on economics. Watch what happens to banks before the FDIC was invented, and consider how owning a house effects a family's wealth generationally. In this time period the Martini's would not have been considered white, so apparently George Bailey is building a subdivision that doesn't have deed restrictions! Imagine that. Meanwhile Old Man Potter wants to keep everyone living in his cheap substandard rentals so they won't get ""above themselves.""I love this movie in Black & White as originally filmed, but for those who can't bring themselves to watch a B&W movie, Ted Turner made a colorized version in the early 80s. Some of the beautiful shadows are lost, but Violet's hat gets a whole new look. I think everyone should watch this movie, at least once as kid to learn the real meaning of Christmas and at least once as an adult to unpack the economics lesson. For myself, I was lucky enough to see it once in a full size theater during a special. And in the 90s when it fell into the public domain it used to be run on TV every year so we could watch it as a holiday tradition. It never gets old to me."
kellisean-24239,"Mar 19, 2020",6/10,I've seen this movie every Christmas for years. Its pure Capra and Stewart sentiment. I like 'You Cant Take it With You' alot better. It has a pertinent message plus humor. There's just saccharin overdrive here to me.The only one who really brings some realism to IAWL is Lionel Barrymore 's excellent portrayal of Mr. Potter. Hey you may not like him but he is as real as it gets here! He steals every scene he is in and of course crucial to the film. You can't have a movie like this without a great villian. And he is about the best villian in Cinema history! And leave the ending alone! It doesn't need an alternate ending. I never watched that SNL skit and never will!Great over all cast here though and I can see the appeal. But its like 'Gone With the Wind'. I've seen it too many times.

jamalhossainramjan,"Jun 5, 2019",10/10,"It's Really a wonderful movie.So much inspiration,comedy,reality based movie.This is One of my favorite movie ever.I just loved it so much.This teach us that our life is not worthless.We really have a place in the socity and it connected with others life so never think you are worthless.Life gives all of us opportunity.You just have to use them properly💕"
tffiber,"Mar 18, 2019",9/10,"Never X-mas without it. Love Jimmy Stewart in any movie, however this movie has been in my heart for more years than I care to remember.I often dwell on my existence and whether or not my being here has made any impact. Sad to say but it has not. This movie touches on that point far more deeply than I care to go."
maccas-56367,"Dec 23, 2020",9/10,"One of the films that has been on my watchlist the longest. I finally understand why this is regularly listed as peoples' favourite film, and why it has become the ultimate Christmas staple.Jimmy Stewart was fantastic in this. I can't help but feel he brought some of his own wartime experiences into this role and the way he portrays George Bailey at his most vulnerable. The rest of the cast were fantastic too. Special mention to Donna Reed as the beautiful Mary, and Henry Travers as Clarence, who definitely had me laughing more than once.This didn't actually feel like a traditional Christmas film for most of it. In some ways, that just makes it even more universal and timeless in its appeal.The plot and originality have been reproduced in countless ways ever since. It's easy to see why. You can't help but think about your own life at times, and somehow come out the other side a little more grateful, a little more optimistic. Any film that can do that is worth its weight in gold.A well-deserved classic and one I'm grateful to have finally seen.Those final scenes. Damn. Is someone cutting onions in here?"
jbuck_919,"Jun 6, 2002",N/A,"No folks, I promise not to do the same thing to the Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind, but this has got to be the most overrated movie of all time.It took me a number of tries to watch it all the way through, because it is so incredibly boring.  All the scenarios are exaggerated without a hint of the whimsy or joy that should mark  a Christmas movie.  NOBODY in it is likeable, including the hapless and almost hopeless hero.  They even give Donna Reed an improbable scene in the alternate reality where she is a total... well, if I want this posted, I can't use the word.But the worst flaw?  THEY NEVER GET BACK THE MONEY THAT WAS STOLEN.  It is morally unacceptable that this guy doesn't get punished and the townspeople have to rush in with a bailout.I've heard this movie praised to the highest heavens as one of the ten best ever made for most of my life.  I'll give them credit for the body language between Donna Reed and James Stewart in the scene where he is on the phone, but not for much else."
stallion1945,"Dec 16, 2025",10/10,"Once upon a Time, in an America far,,far away, lived morality, love, and hope. Before the world changed from polar opposites there was a middle ground. It's a Wonderful Life takes place in there. It's a time and place we could never go back to what it happened. I was there and I miss it all so desperately.Jimmy Stewart is the ""every man"" trying to hold his life together. He gives the performance of a lifetime. As to Donna, Reed, Lionel Barrymore and the entire cast. His scene where he prays in Martin's Bar is a master class in human emotion and can easily be the greatest moment in film history."
undalol,"Dec 24, 2023",6/10,"My problem with this film is that it's 2 hr and 10 min length; I mean, I have no problem with other films that are this long, in fact, some of my favorite films are about 3 hr length, I just think this could have been resolved in a lot less time.My problem it's not for the film being of the 1940's; I completely understand how movies were made back then, so this is not a complaint about the acting or the effects at all, in fact, I think these two were done excellently.I just think the development of George's life could have been a little shorter, I mean, we know he's a good man and helps people, but what's the need to drag this out too much?I believe this is simply so that the ending has a greater impact, but unfortunately for me it has more weight that I liked the entire story than that I liked only the ending."
toddyehl,"Dec 21, 2019",10/10,Jimmy Stewart is so cool and Donna Reed is amazing. The telephone scene between George and Mary is pure passion. All the characters are perfect playing two roles. Frank Capra did an incredible job.
willow12,"Dec 20, 2018",10/10,I have just watched this movie in a special showing at the movies and it reminded me of how wonderful it is. I barely remembered what the movie was about and watching it again made me see that it is simply marvelous.
elvircorhodzic,"Jul 23, 2016",10/10,"IT's A WONDERFUL LIFE is definitely one of the most beloved and most watched films of all time. Simply enter human warmth and kindness in the festive atmosphere. Great script and a story that follows the life of one man, his family and his fellow citizens will not leave anyone indifferent. The magical atmosphere and timeless magic simply forces us to become part of the film. Given the time period and the retrospective of life, it is hard not to find yourself in one of the situations.Director Capra went on a series of films about the little people with real human virtues. Again, one protagonist dominant. In this case, dissatisfied with their lives. Capra wants to show something that is long lost. Family, friends and hard work are actually a wonderful life.James Stewart as George Bailey hit the famous director. Not only because of its irresistible charm and manners that had a chance to hone working with the most beautiful and famous women in Hollywood, but for the link in the mode of dealing in the character George Bailey and the actor. Furthermore, his character, although at first glance may be too mean, really has a great depth, and excellent Stewart interpretation gives it weight. Stewart's acting phenomenon I personally never liked her, but his fantastic performance I will never challenged.Donna Reed as Mary Hatch Bailey is quiet and modest woman who truly loves and appreciates his wife. The character is so simple and quiet to the stunning strength has exactly the moments when it is most needed. Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Henry F. Potter essentially it is a greedy materialist, passion for money in his being destroyed any shred of humanity, but he is not satisfied and with all his strength his personal dissatisfaction wants to convey the awareness of other people. I have to be skeptical and say that today these people are incredibly much.No man is an island unto themselves! Globally, the story in this film does not have a universal character. However, we can hardly resist the impression that we are all part of a whole, and unbreakable bond. I am not a supporter of the belief that there is ""someone up there"" who maintains the world's balance. Simply have eyes and see what happens. However, I think it's Capra lukewarm fiction and mild levity created because of those feelings.This movie is full of optimism, the story is touching. The man is an unusual way realized, despite all the problems, how is life actually delightful."
manendra-lodhi,"Aug 15, 2012",9/10,"The film has what I love most about films, ""Inspiration"". The story really is built up in such a way that you'll eventually get inspired by it. Acting by James Stewart is superb. The story is about a man who wanted to do a lot of things, but circumstances changed his fate. He never lost hope, but one day things get really out of controlled and he loses faith in everything. It is very interesting to see how the story reaches to its ending.PROS:One of the best acting performances I had seen recently. The whole film rests on its beautiful story. The film is a very fine example of what we expect from life and what we actually get. The life of our hero seems to be frustrating a lot of times but than in the end, you are finally going to get convinced that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.CONSI admit that the whole angel thing did not impress me much and I was hoping for more realistic kind of thing. Also the editing at some later part of the film looked bad. It was nominated for the best editing Oscars, but just my opinion. But when you have a very fine story, you have to overlook these small glitches.MESSAGE: ""It's a wonderful life.""VERDICT: ""A must watch for all."""
michadny,"Oct 20, 2015",6/10,"It's A Wonderful Life may have been one of the all time greats back in it's day, but now it just feels a little too dated to be considered fantastic. Whilst by no means is this film trash, it just feels a little too old for your attention not to wonder off into pointless thoughts. However, there are parts in this film that genuinely are fantastic, some of which are quite funny and others being heartfelt and sentimental.It's A Wonderful Life may have it's faults as viewed by a modern viewer, but you cannot deny that it is somewhat one of the greats. Even though this film may be considered boring in comparison to the twenty-first century cinema, It's A Wonderful Life still has it's place somewhere in history."
greggman,"Apr 25, 2021",7/10,"I'd argue the ending makes the movie. In other words, the ending is so heartwarming that anything that came before it is forgotten. I'm not saying it's bad movie but....George goes to a bar to drink is woes away? Since when? What evidence or foreshadowing do we have that a man like George would go to a bar and get drunk when faced with problems?George then contemplates suicide (not a spoiler since the movie starts with this info). What reason to we have to believe that George would even consider such a thing? Regardless of what he learns about others, he's got frikkin unicorn wife. You know, the lady that did so much for him on their wedding night. He's also got 4 amazing kids. He didn't need Clarence and it was unbelievable that he'd consider ending his life.George sees the world without him.... This didn't work for me at all as motivation for George to go back. First off the angel never told him he could choose to go back. Further, it's out of date. The new town with all the clubs looked way more interesting and fun to me than the old town with an ""emporium"". Maybe it wasn't the town he was used to but it wasn't objectively worse, just different. Of course I get the main point was all the people worse off without him but it just came off as contrived. I haven't yet read the book ""The Midnight Library"" but apparently it covers this idea with a lot more balance.The mean old Mr. Potter was a ridiculous caricature which made much of the movie feel like propaganda. It's all fine to to sing kumbaya with each other ... until someone takes advantage and doesn't hold up their end of the bargain. Then suddenly the entire thing goes belly up. In other words, there's a balance between greedy but pudent Mr. Potter and generous but irresponsible Mr. Bailey. Without that balance Mr. Potter will own the town but Mr. Bailey will also, of his own accord, go bankrupt by being more generous than his loan company can afford to be which in and of itself will ruin all the people who's money he's loaning out.Further, in today's lens, his ""I loaned him money because I knew him"" sounds at lot like banks only loaning to people that look similar to the banker. In other words, the ""I know this person so they're ok in my book"" (eg, the good ole boys network) was banned for good reason.You'll note, the movie got mixed reviews when it came out. It also lost money meaning people at the time didn't like it. Go read the reviews when it came out and you'll see similar issues as those mentioned above.In any case, the good scenes won out and I'm glad I watched the movie and teared up at the end. But, it's not a 10/10 because of how contrived it is, at least for me."
blanche-2,"Dec 25, 2009",10/10,"Frank Capra's sometimes dark post-war film, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was released in 1946. It was intended to be released in 1947, but when a Technicolor print of ""Sinbad"" couldn't be delivered on time, this film was put into release.For that reason, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - possibly the most wonderful film ever made - was overshadowed by ""The Best Years of Our Lives.""But you can't keep a great film down, and as the years have passed, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has found its place as an iconic film that means Christmas. It's survived the public domain (due to a clerical error, when the copyright was not renewed in 1974), where it was cut to ribbons and shown so often on television (and why not, networks could show it for nothing) that people were sick of it. Now that it has to be licensed again in order to be shown, the film is shown in its totality and not as often.This remarkable story of a man who sacrifices his dreams for the betterment of his community and the business his father built resonates today more than ever, when it often seems like no one cares about anything except what's in it for them.James Stewart is perfect as a caring man who swallows disappointment after disappointment and finally is ready to give up, until he is given the gift of seeing what would have happened had he never been born. No man, he learns, is poor who has friends.I can't think of a better message or anything more inspirational than can be found in this film. George Bailey is all of us, and his story is a reminder that we're all important and, no matter how tough it gets, we need to keep going. One of my favorite movies."
WandererQ,"Mar 27, 2021",10/10,"Although 74 years have passed since it was released, its core message continues to stay true until this very day: don't give up, ever, ""no man is a failure who has friends"". Every person is important, the influence one soul has on so many other lives is incontestable, yet many of us tend to forget that pretty quickly and give in to despair... I love how the script, the director captured this perfectly and more so, the characters fit like a glove on the actors. This movie is like a breathe of fresh air that doesn't cease to touch you in some way every time you watch it."
csm-78119,"Feb 3, 2019",10/10,My favourite film of all time. George Bailey reminds you of what's important and what isn't. A film that still plays in cinemas 70 years later and which has been applauded at the end a number of times when I've watched it. We would all be happier if there were more George Baileys around and less Mr Potters; fewer Pottersville's and more Bedford Falls.
huzi0,"Oct 9, 2024",10/10,"Had put it off for quite a long time but I'm truly happy that I got to experience this masterpiece for the first time. Why can't movies be like this anymore?I'm not kidding when I say that this movie should definitely be shown to people with severe depression, are suicidal, have given up on life etc. It would have more impact on them than all those useless pills.James Stewart obviously does an incredible job right from start when he is in the peak of youth upto the complete end when he's a family man along with Lionel Barrymore who plays a greedy businessman of the county.This movie does an exceptional job showcasing how our life affects others without us realising and it does so not in a complicated manner but in a simplistic manner with powerful themes.This movie is a must watch for every cinema lover."
Kirpianuscus,"Dec 2, 2015",N/A,"one of memorable movies for profound humanistic message. one of films with the gift to be experience more than memory. charming for its simplicity and for the comfortable , protective status. a Frank Capra who could be easy his the best. because entire soft atmosphere, the joy, the crisis, the values, the humor are exposed at the right moment, in the right place and measure. a film about a man and his family. his dreams, projects. and his future. nothing original. but new each occasion to view the movie. because it is a classic in a special sense. not for the taste of old moments but as a moral lesson, very useful, for the present. a film who seems be perfect for the Christmas. in fact, it remains the perfect choice for every day."
Philipp_Flersheim,"Dec 12, 2021",7/10,"I vaguely remember watching this once as a child but it left no lasting impression. Having just revisited it, I know the reason why. 'It's a Wonderful Life' is a good film that offers two hours of solid entertainment, but no more. It is well-acted, well-directed and has a nice Christmassy message that it drives home with absolute, unambiguous clarity. Does it deserve the hyperbole reflected in some of the reviews on this site? I don't think so. It is certainly NOT the greatest film ever made, and watching it is certainly no unrepeatable experience. Just look at the characters: They are static and (with the minor exception of Gloria Grahame as Violet) black and white: either entirely good (almost everyone) or entirely bad (Mr Potter). No one has nuances and no one changes. Parts of the film are kitschy, especially once the angel appears and shows George (James Stewart) how without him his small town has evolved into an early version of Hill Valley under the rule of Biff Tannen. And no matter how much I like James Stewart, he becomes slightly irritating when he is allowed to indulge in his mannerisms as unchecked as here. No wonder reviewers in 1946 were not enthusiastic. So why did the film become a Christmas classic in the US? According to what I read, that happened at least in part more or less by accident: Its copyright had expired and one channel took the chance to show it again and again. Still, for all that 'It's a Wonderful Life' must hit some kind of chord. Which chord is a mystery to me, but then I am not American. We have our own Christmas classics (for example 'Three Wishes for Cinderella', 1973), and I guess what we like about those would be just as mysterious to an American audience. In sum: 'It's a Wonderful Life' is nice enough but definitely overrated."
benchubb,"Dec 25, 2022",10/10,"Here I am, a 23 year old born in 1999, seeing this movie for the 5th time in my life. It truly is a timeless masterpiece and everyone should see it at least once in their life.One of the most feel-good stories ever to hit the big screen, with incredible character development and dialogue.George Bailey shows that even the little people can make a big difference in this world, and his life is full of meaning to everyone around him.Everybody should see this movie at least once in their life, and it should be a essential film to watch on the holidays. If you're nitpicky about watching a black and white film, watch it in colour instead."
didi-5,"May 1, 2004",5/10,"One of the all-time Christmas classics, this excellent piece of work from Frank Capra focuses on George Bailey (James Stewart, in one of his career-best roles) who is stopped from jumping into the river in despair by a friendly angel called Clarence (Henry Travers). We then see in flashback what has brought George to the brink of suicide and key events from his life - saving his brother from drowning when the ice breaks; alerting his chemist boss to a fatal mix of drugs; courting and marrying his childhood sweetheart (the winsome Donna Reed); and dealing with the film's token bad guy, Mr Potter (brilliantly played by the crusty Lionel Barrymore). Clarence then shows George what the sleepy town of Bedford Falls would have been like without him and proves that you're never alone if you have friends around you and if you make a difference.Interestingly, two direct influences from this film were on the poetry e-zine 'Zuzu's Petals' (George Bailey's little daughter, who leaves some flower petals in his jacket); and, so it is said, on the children's TV programme, Sesame Street (Bert and Ernie, the mad puppets, who are the names of the cop and the taxi driver in this).And let us not forget, when you hear a bell ring, it means an angel has got its wings!"
tanmay-2411,"Nov 3, 2019",10/10,It's a wonderful life. Well it truly is. I have never reviewed a movie before. Probably because I have never seen a movie like this. I have watched a lot of good movies but never bothered about reviewing any of those because none of them made me do that but this movie forced me to do that. This movie is flawless. The best movie I have ever seen.
Jozinek,"Dec 26, 2022",10/10,"This is a movie about George Bailey, a businessman who is on the verge of suicide due to being on the verge of bankruptcy, costing his livelihood as well as many others' quality of life. However, he is greeted by a kind angel who shows him what the world would be like had he not been born. A rather simple plot, yet a brilliant one.This movie perfectly conveys a message about self worth as well as selflessness, showing how much of an impact you can have on many people's lives if you're willing to help others and in turn, help improve their lives as well as how you should be grateful for the things that you have and not be foolish enough to throw them away (especially family and friends). The movie also does a great job balancing love, humour, tragedy, and joy. I should also mention that the acting is fantastic (I especially like Lionel Barrymore's performance as the grouchy, villainous Mr. Potter).Following George Bailey's story was truly enthralling and the film did an excellent job making him a sympathetic and likeable character. A man who sacrificed his dreams of travelling the world in order to financially support the inhabitants of his childhood town. Seeing his sacrifice pay off in the end is truly, dare I say, wonderful.I absolutely recommend this, especially as a Christmas family film."
KaiOlaf,"Feb 4, 2022",10/10,"I am going down the imdb Top 250 list this year to watch all the best rated movies I haven't seen yet. I saw some good movies, but I also saw some movies I can't understand the high rating.But now, finally, I saw the best movie I have seen for a long time, it will become one of my very favourites. Of course, the story is sweet as candy and sometimes you need stuff like that. The plot, the acting, the setting, the humour and the emotions are simply perfect. The fact that this movie is so old without any effects seems strange in the beginning but in the end it makes this special charme.If you are one of the few persons just like me who never saw it yet: Do it. And laugh, cry and sigh."
PoppuIRL,"Dec 24, 2025",10/10,"I can't believe a movie made in 1946, was able to change the way I think about my life. The stresses of every day life feel so trivial, I need to be more appreciative of the things that surround my life. I definitely related to George's struggles with the things he cannot control, and how the stress can pile up more and more until you want to give up."
ezucker-03798,"Oct 30, 2019",10/10,"This movie makes you really put life in to perspective. That's all I'm going to say.
Great message. Really funny at some points, but mostly just the most wholesome movie I've ever seen."
raygirvan,"Dec 26, 2002",N/A,"There is a folktale concerning St Martin, who as a soldier on a mission of importance, gave half of his cloak to a naked beggar he met in a snowstorm... the moral being that there are circumstances where it isn't worthy (or rational) to be charitable to the point where you can't survive yourself. It's a A Wonderful Life, however, is the story of someone who - in effect - gives all his cloak, then complains about the consequences.There's been a deal of revisionist criticism focusing on the political subtext, but I'm more interested in the personal angle.  In my view, George's suicidal state of mind is not caused by the greedy Potter or by family mishaps, but by his invariable decision to respond to such situations by throwing away all of his own wellbeing and hopes in favour of others.His actions are not even necessarily 'good'.  At every turn, George lets sentiment completely swamp reason. What if covering up for an incompetent pharmacist led to further deaths?  Perhaps Uncle Billy *ought* to be in an institution?  Perhaps George should have recognised a no-win situation, made a settlement with Potter and moved on, instead of selfishly saddling his family with a company he deliberately runs so unprofitably that it hasn't the capital to ride a financial setback.Furthermore, the alternative timeline presented by Clarence is clearly fake, concocted to justify George's failure to break out of this self-created rut. There is no reason to asssume, other than because Capra wants it so, that if George hadn't existed his wife would have remained unmarried, his brother fallen through the ice, or the town's social change necessarily proved negative in the long run (Potter after all, won't live for ever).Sorry, but I find this film deeply exasperating.  This is not, as some have commented, a modern-day Book of Job, since George's problems are not inevitable fate, but so much down to his own choice to be a doormat."
grigoraaakis-889-295918,"Nov 23, 2023",7/10,"A timeless story, one of the must-see classics of the old cinema. ""It's a wonderful life"" is crafted in a beautiful way, and it's the absolute Christmas movie. It is a Christmas movie indeed because at its core lies a beautiful message that celebrates the holiday spirit, but the truth is that the movie's message is one to be celebrated at all times. Even in the darkest of times, life must be celebrated,and together with others we must always hope for tomorrow. The ending is really beautiful and touching and is actually what has turned this movie into an instant classic. My only issue with the movie is that although I understand what it stands for,and love it, I don't like the way it treats its protagonist. George Bailey is an ambitious man, a free spirit and his life has trapped him in a place where I feel he's not happy enough. And the movie ends,and sure he learns his lesson,and although he is celebrating the life he's got, he has lost all ambition and his fire. The movie sacrificed a man's dream to remind us that life is wonderful no matter how hard it will get, but isn't dreams the reason we keep going?"
ajkbiotech,"May 5, 2021",10/10,"I'm very fond of Frank Capra's many films.He was of Italian American ancestry while I am of Greek, Albanian and Turkish ancestry. Like him, I see America as a land of opportunity which when it keeps its promises is at its best.Capra's films keep telling the same story, but in different ways. In this one, he uses an amazing story device; he has the main protagonist wish that he had never lived, and then God sends an Angel to show Jimmy Stewart as the main protagonist exactly how everyone's life would have been different if he had never lived.By doing this, Capra shows the importance of COMMUNITY and CARING for one another, and also demonstrates his deep faith in the Church and in the Lord.This is far and away Capra's best film, and far and away the finest Christmas film ever made.Hodie Christus Natus Est.Zuzu Bailey: Look, Daddy. Teacher says, every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings.George Bailey: That's right, that's right.George Bailey: Attaboy, Clarence."
jef-mead,"Feb 13, 2008",1/10,"A good reason for banning Christmas! It's not enough that saintly Jimmy Stewart hogs 90mins of screen time without once showing a genuinely human emotion ( other than the rampant self-pity of suicidal Jimmy ) but I've also got to face a blundering angel sweet enough to be everybody's favourite grandfather ( retch ), a sweet wife who should have clobbered the mad drunk with a book on coming out of the library and a lovingly inadequate drunken Uncle. I'm sure my ire wouldn't be as great if it were not for the obscenely holy reputation this film has but right now I'd cheerfully burn every copy of this 'evil' movie! Can't wait for an angel to show me what the world would be like without it, although I can't imagine that one ever hearing a bell again!"
allanmac-05661,"Dec 24, 2022",10/10,"Simply the best Christmas movie ever made. It's funny, sweet, unexpectedly dark and simply wonderful and makes you want to be a better person.The cast are wonderful, the story is simple but beautifully told and there are just so many little parts you pick up on repeat viewing thst just make it better each time. Yes,it was made in 1946 (when I was minus 24),yes it is in black and white, yes it now looks a little old fashioned but it's a genuine timeless classic.Oh and I think the Bert and Ernie in this inspired the Bert and Ernie in Sesame Street!If you've never seen, watch it as soon as you can...pure Christmas joy!"
dmars1987,"Nov 24, 2019",10/10,This Christmas movie is the Christmas movie by which all others should be judged. This movie is a a 10 for more reasons that can be listed here. This movie has almost as many quotable lines as any Monty python movie. I defy anyone to name a better Christmas movie. It is perfect. It has has Jimmy Stewart and Angel's. Whoever gave this movie a 8.6 should be shot.
BCSLNBB12,"Dec 17, 2025",10/10,"I just finished watching this movie and wow. I have never seen anything like it. The themes are timeless, the acting is beautiful, and the storyline is great! James Stewart embodies the role of George Bailey. The movie causes you to think back and reflect on your own life, regardless of its age. Stewart's acting is phenomenal, you can see the joy and tears in his face. If I could rate this movie higher, I would. 10/10 stars, DEFINITELY would watch again."
zacklearman,"Dec 10, 2021",10/10,"This movie encapsulates the post-world war 2 spirit of the times perfectly. The focus of the protagonist's communal obligations in helping thy neighbor in lieu of loftier ambitions is adorable, and the old-school American angle is pure 50s nostalgia. Scoring this timeless classic as anything less than a perfect 10 is abominable."
benowen-91207,"Dec 24, 2019",10/10,"Very much my opinion, but this film is the best Christmas movie because it embodies everything the season is about; loving the people close to you, not taking you're life for granted and caring for those in need. It's funny because the film barely takes place in ChristmasIt's a wonderful life is worth an annual viewing, it is something that keeps the spirit of the season and never seems to loose it, and it's rare to have a film like that"
starwarspasta,"Sep 1, 2021",10/10,"The storytelling, level of acting and pure emotion found in It's a Wonderful life is what separates it from almost any other film. Watching it, whether it is the first time or 50th time, reminds the viewer of the meaning and significance that was once ubiquitous in film. Movies in the modern day are largely filled with cheap thrills, one liners and constant stimuli. It's a Wonderful Life is the complete opposite. It tells a story that is so fundamentally important that it almost NEEDS to be told. The lessons that can potentially learned from watching this film are invaluable. The beautiful and talented Donna Reed gives one of, if not the best female acting performances I have ever seen, and James Stewart portrays George Bailey so well that it is hard to imagine separating the man from the character. Even some of the greatest films have flaws, but I am unable to find any with It's a Wonderful life, it is a bona fide masterpiece, and I believe any true cinephile would agree."
bob the moo,"Feb 8, 2002",N/A,"`George Bailey is a pillar of his community whose life has been selflessly dedicated to the welfare of others.  Through the evil machinations of the town's business mogul, George is driven to the point of suicide.  In answer to the prayers of the townsfolk, a missing angel comes to the rescue.  He shows George what a sad and sorry place the town would have been without him.  Can this life George out of his despair?'Who hasn't seen this film?  Anyone?  It is an unashamed tribute to homely values and is hugely warming.  The story itself is not exactly rocket science, but it is does contain plenty of nice touches as we follow George through his life of missed opportunities and sacrifice through to his marriage and eventual down fall.  The world that this happens seems so distant nowadays, with our friendless society - so few people do anything for their fellow man in big cities etc.  So this is very touching to see a man who serves others in such a major way.  It is a story of how every little helps and how you cannot overdo friendly gestures.Stewart is excellent with his partner Capra.  Barrymore is also excellent in a thankless role - he represents all that is wrong in society and of course he rises to a powerful position.  Henry Travers is good as Clarence, the wingless angel and of course who can forget the excellent Donna Reed as Mary.It's pure hokum of course, the regular Christmas movie that lifts everyone's spirits.  But isn't this what we all wish the world was like really?  Why can't it be - if only for two hours.  This is what Stewart and Capra do best - enjoy and forget the real world."
farez,"Dec 6, 2015",10/10,"Everyone has heard of this film, and if you haven't seen it, it's probably because you live in Antarctica or you have purposely avoided watching an old corny rerun in black and white.I command you to watch it, and if you have a heart, you will cry with joy. This film has endured as a timeless classic for 70 years for good reason. This film is pure art because it taps into the human experience in such an effective way. The message that we are all important is simply and beautifully brought to life.Jimmy Stewart's performance is human, funny, poignant and brilliant. Do not look for subtlety, clever meanings, high drama, modern art, political correctness, special effects, sex scenes, or car chases. You won't even see any color (avoid the colorized version at all costs), but what you will find is a perfect little film that will stay with you forever. This film represents the very best of what America wants to be at its core.I appreciate high brow multi-million dollar productions as much as any other film geek/ movie buff, but this film always brings me home because it reminds me of what really matters in life.Watch it and savor every wholesome corny second of it. If you don't feel something, you are not human."
lee_eisenberg,"Feb 17, 2006",7/10,"Since everyone knows what happens, I'll comment on Maureen Dowd's spoof, called ""A Not-So-Wonderful Life"". It portrays Clarence meeting Donald Rumsfeld and showing the defense secretary how the world would be if he'd never existed. The world would be a much better place: no Iraq war and we'd have caught Osama bin Laden almost immediately.I wrote an extension of that idea portraying that Fonzie is president and the characters from ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", ""Bewitched"", ""Gilligan's Island"", ""I Dream of Jeannie"", ""Get Smart"", ""The Flying Nun"", ""The Brady Bunch"", ""All in the Family"" and ""Sanford and Son"" are in his cabinet.But anyway, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is worth seeing. Especially the swimming pool scene and the bathrobe scene."
dataconflossmoor,"Aug 16, 2007",10/10,"This will be my 100th comment on this website, and, it stands to reason that I should pick an all time classic movie such as ""It's A Wonderful Life""!! This film is Frank Capra's best film ever... A statement of this nature tells you how remarkable this movie truly is!! Jimmy Stewart was voted by one magazine as the second best performer ever in the history of Hollywood!! Only second behind Katherine Hepburn, making him rated the best actor in the history of movie making!! While some people may question this assessment of Jimmy Stewart, due to Jimmy Stewart's innocuous Huckelberry Finn disposition, I can empathize with this verdict of Stewart's acting on account of his precisely executed latent tendencies which ultimately resonated into an articulated anger!! Jimmy Stewart's acting is very itemized, and thus, it establishes emotions which are genuine, these emotions relegate Stewart to a vulnerability which was pertinent to the fact that his feelings which could no longer be bottled up inside of him, would make him obtusely erupt!! Donna Reed is in this movie, and her performance is very believable as well!! Lionel Barrymore is extremely adept at playing the role of the ogre (Mr Potter) who is metaphorically writhing in his acquisition of the Baily Building and Loan!! This movie is the classic Christmas movie of all time!!, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""Fantasia"" as well as any other Christmas movie, do not capture the spiritual camaraderie related to the yuletide association with caring and benevolence that ""It's A Wonderful Life"" exemplifies so flawlessly!!What the film ""It's A Wonderful Life"" accomplishes is the ideology behind the true meaning of what Christmas signifies... This phrase in of itself sounds very rhetorical, however, with a movie like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" such an accolade is the genuine article!! ""It's A Wonderful Life"" resembles the movie ""Best Years of Our Lives"" in the manner by which a happy ending is attained the hard way!! Often times, we look at our lives and become demoralized at the uneventful banalities which perpetually plague us!! We are depressed at how money dictates virtually everything, and, as was the case with George Bailey, we become trounced by failure and despondence!! Adversities are what make us cohesive, considering that this film was made right after World War II concluded, we as Americans were thoroughly aware of such a fate!! The fatal predicament which besieges George Bailey in this movie arouses occasion for all of the good citizens of Bedford Falls to bond together and realize the importance of caring for each other!! Such a homespun philosophy was anything but an artificial panacea, and with it, Americans immersed themselves into a nationally guarded perspective of good will and compassion!! This film is outstanding!! The talent and the ideological premise to this film, has out-shined virtually every other movie made!! A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned!!! Films which make people feel fortunate are not breaking any rules which compromise the quality of a film!! All of these carefully devised components to this film make ""It's A Wonderful Life"" an absolutely magnificent movie!!"

pmtheint,"Jan 19, 2014",N/A,"This is a seriously enjoyable watch for the New Year. I've been meaning to watch it for quite a few years but couldn't get my hands on the movie, living in Asia. Just watched it online last New Year Eve and it was amazing. I love how they portrayed the life's little coincidences. How little gestures can change a person's life. It's sweet and great and I don't know what else. My favorite scene is when George woos the girl. Seriously sweet how they did it in the 19s. The character of George is funny and true. I also love how they portrayed the family. Love how they dawned on the importance of loving relationships and seriously it brought me back to the innocent self I have been as a child. This is really going to make it to my next New Year's watch list."
paulclaassen,"Nov 21, 2023",6/10,"I wanted to see 'It's a wonderful life' because it is sitting comfortably at the 20th spot of highest rated films on IMDB. Interestingly, on doing research on the film, I found the film received mixed reviews at the time of its release, and was a box office flop. In time, it became the highly rated movie it is today.So what did I think of the film? Well, let's just say I can easily understand why the film was not a box office success back in 1946. Due to its subject matter, many viewers might have found the film to be blasphemous. What, with an angel being sent down to Earth to help a man on the brink of committing suicide. The angel being sent down, is Clarence - an angel who hasn't got his wings yet, and is hoping to get his wings when he succeeds in saving the suicidal George Bailey.But what lead to family man George's suicidal inclinations? Before Clarence is sent to Earth, angel Joseph tells George's story so Clarence can familiarize himself with the man he is to save. The story starts with a 12-year old George saving his younger brother Harry's life. Years later George is a fast-talking, high-spirited, adventurous young man. He has dreams of traveling the world and doing amazing things. Off course romance soon finds him, he marries and has kids. And he is working at his Father-in-law's Building and Loan firm.The events leading to George becoming suicidal was actually quite boring, and I sat there wondering how this movie could be so high rated. And then the final 20 minutes changed everything, and the film really got to me. These final moments salvaged the film to such an extent that it gave me goosebumps, making me think about a lot of things I never thought about before. Talk about thought-provoking!! I guarantee the film's finale will make you ponder on your life, and you might even see the world in an entirely different manner.James Stewart was exceptional as George Bailey!Would I watch it again? I don't think so, but I definitely won't forget it!"
tatdenning,"Jan 9, 2022",10/10,"This is by far my favorite holiday film.It's a Wonderful Life is an amazing story of a man who wants nothing more than to escape his small town life and travel the world - but destiny has other plans.George is a man with a good heart, a man who listens to his conscience. It's because of his kindness and compassion that he is rich beyond measure, but not in the typical sense. But it takes an act of Heaven to teach George that life is about more than money and worldly things - and the absence of any one of us would leave a hole in the world that could not be filled."
katiajimenezsantiago,"Dec 9, 2022",6/10,"This movie was okay its not something I would actually really watch if it were on my own time, the beginning was good but towards the end I got a little confused.this movie made me feel awkward so many times, especially when they would kiss...like who kisses like that. And when his ghost or whatever it was had him looking around and seeing how it would be if he wasn't alive.. I would recommend this to someone if they like watching old films but for me this wasn't really it but overall it was an okay movie. Im really not a big fan of stuff like this but if I were I feel like I would enjoy it more than I actually did."
johnno-17,"Mar 17, 2009",1/10,"Of all the male stars of Hollywood's studio-dominated 'classic' era, James Stewart was the hammiest. He almost always shouts when a whisper would do; instead of striking an impressive pose, he's always squirming about, arms flailing. He's the melodramatic version of Jerry Lewis.His way-over-the-top performance in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" lingers like the taste of lettuce fried in lard atop a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich on a moldy McDonalds burger roll.But then there's the story itself. It's notable that Capra waited until the Depression was largely over before putting together this dreadful lie about it (which is what this film is really about). Apparently the banks didn't spend years foreclosing homes and farms? No one was displaced, we all held together in the small towns we grew up in? Family's weren't shattered and careers not ruined? It's wonderful baloney to serve with peanut-butter and fried lettuce.It's deplorable that American's think of this as a ""Christmas classic."" Christmas should be about joy, not self-centered delusion. The truth is, the world would have been the stronger is Stewart's character had never been born. The people in it need to find real reasons for living, not Capra's pandering."
Supachewy,"Aug 20, 2010",8/10,"The drama fantasy It's a Wonderful Life is directed by Frank Capra and stars James Stewart, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore and it takes place in a modern day small town.The film starts off with angels talking about how a man, George Bailey (Stewart), needs help to make his life better. The angels decide to send a second class angel, Clarence, to go and help him. But before sending him they give him all the important details of his life. The first one that is shown was when George Bailey was a child and saved his brother's life and stopped the shopkeeper he worked for from selling poison tablets. Then it showed when George Bailey was older and how he dreamed of traveling the world but at any chance he got he had to do some sort of work for the loan shop he was in charge of. He fell in love with a young woman named Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) but struggled to gain her as his wife. This film is excellent and has a morale that everyone needs to hear, a timeless classic.Frank Capra directed this film brilliantly. It was truly sentimental and he made it so you could feel the emotions of George Bailey. There were quite a few classic moments that he created in this film such as when George asks Mary is she wants for him to lasso the moon for her. Capra truly created an excellent film.The writing of this film was pure bliss. There are not that many films out there that have a sense of purity such as this one and that is intended for all audiences. There were many ups and downs on this ride and it left you completely satisfied.The acting by the whole cast was remarkable. James Stewart gave a great performance as George Bailey never being able to get what he really wants and being extremely stressed by all the tasks that he has to do. Donna Reed was great as the love interest, providing much support for Stewart's character to grow off of. Lionel Barrymore was great as the big business man in town trying to buy up everything and keeping Bailey down. Excellent performances for an excellent film.Overall I give this film a strong 9/10, it is truly a timeless classic from the legendary Frank Capra. I recommend this to absolutely everyone young and old, it is a truly heartwarming story that has already gone down in film history."

f-27753,"Jul 25, 2016",9/10,"It's an emotional movie which gives you a chance to reconsider about your own life. Lead character is a man of hones and thoughtful. He is an earnest person toward his own life but he faces some difficulties in his business, which discourage him to live a life. As a result, he tries to take his life. Yet, he is survived by the angel with a magical power and comes to appreciate his life.You will notice how wonderful your life is after watching the movie. You might evaluate your life by wealth. fame and success even though you well realize they can't measure the life. Therefore, you're obsessed to pursue them, sacrificing what really matters to you such as ordinal lives with your family and being in health. The main character is also one of them who miss what is inevitable in his life. However, after the strange moment with the angel,he notices the importance of his family, friends and neighbours.In recent days, you can easily lose sight of true value of your lives because of your life's tight schedule, hence, you should watch the movie and think of your life again."
garyfromct,"Dec 2, 2012",8/10,"I just saw IAWL for the first time last night. While it's not the best movie I have ever seen, it is very good and worth watching at least once. It is allegorical and thus shouldn't be held to exacting standards, as some reviews have done, in my opinion. The movie gets you to think about how your life impacts others and how we should treat one another better. For that I think it succeeds quite nicely. I think Jimmy Stewart did an excellent job of portraying George Bailey. He is fundamentally a good person, but like all of us, is given to bouts of anger and emotion, and lashes out against the people he loves. He quickly realizes his errors and apologizes for them. He is frustrated by his responsibilities and obligations intruding on his dreams, but he does the right thing in the end. We can all related to this and learn a few things by his example."

The Year's Outstanding Picture!Amusing and entertaining Frank Capra film in which you go to live a glorious experience with the grandest group of human beings who ever dared to lead their own happy lives . The final is is a real tearjerker and if you don't agree with Capra that life is actually like this then you might go along with sentiments that it ought to be . James Stewart is at his best as the young asked by an angel to reflect on his life when he sadly contemplates to commit suicide . Stewart was tapped for the lead character right after he left the service at the end of World War Two . Here stands out Henry Travers who performs the good-tempered angel and Lionel Barrymore as the ambitious and snobbish banker , as he was suddenly crippled at the outset of the movie by the arthritis that had been troubling him for years. Frank Capra put a plaster cast on Barrymore's foot , highlighting a long number of prestigious secondaries. Along with the starring , the great James Stewart giving stunning performance , appearing here and there an enjoyable cast playing all kinds of outlandish characters , magnificently interpreted by Thomas Mitchell , Henry Travers , Beulah Bondi , Frank Faylen , Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame, H. B. Warner, Samuel Hinds , Frank Albertson , among others.The motion picture was stunningly and compellingly directed by Frank Capra . This classy director Capra carries out a sharp dissection of the attractive roles , of the social classes and delivering good acting from the prestigious actors . Frank Capra was an expert in manipulating emotions such as proved in his films in the 1930s and 1940s , as he influenced the lives and beliefs of people of the nation with movies as 'Mr Deeds goes to town' ,' It happened one night' , 'It's wonderful life' , 'Mr Smith goes to Washington' , ' Mr Deeds goes to town' , 'Meet John Doe' , 'State of the Union' , and 'You can't take it with you' , it gave him his third Oscar for best director and his second for best film. Rating : 8/10 . The results are certainly warm and really wonderful . The flick will appeal to James Stewart fans , as well as Frank Capra enthusiasts. Well worth watching . Essential and indispensable seeing."

gavin6942,"Dec 7, 2014",7/10,"An angel (Henry Travers) helps a compassionate but despairingly frustrated businessman (Jimmy Stewart) by showing what life would have been like if he never existed.After almost seventy years, and getting played over and over on television, you might think people have grown tired of this film. And yet, as of 2014, it seems to be appreciated more than ever. Not that it is a flawless film. The editing, for example, is pretty rotten. And critical, it is probably not a great film, especially alongside ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", which came out around the same time. But this film really hits the heart.There are some parallels here with ""A Christmas Carol"", only now it is Bob Cratchitt who is the one in a need of a visit from a supernatural friend. The message is different, but also very much the same."

OllieSuave-007,"Dec 18, 2015",9/10,"This is indeed a wonderful Christmas movie, where James Stewart plays George Bailey, who has dreams of moving out of his town (Bedford Walls) going to college, having an established career and seeing the world. However, after his father's demise, he reluctantly takes on the family business (a loan company), indefinitely putting his dreams on hold.This is a classic story that definitely reminds you of the more innocent times in America and reminds you things will always turn out all right at the end if you have enough hope and faith. The plot keeps you engaged from start to finish as you follow George Bailey's life, from his times as a preteen to him taking on the family business, and finally to him getting married and raising a family of his own - all the while seeing his dreams fade away. However, when things get too down in the dumps for him, an angel tries to help him out of despair and lets him see what would life be like in George's town without him being born. This reminds you to never take anything for granted and to always appreciate what you have.It's a great movie with heartwarming moments and great acting. James Stewart and leading lady Donna Reed had great chemistry together. And, the rest of the cast, from Lionel Barrymore as the villainous Mr. Potter to Henry Travers as the angel Clarence, all did a wonderful job.Even as a movie made in the 1940s, it holds up very well through the test of time and is surely one of the greatest to watch during Christmas time. Highly recommend!Grade A"
putneychick,"Jan 3, 2021",10/10,"Made in 1946 and yet watching it as my first movie for 2021 reminds me so much of what we should be thankful for - being YOURSELF that is filled with kindness, generosity, sacrificing and full of love and tenderness.

yousef-jadallah,"Sep 6, 2022",10/10,"Here's a new definition of cold-hearted: a man or woman who remains completely untouched by the 1946 Capra classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". You can't not be moved by this wonderful little gem.The acting is all great. One of the film's greatest strengths for me is making George Bailey - the star of the movie played by James Stewart - a nice normal man. He's not perfect and that's pretty much essential to the film's success because Bailey could be *any* man. The lesson of the movie is fairly simple - we all have our role to play in the world and we are all important. Most movies would make this into a schmaltzy affair but Capra delivered a touching, heart warming tale. Bailey consistently denies himself to allow others to live as he sacrifices his life to make sure people can have enough money to avoid having to sell-their-soul in debt to the evil H. Potter (alas not a Harry Potter...). His complete and utter humility is great - he doesn't see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel Clarence shows him. Again Clarence isn't played in the usual clichéd manner but more as a believable character who honestly loves Bailey for his strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter. The music, the set pieces, all the touches add to a wonderful movie and give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful. A lovely mood-lifter. 8.8/10."
Sargebri,"Dec 26, 2004",N/A,"This is one of the truly great films to have ever been released in the post war era. The themes of wondering how different the world might have been if you weren't born is still a recurring theme in many films as well as television series, but this one really does it with a even greater poignancy than most that try to imitate it. However, the film really gives a great message that no matter how unimportant you feel, your life, for better or worse, touches each person that that you come in contact with. James Stewart is perfectly cast as George really show's why he is the perfect everyman in this film. Also, Donna Reed is wonderful as Mary, the love of his life. The two of them really convey the love that George and Mary felt for one another what made the relationship between the two of them special. I also loved the fact that it pretty much pulled no punches when dealing with what probably was the touchy subject of suicide. This film is truly one of the all time greats."

These films are a lot better than the best dark ones like A Clockwork Orange, Requiem for a Dream, etc.Should be in the IMDB top 10, I wonder why its not. Deserves higher than 10 out of 10."
conpethan,"Dec 17, 2006",1/10,"People like this because it, I am forced to assume, reminds them of a time past and x-mas the way they like to think it should be. And those are good things. But those attributes have nothing to do with an honest criticism of the film.Few here actually rate it for what it really is. And that is a collection of some of the poorest writing and acting in all of film making. Even Stewart, not a great actor but one who is often accused of being a great actor since he is endearing just like this movie is, is at his worst here.If people really looked at this flick without the romantic viewpoint and with true objectivity they would see it for what it really is; A complete a waste of film.Life may be wonderful, but this movie is sappy garbage."

AudioFileZ,"Dec 3, 2019",10/10,"Why would I even think about adding another review to one of the most reviewed movies on IMDB. In a word, emotions. Few films I've ever seen evoke the inner feeling I experience when I watch It's A Wonderful Life. In fact I can't think of any even close.Capra's film is a masterpiece of humanity and spirituality. And it's light as a feather never preachy or heavy-handed. If a person seeing this can't get in touch with some deep inner joy of love and life it's probably a sign of some psychopathic character flaw. This movie celebrates the power within to overcome even when we all have flaws and weaknesses which if we allow do much the opposite. It's a fantastic journey of a life with roads not taken in while keeping an eye on what unites us all.Jimmy Stewart will forever have my awe and appreciation for his portrayal of George Bailey. George is waging war with a powerful foe. He's doing it for the right reasons and Stewart always allows the frail human side to walk hand in hand with the focused true believer. It's a powerful juxtaposition that mimics the eternal struggle of good and evil. It has never been presented in celluloid more masterfully and in such a way as to shoot straight to the heart. The entire cast is uniformly excellent in creating a microcosm of so many elements of mankind's struggle. It is not simply a journey of light either as there are many dark turns. In the end though it affirms a belief in man as a spiritual creation that can, with faith, rise and conquer darkness. I love this movie. It's a Christmas Classic that is an all-time great. So great it's my single favorite movie and I suspect it is others too and will continue to be this kind of film to even unborn generations. Yes, it is that WONDERFUL!"
russjones-80887,"Dec 26, 2020",10/10,"Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, George Bailey feels his life has been worthless and is on the verge of suicide. When his prayer for help is heard in Heaven, an angel, Clarence Odbody, is assigned to help George by showing him how much better the lives of those around him are because of his life.Frank Capra's charming, thoughtful, Oscar nominated classic is a film loved by critics and viewers alike. James Stewart is on top form - how can an actor express so much without words? - with fine support from Henry Travers as Clarence and Donna Reed as George's wife. The greatest Christmas film and arguable the best film ever."
aliyastephens,"Dec 9, 2022",7/10,"For my first time seeing this film, I think it was a nice two hours of my life. Personally I wouldn't have watched such an old film but I'm glad I had the opportunity to watch. I think the mora; of the story was very well needed for holidays because people fall on hard times due to the holiday stress. I really enjoyed this take on the value of family and community and how one person's life can affect the outcome of others. I think the only problem I have with the movie is the part when the angel makes the idea ""George Bailey"" nonexistent. I didn't like how quickly it was resolved. It was like George didn't see how his life changed his town and it was more like he wanted it to go back to normal because people didn't know him anymore. I think it would have been more impactful if there was a scene here he put the pieces together of how impactful his life is. Other than that this was a decent Christmas movie."
Hey_Sweden,"Dec 6, 2022",9/10,"This enduring, popular story tells of George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), a dreamer from the small town of Bedford Falls who's itching to get *out* of town and accomplish big things. But, due to his kind and compassionate nature, he ends up sticking around for years, always attempting to *help* people. Then, at one point, all seems lost, and a deeply despondent George seriously contemplates suicide. An angel named Clarence (Henry Travers), who still yearns to earn his wings, intervenes and makes a difference by showing George what life in town would be like if he'd never been born.I can believe that movie lovers consider this one of the most inspiring films of all time. It shows us how that each of us *does* leave an impression during our time on Earth, and how much some of us really *do* make a difference in the lives of those close to us. As Clarence says at the end, ""No man is a failure who has friends"", and these are words to live by. George spent a lifetime earning his friendship with others, and provided a rock for townspeople in rebelling against tyrannical, pathologically greedy Scrooge-like cretin Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), who aims to own the whole town - lock, stock, and barrel.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is full to the brim with acting talent, with familiar faces (Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, Gloria Grahame, Frank Albertson, Samuel S. Hinds, etc.) in a great many roles. Barrymore is a completely effective villain, making you hate his character in record time. Donna Reed is absolutely enchanting as Mary, the love of Georges' life. And Jimmy himself is totally believable - a principled, amiable, dependable sort of average guy. I particularly enjoyed character actors Ward Bond as Bert the cop and Frank Faylen as Ernie the cab driver (as you may have guessed, this is where 'Sesame Street' got the idea for the names for two of their popular puppet characters).The film is fundamentally a solid story that's very well told by filmmaker Frank Capra, with moments both very funny and incredibly poignant. It's very well acted and expertly made, and would make for good viewing any time of the year, not just Christmas time.Nine out of 10."
Norm-30,"May 24, 1999",1/10,"I've been collecting (& watching) old films for over 20 years, and have over 700 in my collection.  Call me ""Ebeneezer Scrooge"", but I think that ""Wonderful Life"" is one of THE WORST films I've ever seen!!!! (I'm not kidding).People today are amazed that it got such lousy reviews when it premiered; I feel that audiences THEN could see what a bad film it is!What's wrong with it?  First, the pacing.  The first half of the film (where all the ""bad stuff"" happens) is MUCH too long; it goes on FOREVER.  The part after his suicide attempt is much too short, and doesn't dispel the ""depressing-ness"" of the beginning.  Plus, the scene where the clerk hits young Stewart on the ear is an extremely brutal (& violent) scene for that era; it STILL bothers me!If you want to see GOOD Capra, check out ""Arsenic & Old Lace"", ""Lost Horizon"", ""Lady For a Day"", ""You can't take it with you"".....in fact, any film BUT this one!It may be a ""Wonderful Life"".....but, it's a lousy movie!"
movie-reviews-uk,"Dec 29, 2022",9/10,"I'm quite surprised that it's taken me more than fifty turns around the Sun to see this accepted classic. Still I managed to catch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in the cinema so I don't regret waiting.That said the film doesn't quite live up to the image suggested by the clips and excerpts that have become familiar over the years. The bulk of the movie is far darker than the end would suggest with Jimmy Stewart playing a man who's spent his life putting, well, his life on hold in the service of others. This doesn't make him very happy but it does support just about everyone else in town.Fortunately this self-sacrifice proves worth it when, eventually, everyone rallies around him just then he thinks that his life is over. This is the happy, sentimental message of the movie. Thankfully the witty script and solid acting overcome this sappiness.I don't think that this is the greatest movie ever, or even the greatest Christmas movie, but it is well made and a refreshing antidote to the usual festive fare. If you like Jimmy Stewart then you won't go far wrong here."
ashlynrainn,"Dec 22, 2017",10/10,I am only 7 and I think this is the perfect movie of all time. This is the movie that blends all of the characters into a time where things actually mattered. Childhood seemed so much different then than it is now. It would have been beautiful to live back then.
Bad-Good-Great,"Dec 30, 2019",7/10,"When you cast characters as a family, or when you have different actors to play the same person when he or she was young, then cast another adult actor to play the same person as he or she grew up, there are two very important necessities whenever involved family and age growth.We have so many actors young and old cast as family members, father, mother, brothers young or old, there's consistence the filmmakers used to overlook: The people live under the same roof, coming from the same parents, the kids undoubtedly would inherit the accent from one of their parents; if the father often with the kids, then the kids, especially the boys, their accent and intonation when speaking would be very similar to their father's accent and intonation. Or if it is the mother who spend more time with her kids, usually, the kids would inherit her accent and intonation when speaking.But what we got here in this movie is a mess!
Samuel S. Hinds, who played Pa Bailey was born in Brooklyn, New York, so he got a Brooklyn accent. Beulah Bondi, she played Mrs. Bailey, was born in Chicago, Illinois, while George Bailey played by James Stewart was born in
Indiana, Pennsylvania. James Steward never bothered to change his accent in almost every movie he played, no matter what kind of role it was. His trademark heavy and weird accent and the way he spoke were so unique.
Robert J.Anderson, he played the Little George, was born in Hollywood, California. And Todd Karns, he played Harry Bailey as George Bailey' younger brother, was born in Hollywood, California.So we got so many actors came from different cities and states, and all of them got different accents and intonations when speaking the dialog. How come everybody lived under the same roof, with the same parents, their accents and intonations would be so different? None of them in this movie speaking with the least similar accent, especially George Bailey? It's just ridiculous!!There's one other big problem when the screenplay involves kids growing up into adults. No matter what, when kids actors growing up, the actors who played their adult roles, there must be some similarities between the kids actors and their adult actors. In ""Brothers Bloom (2008)"", when young Bloom grew up, the adult Bloom was played by Adrien Brody, a ridiculous casting job! How come a boy played by Zachary Gordon, his face would grow into such huge different facial parts? The huge hooked nose? the slant eyebrows? I just couldn't believe the transformations would be so huge.James Steward was a great actor with natural acting talents, but his never-changed heavy and weird accent was actually a big flaw in almost every movies he played."
SlipGun,"Jul 24, 2004",5/10,"It's a Wonderful Life is to cinema what The Fox and the Crow is to literature.Don't get me wrong: This is a gem of a film, definitely worth watching at least once, but it really is more of a parable or short story than anything else. Its biggest drawback (aside from its length, which could use a trimming of about 30 minutes) is its cheap sentiment, done in typical Capra style. Beyond that, though, is a very simple yet potent film that serves as a reminder that the stories that work on a simple, allegorical level are often the ones that work best. I believe that due to it being a Christmas movie, people are willing to overlook its multitude of flaws, from the hokey acting to the weak script. It's interesting to see the rather bluntly portrayed themes here still work well today, though thankfully with more subtlety and complexity, such as the childlike wonder in Amelie, alternate realities in everything from the Groundhog Day to the Matrix and of course the very obvious character arc no good story should be without (although Capra is hardly the inventor of this basic centuries-old device, as one reviewer stated)."
marmar-69780,"May 2, 2020",10/10,"Its a wonderful life is one of most sweetest movies ever made and making it to be set during christmas holidays just make it a lot better,i think that this movie needs to be seen at least once in a year since its a wonderful life has some unknown warm vibe and magical feeling around it,many kids would also appriciete it since it has some fun moments in it and parents would be able to relate to it and to question their decisions made in life but also appriciete that they at least have family around them,its a wonderful life is for sure one if not the best holiday based film and capra after it happened one night was able to impress me once again"
Lord_Aragon,"Jul 24, 2011",10/10,"I was very much aware of this film consistently being listed as one of the best movies EVER made. James Stewart has been one of my favorites for a longtime. This DVD had been lying with me for quite some time so I decided to give it a try. By God, I was stupefied, I did not write a review immediately just to see if this was not a flash in the pan, just an overdone, emotional blackmailer of a movie but this movie is simply brilliant. As an after thought maybe, its so hard to describe what one feels after watching this gem, this masterpiece. I am told it was a resounding flop when it was released, aah thats so unfortunate.Everyone goes through the vicissitudes of life, and many a times it is so tempting to end it all, to blame each and everyone around for one's misery that we miss out on the differences one's life makes to others. This is Hollywood at its very best, this is what everyone needs to realize...............Its a WONDERFUL LIFE... indeed...... ! See it and praise the Lord !"
ellkew,"Feb 14, 2003",N/A,"At the heart of this marvellous Capra film is a man, who from when we first see him in Gower's store, longs to see far off places. As we all know, he never does leave Bedford Falls and it is this sadness that is at the core of the film and the main character George Bailey, a man with unfulfilled dreams. It is also what makes this film stand the test of time. The characters are believable and compared to current Hollywood heroes win hands down. They are all so well defined and fleshed out as in a Dickens novel that one enjoys spending time with them. So much has been borrowed from this film and so much written about it. Essentially it is James Stewart's central performance that is outstanding and to watch his realistic gradual breakdown is very distressing. I always find it difficult watching the scene when he goes home after realising he cannot find the money and Mary(his wife) turns to see him clutching his daughter with such a desperate look on his face. Her reaction to him is extremely moving. A man driven to the brink worth more alive than dead, this is a much darker film than people often expect. But he does get a second chance and maybe this is why we like it so much, because in real life this is rarely possible. George Bailey played by James Stewart is someone who has a great face. I like George Bailey."
boniandika,"Jul 22, 2014",10/10,"I consider this movie as one of my inspirational movies. I think there are many lessons that we can take from the story. In life, sometimes we feel down, nobody cares with us, no choices in life, and many others desperate things. We might feel like why we should be born in this condition, or why is God gives this problem to us, or anything else. But, we should reconsider how wonderful life is.! From the movie we can learn that life is like a cobweb. We don't know that thing which happened to us, might be connected and give the influence to other's life. We don't know that the thing we do is might be a history. We don't know how is precious our life for others, for our family, our friends, and for people around us. We can think that the thing is disaster, but we never knew how great that thing and what is God's planned for us. From the movie we can see that George might feel very desperate and thought that better not to be born. But, God has his own plan! And no matter how hard the problem is, God can always helps his slaves. We should not be regretful to everything happened in our life. Even how hard our life is, we should consider that God is exist, and we have many friends that still willing to help us and give us their support. We are human being, we don't know the future, we don't know that every problems has its solution behind. That we need just belief that LIFE IS WONDERFUL!"
CineCritic2517,"Dec 29, 2013",1/10,"Stewart plays the saintly George Bailey who, on the brink of committing suicide, gets sent an angel to sort things out in order for the angel to earn his wings. Hilariously parodied by more contemporary films and series, not excluding Married With Children, the idea and execution, let's be honest here, is trite and cloying. Stagy performances and a dragging screenplay is really all that there is for the viewer to mercilessly swallow while the lengthy running time of the film brutally tests one's patience. Had the director shaved off 30 minutes or so from the excruciatingly melodramatic and repetitive second act, the movie would have been far less exhausting, though the silly what-ifs the story puts forth wouldn't have been any less clunky and witless.Despite the technical achievement, which is impressive for its day and age, this is one of those classics the popularity of which simply lacks credibility. Perhaps Grandma and Gramps are still able to look kindly on this overblown, saccharine monstrosity, but anyone under 60 shouldn't be subjected to it."
s-clifford419,"Dec 22, 2020",10/10,"I think I was only 7 when I 1st saw this film as a child I remembered the angel and the fun parts. When I saw it later as a teenager I was hooked. It's my favourite Christmas film. I have to watch it every year near Christmas to get my fix to last till another Christmas. This film has everything, great story, great acting and a wonderful ending. I know why I have to put little ringing bells on my Christmas tree every year."

michaelny7-909-638520,"Dec 13, 2015",9/10,"Just a terrific film that needs to be seen each yr, Great acting by James Stewart and supporting actors. I guess audience and critics back then could not support another inspirational film vs Best years of Our Lives which deserved much acclaim after WW 2. Stewart did deserve the Oscar though and that would have made 2 if they got it right, since he should have won for MR Smith goes to washington.director Frank Capra does a tremendous job and its a shame he wasn't given more time and money for creative jobs. BTW its fascinating that the snow scenes were filmed on days of heat waves and you see Stewart sweating in the scenes. A great classic film that holds up and hopefully will be seen a hundred yrs from now"
dalemo-25894,"Dec 28, 2020",10/10,"This has always been my mom's favorite movie so we've watched it every Christmas for as long as I can remember. As a kid, I never really understood it or enjoyed it. I didn't hate it, but it was just a boring black and white movie. But over the last ten years or so I have gotten to where I can't wait to watch it each year. It is far and away my favorite Christmas movie and it's in the top ten of my favorite all-time movies. I am moved to tears every time, and it honestly gets better with each viewing. We all need to be reminded sometimes that ""no man is a failure who has friends."""
stryker-5,"Jul 11, 2000",N/A,"George Bailey is a thoroughly nice guy, the backbone of the small American community into which he was born.  George's story is that of America in the first half of the twentieth century - a happy childhood before the First World War, ambition growing with maturity, then trouble for the family in the wake of the 1929 crash.  George and his family make it through the Depression, and are blessed with success as George's dearly-loved brother Harry wins the Congressional Medal of Honour in World War Two.  From this high point, George's fortunes take a steep nosedive, and the defining crisis of his life is suddenly upon him ...George's twin ambitions since early childhood have been to explore the world (travel has always fired his imagination) and to ""build things"". Events are constantly cheating him out of his travel plans, and sheer selflessness prevents him from getting an education, his passport out of Bedford Falls and into a career as an architect.  Like his father before him, George is too kindly ever to advance his own personal aims.His adversary and nemesis is Old Man Potter, ""the richest and the meanest man in the county"".  He is as unlike George as a man can be. Immobile and with no curiosity about the world, Potter dominates the small town, and is universally feared and despised.  Without family or home life, Potter has only his money, which he ruthlessly ensures will increase and multiply.  George believes in the community (""we've got to have faith in each other""), whereas Henry F. Potter regards the people as exploitable ""rabble"".  On George's study wall hangs a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. Potter has a bust of Napoleon.This famous Capra tear-jerker is a masterpiece of emotional manipulation, and incidentally a tremendous piece of cinematic craftsmanship.  The film has two premises, firstly that the fabric of the nation is sound so long as Americans stick to the early settlers' values of communal mutual assistance, and secondly, an enlightened liberal doctrine of the perfectability of mankind.  If ordinary folks are offered chances for betterment, by means of building improved housing and encouraging financial thrift, they will prove themselves to be sober, hardworking citizens, keen to advance the prosperity of their progeny.  George is the liberal hero who embodies these beliefs.  His dream is to raise ""dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw"", and when the Martini family takes possession of its property, George is on hand to see Giuseppe realise the American Dream - ""I own my own house!""The young George knows that he doesn't want to squander his life ""cooped up ... in a shabby little office"".  However, George is the responsible type, and to protect the working people from Potter, and put Harry through college, he assumes the burden of running the family's Building and Loans business.  He grows to realise that his father's legacy is a noble one, the foundation of America's future.George continues to dream of ""anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles"", but the thoughtlessness of others keeps him trapped in Bedford Falls.  Alone outside a house party, he reacts wistfully to the wail of a distant train.  His crisis of conscience when Harry announces the marriage and the new job is a tremendous piece of cinema.  Kind, decent George goes through silent turmoil as it sinks in that his hopes have been dashed again.If the propositions on which the story rests are simple folksy ones, the story itself is a strong one, told with great zest.  Pacy effervescence keeps the action moving snappily along.  Mary loves George from childhood, as we see in the drugstore sequence.  The prepubescent George shows the traits we come to love in him - industriousness, reliability and social conscience - and he saves Gower the druggist from committing an appalling act of negligence, at great cost to himself.  The tight narrative sweeps us from the kiss to the wedding, and from the honeymoon taxi to the run on the bank.  World war Two, during which ""George fought the battle of Bedford Falls"", is an object lesson in concise story-telling.One of Capra's narrative techniques is to exploit clashes of opposites. We plunge from elation to despair as Harry's triumph gives way to the financial disaster.  Christmas bonhomie is tainted by the chilling presence of the bank examiner.  George's desperate prayer in Martini's bar is accompanied by a jolly Italian ditty.  The 'drowning' drama is followed swiftly by a gentle comedy scene.The heart of the film is the relationship between George and Mary.  A silent look passes between them at the high school dance, and we know that they have fallen in love.  Their charleston dance (a superbly-choreographed sequence) cements the incipient romance and is followed by a great two-handed scene in which the lovers throw stones at 320 Sycamore, the house which will one day be theirs.  George's later visit to Mary's house once more blends romance and comedy with splendid success.  It is a joy to watch the aching desire of each for the other as they listen to Sam's phone call.Clarence the wingless angel offers George ""a chance to see what the world would be like without you"".  The nightmare sequence shows Bedford Falls (now known as Pottersville) to be a seedy Gomorrah of jazz bars and strip joints, peopled by a surly, unhappy populace.  George's creed is borne out - ""each man's life touches every other man's life"", and he sees that his patient, benign influence has worked its magic.  Bedford Falls is a better place for having known George Bailey.Watch out for a young Gloria Grahame as Violet, launching a career of playing bad girls.  And is that Donna Reed in Martini's, posing as the bar girl in the peroxide wig?"
