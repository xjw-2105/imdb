Bored_Dragon,"Mar 3, 2018",8/10,"Placed in futuristic Britain, this movie tells a story about dictatorship and the man who became symbol of it's downfall. People from many, not to say majority, countries in today's world can easily identify with the characters. Great adaptation of DC comic and always gladly seen Natalie Portman.8/10"
benxrichardson,"Nov 17, 2020",9/10,"This is a very unique film. Watching it again 15 years later, it's amazing how much closer we are to this totalitarian future. A must see."
planktonrules,"Nov 16, 2019",9/10,"DC Comics has a rather poor reputation lately. Despite having some great superheroes, the films based on their characters often have sucked. However, one of the best and most worthwhile films based on their comics is WELL worth seeing...""V for Vendetta"".The story is placed in a dystopian future. According to this future, the United States has been torn apart by civil war and disasters. And, the United Kingdom has gone from a constitutional monarchy to a repressive fascist dictatorship. But the government is far more evil than just repressing free speech. It seems that much of the chaos that led to this government was actually created by the man who now is in charge. To create a climate of fear and chaos, the government has created fake terrorists...and used the deaths of 10s of thousands of Brits as an excuse to control the country with an iron fist.The only hope Britain has is a weird nehilistic superhero, V. V (Hugo Weaving) is determined to bring down the government and give the country back to the people. But how? And what part does Evey (Natalie Portman) play in all this? See the film.This is a very exciting and intelligent film. It definitely kept my interest...much of it because the whole thing (aside from the near indestructable anti-hero) seemed possible! Well worth seeing and exceptionally well made.By the way, if you like this film, try the 1960s Italian film ""Danger: Diabolik"". Both have very, very similar themes and both are wonderful movies."
paxatron,"Mar 8, 2006",N/A,"I was a fan of the ""V for Vendetta"" graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he's always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore's music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Closer"". Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it's too late.The Wachowski Brothers' former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors' breakout hit ""The Matrix"". Unlike ""The Matrix"", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn't show off, and his trickery isn't self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.With solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another ""Matrix""-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in ""V"" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. ""V for Vendetta"" is a must-see.10/10"
beschuitfluiter,"Nov 14, 2021",10/10,"Here we are, 2021, almost 2022Do I even need to explain why this movie is of the most importance?Watch itUnderstand itKnow how a fascist state is born, nurtured, and risesAnd now look aroundYes, you may thank me later, if it is still allowed by then."
Sicaa369,"Dec 8, 2020",10/10,"First, I have to give credit and praise the team behind this film, for releasing a movie so politicly powerful and sharing a strong message how ""we"", as ""we"" the people living in our country shouldn't be afraid of our governments 4/5 years after 9/11 and during the massive political protests in many countries around the world.It is sad to think that 15 years later in this rough, chaotic 2020, when I saw this movie for the first time, I realized that my countries government isn't far away of being like the government presented as a villain in a fictional, sci-fi, DC made film based on a graphic novel. Hope that in the future things will change for the better, but we should not stand low and keep on fighting.The movies writing and characters have so much emotion, care and love put into them. The plot and the story are powerful, heartwarming yet entertaining. Action is well filmed and exciting. And the acting is just, WoW! Hugo Weaving kills it as V, and Natalie Portman's character Evie's growth through the story from beginning to end was so well done that id had me tearing up!In my opinion, a MUST WATCH! Honestly my favorite DC movie ( yes, love it more than the Dark Knight ) and one of my top 5 favorite movies.A perfect 10/10 from me."
atzimo,"Mar 19, 2006",10/10,"I am speechless. I just came back from the theatre, where I watched 'V for Vendetta'. There are three main elements in the movie and it excels on all three of them.First off the dialogues and script. Intense, witty, honest but not patronising, intelligent but not pretentious. That's the first level at which the movie surprises you. You don't except such high level of script from an action movie. But it is slowly revealed to the audience that V for Vendetta is not just an action movie. The story is filled with current events and has a definite strong political sense.Secondly Hugo Weaving's performance. It is definitely what grabs you from the start. He delivers some of the hardest lines with incredible charisma. His performance shines throughout the movie and honestly he sounds as good as any of the best actors out there. He should be nominated for an academy award.Finally the visual part. Incredible, yet no ""Matrix"" effects used. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top notch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.Do not miss 'V for Vendetta'. It's one of the best movies of all time, an eternal classic.10/10"
0U,"Feb 11, 2020",10/10,"Some of the action might be a bit choppy, but V for Vendetta is extremely entertaining. Its great visual effects and Hugo Weaving's iconic portrayal of ""V"" is more than enough to satisfy even the strictest of viewers. There is also a great message about rising up against political propaganda within its great style and environment. Another great film from the Wachowski's is now on your hands."
BrunoRatesTheMovies,"Mar 27, 2022",7/10,"While the Visuals look dated, the Vibe is Very current. The parallels in this Version of reality is ominously similar to our own 2020. Viral disease, politicising Vaccines, at least this pulls the Veil on what a true fascist totalitarian regime is like along with government control media."
barcmeister4958,"Dec 14, 2020",8/10,"We haven't watched this movie before and it has been out for 15 years. It seemed a tad too cartoonish in the first few minutes so we gave up on it when we first tried to watch many years ago. I am glad we gave it another view tonight-it could be a movie about the events happening today and so very realistic it is frightening.
It has a good storyline and the acting is well done. More importantly is the message it carries and we should all take that message seriously if we don't want to end up living in a country governed by martial law, fear and loss of freedom."
saint_barbie,"Mar 27, 2006",1/10,"*** CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS ***Alan Moore's graphic novel V for Vendetta is an elegant, thought-provoking and complex exploration of the meaning of freedom and the politics of protest. The Wachowski Brothers and James McTeigue have somehow reduced this to a film that pretty much says 'Whoa, dude! Terrorists ROCK!!!111!'It's hard to imagine how anyone who is a fan of the book could have produced this film. The novel is clever where the film is dumb, engaging where the film is boring, and subtle where the film simply blows stuff up. Where Moore's V is erudite and sophisticated, the best McTeigue's V can manage is a big speech of words mostly beginning with the letter 'V'.Principally to blame for this must be the screenplay, which is full of unwieldy clunking additions which are supposed to make you think REAL HARD YOU GUYS about how this is LIKE RELLEVUNT to NOW. The screenplay takes a piece which is about Thatcherite Britain and tries to use it to bang home a message about George Bush's USA. So, instead of Moore's extreme conservative regime, we are presented with a 'British' government of the religious right, which seeks to ban homosexuality and Islam in the name of Christianity. Anyone who is actually British will find this confusing and nonsensical, as there is no popular religious right in Britain. And Americanisms like 'lever' (pronounced 'levver' rather than 'leever') and 'elevator' don't help.Still, no one could really have expected the Wachowskis to produce a subtle or clever screenplay. But you might reasonably expect that this would be a super-stylish, high-action thriller. It isn't. The production design is sloppy - we're expected to believe that, thirty or forty years into the future, people are wearing exactly the same clothes and using exactly the same technology as they are now, with the sole exception of a little red bleepy machine which doesn't seem to have a function but might perhaps be a dictaphone. And, as for your high-octane thrills, well... don't get your hopes up. The action moves at around a quarter of the pace of the Matrix, and fight scenes are few and far between. In the climactic fight at the end, wherein V slays a whole troop of men, the film's signature visual effect finally kicks in: and it's... *drumroll*... knives leaving vapour trails. Wooooo. No need to bring a spare pair of pants to the cinema. Bullet time, it ain't.There are many problems with this film: poor editing, appalling performances, the pointless addition of a love story. But the main crime is undoubtedly the sheer stupidity that the Wachowskis have brought to the table. Moore's novel deliberately does not end with firm conclusions, but asks you to consider relative evils: the government is obviously oppressive and fascist, but V is no less totalitarian in his own convictions. When he blows up symbols of democracy and justice like the OId Bailey, murders those who don't agree with him, or tortures Evie to 're-educate her', he becomes more and more like the government he despises.In the film, this duality is forgotten, and V is presented as a straightforward hero. The conclusion, therefore, is that terrorism works, terrorism is good, and the ends always justify the means. The film of V for Vendetta misses the principal point of the novel, and ends up being offensive as well as boring and rubbish. Read the book, please, but don't waste your time watching this. And let's pray they never make Watchmen."
divinethomas,"Feb 14, 2006",10/10,"""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot. I see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.""I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. I saw the film last night at it's World Premiere at the Berlin International Film festival. Though it became a little weighty in the middle (one part seemed to drag a little) other than that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character ""V"", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She portrays tremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the movie. This is one of those movies that really sticks in your head long after you watch it though... and it continues to stir and grow."
GreenPlastikMan,"Feb 26, 2006",9/10,"There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I just saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is nothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.The acting, the cinematography, the effects, and the general vision of this film all lead me to believe that it will likely receive a cult following. It is only my hope that the message of this film will come to summarize the history of our future ascendancy to true liberty.Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. In the meantime, go see this movie."
Xstal,"Nov 15, 2022",9/10,"A masked messiah seeks to topple fascist rule, despotic government's so brutal and so cruel, all diversity has gone, being different is now wrong, poor Britannia is no longer calm and cool. The police have spies and cameras everywhere, their eyes and ears observe the wires, seize and snare, but disguises cause surprises, hero V knifes, Fawkes and prises, to derail those, that sit in the top chairs. Removing dread, concern and fear is the key, which V does tormentingly to friend Evey, enables her to have the power, as the clock counts down the hour, to raze a tomb that sets the shackled people free.A fantastic piece of storytelling with outstanding performances all round."

claudio_carvalho,"Aug 12, 2006",10/10,"In a near future, a totalitarian state is ruling England. On November, 5th, a man self-calling V (Hugo Weaving) explodes a symbolic monument and starts fighting for freedom using terrorist technique. He also rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from the claws of the abusive secret police and later she becomes her allied. The man in charge of the investigation, Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea), discloses the truth about his leaders while chasing V.""V for Vendetta"" is in my opinion the best action movie of the year. The story, about a totalitarian state that uses fear and terror to win the elections and dominate the population, inclusive forging terrorist attacks, is much updated. There are many excellent lines in this Orwellian story, but I would like to highlight the following ones: ""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""; and ""Ideas are bulletproof"". The awesome Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" fits amazingly perfect to both scenes of explosion. ""V for Vendetta"" is not only a brilliant tale of revenge as the name suggests, but mostly a magnificent message and hymn of freedom. This is a movie that deserves to be watched many times as a lesson of freedom and citizenship. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""V de Vingança"" (""V for Vendetta"")"
cosmic_quest,"Mar 28, 2006",N/A,"'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.The acting in 'V for Vendetta' was top-notch and, along with the well-written script and apt soundtrack, gave the film the essence to engage the audience and make them feel-- for better or worse-- for these characters. Although her accent was wobbly in places, Natalie Portman delivered a strong performance as Evey, depicting the character's growing love for V and the realisation that the time for her to fight has arrived. Stephen Rea also deserves a mention, as the detective who begins to grasp just how corrupt the government he has supported really is, as does Stephen Fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters in his performance as Deitrich, a protester who hasn't quite grasped just how far the government will go to shut their opponents up. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler was very terrifying as the dictator who couldn't give a toss about his people so long as he remained in total power. However, above all, it was Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction of the lead character V who dominates. Without ever seeing his facial expression, he exudes the pragmatism, charisma and intelligence of the character with a twist of revenge-driven madness.Entertainment-wise, the film doesn't fail with it's apt soundtrack and well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based on a comic book. Yet 'V for Vendetta' maintains the ability to leave the audience shaken and chilled at the thought of how easily a Western country can be ensnared by tyranny when a corrupt government is allowed too much power and goes too far. The elements dealt with are all the more disturbing with the state of the world today. I imagine it will touch a deeper cord with Britons like myself (it would have been interesting to see more on how Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had fared in this new world though) as it is so rare that a Hollywood film is set in the UK. It's always simpler to pretend these things could never happen here so it is a sharp shock to see such a dark future located in familiar surroundings of home.I highly recommend this film to all as it will leave you both entertained and pondering matters raised in the storyline long after the credits have rolled up."
LordBlacklist,"Mar 25, 2006",10/10,"...I am well aware that my summary line invites several retorts, and given the nature of my comment those retorts may very well be resoundingly, unanimously negative. If I say ""This is one of the Best films I have ever seen..."" One would think the immediate response would be, ""Then you must not have seen many films in your time, dear boy."" Butoh I have, and it has been far too long since there has been something up on that screen in the darkened theater that I enter to leave this boring, monotonous existence that had the capacity to inspire. To see the possibilities of what might be, what could never be, and what could happen if the leaders of the world keep things going in the directions that they are headed. V For Vendetta is just a film, yes? But it is also a wake up call of which there are not enough in this time we live in. It speaks directly to the hardship that we endure but seldom take notice of because we are distracted by things that do not matter...upon leaving the theater I saw people, teenagers mostly, the very people who should be pro-actively questioning the methodical erosion of this thing called government in the modern age, react with complete apathy. Most try so hard to be so outwardly different from the rest that they do not realize that in doing this they become just like everyone else; oblivious. We as a society do not want to see films like this, we do not want to acknowledge the atrocities going on in the world, all we want to do is play our video games, watch reality television, spend our money on clothes, jewelry, entertainment. Things that for all intents and purposes we do not need. These are the distractions that keep society from pondering in the wee hours of the night what they can do to prevent true injustice. The evils committed by those that govern are far worse than any fiction the cinema can dazzle us with these days. Yes this is a truly great film and one that I will cherish for a long time. I can only hope that its message finds a wide audience that is open to seeing things from another perspective, in a uniquely human light. In the end that is what the film is about...being human. Having the capacity to choose weather or not to recognize the evils of society and take a stand to make things better than they are. The film of course takes this idea to extremes but for the viewing public dramatic examples are needed to awake them from this artificially induced state of being we call existence and say, ""I see there is wrong, and it is my duty as a human being to do what I can to make it right."" To the makers of this unique and wonderful film, I salute you."
jon-smartty,"Mar 26, 2007",6/10,"V for Vendetta was a weak attempt at political commentary and a simplistic illustration of revolution. I couldn't help but laugh at the ending with the fireworks and people. I think I'm going to make a movie that harps on peoples ignorance and emotions. I'm going to fill it with images of death for shock factor, make knives fly in slow motion (instead of bullets like they did in the matrix) because I can't think of anything original, and make my protagonist hero/terrorist speak so ""eloquently"" so that the movie seems smart because no one can understand the alliteration blather coming from behind that mask. The one thing I was impressed by was Hugo Weaving's ability to recite his lines. Natalie Portman was garbage as always. Characters: all 1-dimensional. The action was generic and predictable. When it comes to IMDb ratings, some people jump to say that this is ""the worst movie ever"" and give it one star. That is silly as anyone with a brain can see that there is a tremendous difference between it and ""SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses"" which holds a bottom spot on this site. However, it is not even close to worthy of a top 250 berth. 6/10"

Our generation has done this revolution against our dictator leader after, a rather realistic portrayal of the storyline. Thousands have been killed in my country including choldren, mostly students and common people. The students lead the revolution, went through torture and pain, but never gave up. This is easily on the most inspirational movies I have seen in my life, and after the recent events I can connect to it more intensely. People should not be afraid of their government, government should be afraid of their people!"
invalidcastoperation,"Aug 28, 2024",10/10,"The movie's depiction of government control through constant surveillance and censorship reflects the increasing anxiety over privacy in modern Europe, where citizens are increasingly monitored by state and corporate entities. The use of mass media in the film to manipulate and control public opinion parallels concerns over misinformation and media bias in today's world.Does this ring any bell? The fact that the story happens in the UK just make it more crazy given the leftist repression that the population is now suffering from.It turned in to a documentary, but I hope it inspires people because ""People shouldn't be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people."""
elliotsillander,"Nov 5, 2022",7/10,"In 1982 acclaimed writer Alan Moore published his comic book ""V for Vendetta"". 23 years later this film adaptation, going by the same name, was released. In short V for Vendetta is an Orwellian dystopia that culminates in a now ever more important satire of the dangers a lack of democracy can bring forth.On a personal level this film haunts me a little... On one hand it does so many things so well, but on the other, there are more than a few issues I have to take into consideration.The biggest of the issues unfortunately is the protagonist Evie. Without spoiling anything I can say that she basically boils down to your typical vessel into the film's universe. Her personality frankly isn't strong enough especially when compared to a certain other character this movie contains. Furthermore there are some at times rather goofy action sequences that do pull me out of the film a little. In connection to these scenes, but also just in general, there are some odd editing choices as well as some overblown sound effects.Getting that off my chest though I can finally talk about the substantially bigger amount of things this film does very well. One thing that shines as bright as the sun when it comes to this here picture, is the central character V. Zed character is a sort of terrorist leader played eccentrically by Hugo Weaving. V not only gives the film something of a backbone in the first place, but also makes the viewing experience a hundred times more enjoyable than it would be without his unforgettable inclusion.Speaking of V his mask is one of the most iconic in film history and as such leads us to the movie's remarkable set and costume design. The bleak version of London we see in this film (which undoubtedly is inspired by a certain German movement) sets the perfect scenery for a story such as this.Now the story being told here is also obviously phenomenal which in my opinion is the most important factor to be considered about a film in the first place. Then there is the villain played by John Hurt who acts as striking critique on dictators overall, and so on, so forth.There is truly so much to love about this film and while there are also unfortunately some quite noticable issues that redact a little from the experience, this is still at the end of the day a wonderful and genuinely important satiric sci-fi/action film.Rating: 7+/10."

But was i in for a BIG treat, this movie is so superbly acted by all  the actors, especially Natalie Portman performed according to me to an  Oscar nomination next year.  The movie is perfectly put together, so if you haven't read the comics  you will be on the edge of you seat the whole movie. Its really that  good folks.  And lastly, the visual effects is fantastic, and the action scenes is  nothing but spectacular.  Watch this movie :-)."
HiddenVoice,"Mar 9, 2006",8/10,"This marks the fantastic return of the Wachowski brothers.Those who were disappointed with their last two efforts will not be disappointed here,there is no doubt that the Brothers are talented.Here they make their comeback.But not as filmmakers,but as producers and writers.And to be honest ,this film thrills you from beginning to end.You'll be blown away with this adrenaline excitement and dramatically intense thriller.A finely complex storyline about V, a reluctant freedom fighter , a rebellion who fights for freedom against the government in London in another time line.Set against the futuristic landscape of totalitarian Britain,a mild-mannered young woman named Evey who is rescued from a life-and-death situation by""V."" Incomparably charismatic and ferociously skilled in the art of combat and deception, V urges his fellow citizens to rise up against tyranny and oppression. As Evey uncovers the truth about V's mysterious background, she also discovers the truth about herself--and emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.This is perhaps the first and fully realized and most successful of all the Moore adaptations.What I liked about this film was the way it balances action and drama.The script is fantastic and directing is equally worth a mention.The assistant director on the Matrix(James McTeigue) movies really has some talent ,and handles the action and drama very well.The film is fast paced and exciting.It is also politically charged and quite controversial but that is the point.It makes you think about the current situation, how well is the government handling the situation of terrorism.V serves as an anti-hero on a quest of freedom.His actions are right but his methods are wrong,he is trying to bring about a message in the wrong way.This film focuses on the source material of the book, more on the characters than on the action.More on the emotions and the drama than on the violence.This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is.The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout,never once boring,an apocalyptic future setting really heightens the tension with starkly dark set designing and stunning cinematography.The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.This is a terrific movie at all points, it has a strong script , impressive directing and commendable performances.But having read the book after the movie,I must confess this film is still nowhere close to being better than the book.No way.It feels incomplete adaptation,leaving a lot of details behind,whereas the book had a more in depth look at V's life and his relationship with Evey.But I guess the filmmakers wanted to take a different approach,to which they succeed completely.There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison and 9/11 issues echoes throughout the film.And it made the film even more direct.There are several more references to our world dominated by politics and government,regarding terrorism.And what they do to secure their safety.This is one thing that makes V so controversial.His actions will make you think he's insane,but it's just an idea,a notion that alerts us to take actions if our own Government ever try to control us,and inflict fear into our lives.Hidden behind the creepy mask ,Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future ,and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.Portman on the other hand also excels,with a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.V is an idea,a symbol,a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.A man can be obliterated but as an idea,an icon he is indestructible and his message becomes more powerful to convey as people look upon this figure ,but not the man beneath it.One man can make a huge difference but united men and women can change something.And that's what made me respond to this film's ideas.It's full of it.Shed with technical and visual brilliance.A spellbinding adventure , exciting action, superb directing and writing and a Sci-Fi film with a thoughtful message,and the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This film is the most controversial and at the same time breathtaking Action/thriller.A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowskis' and Silver.The climax,especially,was uplifting and beautifully executed.And will live on to be one of the most memorable conclusions.It always get me.If there's anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off ,then this is a blast for you."
scottrob36,"Nov 18, 2021",8/10,A film that depicts the mainstream media as another arm of it's tyrannical government which sums up what is happening worldwide in 2020/2021. All in the guise of the common cold. This is certainly worth a watch. We can only hope for the same revolution in the near future.
yasinhussain-14721,"Oct 28, 2023",7/10,"I have to admit I'm somewhat baffled as to how this has such incredibly high ratings, but nevertheless I still really enjoyed it. It's just that this isn't anything too special compared to other dystopian future films out there. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the best dystopians I've seen, but that's simply because movies of this genre tend to falter in terms of storytelling anyway. With V for Vendetta (2005), whilst the plot did progress in ways that were not only unpredictable but even emotive, none of it truly wowed me as much as I would've hoped. Having known of just how highly regarded this film was before watching it, I found myself waiting & waiting for something big to occur, something surprising and impactful, as there had been nothing of the sort to warrant such a high rating. And indeed by the end of things, there was nothing of that sort, not for me at least. Hence my slight disappointment overall. Also, aside from the script, I really think this needed a higher budget, as even though this is meant to be set in the future, many scenes (mainly the ones in the alleyways) looked as if this was set about 100 years in the past, so yeah I definitely found the production design a bit bizarre at times.But I am speaking far far too negatively about a picture that I did like to be fair. I'm sure better writers than me could go on and on about how this portrays society and whatnot, but it really does do so well at depicting totalitarianism and autocracy in the modern-day era, and you could even say our real-life government are slowly becoming more and more like the one showcased here. Additionally, both Hugo Weaving (as V) and Natalie Portman (as Evey) are exceptional as the two conspirators aiming to overthrow their tyrannical authority. The former is witty and charming in personality yet determined and passionate when it comes to the ultimate goal, and this attitude rubs off on the latter whose performance gets better and better until the end as a result. And Portman is so incredibly excellent at illustrating Evey's newfound spiritedness that it even rubs off on us, and gets us rallying for a resolution just as much as she now wants one.Altogether, it's honestly brilliant at getting its message across, and although it may not be a masterpiece of filmmaking, it can certainly leave you feeling rather pensive."
Sir-Final_Thoughts-No_Review,"Aug 26, 2023",7/10,"I read the entire graphic novel V for Vendetta before tackling the movie. Almost three hours to complete a near 300 pages of one of the highlights of the late 80s focus on the darker side of superhero comic books, especially the anti-hero. A masterwork of both Alan Moore and David Lloyd; credited only to Lloyd stemming from Moore's dissatisfaction for film adaptations of his popular works.The film is extremly loyal to the material with obvious minor changes. Its follows the first half the closest and leaves gaps in the second half being the most noticable (Books 2 and 3 to be exact). Stephen Rea's character the big addition to the film.A slight miscast in Natalie Portman who is quite a bit older than the character in the book, but she nonetheless does a fine job, going as far as shaving her head which did get some attention in the tabloids that year. It doesn't have the look of the time period it portrays. The dystopian future of 1997 in the book looks too modern here. The aforementioned gaps also do change the original finale slightly. Not a big deal.Highlights to me are the flair of the directing by James McTeigue, really nice. And John Hurt himself, never more diabolical, heartless, and just plain evil especially in extremely close up which you get alot of here. His most malicious role yet and a loving tribute to the movie 1984 by having him here.Its definitely worth a look and one of the better comic adaptations out there alongside other films of the time like Road to Perdition and Ghost World."
CineCritic2517,"Mar 24, 2008",1/10,"If this had been a children's-movie rated by children getting the 8.3 it got, I would have understood. But grown-up boys and girls surely have better things to do with their time than to overhype this celebration of averageness into the top 250 of this website.The grown up boys 'n gals haven't rated a movie, they have rated subject-matter as it would appear. I guess that showing some concentration camp imagery, an evil Hitler-like character (a grumpy old man version of an Adolf anyway) and rehashing '1984' is enough these days to make something profound.I mean, why else would a movie which has obvious pacing-flaws, a script so full of nonsensical alliteration that it would even make a Vogon gnaw off his own ears, anything but a lavish plot, a pedestrian view on politics and an agonizingly bad performance by one of its leads (Nat Portman (God bless her soul and looks) couldn't act her way out of a high-school drama even if she tried it without a fake foreign accent.) be regarded so highly?Watching this borefest, my eyelids cramped from fighting gravity. I won't get into all the complaints I have with this talky and plodding twaddle, it has all been pointed out by other reviewers in the 'hated-it' section. These are just my two cents to warn anyone with an education about the incredibly inflated polling-numbers for this cringeworthy exercise in film-making, scripting, casting etc. It certainly isn't thé worst movie ever made, but it's average rating shouldn't be higher than a 5.5 and not a decimal more."
Prismark10,"Oct 7, 2013",9/10,"V for Vendetta is an allegory. It is rather apparent the Wachowski Brothers wanted to make a critique of George W Bush's post 9/11 USA.The vehicle they used was Alan Moore's graphic novel with the setting a futuristic and fascist Britain.The film that inspired Anonymous. We have a masked anarchist voiced by Hugo Weaving exacting revenge on John Hurt's High Chancellor whilst trying to save Natalie Portman from the secret police. She later becomes an ally.V for Vendetta deals with issues relating to a repressive state. Totalitarianism, homophobia, Islamophobia and terrorism. The film with its controversial themes has attracted both criticism and praise, although author of the graphic novel Alan Moore is unhappy with the adaptation.The acting from the cast is excellent. Portman, Weaving, Rea, Hurt and especially Roger Allam all excel.It's a brave and a cutting edge film packed with entertainment values and also thought inspiring. A real must see."
Benjamin-M-Weilert,"Oct 10, 2020",8/10,"It's a little weird watching a dystopian movie like V for Vendetta (2005) in 2020. I watched this film each year around the 5th of November, but life eventually got in the way and made it difficult to continue the tradition. At the time, I enjoyed the ""underdog"" of V (Hugo Weaving) protecting art and freedom of thought from the tyranny of an oppressive government. Having gone back and re-watched it in the current global climate, I'm honestly shocked at how prescient it was in predicting a lot of our future. Hopefully, things don't become worse to the point of completely fulfilling this prophecy.I think part of the reason this film remains timeless-other than the flawless performances of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving-is how it shows the amount of freedom people in society give up in the name of ""safety."" Fear-mongering is a common political tactic to get individuals to vote for a particular party. All we have to do to be ""protected"" is to allow those in power to do what's in ""our best interests."" Except, rarely are the actions of leaders in the best interest of their constituents. After all, absolute power corrupts absolutely.Fortunately, V for Vendetta provides a glimmer of explosive hope. Where tyranny is exposed, the one force that can stand up to it is the Populus's combined force. No political system is perfect, but the will of the people-if unified-can overcome great oppression. People die; ideas live forever. Now, whether or not our current global situation can garner enough unity to shatter this broken system without resorting to V's explosive measures is an exercise left up to the reader.An eerily prescient indictment on the trade between safety and freedom, I give V for Vendetta 4.0 stars out of 5."
carboncopy-85854,"Nov 6, 2021",10/10,"This movie will affect you on a deeply emotional level. It shows you that one man can affect change. In this turbulent political atmosphere we live in, this move will give you hope.The writing, the action, the acting are all sublime. V is an embodiment of us all. Truly one of the most amazing movies I've seen, and after watching it in 2021 for the 100th time, it's message is just as powerful and resonant as it ever was. Don't miss this one."
Katz5,"Jul 8, 2025",9/10,"""...Governments should be afraid of their people.""You can't get more timely than the quote from the movie I used as the title of this review. This film, an adaptation of the late 1980s DC Vertigo Comics limited series graphic novel by Alan Moore, David Lloyd, and Tony Weare, was given a screen treatment in 2005 by the Wachowskis, the team behind The Matrix movies and the underrated 1996 film Bound (among other films).The graphic novel was written at the end of the Reagan/Thatcher era and while its statement against fascism and defense of freedom (actual freedom, not some perverted version of it), independent thinking, and decency is relevant in any era, it seems to resonant even more in 2025, particularly in the United States.American viewers with open minds: Try watching the events unfold in the movie and not think about what could happen in our future. There is likely no masked ""terrorist to some, hero to others"" character like V out there to save us. If anything, the movie, as an entertaining science eventuality and action film, may shake apathetic audiences to the core and wake them up.We only see Hugo Weaving's V's face once, for a few seconds, very blurry to boot. His acting is done by his body and his voice. It's an uncanny performance and makes you wonder why the Australian actor doesn't get more roles. Fans remember him as a member of the trio in Adventures of Priscilla, and as Agent Smith in the Matrix movies. Very early fans will remember him from the 1991 independent Aussie film Proof, which also starred a young Russell Crowe. Perhaps Weaving is more selective about his parts compared to his co-star from Priscilla, Guy Pearce.Natalie Portman as Evy is wonderful, her British accent believable. Her transformation from mostly apathetic employee of the movie's version of a Murdoch media empire to unwitting hostage to revolutionary is compelling.John Hurt, who played Winston Smith in the 1984 big screen remake of ""1984,"" is on the other side of the ""Big Brother"" wall for V for Vendetta. The arrogant, narcissistic Chancellor Sutler who truly believes only he and his (now unopposed) political party can protect the people of the UK. Any criticism or even someone who makes fun of him must be condemned (or worse), Sutler controls all police forces as well the propaganda coming from the token Goebbels media empire. In other words, a psychopath. Who surrounds himself with other psychopaths and sociopaths, with the exception of one, in his administration.Sad eyed Irish actor Stephen Rea is Chief Inspector Finch, the one member of the fascist administration who still has a conscience, although he keeps his sympathy and admiration for Evy and V a secret, of course. Stephen Fry plays Gordon Deitrich, a friend of Evy's from the media empire who has a talk show and is inspired by the ""terrorist acts"" of V to start mocking Sutler. It doesn't end well for him.For the other members of the fascist administration, the acting is spot on perfect. Tim Pigott-Smith plays Creedy, the stone cold sociopath who is the Party leader and the head of the ""Finger Men,"" a group of uniformed thugs patrolling cities and enforcing curfews, absolutely above the law and seemingly untouchable. Roger Allam plays Lewis Prothero, the arrogant blowhard on the media empire, the 'Voice of London,"" who will remind American viewers of a high profile pundit on this side of the pond.V for Vendetta has a high rewatch factor, even higher than the original Matrix, although both films share similar dystopian DNA. Most of us learned about unchecked fascism from studying Nazi Germany. Sadly not enough human beings have taken the lessons seriously. That makes this science eventuality film just as chilling as it is exciting."
BadRoosevelt,"Nov 22, 2020",10/10,"It's remarkable how this film came to us before Brexit, before Trump and before the pandemic. Granted, it was borne out of disillusionment and rage over Bush and Blair's corrupt handling of domestic and foreign affairs back in the day and post-9/11 (hence the themes of Islamophobia). But with time the film has only become more topical than it was in 2006, when I was asleep and didn't even know of its existence. More than a decade later, I have finally now seen it and I am left wondering what lessons we as a people still have yet to learn about our governments and their descent into totalitarianism. There's no telling if it has predicted even more of our future. Highly recommended to anyone and everyone."

swottmann,"Jun 6, 2020",10/10,"Hugo Weaving delivers his finest appearance in a linguistic and philosophical masterpiece. Every time I watch this movie it brings a new perspective and enjoyment for the art of film. Beautifully interpreted from the DC comics, this movie rivals Christopher Nolan's interpretation and presentation of ""The Dark Knight"" graphic novels. 10/10 recommend that everyone watch this at least a second time to pick up on the subtleties hidden in the script."
chiaragiacobelli,"Oct 30, 2019",7/10,"The protagonist of this movie can be considered an antihero, hidden behind a mask, but very different from characters like Batman or Superman. Although he wants revenge and he shows no pity for those men who destroied his life and made many people suffer, he is also a romantic hero full of dreams and hopes for humanity. He believes in a new better world and he is ready to die for it.
The character is inspired to Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo. It is a very good movie, deep and full of quotes."
askalex,"Jul 13, 2008",1/10,"Although it fails as a film in multiple ways (e.g. boredom, repetitions, predictability, ..) I think it is a total failure because it is a political agitprop piece and not an actual movie.A fascist-catholic law&order government somewhere along the lines of Franquist Spain which eliminated all Muslims, the Labor Party and homosexuals runs Britain in 2020. Yea, right, ..., that's what is to fear judging from the last decades of British politics. Cameron is Hitler and Bush' war made it possible.I expected a deep study on contemporary authoritarian tendencies (which hold a grip on all(!) parties all across the political spectrum) but was treated to a partisan Liberal agitprop vehicle. Thanks a lot, I'd like to make my own conclusions. It's not like it was the Labour party which holds the reigns since 1997 which has enacted all current anti-Terror laws and has greatly enhanced the power of the state and reduced privacy and freedom of the individual.Iraq anyone? Nah, people, fear a Catholic-Conservative dictator ...I'd like my movies thought-provoking and free of at least blunt in your face partisanship. V for Vendetta is lousy."
gavin6942,"May 20, 2007",10/10,"In the future, England is controlled by a fascist, 1984-esque government. One man, who calls himself V, has taken on the guise of Guy Fawkes and has made it his personal mission to destroy Parliament and get England to rise up. He befriends Evey (Natalie Portman), who sometimes sees his side and sometimes doesn't.I've given out a handful of 10s. I think out of the nearly 500 reviews I've done, I've given out maybe 7 or 8 of them. I'm not quick to throw a 10 on something because of some whim, you really have to earn it. This film earns it in spades.Natalie Portman is the perfect actress: obviously beautiful, but also a real actress. Some of the other casting considerations (such as Scarlett Johannsen) I just don't have as much confidence in. And Hugo Weaving, although never seen on the screen (at least not his face), made a great V. It makes me sad that Alan Moore decided to preemptively disown this film, because unlike ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"", this is a winner. (And I liked ""From Hell"", even if Moore didn't.) I'm a little partial to this film. I love the musical themes, the alliteration. I love the anti-government, pro-populace message. I do own the graphic novel. But underneath all that, this film offers it all.There's romance (and I mean actual romance, not just people screwing around on a gaming table). There's action, fighting and explosions. There's intense drama (I cried a few times, especially during the prison sequences). I suppose the humor might be lacking, but I hadn't really noticed because everything else is done in just the right amounts.If you like Portman, like good dramas and action films, and are willing to suspend your disbelief for two hours (there are some things that might be just a small stretch of impossibility) this is a must-see. Already firmly planted on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250, I have no doubt it will stay there for a great many years."
georgepanait-06893,"Oct 19, 2021",10/10,"I saw it back in 2007 and the impression was positive, just a good dystopian movie, well made, well played, a little alarmist and filled with witty dialog and symbolism.Fast forward to 2021 the movie becomes a reality in progress and it makes me wonder weather the creators were merely visionaries, or part of the elites that use misinformation and fear as a tool to shape the world into an open prison. While i cannot answer that question, the fact remains that what we see in this movie , we will get to live real soon, without the hero or rebellion of the masses, of course."

AmericanWorldPictures,"Feb 14, 2006",9/10,"well... all i can say is goddamn.keeping in mind that anytime you see a movie as part of a major film festival world premiere, where the cast and creators are present, along with hundreds of avid film fans and press, it tends to raise the experience a notch or two... but having said that - i found it to be a work of monumental genius. i thought it was so amazingly good in fact that i actually had to say something as extreme as that to express my current mood towards it, which is still only a mere fraction of how i felt when i actually left the theatre. it was seriously that good.and yes, i'm biased, if you can call it that. but i like the wachowski's for a reason, not blind admiration. they're geniuses, and they've trained mcteigue well.naturally, i think it will be under-appreciated by much of the general public as its not nearly as action-packed as the trailer would have you believe, but whether it makes 100 mil or 200 mil, it should at least completely redeem the wachowski's legacy in even the most critical of critic's minds.i have to say, the rush of adrenaline i felt when...well, you know if you've seen the trailer - made me want to stand u and cheer. when a movie can make you feel like that, it's succeeded."

juliankennedy23,"Nov 6, 2006",6/10,"V for Vendetta: 6 out of 10: Ah the law of unintended consequences. You seek to adapt a 1982 graphic novel about Thatcherism and convert it to a too clever by half attack on the Bush administration and the war on Terror and you end up with a love sonnet to Timothy McVeigh. Uh-oh.V is Timothy McVeigh from the fertilizer bombs to the horrible Waco style fire flashbacks it is of all people McVeigh behind that mask. (In reality Guy Fawkes and McVeigh shared a similar philosophy. The only difference being Fawkes is famous for failing.) Now obviously the filmmakers were to busy ripping off 1984 and Phantom of the Opera to notice this. The film itself is actually quite entertaining in a mindless sort of way. The script is full of self-referential pseudo intellectual quotes and all the cute little British people say things like bullocks. (I have never actually heard an Englishman say bullocks anywhere besides an album cover. It's interesting to note that the British press hated this film with a passion unmatched by any in recent history. I guess they aren't as pro bombing of Government buildings as Americans are.)The films bad guys are all evil mustache twitching, child raping psychopaths while the good guys are all innocent liberals. The idea mind you that the people will automatically rise up and support the bomber against the big bad government is a fantasy right up with we will be greeted as liberators and Jodie Foster will love me if I shoot the President. Needless to say nuance doesn't enter into the picture.Which is a shame because the movie had a good chance to really make a statement had it been willing to go off the rails a little bit (pun intended) and put some shading on these characters. In all fairness to the filmmakers Timothy McVeigh was also a pretty one sided character. The only difference is where I come from he is the bad guy."

meabak360,"Apr 21, 2022",9/10,"What is freedom? What is vengeance? Who would resemble a nation's long-suppressed anger and hatred of their government?!'V for Vendetta' tells the story of a fictional England which had been suppressed by its newly formed government after a long dark era of disease and war with the USA. The story is the resemblance of many countries under dictatorship and suppression which we have seen throughout history, and definitely will see again. Dictators ruling by suppressing free media, omitting the opposite voices, curfews, killings, and tortures are not unfamiliar to us nor will be. From the darkest corners of this England rises a light, a vigilante names himself V. Someone for me was very much like assassins in the assassin's creed series in the video game world. The story is great, thrilling, mysterious, and also dark and violent at the same time. The script, however a little different from the comics is unbelievably perfect. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are the shining stars of the cast. Other actors were really good too in their roles.The soundtracks are really good and were composed beautifully in harmony with the scenes. Overall, 'V for vendetta' is a great movie that wasn't appreciated in its time. I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who likes dark drama."
sales-741,"Aug 8, 2025",10/10,"I have two massive favourites that I happily give 10/10 and this is the other one.Dystopian autocracy is as close as tomorrow and V portrays perfectly how it can all be brought crashing down.Of course, since the Covid experience, we've had a taste of it up close and personal. It's put some steel into the spines of the public, acquiescence won't show its face again."
haidarkanaan,"Dec 24, 2024",10/10,"I watched this long time ago, and I rated it 8 out of 10, but now, after the escape of Bashar Al-Assad from my country, Syria, this gained a new whole perspective. I bet that this criminal watched the movie and took every single act from it. Can you believe that a nation lived in the reality like this dictator in the movie?A lot of detentions were worse than these imaginary ones. Thousands of people were kidnapped and killed. He even used attacks to convince the public that there is a terror in the country, and control them.I myself was caught for a comment on Facebook mocking his rule.Now watching this masterpiece, I cannot imagine how much real it is. This should not be categorized as Sci-Fi, it should be reality.And it became my all-time favorite movie.One question occurred to me,
WHY it wasn't nominated to any Oscars or major prizes? Any ideas? ??"
prtfvr,"Mar 13, 2006",10/10,"OK, I only went to see this because of the Wachowski brothers involvement. I went totally expecting to hate this movie about a terrorist but it was so much more. I'm amazed to say that it's AWESOME! While not an action picture there's plenty of action and at least one funny homage to The Matrix. You've gotta see it. It's very inspiring, believe it or not and it didn't make me want to blow up buildings either. It just made me appreciate freedom even more. Hugo Weaving is terrific and Natalie Portman leaves Princess Amadala far behind with her performance as Evey. Everyone's great. Stephen Rea is terrific too. I just can't believe I liked this movie. I'm still in shock."
granfunk2001,"Oct 6, 2023",7/10,"Good movie. Natalie did well. Movie was well cast.However, there was a statement that the government was started as a Conservative Party. But as I watched it, all I could think of is this is the works of leftist and or fascist.It's well known that fascism will appear cloaked in liberalism.I can see this happening in the US.Remember the 5th of November not the cake and tea party of January the 6th.The story was solid and I'd say truthful. Governments get too big and powerful as this movie has depicted. It gives us a guide on how to behave, without the killing I hope. Again, governments should be afraid of their people."

Directing by James McTeigue was nearly perfect. At its running time 2 h this movie runs like a clock and it never drags.Overall, revisiting this great movie on a glorious 4K UHD disc was a blast. Great craftsmanship of the film and a great plot makes this a classic. ""V for Vendetta"" is great movie."
BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Sep 10, 2006",7/10,"An alternate futuristic vision of England has the country being run by a ruthless totalitarian government who will stop at nothing to remain to in power. People live in fear and are remarkably passive as a result, save for one masked freedom fighter known as V who fights with cunning and cleverness to rally the people of England to end the dictatorship.Visually this film is quite a stunner. No excessive computer effects, but nonetheless the sets and cinematography are first rate and do a great job and creating a dark world. Also there are many visual symbols as well as creative uses of words that start with 'V.' Added on top of solid acting and direction. For such a faceless performance, Hugo Weaving (who's behind a mask the whole time) plays very well at conveying the character V. However that's the movie version of V, the one in the source graphic novel is quite different.The problem is the film's message and it is ridiculously shallow - ""facism is bad."" That is really it. For a such a lengthy and well produced film it is a real shame, though not much a surprise, that the attention was on the visual, but the metaphorical and philosophical are hardly attended to. There is a lot of dialog and room for for what could have been interesting thoughts of characters reflecting on their world, but it ends up being just routine. For instance when Finch is discussing with his partner the possibility of a government conspiracy they do nothing, but state the obvious - is it worth going against such a powerful government, are we afraid to, and so on. Nothing really that hasn't been done before in countless other stories.Added to the fact that the film ends in an amazingly dull and ridiculously cliché big explosion. It makes sense as you watch the film, but that doesn't mean that it is interesting. How much more interesting would it be when the shadowy freedom fighter V would think of a way to topple the government by not using methods that it uses against it's own people? The film just ends up being almost a more mature version of the Star Wars story - eventually the good triumphs over the evil with a big bang. Star Wars had the Death Star and here we have several buildings in London. So it is good, but retreading on old ground with nothing new to present has never scored a film big points. 7/10Rated R for violence"
winniestymuzunze,"Dec 12, 2024",10/10,"V for Vendetta, directed by the Wachowskis, is a thought-provoking, visually stunning, and deeply unsettling dystopian thriller. Released in 2005, this adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel is a powerful commentary on government control, rebellion, and individual freedom. The film masterfully weaves together elements of science fiction, political thriller, and social commentary, creating a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.At its core, V for Vendetta is a story about resistance and revolution. In a future England, the totalitarian government, led by the tyrannical Chancellor Adam Sutler, exercises total control over its citizens. The narrative follows V, an anarchist revolutionary, played by Hugo Weaving, who seeks to dismantle the oppressive regime. Weaving's performance is nothing short of phenomenal, bringing depth and nuance to the enigmatic V. His voice, presence, and emotional depth make the character both captivating and complex.The film's futuristic London setting is hauntingly beautiful, with a blend of industrial and Gothic architecture that creates a sense of unease. The attention to detail in set design, costumes, and production is unparalleled, transporting viewers to a dystopian world that feels eerily familiar. The cinematography, handled by Stephen Windon, is equally impressive, capturing the gritty realism of a society on the brink of collapse.One of the standout aspects of V for Vendetta is its thought-provoking themes. The film explores complex ideas, including government control and surveillance, rebellion and resistance, identity and individuality, morality and sacrifice, and the power of art and symbolism. These themes are woven throughout the narrative, making the film a rich and rewarding experience for viewers.Natalie Portman shines in her supporting role as Evey Hammond, a young woman who becomes embroiled in V's revolution. Her character's transformation from subservience to empowerment is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. The chemistry between Portman and Weaving is undeniable, adding depth to their complex relationship.The Wachowskis' direction is masterful, balancing action, suspense, and emotion with ease. Their vision for this dystopian world is both terrifying and beautiful, making the film's themes and messages all the more impactful. Dario Marianelli's haunting score perfectly complements the on-screen action, adding to the overall sense of unease.V for Vendetta has had a lasting impact on popular culture, influencing numerous films, TV shows, and books. Its influence can be seen in works such as The Hunger Games, Divergent, and Stranger Things. The film's themes and messages remain eerily relevant today, making it a timely and important watch."
katerina-03526,"Aug 27, 2023",10/10,"A wonderful film about consequences, personal integrity, hope and love. This film continues to be relevant and holds up a mirror to the governments of today - who should always be accountable and transparent to their people. The whole cast are outstanding, particularly Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Natasha Wightman. Hugo should have won awards for his performance, he is mesmerising as V.

Directed by James McTeigue, this cinematic adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel is a brilliant blend of political commentary, artistic vision, and emotional depth, proving itself to be a timeless classic that resonates with audiences even today.At the center of this dystopian narrative is V, portrayed magnificently by Hugo Weaving, whose iconic Guy Fawkes mask has become synonymous with rebellion and resistance. Weaving's performance is a tour de force of charisma and intensity, conveying a profound sense of injustice and longing for freedom that captivates from the very first moment he appears on screen. His eloquent monologues and unwavering determination to dismantle a totalitarian regime evoke both admiration and empathy, making V one of cinema's most compelling anti-heroes.Natalie Portman, in a standout performance as Evey Hammond, provides the emotional touchstone of the story. Her character's journey from fear and submission to empowerment and defiance is beautifully executed, allowing viewers to witness the transformative power of courage and hope. The chemistry between V and Evey is electric, highlighting the impact of resistance in both personal and political spheres.The film's aesthetic is nothing short of stunning; the combination of striking visuals, evocative cinematography, and a haunting score by Dario Marianelli creates an immersive experience that draws viewers into its grim yet captivating world. McTeigue masterfully balances action with thoughtful dialogue, presenting a narrative that compels the audience to question authority and consider the price of freedom.One of the film's most compelling themes is the exploration of identity and the masks we wear-both literally and metaphorically. The famous line, ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people,"" serves as a rallying cry for all who yearn for change amidst oppression. The narrative encourages viewers to reflect on the implications of complacency and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs.""V for Vendetta"" transcends its genre, elevating itself into a lexicon of revolutionary cinema. It is a powerful reminder that the fight against tyranny is both timeless and universal, urging us not to forget the lessons of history or the importance of individual freedom. The film challenges audiences to embrace their inner vigilante, igniting a spark of resistance that resonates strongly in today's sociopolitical climate.In a world that often feels devoid of hope, ""V for Vendetta"" is a resounding proclamation that change is possible. With its unforgettable characters, profound themes, and striking visuals, this film has etched itself into the annals of cinematic history. It is not only a call to action but an enduring testament to the resilience of the human spirit. As the credits roll, one can't help but feel inspired to take up the mantle of resistance, echoing V's unforgettable concluding words: ""Remember, remember the fifth of November."""
Ricardo_Aparicio,"Oct 7, 2006",6/10,"This film looks wonderful and yet gracelessly misses its mark - think of a springboard diver executing a two-and-a-half reverse tuck only to clip his head on the board while falling. (Did I really just make a DIVING reference?) Yes, I understand that this movie used a graphic novel as a source material; this is why most comic book movies have less entertainment value than Laffy Taffy wrapper jokes.The visuals and performances were top-notch, but the message delivered inside of the story was pure rubbish. It was the ""slippery slope"" rhetorical device typically used so nauseatingly by social conservatives (The whole world's gone to hell since (pick one) long hair on boys/the slam dunk/the birth control pill/rock and roll) - only this time, the slippery slope falls to the far right: If you're against gay marriage, it leads to the internment of gays. Opposition to radical Islam leads to the criminalization of the practice of Islam. Opposition to illegal immigrants leads to the deportation of all immigrants. There was also fodder for conspiracy buffs: the government knows and sees every last thing. And the government is waaaaaaaaay bad. I mean seriously - like, EVIL. There was even a Rush Limbaugh sighting, complete with prescription drug addiction!It's obvious that this movie is anti-conservative, which I don't mind at all. We need honest disagreement (which we do have in this country) as long as we are willing to work together (which we have not had in this country since the 1810's). However, I really hate to see sophomoric distortions like these presented as some sort of provocative satire. It's not. It's got all the thoughtful gravitas of ""Rock Against Bush""."

As ¨V¨ utilizes terrorist action against London landmarks but his objective results to be the fighting against the fascist state ruling over Great Britain and governed by a dictator , chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) . The authoritarian tyranny rules over citizens with oppression and violence and ¨V¨ is urging the London citizens to rise up and overthrow the government . Meantime , he saves a beautiful girl named Avey (Natalie Portman) from the violent deputies . She decides becoming his ally and confront the atrocities of the nasty chancellor and his underlings (Tim Piggoth Smith) . Meanwhile , a detective (Stephen Rea) and his helper (Robert Graves) are investigating the terrorist events .This is a thoughtful and broody story containing a clever political criticism and is based on a graphic novel by Allan Moore . The film gets diverse influences , as the myth of ¨the beauty and the beast¨ ,¨The phantom of Opera¨, the anti-Utopian literature of ¨1984 ¨ by George Orwell and , of course , ¨The Count of Montecristo¨, but we are seeing images from the classic film and ¨V¨ acts like Edmond Dantes . In fact , the screenplay of the film is remotely similar to that of the Alexandre Dumas novel 'The Count of Monte Cristo' as both stories revolve around characters who escape from imprisonment and proceed in seeking revenge on all of those responsible for their incarceration . The original comic series was originally created by Alan Moore . However, following his negative experience with ¨From Hell¨ (2001) and The league of the extraordinary men¨ (2003) , Moore decided to reject all money and credit from Hollywood on any adaptations of his work . Thus , he gave all the money he would've gotten to the artist who drew the character with him, and rejected his own ""created by"" credit from the film . The movie has a stagy and carnival stylish but with a breathtaking production design by Owen Patterson . Colorful cinematography by Adrian Biddle , he died during the filming and is dedicated to him . The motion picture was well directed by James McTeigue . James , previously , was assistant direction of Wachowski brothers (Larry and Andy) , film producers in high budget along with another great producer , Joel Silver . The flick will appeal to the comic books enthusiastic and Natalie Portman fans . Rating : Above average , well worth watching."

And all of this for a guy who loves everything from comic adventure films, to silent oldies, to foreign language, or Errol Flynn swashbucklers, or anything written by Robert Bolt. I've seen a lot of movies and this was at the top of the list for how many times I checked my watch. The only film I've seen in the last 10 years that was more annoying was ""The Happening.""Why was this film so bad? It was predictable at every level and surprising at none. Further, it was filled with every politically correct cliché in the book..really? A religious right group that takes over the world, and persecutes lesbians? And the only way to stop them is terrorism? I kept wondering if Michael Moore was behind V's mask (now that would have been a truly surprising ending)."
josephinecarvill,"Nov 6, 2021",10/10,"This film is so much more than a comic book film related to Guy Fawkes. Its intricacies regarding politics, morality, sense of self and what it wholly represents; liberation.V for Vendetta shares a relationship with anarchy, shown through V's belief in the absence of government. The film depicts a corrupt and totalitarian government in which V aims to destroy.The symbolism behind the mask is one of utmost genius! V strives for anarchy and freedom and therefore a disbelief in hierarchy. The mask is a perfect representation of this as it implies unity. As the identity of V is never revealed, we understand that the identity is not of importance, the sole importance is the message behind the mask - and the message the mask seeks to tell...
We are also invited to observe Evey and V's ever-blossoming relationship, with V's eventual admission of his love for her. It seems strange to fall in love with an onscreen couple where one partner remains masked and unknown, but the way their relationship is built upon yearns for me to have a complete adoration for their deeply personable and honest chemistry.It matters not what is behind the mask, V's identity lies within his actions.Every year I watch this film and every year I love it a little more.Remember remember V for Vendetta...""Evey, please. There is a face beneath this mask but it's not me. I'm no more that face than I am the muscles beneath it or the bones beneath them."" - V""He was Edmond Dantés... and he was my father. And my mother... my brother... my friend. He was you... and me. He was all of us."" - Evey."

dieseldemon85,"Oct 16, 2023",9/10,"For being a DC film that wasn't Batman, I must say it was well done, I don't believe I would watch it again though. Only because of the accuracy of how it showcased things in 2005 the the Erie similarities that have taken place. John Hurt is excellent as the dictator playing the exact opposite of his 1984 character Winston Smith. Hugo Weaving was a great choice for playing V, I often think of him as a supporting actor but it was joy to see him in the lead role. Steven fry, Natalie Portman round out the cast. If your into conspiracies maybe give this a pass as the similarities to some current events will have you hunkering in your bunker. 4.5/5."
nikspitz,"Oct 8, 2021",7/10,"The film is prescient given the current state of surveillance, the ever increasing police state, and the manipulation of authority in the UK in 2021.We will say nothing of false flag operations and ""gain of function"" virus manipulation because that would be inappropriate, controversial and speculative, but the parallel and parable is plain as day. The story is by definition dramatic and extreme, yet Orwell, amongst so many other free thinkers and visionaries throughout history would agree with the underlying premise. Fear and manipulation/narrowing of consciousness is of course what any authoritarian power is derived out of.Unfortunately this is not one of Natalie Portman's best roles, considering some of her superlative latter work, her character is stilted, wooden timing throughout. And yet, it is a thoroughly entertaining film from beginning to end.I could almost see Boris in John Hurts place if he didn't present as quite such a mop headed muppet vs the 3rd Reichian role called for. Not sure which is more dangerous, but I digress. Lastly, I am jealous of V's art collection. I believe that was a Blake canvas in there amongst all the other gorgeous art and architecture.If you haven't seen it for a few years, check it out!"
iamclamswan,"Apr 22, 2006",1/10,"This film is clearly political propaganda! I am not some political nut but I am also no idiot. When a film is made a certain bit of the creators beliefs are ingrained and that doesn't bother me, but that is not what happened here. A ruthless Christian conservative enslaved an entire country by making it a police state. He did it by creating fear through phony terrorist attacks. He outlawed the Koran. He locked up all the homosexuals. There were repeated references to AMERICAS WAR and how it destroyed them. This is nothing but outright left-wing propaganda and I would be just as outraged about a film that went the other way. I believe a film like this goes to far no matter whose politics it is pushing and quite frankly I am disgusted!"

Crest_O_Razors,"Jul 25, 2022",9/10,Words cannot describe how much of a performance Hugo Weaving put on. This might be the highlight of his career. The film brilliantly explores the darker side of what happens when a government is ruled by one party alone that controls everything. It makes me think of today's world. The dialogue in this film is one of the best in cinema. It remains faithful to the story and it's a good watch for a November 5th.
deirdre-nocturne-572-557648,"Nov 6, 2022",10/10,"This is one of my absolute favorite movies. I watch it every Nov 5. I hope that the message continues to be spread and that we never get to the point where it becomes a reality like Idiocracy is. It's hard to believe that this movie is 17 years old now. But it is still a lot better than new movies that have come out recently.I think that everyone needs to see V for Vendetta at least once in their lives. It sends a big message to not allow the government to have an insane amount of control. That some things need the fight. It's not all just vengeance, as the movie is called. It's just one part."
levent-molla-623-140235,"May 4, 2025",8/10,"I finally had time to watch the video version of V for Vendetta a few years after it was released. It is a moving enquiry into the possible futures for today's world when governments go to extreme lengths to restrict humanitarian rights to deal with the increasing security threats and terrorist situations. Evey, the narrator of the story (marvellously portrayad by Natalie Portman), has had activist parents but they were both killed as a result of government suppression, although Evey herself has been out of trouble mostly because she was not as brave as they were. When a mysterious masked man blows up the Old Bailey (the central criminal court in London), Evey gets involved inadvertently and is dragged to a year-long trail of anarchy and destruction the masked man (who calls himself V, after Vendetta, portrayed by Hugo Weaving, although we do not see his face in the movie). Although initially wary of the destructive methods V uses, Evey finds more and more meaning into the acts of V.The movie has several elements from popular culture, as well as solid references to today's world. England's path to authoritarian regime passes from the failure of the U. S. in its war and the consequent bio-terror that bring the U. S. down to its knees. There are references to a racist campaign to eliminate everything to do with muslims and other ""subversive elements"" such as homosexuals. It is an interesting twist that John Hurt, who plays the chancellor/dictator Adam Sutler has played Winston Smith, who was tortured by an equally oppressive regime in the movie 1984 from George Orwell's famous book. The underlying message of freedom may be too generic and trivial, but the movie is really well handled."

adamonIMDb,"Sep 27, 2017",6/10,"Having read some glowing reviews beforehand, I was really looking forward to seeing 'V for Vendetta' for the first time. Now I've seen it, I must say that I was underwhelmed. Maybe the reviews gave me false expectations, but the film just didn't come close to being the 'masterpiece' that many reviewers before me have called it. Aside from an intriguing main character and some great visuals, it left me cold.From the get-go, the film is more interested in showcasing a bunch of knife fights, explosions and firework displays (timed to music, of course) than telling any sort of story. As a result, the film becomes repetitive and tiresome very fast. The excessive action and violence is only interesting for so long and when it finally wears thin, the weak and poorly executed plot is clear to see.'V for Vendetta' isn't the film I was hoping it would be and I was expecting something a lot better to be honest."

What I really loved was its unapologetic social commentary on authoritarianism and freedom. The film isn't afraid to tackle big, complex ideas. Hugo Weaving is outstanding as V, managing to convey so much emotion and charisma without ever showing his face-his voice and body language are just perfect. Natalie Portman is also fantastic, giving a raw and emotional performance. The film's stylized action and memorable dialogue make it a riveting experience, but it's the core message about rebellion and fighting for what you believe in that really sticks with you.Is it a remake of another film? No, ""V for Vendetta"" is not a remake of another film. It is a film adaptation of the ten-issue limited comic book series of the same name by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, published between 1982 and 1989.Is it worth watching? Yes, it is absolutely worth watching. It's a compelling and visually striking film with a powerful message.

mihai-sandu,"Mar 8, 2023",10/10,"I see tons of reviews going over one version of the movie that is fluttered in front of the audience like a bull fighter would do with a piece of red cloth all while hiding his true weapon. Shockingly this is not (only) about a fight against tyranny. It is about relinquishing your freedom on an artificial fear. Fear fabricated, fanned via media, profitable, and in the end generating the tyranny. It is funny, as the movie is 15 years ahead of time. Alas, for its true story the audience needs to pay attention, let aside the so easy to see and follow surface. For me, even at its time, this was a masterpiece. On par with so many gems hidden in other movies that will masquerade as action movies just to have again a hidden clever side (Winter Soldier..)"

The storyline follows a tyrannical British Parliament that controls the news, societal television and rules the streets with tight curfews. A man emerges the government calls a terrorist but some believe he could be a hero to free the people. A young lady named Eve gets caught in the middle between her job at the television station and the efforts of the ""terrorist.""This movie is directed by James McTeigue (The Raven) and stars Hugo Weaving (The Matrix), Natalie Portman (Leon: The Professional), Rupert Graves (Sherlock), Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), Stephen Fry (Gosford Park) and John Hurt (Alien).This storyline is absolutely magnificent with intricate storylines, subplots and characters. The setting and circumstances are well presented and the action scenes and choreography are first rate. The costumes were excellent and the cinematography was beautiful. The acting is well done and the cast perfectly selected.Overall this is an underrated gem and one of the greatest comic book movies ever made. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
thomasgouldsbrough,"Mar 14, 2022",9/10,"V for Vendetta is a wonderful dystopian film. The film makes it's own world, and thus it's own identity. V's opening speech is nothing short of a masterpiece. The majority of his words begin with the letter V, and it's such good fun pausing the film ever second, and looking it up in the dictionary. It's such a shame that he didn't speak in this way for the rest of the film. The action sequences are decent, the tension builds up really well, the reveal of V's identity is really well written, and just generally it's a solid film.However, the film wasted too much time with Natalie Portman and V's relationship. Out of all the aspects of the film they could have focused on, this was the least entertaining. It could be argued however, that this focus was due to the idea that their love was interesting, as Natalie Portman didn't need to know V's identity to love him, and instead she was in love with his world view.All in all, V for Vendetta is a very good film. It's certainly not the greatest film of all time, but it's well worth a watch."

Why would have V done something like that.

There was no Batman/Bryce Wayne, there was only V and because of that it made him more of a myth and much more intriguing for what he stood for.Vengence is in the title, but it so much more than that with a deeper meaning that rivals some of the best in Hollywood.

Suppose you gather groups of people by the millions to overtly support your enterprise, wrapped in gloss and foreshadowing. Suppose you decide to make it humorless and obvious; and to make it whole and logical not because it is those things but because your confidence makes its seem so.Well, you'd have what this film has built itself against. But you'd also have what this film is.Will we never learn? Do the brothers suppose they aren't paving the way for simplistic munchkin politics? If you want a subversive film, go to Greenaway.Yet, I can admire how this thing is put together. It is highly cinematic visually even though most of the thing is talking. But even that is tricky because the talker is behind a mask, so we largely invent the images in our own minds, prompted from time to time with inserted visions.The first half is the Count of Agatha Cristie, where we are presented with an old fashioned detective story except presented from the criminal's perspective. Serial killings are ticked off and we want to know why. Though we follow the killer, our inquiries are handled by the on screen detective.This is followed by an ""Oldboy"" segment, a radical shift, perhaps equally well done. And then we shift into ""Irreversible"" mode as we slide into the sappy movieland happy ending. Fireworks.Along the way, we are pounded with self-reference to video media: our heroine and her pal work in TeeVee. The central Valerie character is a filmmaker who incidentally creates the film we are watching indirectly by writing it on toilet paper and passing it as if behind a mask.Our hero is motivated by a certain old movie. Until the very end, we only see our political nemesis on a huge video screen, as his millions of victims do.This IS worth watching, but only for the way it is constructed.

dapederson,"Dec 20, 2018",7/10,"V for Vendetta is very fun, upbeat, and entertaining. It's signature flaw is that it wants to be subversive, bold, and thoughtful, but it's more or less worthless on an intellectual level. Every point it makes is obvious and surprisingly averse to controversy. It contradicts itself on whether the ends should justify the means. It passes itself off as progressive by spending most of its runtime attacking right-wingers, in spite of the fact that it seems to be advocating libertarianism. It attacks cults of personality as the audience revels in V's awesomeness. I'd recommend it purely on an entertainment level, but I find it annoying when people make the film out to be meaningful."

tiarings,"Jul 31, 2006",N/A,"It's just so typical of dumb asses on the IMDb to overrate this tired, badly written piece of nonsense. The overuse of bad explanatory speeches/ dialogue combined with its simplistic didacticism really grated - the film offered a cheesy crash course in political subversion/ rebellion for cretins. The love story was irrelevant, sentimental and completely uniteresting because the charcterisation was so lame - princess amrilla's character was nothing more subtle than the pretty scared girlie who grows a political conscience and a bit of courage. The direction and editing were hackneyed, dull and predictable. The photography was stunningly flat and badly framed, just boring -take the shot of the English people watching telly - it was like a particularly tedious Kodak moment from a family album."
McHenry,"Oct 6, 2006",6/10,"After watching this movie, I had to agree with an earlier posting which stated that this movie didn't really present a believable totalitarian regime. When the troops stormed in after the Benny Hill skit, I half expected the bloke to blurt: ""How dare you barge in here during tea!??!"" You need to present a really dour, Machiavellian political atmosphere, where all sense of personal freedom is removed. Where the threat of brutalities is as horrifying as the brutalities themselves. Characters with muted personalities, indicating fearful oppression, but yet moments of humanity peeking through (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Handmaid's Tale, THX 1138) and the hero should begin like all the others, no different than they are, except for a courageous ability to rebel. For as long as there is even only one defiant character, the world is saved. There hasn't been a movie like that in a long time. Just look at what they did to the remake of 'Rollerball' - I'm afraid to see what they'll do to 'Logan's Run'."
lordfoom,"Oct 11, 2007",1/10,"This flicker is badly acted, with hammy dialog and horrible alterations to the comic. If you liked the comic, don't watch this movie. If you like movies, don't watch this movie. All I ask as a viewer is that the movie respect its viewers and itself. This movie is vile, which is a real pity, because it could have been really interesting. The source material certainly is and, no, I don't expect movie adaptations to stick 100% to their source material (like Sin City, which, let's face it, was wooden). I don't expect to be written down to, though. Though I should have expected that Hollywood would remove all the sophistication and cleverness they could lay their hands on. Gah. The dialog. The dialog. Lord help me, the dialog.Oh, yeah: the costume was cool."
casterbridge,"Jun 28, 2006",10/10,"I'm sorry that I can't focus on the movie, but a great movie I think should bring up things other than the story itself.Just like a friend of mine said, any government who bans this movie, it must be a government just like the one in the movie. Unfortunately, the government of my country, PR China is one of them.It's just what they do, although not so explicitly. Everyday, Chinese police censor all kinds of political sensitive content we can reach, put away brave-enough-to-speak journalists like Shi Tao, they even put up a project called Red Shield to control the Internet, which we always believed to be non-controllable.In China, we have never seen a TV show that makes fun of the God like leaders, cause all the so called People's media were never people's. And what we citizens usually do? Just like what they do in the movie, eating, fncking and and shutting.Thank God(every God we people believe in) there is still a country called United States, whose people haven't yet felt tired to remind us of how we should be living."
lee_eisenberg,"Aug 26, 2006",10/10,"When ""V for Vendetta"" came out, maybe reviews called it the first pro-terrorist movie of the post-9/11 world. And seeing what kind of society the movie portrays, it's hard not to sympathize with the terrorist (or is he a freedom fighter?).The movie portrays an arch-totalitarian England sometime in the future. Because of the wars waged by the United States, the whole world exploded into war, the US got reduced to a third world country, and the fascistic Adam Sutler (John Hurt) seized power in England. Imposing devout Christianity on everyone, he rules with the slogan ""England prevails!"".However, Sutler's days just might be numbered. A masked man known only as V (Hugo Weaving) seeks to overthrow this dictator on November 5, to commemorate Guy Fawkes trying to blow up parliament. V had gotten disfigured some years earlier from an explosion in a chemical plant where he was a test subject, and thus wears this mask.One night, V rescues young Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from Sutler's thugs, and slowly but surely draws her into his world of rebellion. As it is, Evey has a reason to go along with V: her parents were political activists murdered by Sutler's forces. So what will this all come down to? I must say that this movie really draws you in. While uneasy about supporting terrorist activity, one realizes that there's no alternative. Naturally, that brings up the issue of the current state of the world. Is Sutler Bush, we may ask. (No, Sutler actually has a brain.) I think that my favorite line in the movie is ""We report the news, not fabricate it. That's the government's job."" All in all, this gives movies based on graphic novels a really good name. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. Also starring Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry and Tim Pigott-Smith."

dazza-moffff0,"Jan 31, 2025",10/10,"V for Vendetta (2005) - A Chilling Prophecy That Becomes Reality (10/10)Few films stand the test of time, but V for Vendetta has transcended mere entertainment to become an urgent warning-one that rings louder in 2025 than ever before. When this film was released in 2005, many dismissed its dystopian vision as fiction. But now, under the grip of an ever-expanding left-wing surveillance state, where censorship is law, freedom is a relic, and the global elite tighten their control under the guise of safety, the film's message has never been more relevant.Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel and deeply inspired by Orwell's 1984, V for Vendetta paints a picture of a society ruled by fear, where the government controls speech, thought, and even the truth itself. Sound familiar? As the global cabal pushes its agenda-erasing independent thought, demonizing dissent, and manufacturing crises to justify their overreach-the parallels between fiction and reality have become terrifyingly clear.Hugo Weaving's performance as V is nothing short of legendary, embodying the spirit of resistance with poetic brilliance. Natalie Portman delivers one of her most compelling roles, as her character, Evey, transforms from a fearful bystander into a symbol of defiance. Every line of dialogue, every masked act of rebellion, pulses with raw, unfiltered truth.But the true power of V for Vendetta lies beyond its cinematography, performances, or action sequences. It is a call to wake up. To remember that governments will always seek more control, and that power is never given back willingly. To remind us that when oppression reaches its peak, the people must rise.In a world where truth is labeled misinformation, where history is rewritten in real-time, and where obedience is enforced through social and financial manipulation, V for Vendetta is no longer just a film-it's a mirror. It's a prophecy fulfilled. And above all, it's a reminder that the people have one weapon the ruling class fears most: the idea that they can say no.10/10-because this film is not just relevant. It is essential."
Camera-Obscura,"Jan 11, 2007",N/A,"What a frustrating experience this was.A pseudo-historical philosophical hotchpotch slowly unfolding into a film with an alarmingly nihilistic resolution, that completely undermines the film's initial outlook. Some images are pleasing to look at, but the film's philosophy is incredibly pretentious, with some gratuitous references to Shakespeare and Goethe's Faust along the way, that have no bearing to the story at all. The main character is V, for which Hugo Weaving provided the voice, who looks like a 21th century reincarnation of The Count of Monte Christo. He is constantly - when not wreaking havoc on other people - proclaiming various philosophical cliché's, supposedly referring to totalitarianism or tyranny. Very annoying and they might as well have used a computer for his voice since his lips aren't moving.The film is totally deprived of humor or even the slightest wit or irony, as one can expect from the Wachowsky brothers. For me, this overbearing seriousness is killing. Do these guys ever laugh?V (for Vendetta) has rather dubious and elitist views on how to ""liberate"" the commoners from tyranny, let alone in his relations with Evey. He even tortures her in a specially built cell to force his viewpoint upon her. I thought our hero was supposed to fight these practices. He's worse than the system he's fighting against. I'd rather live under the reign of chancellor Hurt than under V's, with all his bombast and self-righteous flowery speeches about the world we live in.Hardly a thoughtful film. Makes you wonder what audience the makers had in mind. As an action flick is disappointing, as drama it's hopeless. The performances don't really matter for the total lack of material to work with here, but even in this department it fails. Nathalie Portman cultivates a strange BBC-broadcasting accent and gives another bad performance. Stephen Rhea does his mumbling police inspector thing again (how often has he played these kind of roles?). He's not bad, but why is a simple police inspector put in charge of stopping a threat that could put the whole world order upside-down? What kind of character is this anyway? Stephen Fry as a TV-presenter is the only one to breath some live into his character.As a political allegory, it's nothing more than postcard philosophy, completely trivial. Perhaps the Wachowsky brothers should stick to making action flicks like THE MATRIX wherein their wretched views of reality and fiction belong. With this film, they exposed themselves as two little boys with the basic understanding of a twelve-year old. Depressing.Camera Obscura --- 3/10"

But then it's just boring, and she's definitely not likable in this Evey character.And when the ad uses ""from the directors of MATRIX"" etc etc, I'm definitely expecting something more. From the trailer, I'm expecting a Sci-Fi action thriller.

jonbg,"Mar 14, 2006",1/10,"I have just seen this at a private screening and was hoping for great things. The general consensus was - How on earth did this get made??? 'V' is easily the longest 2 hours 10 minutes I've ever spent in a cinema. The whole thing is very short on action, and ridiculously long on tedium. A colleague I saw it with - an apolitical Australian - dubbed it 'The worst film I have ever seen..' He wasn't alone.Where to start?1/. Well, FOUR script writers. And not one of them with a decent writing credit to their name. Yes, I know there are loads of sad guys with no girlfriends out there, who think The Matrix is a work of mystical genius. It isn't. It is a film that stupid people think is clever. 'V' is the same, but without the good bits. I haven't read the comic novel on which it's based, but I understand the author has disassociated himself from it. AFter five minutes you can see why. From the off we are hit with ranting, heavy-handed, pretentious, meaningless drivel masquerading as commentary or satire, or allegory? God only knows. But given the hysteria of the writing teams' message, you wonder what sort of government such rabid parochialists would form given the chance.. What is obvious, after an interminable first third is: THE SCRIPT IS A MESS. The writers cannot tell a story and leave vast holes in the plot. My guess is they had neither the money, nor the will, to hire a decent script doctor. It would have been expensive.2/. Hugo Weaving in a rubbish mask is irritating after two minutes. After two HOURS, you've lost the will to live. 'Hey Larry (and the other one). PLASTIC MASKS CAN'T ACT. They're static, and in movies, static=boring. But even his fight scenes were badly choreographed and badly directed.3/. The whole film looks like it was made for TV. The first scene has a set like a 1970s Hammer horror. We in Britain were used to this sort of thing 20 years ago. Is London supposed to be desolate and oppressed as it would be under a totalitarian regime? If so, what was the production designer doing?4/. What year is it set in? It's meant to be 20-30 years in the future and yet the police are still using old Dell computers, driving five year old Rovers and using current mobile phones. Details like these added to the veneer of cheapness.5/. Plot. In Wachowskis' England there is one family, one grotty pub, two policeman who live in an office, five politicians and this girl - Ms Portman - whose parents have been killed by an evil totalitarian government because they protested against the war or something. But the government are bioterrorists experimenting on dissidents until one day there's a big explosion (not sure why) and then a nerve agent kills 100,000 people, (or is it 80,000, we get told both figures) which is falsely pinned on Muslim extremists and then John Hurt becomes Hitler on a chat show and we've still got an hour to go..... I MEAN IT IS SO MUCH JUVENILE RUBBISH. How old are these writers?6/. Actors. Natalie Portman. Yes, she does a perfectly decent job with a script so full of holes and containing so many terrible lines you actually feel for her. Her accent was fine and I hope she got paid well for this, because she is at sea with this ludicrous script. Scarlett Johanssen and Bryce Dallas Howard - count yourselves lucky. John Hurt is great in these sorts of roles (Contact) Here he was terrible. One dimensional, shouty nonsense does not a performance make. Not in the least bit convincing, or unlikeable. The other bit part actors were pretty low rent, you don't even see them on TV in the UK. Even Stephen Rea was laughable on occasion.7/. OK, what is the point? Governments are evil? Totalitarianism is a bit unpleasant? Revolution will save us all? Or worse - and I think this is what our angst-ridden writers are getting at - 9/11 was a Bush plot. How original. Simplistic, Hollywood liberalism is eating itself alive right there, up on the screen.....8/. Cheap, cheap, cheap. 'V' for Vendetta cost $50m. Natalie aside, the acting is so second rate you know the budget didn't go there, the production values were sub made for TV standard, there are no Matrix sfx to speak of, so I guess the cash went on blowing up the Houses of Parliament (still not quite sure why) and shutting down St James' on a Monday night. $50m is cheap by Batman Begins standards. But it looks like it cost half that. And BB is a ten times the film this mess is. The good side? It will make money for fat Joel and his band tedious fat cats.9/. Do we really need a movie for spotty, Chomsky groupies? The downside of the web has been the growth of the conspiracy theory racket. This has always been lucrative Wachowski territory and their constituency will flock to this nonsense and proclaim it a work of genius. For these people, movies like this aren't really entertainment, they are a confirmation of their own simplistic, childish beliefs in scenarios created out of low self-esteem, paranoia, social failure, limited intellect and laziness. This one's for them.10/. V for Vendetta commits the greatest crime in movies. It is boring. Bad story telling is boring. Bad preaching is boring, bad acting is boring. This has all three. I was a guest at the screening I saw so I couldn't leave, and had to watch the whole thing. Someone behind me summed it up. With 30 minutes to go, they hissed 'For the love of God. End now.'"
sac-09612,"Oct 30, 2021",10/10,"March 1982, I bought that first edition of 'The Warrior' from a local shop in south London.This was the first time that I encountered the genius that is Alan Moore.Enraged by Thatcher's destruction of the status quo, and high handed approach, he wrote V. The grainy black and white strip belied the complexity of the wordsmithery. There is pure venom in the script.I kind of wish that this movie was in grainy black and white, so that I could once more experience the explosive effect that comic had on me.Moore went on to write wonderful strips, like Watchmen and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen that played with and remade the format for a grown up late century audience.But V is where it all starts."

Norman_French,"Feb 29, 2024",9/10,"After the Matrix Trilogy, the Wachowski Brothers (as they were known then) teamed up with Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) and Natalie Portman to make this incredible film, which remains a personal favorite.I rewatched it (now, in 2024) to write this review, and it hasn't aged a day. If anything, it's more relevant than ever, given the anti-totalitarian theme. There are so many lines I could quote, but I'll limit myself to one:""Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Creedy. And ideas are bulletproof.""The power of ideas and their relationship to freedom and liberty are central to the film. SO central, in fact, that the face of ""V"" is never shown (except for the odd back-lit glimpse), as that would distract from the message.I could write more, but seriously, you're better off watching the film. The dialog (and symbolism) is THAT good.This is an important movie. I hope you choose to watch it."
paulclaassen,"Mar 2, 2024",8/10,"Hugo Weaving stars as anti-hero protagonist V, a masked man destined to bring down a corrupt government.'V for Vendetta' is a fictionalized story of Guy Fawkes, who was involved in a failed attempt to blow up the House of Lords in 1605. 'V for Vendetta' is set in modern times. The film starts with Evey (Natalie Portman) walking home at night after curfew, when she is approached by a bunch of unsavoury characters. V comes to her rescue and then invites her to ""an orchestra"". He arranged for fireworks and orchestral music to coincide with the demolishment of an old building.Having been spot on CCTV cameras, the police is now after Evey. Now, V helps her - in the most unconventional way - and she helps him in return, but little does she realize his motive is vengeance.I enjoyed the mystery as to V's identity and the fact we never got to see him without his mask, and I enjoyed the investigative element, as well. The film has a good production design and V's home is absolutely stunning. There's plenty of action and adventure, and the film has a great script with impeccable dialogue - so well spoken by Hugo Weaving. Both Hugo and Natalie Portman deliver fantastic performances. The film is also very well edited, and features good visuals."
knwgzz,"Nov 6, 2022",9/10,"I love the story about fighting against the totalitarian regime as a Chinese. Mr. Eleven got his third term, and tightened the restriction on every aspect of life. Like the Conservative Party in the movie, they conceal every truth that is bad for them, and make propaganda about the advantage their policies bring, sometimes even fake. I expected that we were moving towards a more and more free society, but it turns out the opposite. By the way, this movie was taken away from douban, aka the Chinese IMDb. I mean, they cannot tolerate a movie that tells people to be together and fight for their better future. That's the most ridiculous thing."
steve-27-258783,"Jan 30, 2016",6/10,"It's all pretty slickly made and the ideas portrayed are overall appealing, but I have problems with the story.First up, V has no problem killing people, potentially innocent people to further his cause. Ironic since that is why he is taking vengeance in the first place. He is in no way forgiving, like the government that he seeks to destroy. He is an extremist, like the government he seeks to destroy. Wars are always fort between 2 or more extremist.I would have like to have seen more focus on the ideas of racism and religious intolerance as these issues have been at the root of immeasurable violence, suffering and death throughout the ages up until recent times. Even today we have Donald Trump, potential leader of the most powerful nation on the planet declaring that he will ""Ban all Muslims from entering the country"", a scary and relevant real life occurrence of the totalitarian government portrayed in this movie.Also the phrase that he quotes ""By the power of truth, I, while living,have conquered the universe"" that he attributes to Fuast is wrong, a lie if you like. Again somewhat ironic that such a strong statement about truth is attributed falsely.On the positive side the ending showing all of the people standing up for change, peacefully is a good ending."
ahtishampro,"Jul 22, 2022",10/10,"One of the best movies I have ever watched. A pure gem! A masterpiece of art!The major theme of the movie is resistance against oppression and tyranny and struggle for rights and freedoms. It describes politics and its effects on human life, the relationship between the state and the individual, and the the political rights of the people. The protagonist of the movie practically demonstrates that ""When injusitce becomes law, resistance becomes duty."" He proves that one man can singlehadedly start a revolution and mobilise the people against oprression.In times when the authoriatnism and fascism is again encroaching upon the rights of the people, the democracy is on a backfoot and governments are becoming increasingly autocracic, this movies provides a hope. There is always a hope.My favorite quote: People should not be afraird of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."

And the action sequence near is kind of doing it's own sequel to the Matrix?*new* I watched this again and found what this truly lacks is the cinematic. The shot framing are not very inspiring, the story just moves along. The jail sequence is touching but done in a very simple way. Too simple when in fact that is the turning point.So I stand by my rating of 6. A good idea wasted on execution.

askbartholdy,"Nov 15, 2023",10/10,"A fantastic film with plot twists and suprises at every turn. It is truly hard to be original these days when so many ideas and fictional universes have been created over the past 150 years of artistic output, but V for vandetta succeeds at being orignal and suprising and still keep a level of simplicity that makes it enyojable for almost everyoneIts one of the all time greats in my opinion a lot of it due to its originality and its ability to throw the viewer of when you least excpect it.But also because it showcases a recurring truth thats seen in nearly all dictatorships both modern and old. Create fear and divition, take charge as the strong defender, remove the liberty and freedom of the oppisition and then the average citizen.It does all this and still manage to lift the spirit with well timed jokes and a magestic finish."
pulpficat,"Feb 4, 2024",9/10,"Directed by James McTeigue, this film is a rollercoaster of political intrigue, masked rebellion, and a vigilante out to bring down a tyrannical government in a future Britain that's not exactly winning any ""Best Place to Live"" awards.Set in a dystopian future, the story follows V, a masked vigilante with a knack for poetic dialogue and some serious acrobatic skills. Think Batman with a vendetta, and you're in the right ballpark. Hugo Weaving, despite hiding behind that iconic mask the whole time, delivers a performance that's both chilling and strangely charismatic.Natalie Portman plays Evey, the unsuspecting citizen swept up in V's chaotic plan to bring down a totalitarian government. Her character goes through some serious transformations from damsel in distress to a rebellious force, and Portman brings that mix of vulnerability and strength that keeps you cheering for her like you would for your friend who finally stands up to a bully.The film's visuals are a mix of gritty and stylized. From the iconic mask to the shadowy alleyways of a dystopian London, it's got this edgy aesthetic that's part comic book, part revolutionary propaganda poster. The action scenes are like a dance of destruction, and the iconic imagery of V standing tall amidst chaos is just as powerful as your favorite meme.V for Vendetta is a darkly thrilling and politically charged ride through a dystopian world. It's got twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat, and just when you think you've got it figured out, BAM! Another layer gets peeled back, like an onion you didn't know you were cutting. It's like a wake-up call wrapped in a superhero cape, and you'll be pondering the power of ideas and the consequences of living in a world that's both chaotic and controlled. It's a not-so-subtle critique of authoritarian regimes, surveillance states, and the power of symbols in inspiring rebellion. The parallels to real-world politics might hit you like a punchline, but it's all part of the ride."
Notbrainwashed,"Nov 5, 2023",10/10,"Very, very nice film. The actors, the script, the direction, the cinematography, the visual effects, all incredible and on point. Hugo Weaving gave it his all as V and it's unfair that he didn't win an award even though his face wasn't visible. V's personality is something charming and unprecedented that has no equal. Also very good performance by Natalie Portman even though she didn't excite me much. There is something poetic and quality about the whole film and I think that's a result of the very good work done by the production. Nothing seems poorly made.One of my favourite films and definitely one of the best films of all time."

For me I see this film as an agitator film, much like the Purge, Joker or Django, you know cinema created to stir the emotions and anger of the masses. Now every pansy has a Guy Fawkes mask in their bedroom to prove they rad and anti establishment. The Wachowski BROTHERS wrote this and when I see those names I know that there will be a story about an anti hero who saves the world from some sort of evil system. OK, kewl, just don't drink this kool-aid either, watch it for entertainment purposes only not as a political life style choice."
chera_khalid,"Sep 29, 2023",8/10,"V for Vendetta (2005), a cinematic revolution that captivated my heart and mind with its bold storytelling and powerful performances. Hugo Weaving's enigmatic portrayal of V, masked and mesmerizing, is nothing short of iconic. The film editing weaves a tapestry of political intrigue and explosive action, creating a narrative that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally satisfying. The strength of V for Vendetta lies in its timely and thought-provoking message, a rallying cry for resistance against oppression and the power of ideas. The music, especially the use of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, adds a symphonic layer to the revolutionary spirit. While some may find the narrative pacing a bit brisk, the relentless energy serves the film's purpose. Cinematography paints a dystopian landscape with a chiaroscuro elegance, capturing the essence of a world on the brink of change. At 8/10, V for Vendetta is a cinematic manifesto that not only entertains but inspires, leaving me in awe of its ability to ignite a fire for justice and freedom."

The whole picture is imbued with deep meaning. The film is intriguing and exciting. In one word - it's great!V remained a mystery to me. This is probably what the filmmakers wanted. Was he insane? Maybe. But that mystery only gives him more character.Natalie Portman is magnificent! I never doubted her acting talent, but how sincere she is in this film!I advise everyone to watch it. The film definitely sticks with you. Many thanks to James McTeigue for this masterpiece."
bob the moo,"Dec 11, 2006",N/A,"Evey Hammond is heading out after curfew when the Government's Finger Men catch her and decide to enact their own form of justice on her. Her only rescue comes in the form of a masked man in a cape. This man then proceeds to show her the destruction of the Old Bailey. The Government spring into action to spin the story, control the people and find the terrorist. The police track Evey from CCTV and head to her work place (the Government controlled television station) to detain her. ""V"" arrives before them and uses the emergency station to broadcast his own message of unrest, elevating his ""terrorist"" stance against the Government in a year long war that will culminate on the 5th November one way or the other.It probably helps to be in the UK to really appreciate what this film does well. I don't mean that in a snobby way but it is a success of the film that it produces a vision of the UK that is both futuristic but yet recognisable as our current condition. It does this most easily by visually mixing the design of homes and people's lives with all the trimmings of a totalitarian state but it also does it by making the links to our current political state of control and Government intrusion in the name of ""terrorism control"" and protection. Although it is only a year old, the film still shows a lot of foresight when viewed with hindsight and in doing so it produces an effectively bleak attack on our current political climate. It is effective mainly because it doesn't ever feel that far fetched thanks to the details but mainly thanks to the overriding themes of fear and control being used by a Government.The surprise and joy of finding this level of social commentary in a what appeared to be a Hollywood action movie helped cover up some of the weaknesses. Some viewers have complained about the lack of action in the film; personally I do not see this as a weakness because this is more to do with how the film was sold rather than how it was made. The weaknesses are minor and include the asks the plot makes in regards the ability of V to do what he does and how far-fetched some of it is etc but, like I said, these are covered by how relevant and interesting I found the story. The cast are mostly good. It took me a good twenty minutes to accept Portman's accent but after that she won me over. She is very much in the shadow of Weaving, who shows what a great voice he has by producing a wonderful character without a glimpse of his face throughout. Rea is a bit dour but he does convince as a worn-down public servant faced with the truth about his masters. Fry wasn't that good but does what he had to do in a small role. Hurt and Pigott-Smith are both very good; Hurt particularly convinced as the sort of person who rises to power and delivered convincing lines in a convincing manner  it is telling he has little screen time but a large impact. McTeigue direction was surprisingly good and he delivered the whole affair with a real downbeat air while I'm sure some pressure must have been on him to deliver a big budget action movie for the summer season. He is well supported by the designers behind the visuals.Those seeking action to compare with the Matrix (or even action) will feel let down and I can understand why  the trailers have talked up this side and talked down the social commentary side (and this is a damning verdict of how public tastes are viewed from Hollywood) but credit to the makers for producing a film that surprised me by how relevant it was. Over the coming years this will either become a thing of its time or more relevant than ever (I hope the former) but right now it is an effective story, told with the unreal air of graphic novel but with enough to link it to the present to keep it relevant. I was genuinely surprised by how good it was and how engaged I was by it."
Giugi1101,"Mar 13, 2022",9/10,"Very good movie with a great storyline, great direction and really really good acting. In general the film is entertaining and keeps a good pace for most of its duration, too bad for some parts that are a bit slow but pass well looking in general at the whole complex."
kosmasp,"Apr 21, 2007",7/10,"If you want to know who plays the man behind the mask, just look through the cast listed here. What I mean, are the ideals behind the man/mask. Because this movie has ""balls"". It does not shy away from a critical theme (which is terrorism) and does not pull any punches either.It's bold and it might leave you with a bad taste in your mouth or at least might make you reconsider a few things, you thought were right or wrong, before you watched this movie. If you haven't watched the movie yet, you might not understand what I've written, but you will after you watch it!I even wanted to rate this movie higher, but there is one part in the movie, that I didn't like at all and it just didn't feel right (I can't go further into that, without spoiling, I'm just going to say that, this happens, before one of our main characters ""changes"" her hair style), but being as it is, if you like the sort of films I described above, go watch this one too!"
Dragon_Eye_Morrison,"May 24, 2010",4/10,"Another movie based on Alan Moore's work, another failure in every way. Written by the geeks who created (and destroyed) the matrix franchise V tries so hard to be two things at the same time: an action movie and a socio-political commentary of sorts. It mostly fails at both, but specially at the second area.The premise of a single man taking over an entire government is not an easy premise to develop in a believable and convincing way. In the case of V we have a character that want's to revolt the masses to turn against the authorities. The problem with this script is that it never makes up it's mind on how it wants to present ""V"", he's a terrorist, but he's looking for revenge, he's a loony but he's sophisticated. At the end he's really just the charismatic Shepperd leading the flock. He's just another authority figure trading places with the other authority figures. He just happens to wear a very cool mask, and a suit full of knifes.The movie also has no idea what to do with all it's political commentary, how to aim it properly, how to give it any weight whatsoever. England is controlled by a cartoonish religious/fascist state, complete with an evil big brother guy in a big TV always throwing orders at his inept employees. Went it comes to dealing with V this forces of the law seem to be unable of doing even the most simple and logic task. How can a man that is searched by the entire state can ship a bunch of masks to thousands of people across the country? Using every-day shipping service?Once more, is not that the premise can't give us a good story, and good characters, is just that the wachachoskis have not even the slightest idea of how to handle the material. Other phony ""evil"" characters appear here and there, and at the end the entire logic of the movie is nothing more than a black and white picture where V is the good guy and the state is bad and that's it, there's your entire plot development right there. There's a very solid supporting cast doing what they can with the material. Sthepen Rea cringes at every line he spokes, Hugo Weaving at least has the mask to cover himself from the embarrassment. John Hurt hams it up, Stephen Fry brings some charm. Natalie Portman on the other hand gives yet another high-school-musical level of performance. This woman has nothing to do in front of a camera.Sure, watching stuff blow up with the 1812 overture is cool to watch, but when there's nothing to back up all those images then there's a big problem with the material. The wachowskis should never, ever try to write anything else in this vein again. Think of the children please."
gothic_hugh,"Jul 6, 2022",10/10,"This is no doubt one of the best movies of all time. Not only the people from authoritarian countries can enjoy it, but also those living in the democratic societies. The movie give us a warning about the infiltration of authoritarianism in our everyday life and how we can prevent ourselves of being poisoned by it. We should cherish the freedom that we have now and stand up to fight against everything that is related to authoritarianism. Our world can only be better when the authoritarianism ends."
dyanacazacu,"Feb 19, 2025",10/10,"V for Vendetta (2005) is a striking and timely film that blends dystopian themes with powerful political commentary. Directed by James McTeigue and written by the Wachowskis, the film is set in a near-future Britain where a fascist regime controls the government. The story follows V, a mysterious, masked vigilante on a mission to overthrow the totalitarian state, and Evey, a young woman drawn into his radical cause.Hugo Weaving delivers a memorable performance as V, his voice and presence conveying both the character's tragic past and his revolutionary zeal. Despite never revealing his face, Weaving's portrayal of V is both compelling and intense. Natalie Portman, as Evey, is equally captivating, skillfully portraying a woman torn between fear and admiration for V's cause, ultimately discovering her own strength.The film's strength lies not just in its action-packed narrative, but in its themes of freedom, oppression, and the power of resistance. The iconic imagery of V's Guy Fawkes mask, which has since become a symbol of protest and rebellion worldwide, is perfectly emblematic of the film's message. The film asks tough questions about the limits of government power, the nature of justice, and the price of freedom, making it feel as relevant today as it did when it was first released.The cinematography, score, and sharp script all work in unison to create a tense, immersive atmosphere. V for Vendetta is not just a thrilling action film, but a thought-provoking exploration of political ideals and the ways in which individuals can fight against oppression.While the film can be seen as a call for revolution, it's also a cautionary tale about the costs of that revolution and the consequences of unchecked power. It's a film that inspires action, reflection, and, most importantly, conversation."
naveenjoshi-51803,"Apr 28, 2022",8/10,"This movie is great. It incorporates action with ideas of government and justice. I cant talk about this movie much without it talking about spoilers but what I can say is that this movie has great performances, great plot, great characters, great cinematography, and overall a great comic book movie."
Washikami,"Mar 26, 2025",10/10,"The 2005 film V for Vendetta, directed by James McTeigue and based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, is a compelling political thriller that explores themes of oppression, revolution, and the power of ideas. Set in a dystopian future where a totalitarian regime controls every aspect of life, the film follows a masked vigilante known as V, who seeks to dismantle the government and inspire the people to reclaim their freedom.At its core, V for Vendetta is a powerful commentary on authoritarianism and the dangers of unchecked governmental control. The film warns against the consequences of fear-driven governance, where personal freedoms are sacrificed in the name of security. It challenges viewers to question the structures of power and recognize the responsibility individuals have in shaping society.Another key theme is the resilience of ideas. Throughout history, revolutions have been fueled not just by force but by powerful ideologies. V's iconic mask becomes a symbol of resistance, proving that even in the face of oppression, ideas can be bulletproof. The film highlights the importance of critical thinking and the courage to stand against injustice.Ultimately, V for Vendetta serves as a thought-provoking reflection on the nature of freedom and the cost of complacency. It urges viewers to remain vigilant in the protection of their rights and to remember that true change begins with those brave enough to challenge the status quo. The film's message is a timeless reminder that even in the darkest of times, hope and resistance can spark a revolution."
Turanic,"Sep 2, 2021",9/10,"Where do I even start, I know two films which somewhat accurately rhymed with the future, The first is ""Lone gunmen"" first episode, the second one is this. In 2006 this film probably wanted to reflect Irak/Afganistan war result, but in 2020 it reflects something different, it pretty much reflects what the modern world and society came to. You have conservative government elected which pushed despotic rules over society and you have a deadly virus that spread over nation, you have companies profiting from vaccine and you have the government imposing freedom restriction. You have civil war closing on US. You literally have a whole package of 2020-2021 and it feels as if it was filmed yesterday. People can only dream of blowing up parliament. The whole blowing up parliament scene is more of a symbol that people had enough, in 2021 that symbol might be Bitcoin ..."
bmw1493,"Jul 1, 2025",9/10,"V for Vendetta takes a theme that's been done many times before and pulls it off better than most. The idea of a revolutionary fighting against a corrupt government is nothing new, but this version feels sharp, thoughtful, and fully realized.Hugo Weaving gives an incredible performance as V, even without ever showing his face. He brings presence, emotion, and a real sense of purpose to every scene. Natalie Portman is also great. Her character goes through a lot over the course of the film, and she handles it all in a way that feels grounded and believable.Despite the heavy subject matter and dystopian setting, it's a movie that's easy to come back to. It has something to say, but it also knows how to deliver a compelling story.V for Vendetta is bold, memorable, and one of the most well-executed films in its genre."
abrondz,"Oct 29, 2009",N/A,"While watching V for Vendetta recently, I couldn't help getting a distinct feeling I'd seen something very similar before. And I had, it was a few months earlier and it was called 1984.1984 isn't as easy to grasp as V for Vendetta. You need to go into the plot to understand what's going on. V for Vendetta makes that a whole lot easier by adding a villain which anyone can get to know and a main character who goes from being conformist to oppositional through the course of the film. In addition there is an ultimate goal instead of the entire film just being a description of life in an completely authoritarian state.This is all very nice, unfortunately V for Vendetta fails to impress.The symbolism of November 5th is at times taken too far. Despite the entire plot being built around Guy Fawkes and the blowing up of the parliament, the reasons behind it are too weak to make an entire film out of it. Having said that, I'm sure films have been built on less. Furthermore, the idea of a villain who's there to save the world, or in this case, Britain, has been severely worn out by now. As always, the villain is hiding behind a mask. Why?All in all, if you liked and understood ""1984"", you'll be disappointed."
rabczukt,"Oct 19, 2021",10/10,This movie couldnt been made in this strange times. I deeply belive that it will be forbiden for few years.Heads up brothers and sisters for 5 november silver short sqeeze!
chrisoddshoes,"Dec 2, 2020",10/10,"Watching for the second time on 2020-12-02 (I saw it in 2006 when it first came out and really rated it then) I found the parallels with today's events particularly chilling. Look at 58:30 masked scientists injecting the poor with a vaccine against a plague, particularly spine chilling. Just read Phillip K Dick or Asimov to see how science fiction foreshadows fact!"
AlsExGal,"May 5, 2013",8/10,"The idea of a terrorist as a popular hero, the irony of John Hurt who played Winston in ""1984"" playing the dictator, and the further irony of Stephen Rea who played a terrorist in ""The Crying Game"" playing the relentless cop who is now hunting a terrorist for the totalitarian regime were all braver ideas than I am accustomed to seeing coming out of Hollywood in the 21st century.The acting is commendable. It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act. Plus, Hugo Weaving had a real challenge to project a personality behind the Halloween mask he wore throughout the film with mere body language and the inflection of his voice. I think it was a challenge that he met admirably.I guess the one thing that really bothered me was the basic premise of the film. Having just read ""While Europe Slept"" I find it difficult to believe that the United States would end up self destructing by ever managing to be more politically correct than any country in Europe, including Great Britain. I also find it hard to believe that religious fundamentalism would ever take root in England, since its language and ways would seem foreign to almost the entire citizenry. After all, the entire continent of Europe has been in a post-Christian era for about the last one hundred years. Nobody in Europe would even understand what the dictator was talking about when he delivered one of his religious rants - he might as well be reciting Shakespeare backwards.Instead, this film looks more and more like a futuristic vision of the U.S., and not even that futuristic. I can easily see a theocratic fascist regime set up in the United States, citizens hassled endlessly by security forces over minor infractions of countless rules, and Americans just sitting back and taking it. Europeans would be more likely to protest under these circumstances than Americans, in particular if you could convince large numbers of them that it was ""God's will"" or it was for the sake of ""national security"". Mix Calvinism with an extreme form of nationalism and you've got a recipe for exactly what happens in this film. In the U.S. we have plenty of both."

drivingat120km,"Mar 19, 2006",10/10,"This is the absolute ""GOD"" of anarchy movies. This movie is intelligent, sleek, new and creative and totally violent, it can appeal to everyone (unless your in love with Hitler or even the government now). It takes place in the mid to late 00's, the only notification on time is a paper that is written awhile ago when the government started taking over which is dated at 2015 (although the original comic took place during 1997-98). This new version of the Nazi's even have there own symbol but unlike the swastika this new symbol isn't a Hindu good luck charm it's more of a cross with an extra horizontal line. V for Vendetta is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd with the same name. The story revolves over the next rain of a fascist government, though Jews are never mentioned, they pick on Muslims and homosexuals mostly. The government is in complete control and makes sure the people keep thinking that they need them.Code name ""V"" is the main character and as you may have guessed he has set out a Vendetta on the people that have ruined his life and the government who is ruining other people's life's. He's a sword wielding terrorist (a terrorist that you root for!) who dresses like Guy Fawks and quotes Shakespeare. He longs for things the government has kept from the public such as art, freedoms, music and literature. He follows Guy Fawks's plan and does all of his destruction on November the fifth. Hugho Weaving plays ""V"" and should win a golden glob or an Oscar, his performance should not be missed. Then there's Evey, played by Natalie ""Mrs.Skywalker"" Portman who's had a life full of tragedies but still follows the powers blindly. Until ""V"" influences her to rise against the oppression. Mr.Finch, played by Stephen Rea, is the police officer who tries to catch ""V"" but while trying to find him discovers some tight lidded secrets. And of course there's the leader, Adam Sutler, played by, John Hurt, and has a hair cut just like, Hitler.A completely astonishing movie which teaches us about the power of one and what we can accomplish. It also teaches us to question our leaders and not to believe the media, because they are all owned by people with ties to the government and only give their point of view. Best movie I think I've ever seen, complete thumbs up, this movie covers every emotion and does it well. This is how a movie should be made and will become a classic that in 30 years people will still remember remember the fifth of November.... and this movie. (too bad they didn't release this movie on the 5th of November but maybe it will come out on video on the fifth)"

lloyd-42,"Mar 25, 2006",N/A,"*** May contain Spoilers *** This movie was a pleasure in a great many ways. One of my indicators for the greatness of a movie is how it does when I think about it after the fact and my fondness for this one only grows with the passage of time.There are many things worth saying about this movie, but much of it has been well said by others. I want to say something in response to those that seem to miss the mark when considering the underlying point to be gleaned from this.First, this movie is not an attack on U.S. policy. To think that it is is to take a garment off the rack and claim that it was specifically cut to fit just one customer. This is about regular people living under an increasingly oppressive and tyrannical regime and one man being the catalyst to try to get them past their fears enough to stand up for what they believe is right.Second, I do not see that this movie is about a terrorist. I see a terrorist as attacking the innocent along with those perceived as guilty. ""V"" did not do that. He attacked icons of the administration and those that were specifically known by him to be guilty of heinous crimes.His efforts were to free people from their fears. This was done on a group level with the city as a whole, and an individual, ""Evey."" He also did not press his ideas on the unwilling. He left ideas to those who could respond to them. In all cases he wanted people to be freed from their fears and he had no desire to simply replace one set of fears for another. He wanted them to be free. Hence, he left them a choice, which is necessary for there to be freedom in the first place. Terrorists do not want to free you from slavery. They want you to change masters. Terrorists do not want you do be without fear. They want you to fear them. ""V"" made his building bombings a spectator sport. They were not done to cause fear in the people, just in the government.This is a wonderful film and I think that some that have seen it should reconsider their idea on its point."
Chris_Docker,"Mar 14, 2006",6/10,"V for Vendetta throws together a remarkable melange of elements, bringing them together in an attempt to be overtly political. We have a dystopian future, an England ruled by a Hitler-lite version of the worst of Blair and Thatcher's governments (multiplied to a horrifying degree); a slightly crazy Guy Fawkes -style figure (V) who is conducting a vendetta against those who kept him in a detention centre; a mild-mannered heroine, Evie, who is almost gang-raped at the hands of corrupt government thugs; and a rather lovable Stephen Fry playing a closet homosexual TV producer.What was originally a comic-strip, updating an Orwellian tale of revolt against an authoritarian government to the eighties, has become a movie that updates the same themes to the present day. There's mention of rendition, an all-male cabinet that hearkens only to its leader, extensive use of 'spin', people detained without trial, secret police putting hoods over people's heads Guantanamo bay style, and most importantly the theme of 'terrors that we all face' as an excuse for government clamp downs and erosion of freedoms. For people pulling their hair out over the antics of Bush and Blair, V for Vendetta must seem like great fun in true liberal tradition. Indeed, there's a very intelligent film there somewhere  but this isn't it.In one scene, Portman (Evey) is about to be abused to the extent she will wish she had never been born. The masked and near-invincible V appears, slays her attackers, and treats her to a barrage of alliteration in which whole paragraphs use words starting with the letter 'V'. Thankful for her deliverance, she is wondering if she has been rescued by a mental case, but V demonstrates some of his pre-arranged demolition jobs set to music. As terrorists go, he's the thoughtful kind, respectful and artistic. Yet any considered analysis of the film gives us little help in deciding whether V is a true hero, saving the nation, or just someone with a heavy personal vendetta that might have the side-effect of getting rid of the bad guys. V's hero, Guy Fawkes, was not a liberator, even though he wanted to blow up parliament (as does V)  he was a Catholic dissident who wanted to destroy the Protestant aristocracy by blowing up the House of Lords and killing the reformer King James I. V wants to overthrow the government not because they are bad, but because they hurt him (and his family) personally, and is quite happy to murder extravagantly and with a certain panache. The two aims do overlap though, and he realises Evie must play a crucial part as the representative of more regular society.The (Matrix) Wachowski Brothers, who wrote the screenplay, indulge their love of literary association by referencing Shakespeare and the Count of Monte Cristo extensively. The use of colour is striking, jumping from violent red and black to smudgy warm interiors with artistic treasures or the white utilitarian rooms of plebeian offices. Natalie Portman's acting is tolerable, but the film's weakness is that it fails to convey any sense of reality, whether as a believable future society, a symbol of modern day ills, or a political thriller. We are left with the Watchowskis' portmanteau of assorted skills thrown together in an inadequate script, and central characters that add up barely as well as the Joker from Batman and Robin, but with the added baggage of trying to ride the crest of left-wing political comment films without having done the necessary homework. Bereft of its pretensions, V for Vendetta is just about acceptable fare for comic-to-film fans, but otherwise fails to rise above the mid water mark for a night's viewing. Like Superman before him, V is a hero who is portrayed as physically and emotionally emasculated, unable to have normal sexual relations, genetically modified with super strength and near invulnerability  a comic-book fan's wet dream. He ensconces himself in a fortress, venturing out as a god-in-a-cape messianic figure. But when the masses rally to support him in their look-alike masks, we can't help but wonder if they will be capable of instituting an intelligent democracy to replace the order that is overthrown. As a superhero, his philosophy has little to recommend it beyond listening to Julie London classics and imitating the Three Musketeers (unless we add a sympathetic ear for gays and lesbians). Bereft of V's remarkable powers, the pub-soaked working classes watching him on a TV screen seem to offer little hope for an enlightened future."
mitchabramson,"Sep 5, 2006",7/10,"It starts off with a testimony to the importance of free speech; i.e. IDEAS. The movie purports to show the power of that basis for all freedoms: the freedom to speak your ideas, your insights, your criticisms. Since these freedoms have been suppressed by a conservative-style government (anti-immigrant, homophobic, anti-Islamic, etc.) , kept afloat with the help of servile media, the answer lies in ""V"" as freedom-fighter. So far, so good - and it IS good, but where Hollywood (always) turns the blind eye is that IN REALITY, it is on the nation's liberal left campuses for example, that any opinion other than that of say, gay activists, is condemned as homophobic; any opinion contrary to unlimited abortion-on-demand is seen as anti-feminist; to oppose racial quotas is to be seen as ""racist."" The media is continually in the hip pocket of the left, and the IDEA of free-speech that ""V"" is championing are the very ideas liberal left-wingers will literally not allow to be spoken on campuses, in most Hollywood movies as well as the mainstream press. Having lived 4 years in the mideast, let me say it is obvious neither the Wachowski brothers, the director or the screenwriter had actually read the Koran, which they make a point of protecting from the angry xenophobic gov't. Had they done so, they would have seen that everything ""V"" id FOR is OPPOSED in a book that would suit well on any fascist's shelf. Mein Kamp would have been the same choice. Aside from turning real-world politics 180 degrees on its head, it's a fun movie that demonstrates Natalie Portman is the real-deal and hopefully we'll be seeing and hearing a lot more from her."

nilent,"Mar 24, 2006",10/10,"I don't need to say too much more if you've seen this...and if you haven't, there are literally hundreds of well written and well reasoned reviews here that should motivate your tail into a theaterThe bottom line is that this wonderfully entertaining and dare I say, enlightening, movie will be (after all is said and done) a FAILURE if it just gets forgotten in the dustbin of commercially successful media.I urge anyone who ""gets"" the message to become politically involved...and to do so at the grassroots fundamental levels as well as on the big sexy issues like Global Warming or the vaingloriously viciously vacuous venomous vehicle for vast profits known as the Iraq war.The grassroots level means actually registering and voting in EVERY election...by absentee ballot if you can't get to the polls......it means running for party committee person in your local precinct and ""taking over"" the county party apparatus so as to reflect a truly people oriented freedom oriented truly American (in the original Patrick Henry/Thomas Jefferson sense) set of values at the local levels of government. If we do this, if the millions of people who will see this nifty flick actually are inspired to GET EVOLVED in political action; then the movie (and us;-) will have served it's(our) higher purpose.Please make this work of art more than a merely entertaining diversion, let's use the emotions and the IDEAS in ""V"" to inform and motivate ourselves and others to commit nuts and bolts political activism!

Riatsila2-1,"Nov 29, 2020",10/10,"When I first saw this film over 10 years ago, I'd never have thought any of its themes of tyranny, governments lies & propaganda would become a reality but here we are in 2020 & we have all three. Frightening to think this film is now our reality. Film is a brilliant & superbly executed canvas and is such an important statement of how people can be mislead & lied to by those that are supposed to look after them. So many parallels to Britain under Johnson - lies about a virus, lockdowns, draconian laws, violence against peaceful demonstrations etc. A milestone"
Boba_Fett1138,"Aug 4, 2006",10/10,"Just like the main character itself, this movie is an icon, for fighting for freedom and liberty in the widest sense of the word.The movie is multiple layered, filled with symbolism and deeper meanings but with one clear main message in it; People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people. It shows that if enough people are behind something, things can be achieved. Even killing and acts of terrorism can be justified. As the character V's says it; A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. A symbol, in and of itself is powerless, but with enough people behind it, blowing up a building can change the world.The movie shows obvious interesting parallels to western leaders and governments but also that of the middle east and beyond. The parallels to the Hitler Nazi period were perhaps a bit too extreme and over-the-top to find it credible but in this case I can forgive the movie for that, since it still makes its point clear and works powerful as a thought provoking movie. For this movie truly is one of the most thought provoking movie of the last couple of decades. The movie forces us to use our minds constantly and makes us see how certain acts of violence can be used for the good cause and how symbolism and one act can inspire people for coming into action and to doing the right thing. Leaders shouldn't just be able to get away with everything they do.Almost every aspect of the word freedom is present in the movie. Some in a symbolic way, others in a more obvious way. Such as freedom of speech and censorship in the media, freedom of religion (some people see this movie is anti-Christian, quite frankly I really don't see why) and freedom of being able to chose your own sexuality and being able to do what ever makes you feel good and happy. The movie also shows interesting parallels with recent issues and issues from the past, from all over the world, such as the earlier mentioned censorship in the media, which still is the case in certain middle eastern and communist countries, the ex scandals in churches but also the use of violence and terrorism against a governments their own citizens, to control and and form the people. It's refueling the conspiracy theories that the American government itself was behind the 9/11 attacks, to put fear into the people so the government was more able to do the things their way and gain from it, by getting the people behind them and exploiting from the people's their fear. But also less recent issues such as performing medical tests on prisoners, in order to create a super-race and more Nazi like references. In other words, more than enough interesting parallels to make you think about the world we're living in today.What ""V for Vendetta"" also does well is mixing action entertainment with thought provoking, almost poetic like elements. In the essence the movie is still an action movie that is fast paced and has a fair amount of violence and fight sequences in it. The action sequences are shot spectacular and form some of the highlights of the movie. But of course ""V for Vendetta"" is far from your average 'superhero' movie, it's a too important and relevant movie for that.The characters are also symbolic. Of course the character of V is the best example of this. Behind the mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea and ideas are bulletproof. I quote V a lot, since everything he says in this movie is true, even when your initial thought might suggest otherwise. Evey is a character who begins as a normal person but slowly starts to becoming just a fearless, determent freedom fighter as V is. Inspector Finch is a normal cop who start to discover and see through the lies that his government, for which he works, spreads and he slowly begins to see the whole picture and V's true intentions. And Chancellor Adam Sutler is symbolic for basically every dictator that ever lived and ruled.The movie is a very good looking one. The cinematography by Adrian Biddle is truly spectacular and this movie was a worthy last picture for him. The special effects are also what makes this movie a really spectacular one.The acting is also of a very high order. Hugo Weaving is great, even though he wears a mask during the entire movie. He acts through his mask and manages to give the character an own personality, complete with working and sensible emotions in certain sequences. Natalie Portman is also great but it sort of makes you wonder why she was cast in this, since she isn't British. Her accent just doesn't sound right but I have to admit that she never looked any better in a movie. She is absolutely beautiful. It was also great to see Stephen Rea in a big production again. John Hurt convincingly plays the villainous dictator. Is there any role that John Hurt can't handle? He is a very versatile actors that has already played a wide range of different characters. Really amazing.But as a movie it is a rather flawed one to be perfectly honest. The story doesn't always flow and the character development and treatment is also lacking at times. It's obvious that James McTeigue still has a lot to learn when it comes to directing. But it however doesn't take away any of the movie its power or messages. The movie succeeds in what it tries to achieve and because of that I consider this movie as an absolute and important relevant masterpiece.See this movie for its action or its messages. Either way you'll be pleased.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
jeroen_vdb,"Mar 20, 2006",10/10,"Wow, went to see it with a bunch of prior feelings of oh god another crummy movie of 06 But believe me, if u want a movie that incorporates the following things: Fast Paced action, a good plot, humor, Nathalie Portman, and a good amount of criticism against totalitarian governments. Obviously it is a strike against current anti gay views, conservatism, etc. (sorry previous reviewer ... i tend to disagree and it doesn't hurt pushing the liberal agenda ... yes it is fiction but so is American Idiot by Green Day, that doesn't mean there is a message behind the fiction... or as they say in the movie: ""Artists use lies to tell the truth; Politicians use lies to cover it up"") ... Best movie in a while, hands down."
edwagreen,"May 20, 2007",6/10,"2018 and England is in the midst of a dictatorship by a crackpot who has brought death to 100,000 people by unleashing a virus and then blaming a dissident group for doing this.Natalie Portman, a gifted actress, stars in this mess. The film has a good premise with a totalitarian regime in England while the U.S. is having a civil war. It soon falls apart as the bodies begin to pile up. The man with the mask begins to bring revenge on all those who concocted the virus.The film is even a little bit silly and the ending is totally ridiculous.There is one good performance and that is by John Hurt as the lunatic ruler. Stephen Rea, who was so good in ""The Crying Game,"" plays a police officer who is trying to capture the terrorist with the mask.Portman looks like she has boozed, drugged and been through the mill. Unwittingly, she becomes an accessory to the masked man. When she denounces him, he imprisons her and then releases her. Along the way, we find out that her young brother was a victim of the virus and her parents were executed for their anti-government activities.Stop with the nonsense. Too much of the film is all so predictable. I upped the rating to **1/2 because of the premise of the film, but that's about it."
MAVS9010,"Oct 8, 2016",10/10,"It's a perfect story, too perfect for this world too imperfect. It was the first thing I thought while watching the movie, while living the world that is told by images. More than a film; a dream, a world, an utopia. A view that lacks technical appraisals, because the sensations reach beyond dogmatism, ""What is this? How can there be something so perfect in such an imperfect world?"". The shock remains until today, because the story went on to take the edges of me, of what I am, the ideas that this film conveys, freedom, truth, revenge, things of life itself. But the times, the effects, the views, it's poesy, it is theater, spooky, shocking. Until today, this is the best movie I have ever seen. Because movies are trips, and worlds, the movie itself sets up a world where I want to live, I want to live that revolution, I want to live that idealism."
dumassays,"Jul 2, 2006",7/10,"When I first saw the preview for this movie I was immediately disinterested because of the man in the mask. However after sitting down last night and watching it I was quite taken with not only the performances of Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Stephen Rea but the premise of the storyline.This movie is so out of the ordinary and frankly a bit weird that you are glued to every minute of it to see where the hell it's going. I found it started out somewhat slow, but its momentum picked up and never stopped straight through to the very memorable ending.Definitely rent this film, watch it with someone who doesn't like to talk throughout a movie, someone that can handle a decent conversation at the end, because this movie will almost certainly provoke dialog... consider the rule of any government who dictates through fear, be they democratic or otherwise.http://suggestamovie.com/"
fishmongerx,"May 6, 2006",5/10,"This movie is transparent simplified movie logic wrapped around mainly Equilibrium with a little bit of Zorro tied in. With all the great guts carved out and replaced with thinly-vield bombastic allegories and metaphors comparing the current administration to Nazi Germany. I do consider myself to be pretty solidly 'left field' politically--and who dosen't hate Bush, but wow... what brazen left wing propagandistic popcorn. I think a little bit of discretion and couth were definitely in order.The movie offers nothing new or original, except an extremely thinly veiled jab at the current administration and the direction its heading, dumbed down with 1 dimensional action hero movie logic and the tired old fight-the-power futuristic anti-totalitarian theme.Also, you can't make honest real world allegories while villainifying your subject to the point of ludicrousness.I had heard great things about this movie but watching it has left me scratching my head."
mhiggins-10,"Jan 24, 2006",8/10,"The mainly excellent casting and performances in this movie make up for it not quite capturing the bleak mood of Alan Moore's superb graphic novel. I feel for the makers, since they were never going to please everybody with this film (and they haven't tried to, thank God). Would have preferred to have someone unknown playing Evie, as although Natalie Portman is a good actress, I felt the part needed to be played by someone fresh and anonymous, and perhaps someone actually English to give it added authenticity That said, Portman's performance is fine and doesn't spoil the film in the way that some extremely wooden performances have ruined big films in the last few years (step forward Mr McGregor, guilty on at least two counts  The Island and Star Wars Episode III). Certainly much better than previous attempts at graphic novel adaptation. Let's see how Moore's magnum opus Watchmen turns out."
joolsthegreat,"Mar 18, 2006",10/10,"When I go to a movie, it's either to make fun of it or because I really have nothing else to do on Friday nights. Last night, I saw 'V For Vendetta' and I blown away. I didn't go to make fun of it of course, but I was just floored.The political satire was wonderful. Using Muslims and homosexuals as scapegoats for the things wrong with society and lying about searching for weapons so as to torture citizens in unknown prisons are parallels to today's America, even though the movie took place in the future in England. :) I was amused that the USA had been through a Civil War and was now a Leper Colony. That's a WONDERFUL future for the Americans, wouldn't you say? (I'm being sarcastic of course) I didn't care for some of the slow motion knife twirling, but even that was overpowered by V actually slicing someone. The great thing about this film is that it's almost unbelievable and ridiculous to a point, but because V represents all the people (as Natalie Portman's character states in the film) you feel sucked in and you love V as a hero, you want him to represent you.I also like how they did have some humor in the film. When Evey wakes up and goes into the kitchen, V is in a frilly apron making her breakfast. When he introduces himself to her in the street, his diction is made up mostly of words that have the lette v or begin with the letter v. He said it all so quickly and it was just amusing.I suggest this movie for anyone who is in the mood for some Bush-bashing, impressive action sequences, and damn good music."
aggietheo,"Apr 10, 2006",10/10,"This was an excellent drama akin to the stories of Brave New World or Fahrenheit 451 in its scathing indictment of those who rule through fear and force. I enjoyed the story and the characters immensely. Though you never see Hugo Weaving's face, his dialogue is masterfully delivered, both a charm and an inspiration all at once. Natalie Portman clearly delivers one of her most stunning performances and projects convincing emotion in her demonstration of an internal struggle. The writing for this project was well done and stands out as a remarkable work of drama whose powerful statements will continue to thrill and haunt you for years. Although I know the graphic novel it is based on was written as an indictment of the Thatcher administration, it nevertheless stands as a reminder to all people of all nationalities that freedom is earned and totalitarianism is given away."
E_Vernon,"Apr 22, 2006",10/10,"Astonishing. Easily the best film I've seen in my years. It combines create cinematography, writing, screenplay, and directing into a conglomerate of breathtaking film. This film makes you want to be involved, stand up, and see it again. Furthermore, it's a film that will stick with you.If you can go into this movie with an open mind and willingness to think and not just be spoon fed a story, you will fall in love with the piece the Wachowski's have brought to you. From start to finish you are engaged in a inspiring tale that uncovers just enough for you to figure out things by yourself. There are many times you can feel your whole body receive goosebumps, and many more times you can look around and see smiles or looks of worry on peoples faces around you in the theater.Do not be scared away by the mask, many people have said it's the reason they don't want to see this movie. It's not scary, it's not silly, Hugo Weaving turns the mask into a fully breathing, living character you yourself might find admiring."
jmsilv,"Mar 19, 2006",6/10,"This movie is for sure inspired by the 1984 George Orwell book and Zorro. But it is neither a political thriller, nor and action movie. It is just a waste of time. It could be a great action movie, but they wasted too much time being a ""documentary"", who cares? People kept talking and talking and talking about bullshit I have seen thousands of times before. They should have concentrated on the action and less on these speeches. This Talkathon would have been a great movie, were it not so preachy. How about the main character? Where did he get all his shakespearean knowledge? They never explain. Stupid movies always try to throw Shakespeare at you, thinking that maybe that will save it. Why would a zoro-like figure keep spouting these endless diatribes? This movie wants to be this and that and it ends up just sucking big time."
girlnheadphones,"Apr 22, 2006",10/10,"This movie was amazing. My sister and my dad dragged me off to see it, even though action movies aren't really my thing. I thought it was all going to be about some oppressed loser getting back and the kids who stole his lunch money in elementary school, but, it's really about a revolution. V's poetic humor and polite manor is terrifying and beautiful at the same time. Evey's steady growth as a character and as human being leaves you no doubt to her destiny. The political cause-and-effect scheme is as such that it can relate to anything and everything happening in our time. this movie shows a modern day revolution of a corrupt government that will make you feel like one among many and many among millions."
MinorityReporter,"Apr 5, 2006",6/10,"Many people had a very negative reaction towards the second and third part of The Matrix trilogy, something I didn't quite understand but it seems that all the Wachowsky brothers needed to do to get back people's attention (in a positive way) was a change of scenery. Even though they didn't direct V for Vendetta their presence in the film making process and in the dialog is very evident. James McTeigue directs this slightly off key blockbuster and he certainly makes it his own. One could have feared that V for Vendetta would be just another Matrix copy but it isn't. Watch the film and you'll know.The acting is generally on a very high level in the film but because of great casting but there are a few, just a few glitches. Natalie Portman who we know can act (at least those of us who have seen Closer and Garden State) is fairly good. When I say fairly good it is not because there is anything wrong with her emotional range as she portrays all the emotions of her character with great skill. No, its her accent. Her accent is not always completely believable. I'm not saying that her accent is downright bad because its not (its not like Kevin Costner's accent in Robin Hood) but there are a few moments where it is obvious that she is an American and not British. Stephen Rea does a good job with his character as well and he portrays both the urgency and the doubt of his character in a very satisfactory manner. Tim Pigott-Smith is decent as well. We don't really see his character that much but we see him enough to dislike him which is just what his purpose is. John Hurt is absolutely wonderful as the dictator, Adam Sutler. Even though we only see his face imposed on a wall screen for most of the film he manages to steal every of these scenes with his amazing facial expressions and confident tone of voice. Absolutely marvelous. Hugo Weaving who most people know as Agent Smith plays the title role and he is brilliant. Having to wear a mask throughout the entire movie he has to rely on his voice and on body language and it is here that he proves how incredibly talented he is because his character is incredibly diverse. Also he is given some of the more heavy dialog and he is very good at dealing with it possibly because of his experience from the Matrix films. He also has great sense of comical timing and is sometimes genuinely funny. Hugo Weaving is fast becoming one of my favorite actors. Two thumbs way up.In terms of style the film is very unique. It isn't like any other action movie spit out by the Hollywood machinery, no. It has its very own style and it sticks to it throughout the entire movie making the overall impression much more polished and believable. The trailer promotes this film as very action packed. Its not. There are only a few excellently choreographed action scenes but that doesn't matter because when you're not thinking about the well written dialog you're looking at some beautifully atmospheric scenes. There are a few slow points in the movie and in these scenes it really helps that there is something to look at because it really helps the movie so that it doesn't come to a complete stop. The soundtrack is a little too vague for my taste, you don't really remember it after the film but at least its not intrusive.V for Vendetta has come early here in 2006 but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it winds up being one of the best films of the year because it really is a clever, moving and very entertaining film with great acting, suspenseful plot and great action.8/10"
phatdan,"Mar 17, 2006",4/10,"This film plays well to those of us who have already made their minds up concerning current events(that certain governments are evil). So what? Government gets away with all kinds of bad things, no matter who runs the show.Aside from this, this movie reminded me a lot of ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" in its negligent desire to reach a more mature audience. I am tired of ""R"" rated films for adolescent mentalities. Young minds are easy to propagandize, especially with easily digestible, non-thinking, fiery slop. Since the story comes from a comic book, maybe it is just for the the intellectually lazy.There are better films that portray similar ideas. ""Brazil"" and ""1984"" are such endeavors. They are far more frightening in their depiction of evil police states.But ideas can be whispered and still change the world. ""V for Vendetta"" came close to putting me to sleep, not only because of its naive storytelling, but also because of its tired imagery. Entertainment is what it's all about, and this isn't that much fun to watch."

mstomaso,"Aug 9, 2006",9/10,"V for Vendetta is an adaptation of a graphic novel by Alan Moore. While V can be seen as an action film, it's much more. Although set in Britain, and originally conceived and written by a British artist, this film seems designed to speak to American political sensibilities. V probes the purpose of government and brings up themes which contemporary Americans seem to have forgotten - the basic concepts of the separation of church and state, government by and for the people, the right to overthrow leaders who exercise their own will at the expense of the nation. V reminds us of our duty to resist and rebel against megalomania and totalitarianism. Though grown in England, and tapped into English history, the message applies everywhere and to everybody, but seems especially appropriate for those of us living with the Bush administration and fearful of its legacy.Natalie Portman plays a young woman who is afraid of her own shadow. Out after curfew one night, she is approached by a pair of ruffians and rescued by the verbose, masked V (Weaving). V is a man who has lost his identity as a result of events in his past which are mysteriously connected to the fascistic government (presided over by John Hurt). He draws his identity out of a relatively obscure event in British history, an attempt to blow up parliament, and dons a mask which is a caricature of the leader of this gunpowder revolution.The plot and characterizations are complex, with adequate but not overbearing back-story. The script is occasionally goofy but excellent - retaining many elements of the comic medium without losing any credibility. The acting is simply wonderful. Natalie Portman is phenomenal. Weaving carries a difficult role very nicely, giving powerful humanity to a man who remains shrouded in mystery. Stephen Rea and John Hurt - always great - both lend strong support. The cinematography is very good and fits the story nicely.Since this film involved the Wachowski's many have seen fit to compare it to the Matrix. Although there are some similarities, I think the comparison is unfair to both films. V is a much less subtle and, in a purely practical political way, a more intelligent and less playful film. It is also less cinematographically innovative and less reliant on scope. Where The Matrix unfolded in the playground of ontology, V is firmly situated in the gladiatorial arena of social psychology. Besides, V was directed by James McTeigue, not the Wachowskis.Even if you don't get it from a political point of view, you are very likely to enjoy this film. I recommend it to all free-thinking individuals who have not lost hope for humanity."
Ivonnesoto7,"Mar 22, 2006",10/10,"EVE: ""Who are you?""V: ""This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is it vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished, as the once vital voice of the verisimilitude now venerates what they once vilified. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose vis-à-vis an introduction, and so it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V""I consider this film a revolution in the cinemas, only by the fact of its message. Some people will think that this film urges to commit terrorism, or to dissolve governments whenever they please to. But the real thing is that the movie wants to remind us that the power of a country resides on their people. They are the ones who choose their legislating leaders, in fact, the complete government perce. V wants to teach us a lesson that consists of remembering that the ideas never die; and no matter what horrible things you had to deal to maintaining it, never die. That's the problem with governments that once they have the power in their hands, they want that we forget who chose them, just to do things their way, and thus to be able to do richer others, thanks to that business that is the government. The government or State not exist so that they can use it like an average one to make businesses, under contrary, the government exist because their job is to protect and give security to the people of their nation, besides to conserve and maintain the peace and unity. The governments have to give their people freedom in their own country and protect that freedom for that matter, as long as that freedom is subject to right laws (Locke). And also, this protection and security that the government should give to the people is not for some specific people of their nation, but to everyone no matter what color, sexual preference or religious believes. After all, for that reason it is why we pay contributions, so that the government has the resources to do it. Of not doing it, treason is considered converses from the government to its people. The government does not exist so they could create conflicts that don't exist, so they can control the people by using the fear as a tool. That is not ethical at all, is cruel, because is a way of using the people debilities to manipulate them as they were puppets.We need to remember that your liberty or freedom finish when other ones starts, and is by living in justice what we could make a better world and a better government. ""REMEMBER, REMEMBER THE FITH OF November"", its mean the rebellion and what Guy Fawkes represents to the people.To the people that have doubts of if they should see or not the movie, I totally recommended. The movie do not incite you to blow a building or something like that, but instead, touch a lot of themes that could make you think a lot, and at the same time is totally enjoyable because of the ironic humor that the character of V (by Hugo Weaving)has. If you think that Hugo Weaving couldn't pull this off, you are wrong, because he manage to give life a character that has not expression but a mask. V really can make you be interest in what he's saying, doing, etc... The movie over pass my expectations and I promise you that it would do the same thing on you. Att. Ivonne (Puerto Rico)"
krebstar138,"Mar 16, 2006",N/A,"I went to a screening of ""V for Vendetta"" last night and if you thought the ""Matrix Trilogy"" was bad then ""V"" will have you pulling your hair out like your name was Natalie Portman. Who by the way, wasn't the worst thing in this movie, which is kind of scary considering what an awful actress she has turned out to be. The movie comes across as little more than an ""anarchy sticker"" stuck on the bottom of some suburban punks' skateboard to look cool. Just like the suburban punk, the Wachowskis don't really believe in what they are displaying, they're just doing it to look cool. While ""V"" is completely unfaithful to comic book it was based upon, that is hardly its biggest crime. Come to think of it, compared to majority of this flicks offenses its little more than petty theft. ""V for Vendetta"" is remembered less for being a great comic book and more for being the work of a great comic book writer; Alan Moore. While nowhere near as good a book as his prior comics that were turned into films (""From Hell"" and ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""), ""V"" does follow in suit as a yet another terrible and mishandled film based on Moore's writing. While nobody would consider the Wachowski brothers to be more than glorified video game creators, I was actually curious as to how they would handle adapting a script for a book overflowing with dialogue and light on flashy graphics. Where as the ""Matrix"" films are completely style over substance, the graphic novel ""V for Vendetta"" has countless scenes devoid of action or explosions but full of rich dialogue and character evolution. Unfortunately the brothers Wachowski, along with their partner in crime director James McTeigue screw it up so badly that if this film were ever shown in a football stadium, it could qualify as the longest fumble in NFL history. For a film that's supposed to be coated in rebellion and anarchy McTeigue and the Wachowski's never really give you a reason to believe in the terrorist hero V or his attacks on Parliament. Instead of giving you emotional and character driven reasons to come to conclusions on the cast, McTeigue and company visually shove it down your throat. You know John Hurt is bad because he's on a giant screen with huge black pupils (to show he's evil, cant you see how evil that is?) and that Portman is good because she is attractive and V is good because he causes explosions and painfully goes out of his way to attempt to illicit laughter from the audience. Not a single character in this has an ounce of reality to them let alone passion for anything going on around them. And why didn't they rerecord weaving's voice; half of V's dialogue is completely muffled due to the mask. Bloated, self important and without any meaning is all you have to remember about the 5th of November."
travisyoung,"Oct 9, 2007",7/10,"What happens when the politics of a movie overpower what is otherwise a moving, relevant, and even (at times) beautiful message?Everyone tries SO hard here...Portman becomes wonderfully cockney, Weaving emotes mystery and power with every gesture and head tilt, and Hurt channels Hitler and any other tyrannical dictator with a frightening authenticity and ferocity--this film shares with us by far the best performances of their careers. Technically speaking, ""V"" is better made than any other film in the past 3 years, and much, much better than other Wachowski/Silver collaborations (read: the Matrix trilogy). Throw in what is a perfectly twisted plot, and what we SHOULD have is a movie catapulted to every top 10 list for the next 20 years, right?Well...not so much. You see, intolerance of the intolerant is very dangerous, especially when the filmgoing public wants to be entertained, not indoctrinated. Buried beneath the faux message of love and acceptance, behind the flashy special effects, Panavision gloom, and the painful smile of a ghastly Guy Fawkes mask is a hatred more malignant than anything Hollywood or comic books could ever dream up. This film teaches that learning to hate is how we learn to love, that vengeance is the only way to achieve justice, that fear of anything--including God--is akin to torture. Democracy begets war, Christianity begets terrorism, and freedom may only be found through Anarchy in the world according to V.One question: is that a world where you want to live?"
holdway73,"Jul 4, 2006",10/10,"I'll keep it short, this was the best movie I have seen in many years, quite possibly ever. I will probably always ""LIKE"" most of the Star Wars movies better, and possibly a few others, but I really think this film was beyond excellent. It's story, characters, effects, message, etc., etc. as a whole make it probably the ""best"" movie I've ever seen. As I said, I may ""like"" or ""enjoy"" other movies a fraction or two more, but ever since I have seen this film, I now consider this the ""best"" film I've ever seen. And it is definitely in the top 5 films that I ""like"" or ""enjoy"" the most. The day after I saw it I called three of my good friends to tell them how good it was, and that I'd go with them to see it again if they were going to go see it. I will buy the DVD the very first day it comes out. I'm not going to try to analyze or interpret the meaning or message here, as I feel almost anyone can benefit from seeing this movie, no matter their views or opinions, and debating the underlying meanings/messages/implications/innuendos, etc. could take me more hours than I want to spend, in addition to the responses, replies, etc. that I'd want to respond to. Just see the movie."
Pan-12,"Jun 8, 2008",6/10,"From memory when this movie came out most reviewers gave it 6-7 out of 10. This is a more accurate reflection of the film's merit than what the average IMDb user has given it. I would put this down to a proportion of users having not seen enough 'good' movies in their time. For those who have seen enough of these movies they would know that nearly everything in this film has already been done many times before. Honestly, how many times is the 1984/big brother theme going to be rehashed? It is a great book and all but someone needs to think of a new dystopian premise. The other one that has been done to death is the plague that either kills people or turns them into monsters. The only variation of this film is that it combines the latter two premises, but really, that is just a testament to the fact that it is a 'dystopia by numbers' film. I guess it's just a trend - a money making operation.To be fair, had I seen this when I was 12 I probably would have thought it was pretty good, but looking at it objectively there are definitely better equivalent films. My advice to those who liked this and haven't seen Bladerunner, A Clockwork Orange and to a lesser extent: Dark City, Gattaca and 12 Monkeys - is to get down to your video store quick smart and hire them out!"
mmerna71,"Mar 19, 2006",4/10,"This film tries hard to be deep, but is actually quite shallow. It hits you hard in the face with simple themes, kind of like ""1984"" for dummies, but without the foresight and vision.The performances were fine, but some of the writing was so bad, it made me want to crawl out of my skin. Too many cheesy lines.Visually, it is quite spectacular, so if you like that, and that is all you require in a film, you might like this one.I live in the NYC area and hearing a line like ""sometimes there's no better way to change the world than to blow up a building"", did not sit well with me. You could argue that is an open invitation/love letter to terrorists. I don't think that is sexy, artsy or cool.All in all, not worth the price of admission."
pgear83,"Aug 3, 2006",10/10,"V For Vendetta is a stunning adaptation of Alan Moore's science-fiction graphic novel that is faithful to its ideals, albeit with some updates which make it seem more relevant to today's world. What makes it truly unique is its believability. While the masked freedom fighter V is the stuff of comic books, the background story of the world's fall into ruin and fascism seems frighteningly possible.The most powerful part of the movie occurs when Natalie Portman's Evey reads the autobiography of Valerie, a remarkable woman who was persecuted, tortured and killed because of her lesbian sexual orientation. Valerie refused to give up her integrity or her dignity, in the face of tremendous evil.The graphic novel was written in the time of Thatcher and Reagan. Today, the forces of greed and ignorance are once again ascendant. Conservatives threaten our values and want to turn back the clock on all the progress made by good-hearted, progressive people. The story of V For Vendetta is a powerful reminder of what could happen if we ever let them win, if we ever give them that ""last inch."" It is also a hopeful film, however, as the forces of wisdom win in the end, just as they always have and always will. Perhaps the very fact that this great film could be made and distributed by a major studio provides the greatest hope that its events will not come to pass. Liberty prevails."
Mike_Devine,"Jun 13, 2021",8/10,"Some stories lose their relevance relatively quickly. Others transcend time and find eternal relevance, appealing to diverse audiences as the years go by. 2005's 'V for Vendetta' falls into the latter category, as the story of hope springing eternal for a revolution to usurp a tyrannical government is one that will unfortunately be viewed as an allegory until the end of time.In 'V,' we get the perspective of both the oppressed (Natalie Portman's Evey and Hugo Weaving's V himself) and the oppressors (through the eyes of Stephen Rea's conflicted detective Finch). We see the slow buildup to a revolution in a future dystopian Great Britain following a second American civil war, which sadly doesn't feel too far from reality. This central plot is what drives 'V' and sets it apart from so many other stories, and many can view the horrors and atrocities committed by the ruling authoritarian government led by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) as representative of who they consider to be their political enemies.But 'V' succeeds in painting a picture of how to stand up to protect your rights, how staying silent can destroy the fabric of society and the importance of never giving in, never giving up. It does this, mind you, in a way that still manages to be entertaining.'V for Vendetta' may have achieved ""cult"" status, but there is no denying the impact and reach of its message."
deepfrieddodo,"Aug 24, 2022",10/10,"Combining super-heroism with a dystopian future, V For Vendetta is a truly outstanding film.The script and dialogue come from excellent source material, and this is brilliantly presented on screen. Intelligent, vicious and witty, the scripts are masterful, and the storytelling reveals the next stage of the plot at the perfect times. The plot is so good and it is a relief that such depth is able to be kept within the confines of film.Performances are superb across the board. Weaving conducts himself beautifully and is brilliant whilst being so limited by being behind a mask. Facial expressions are removed from view but his execution of the dialogue bring that emotion to life. Hurt is fantastic and the perfect casting for the 'Big Brother'-esqe tyrant, showing he can do both sides of the 1984 story. Portman is wonderful throughout and portrays such emotion in her characters development, expressing a great range. The supporting cast all play their parts well, particularly the villains.Excellent choreography and visually stunning, there are many memorable images throughout the film. The costuming and settings do the graphic novel justice and support the movement of the story.Timeless, and unfortunately continuously relevant, V For Vendetta is a masterpiece."
verneylmavt,"Jun 29, 2025",10/10,"V for Vendetta is a masterclass in style-meets-substance, delivering a darkly beautiful vision of rebellion that feels as urgent today as ever. Hugo Weaving's chillingly poised V commands the screen without ever revealing his face, while Natalie Portman grounds the film with a raw, believable journey from fear to fierce resolve. The production design is nothing short of breathtaking-every shot feels meticulously crafted, from the oppressive gleam of government headquarters to the anarchic poetry of V's underground lair.What really sells the movie, though, is how it balances grand, high-stakes action with quiet, thought-provoking moments. Explosions and rooftop escapes are punctuated by stirring speeches that never feel out of place-each one deepens the film's central question about what freedom is worth. Dario Marianelli's score weaves through it all, turning each scene into something that speaks to your heart and your head at once.If you're up for a smart, stylish thrill ride that doesn't talk down to you, this is it. V for Vendetta pulls no punches, sticks the landing on its themes, and leaves you buzzing long after the credits roll-just promise you'll never look at a Guy Fawkes mask the same way again."

gunn-wrights,"May 24, 2021",9/10,"More millenials need to watch this (before it becomes our next chapter in the U. S.).V is the most spectacular character, maybe of all times! He's almost every emotion summed up into 1 person. He has RAGE and ANGER from his past - and he's spent a while now letting that build up - he knows exactly how to enact his revenge and to whom. (oh... and it's good!!)Then on his other side, he's FUN, GENEROUS, and LOVING loving towards Evie (as any close friend). Yet, he knows it's his duty to teach her a lot if she's going to make it in this soon to be liberated world! Sometimes it's your best friends who tell you the TRUTH, no matter how much it may hurt!!RECOMMENDATION: PUT DOWN EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW - AND GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!

DanteRiggs,"Dec 12, 2024",6/10,"This movie highlights the seed of cultural decay in 2024.""Being gay is normal"" in 2005 has turned into ""LGBT everywhere, including in schools and video games, gender fluidity is real, people are obsessed with pronouns, you are a bigot if you don't date a trans person"" in 2024.""Poor guy was arrested for having a Quran"" in 2005 has turned into ""the Islamization of Europe and criticism only towards Christians"" in 2024 (I'm agnostic, btw).""We should welcome all immigrants"" in 2005 has turned into ""the crisis of refugees invading Europe and demanding free stuff"" in 2024.""The fight against fascism"" in 2005 has turned into ""Antifa committing gratuitous violence"" in 2024.""Political protest"" in 2005 has turned into ""disrespect for a country's history and the complete demonization of the past"" in 2024.So what's the appeal of this movie?Obviously, a tyranical regime is bad. Unfortunately, the movie mixes some valid arguments with progressive propaganda and blaming conservative views. ""Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young, up-and-coming politician. He's a deeply religious man and a member of the Conservative Party"".There is a specific appeal to the idea of a ""revolution"". It's the same drive that make people go skydiving: adrenaline. I wouldn't say revolutions are ""fun"", but they do present a certain charm, especially for young people. They give purpose, a reason to fight. The will and need to fight for something is embedded in the human condition. It has accompanied humankind throughout its history.Another positive point for this movie: The action is nice and the main character is pretty cool. He knows how to fight, he is intelligent and has a moral compass, which is always appreciated.However, he does something very questionable at some point. But it's not like the movie tries to start a discussion around his actions, asking the viewer if he really is a ""hero"" or justified in his actions. He is clearly portrayed in a heroic manner. He isn't an ""antihero"". He is a ""hero"" and the movie tells us that the end justifies the means. I'm not so sure I agree with that statement.Also, there is at least one plot hole. Nothing big, but it did make me pause the movie and ask ChatGPT for an explanation."
rogerkynarderickson,"Mar 25, 2006",1/10,"If you enjoyed Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel from 1988 -- as I did -- do yourself a favor and avoid this pale rendition. Alan Moore has disassociated himself from this film, and with good reason. A few of the character names are the same, and a couple of sequences bear a slight resemblance -- but that's it. The fire, the passion, the heart and soul that so infused the novel is completely absent. The screen story was already written, and the filmmakers ignored it, rewriting whole scenes, cutting out others, eliminating a good 75% of the story's power, meaning and resonance. The characters are shallow, empty husks of their original selves, and the pacing is abominable. Nowhere in this superficial yawnfest is the true understanding of revolution made manifest. Nowhere is the audience truly brought in to and made a part of V's tormented motivations or Evey's harrowing journey. That would require some creative camera lingering, and sets that didn't look like sound stages. If this had been made 15 years ago -- as a mini-series -- perhaps some of the gritty integrity and enduring strength of the human spirit might have been retained.Shame that it ended up in the hands of overpaid incompetents."
ezioashwin,"Oct 2, 2016",9/10,"Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, 'V for Vendetta' is a political thriller set in a fascist-ruled England in the 2020s. A film that delves into the political side of oppression and anarchy, whilst running a somewhat emotive and heartfelt story of a character in betrayal, 'V for Vendetta' is a visually stunning and extremely smart flick with some fantastic performances from Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman (whose English accent is rather impressive). The film is nowadays considered a cult classic, and rightfully so, even to the extent that the film has been utilised by governments as an allegory of oppression.I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com.

leftwichzachary,"Aug 15, 2024",10/10,"The savior and absolute redeemer of the archaic, pompous and stifling, British film industry.Hugo Weaving, brings to life a multidimensional, multifaceted character unlike anything we had ever seen before, which paradoxically, we never get to see.As we are grudgingly introduced to V by a sudden twist of fate, a new dynamic to this already complex story line is instilled with the incorporation of the humble idealist, Evey Hamm (Natalie Portman).Hugo Weaving explodes on screen with a mesmerizing repertoire of allegory and blazing determination from behind the symbolic, Guy Fawkes mask. The sublime chemistry between V and Evey is extraordinary and serves to fuel the spectators with a combustible mixture of ardent desire and vengeful compassion.V for Vendetta overshadows all other anti-hero themed movies and sets a whole new standard or benchmark for the fans of emotionally satisfying, action, romance and drama.It will most likely be a long time before we the spectators are presented with an equally compelling story as V for Vendetta. I would recommend the 2002 version of The Count of Monte Cristo as an alternative to help fill the void, while we patiently wait."
gothicgoblin1334,"Jun 8, 2006",N/A,"V for Vedetta, a terrible excuse for making a film. How could Alan Moore allow Hollywood to make a big budget Bush-era investiment and not have any control over it. Alan Moore, the writer and creator of V FOR Vendetta was not about America's governmental system or Republican-bashing-it was about Anarchy and Fascism! For God's sake, it was about England! I have no problem with Bush-bashing but this film makes it so hard to believe, what may seem to be a beautiful, intriguing sci-fi film about the Holocaust is actually a movie that's meant to get to the box office and not to the true core of emotion and thought that it was meant to be. V FOR VENDETTA is about the man in the mask, but the true men that should be wearing masks, my friends, is the makers of this film."
MaximillianZeus,"Apr 16, 2025",6/10,"V for Vendetta is a frustrating film-one that feels like it had the raw potential to capture the powerful essence of Alan Moore's brilliant graphic novel, but instead settles for something much safer and far less ambitious. Watching it, I was continually reminded of what could have been rather than what actually played out on screen. It's a movie that, while still entertaining in its own right, never fully commits to the complexity, darkness, or philosophical depth of its source material.Let's start with what stands out most glaringly: the adaptation itself. Moore's novel is a dense, sophisticated exploration of anarchism, power structures, and individual agency. It's challenging and genuinely provocative without being preachy or simplistic. The film, unfortunately, reduces these complex themes into surface-level declarations and broad political commentary. Its attempt to incorporate overtly post-9/11 anxieties and criticisms of the Bush-era administration feels painfully shoehorned, rendering the story overly simplistic and distractingly specific. It's as though the filmmakers mistrusted their audience to understand nuance or allegory, so they opted for easy symbolism and direct parallels-none of which truly serve the narrative in any meaningful way.Action sequences, while visually sleek, rely heavily on stylized slow-motion shots, which might have been impressive if not for their repetitive overuse. They quickly cross the line from stylish to obnoxious, accompanied by a soundtrack that is overly loud, bombastic, and relentlessly intrusive. The music doesn't complement the visuals so much as it forcibly guides your emotions, leaving no room for subtlety or interpretation.The pacing is another noticeable flaw. The film rushes through scenes, rarely allowing itself-or us-to breathe. Important plot points flash by without enough depth or reflection, undermining their potential impact. Meanwhile, the intricate characterizations and thoughtful monologues from the graphic novel are either trimmed or diluted to fit a more conventional cinematic mold, sacrificing emotional depth for brevity and accessibility. What results is an often hollow experience, emotionally detached from the richly textured story of Moore's original work.That said, the film isn't without merit. Hugo Weaving delivers an outstanding performance as V, expertly capturing the character's poetic menace, charisma, and enigmatic appeal. Even masked, his nuanced vocal work and body language bring genuine life to the screen, easily the strongest element of the movie. Natalie Portman is also commendable, delivering a solid, emotionally invested performance. The film is competently shot, with production values that at least hint at the dark, dystopian landscape Moore envisioned.Ultimately, though, V for Vendetta feels like a diluted echo rather than the resonant adaptation Moore's graphic novel deserved. It's not bad-it entertains and provides moments of genuine intrigue-but it misses the emotional and philosophical depth of its source. Perhaps in the hands of a director and writer willing to dive into the messy, complicated heart of Moore's text, it could have become something far greater. Instead, it remains merely good, trapped behind a mask of wasted potential."
Jacques98,"Oct 1, 2008",1/10,"I can't point to a single film by the Wachowski brothers that wasn't cheesy, over-hyped, unoriginal, and just downright pathetic. I guess the first Matrix film was alright, but that's the closest they have ever gotten to deserving even half the acclaim they get from mindless ""fine cinema""-whores. Or, in other words, ""People who do not have the ability to disagree with the critics, because they have no brain to make their own judgments."" If they critics call it original and daring, they call it original and daring, even though they've seen a hundred other movies just like it. That is the only reasonable explanation I can see for the mass love for this film.Here are my ABCs of V for Vendetta: A for Annoying. The directing and camera-work are so bland and typical I felt like I was watching a children's TV show. The two main leads are okay acting, but every single secondary character, EVERY single one, are so bad at acting I occasionally had to pause the movie so I could stop and laugh. And I'm not someone who usually cares about bad actingthis was just terrible. What also annoyed me was the level of pure cheese the movie carries and sustains. Gunshots don't bleed, typical stabbings are off-screen, and even some fistfights are off screen. It just added to the children's TV show feel the directing and acting started. How did this movie get and R-rating? I've seen PG-13 movies (like Cloverfeild and The Dark Knight) that have more violence/blood than V for Vendetta. The MPAA puts this on the same level as Saw III and Hostel: Part II? Dear God, our rating system is so screwed up it's not even funny. V for Vendetta did not deserve and R-rating by any means, and I think they honestly slipped the MPAA a little cash to rate it such.B for Boring. Just so anyone out there who hasn't seen this yet knows: this is not an action movie. If anything, V for Vendetta is a political drama. There are maybe two main action sequences that last about five minutes each, and the rest of the runtime is old men rambling about terrorists. The plot is no more complex than you're standard, cliché James Bond plot: terrorist appears, and old men with guns talk about him for the majority of the movie, then in the last ten minutes when the ""climax"" starts they finally stop talking about the terrorist and try to do something. In V for Vendetta, when I say the majority, probably 95%, of the movie is nothing but repeated dialogue, I mean it literally. If you were to fast-forward through all the all talking scenes, you'd still understand the plot because it's so generic. You'd also have a fifteen-minute long movie.C for Cliché. As I said, the plot is a rip-off of the books that ripped-off 1984. Giant speakers, evil dictator, TVs used to make mass announcements, people have no freedom . . . blah, cliché, blah, blah. V leaves a rose after he kills, just like every cliché ""sentimental"" killer in movie history. The reason he wears a mask and why he seeks vengeance is also the biggest cliché in movie killer history. Also, the ""government lies"" jokes were so cliché and annoying I was about to turn it off. As if we haven't heard a thousand times that the government is evil! The movie doesn't even give the audience credit for having basic intelligence of political issues. I cannot name a single aspect of this movie that was original, or even close. The entire movie is the biggest cliché ever.Overall, V for vendetta is a waste of time. It is just a boring drama with a cliché ""moral"" that we've heard all our lives. Sure, V himself is cool for a few minutes, but when you realize the knives he carries are just a sales gimmick because there is less action than you could see walking down the street, just know I told you so.1/10"
matthewzanehammer,"Jul 21, 2016",10/10,"This is MY ""greatest movie of all time"" and has been for quite some time now. I often hope something may come along and knock it off the shelf, but it has not happened. (Children of Men came close) I've come to understand what's most important to me in storytelling, Encompassing the entire human experience.Most will not agree, but I found the film better than the comic book, and the comic was top notch! I know Alan Moore hated it, I think he even tried to get it banned or something, but to me Hugo's performance is beyond incredible. The general fear of a main character behind a mask with no facial expression's is totally beyond comparison here. Hugo, if you're reading this, you have reached Ian McKellen status in my eyes.It's really difficult to imagine this comic being put onto the big screen and more so, being acceptable, yet I found it truly compelling, inspiring and the overall essence captured. This is a movie that I believe will stand the test of time and is more relevant with every passing day in our modern world."
ninjademon25,"Aug 3, 2006",10/10,"Like many i was skeptical about v. i had read the comic, and enjoyed the wachovski brothers work, i was carefully optimistic.I saw it the day it came out there were very few people at my theater i was shocked. when the credits started to roll i stood up and applauded , i NEVER do that. i was even shocked at myself. after being pulled through each and every movie i've seen over the past few years i found a gem, a diamond in the rough. This movie was incredible. i believed in the characters, i laughed with them i felt sorry for them, i felt their rises and falls. the story was incredible, it was churned out from the page to the screen so beautifully. and it had a message. i don't mean that sappy message you get at the end of a Disney movie. it spoke to me, i made the connections, i followed the dotted lines, and i was impressed, it showed the evils of the world and it showed that freedom is a price you must sacrifice, avenge, and possibly die for. if somethings not right you do something about it, an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth, all that good stuff. all in all v for vendetta was a movie i will not soon forget if ever i was appalled when i walked out of that theater some guy said ""that sucked"" then i realized that not everyone understood what i understood, a lot of people just saw a guy in a mask. i felt sorry for them i hope if you have not seen this film, you will. i gave this a 10 out of 10 with all my heart. I hope you enjoyed this review, until next time... FREEDOM FOREVER!"
polyprufrock,"Mar 25, 2006",9/10,"Just saw it and was DEEPLY impressed. Yes, acting and cinematography were top-notch, but it was the updated socio-political commentary that gave the film its punch. The novel, written in the Thatcher/Reagan 80's, was projecting the politics of conservative corporate greed into the future, and look how far we've already come since then....Most thought-provoking was Finch's comment to his colleague upon uncovering administrative malfeasance -- if your government facilitated and/or perpetrated actions against its own people that were subsequently blamed on domestic/foreign terrorists, ""Would you want to know?"" (Such a question exposes the root of national denial, through which we're all going to hell in a hand-basket....)V's liberation was by fire, and Evey's is by water. His is mythical, impossible to grasp except through enjoying the fantastical world created in graphical novels. Hers is real and intensely moving. It is the kind of freedom from fear that is faced down by untold others throughout history. Even now as I write this, and as you read it, someone somewhere is coming to terms with the ultimate value of some truth beyond one's own life. Evey experiences and surpasses that unspeakable terror which others (i.e. the great majority of us) prefer to project out into the world as ""terrorism"" -- and without facing such a fear we acquiesce to almost anything in order to believe we're ""safe.""Evey's name isn't merely similar to that of V, but is a metaphor of the first woman as life-giver, and thus subject to the natural and inherent ""temptation"" of preserving life. Is there ever a war worth fighting for, dying for, killing for? This film says yes.While the faceless V behind his mask is a virtual No One, he emerges as the voice of Every One -- and the movie's final moments express this beautifully. Only problem is, most folks have to be much worse off before they rise up, with or without leaders and cool costumes. Bread and circuses (i.e. ""Britain"") will indeed prevail a good while. But perhaps some day when a barely literate populace no longer has easy access to graphic novels, and global warming brings the seacoast lapping up the sides of abandoned coastal cities turned slums, the revolution will come...."
gluttony14,"Apr 4, 2006",9/10,"V for Vendetta is amazing. There is no other word to describe it. It's a visual feast with a gripping plot and a message. You'll be glued to your seat all through-out the movie, and you'll come out sweating with your head filled with ideas. This is easily the best movie I have seen so far this year.I had my reasons to doubt the quality of this film adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore at first. Although, I must confess, it is reading about this movie that made me interested in the graphic novel, it was simply written so brilliantly I was afraid it would be spoiled. Indeed, it wasn't an easy adaptation. The original graphic novel has very little action, and a mind-boggling amount of text, not to mention many numerous characters and subplots. There was also the matter of the Wachowski brothers. I did enjoy the first Matrix movie, but I was terribly disappointed with the sequels. To say the truth, this was a movie that was easy to screw up, and I had a feeling it would get screwed up. I was wrong, and I am oh-so-glad I was.The plot was changed for the film adaptation. The year is no longer 1998. The nuclear war was replaced with a deadly virus. But the idea behind the movie remains, even if the chain of events is different. But the film also added something I felt the graphic novel was sorely in need of: more action. I enjoyed the graphic novel immensely, but I felt it would have been more interesting with more action. And the fight scenes in this film are incredible: swift, stylish, and exciting. I did not like the changed made in Lord of the Rings. But in V, I did not mind the changes. The Wachowskis created a story of their own, based on Alan Moore's original, but different. And it works.There was, however, one change that was for the worst. In the graphic novel, V was insane, and there was no doubt about it. He wasn't simply weird, he was also unpredictable, mysterious and eccentric. V's character was brilliant in the graphic novel, and it was slimmed down in this movie. Hugo Weaving was great as V, of course, but by making the character of V more human, more sane, by making him romantically involved with Evey (who was also portrayed perfectly by Natalie Portman), he became less mysterious and less interesting. Not to mention, they made him more of a man with an idea, than an idea in itself. And that is a shame.All in all, this a spectacular piece of cinema. It's highly recommendable for anyone who enjoyed the original graphic novel, for anyone who enjoys comic book movies, and for anyone who enjoys movies in general. But if you want a different, yet more fleshed out plot, with a more interesting protagonist, pick up the V for Vendetta graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's worth it."
mgiese1118,"Mar 20, 2006",10/10,"This manages the fine line of politics and entertainment. I was motivated to make change and yet fully enjoyed all the fights & action in the movie. This is my new favorite movie, that I could watch repeatedly for days!! This will still move me in 5, 10, 20 years! The characters are well developed and I felt for them and their struggles. This movie makes me feel all the great heroes are gone or suppressed. The parallels between this movie and today's political situations are similar. You see things in today's government that feel like they could go the direction Vendetta shows. In order to prevent chaos, do we go too far and end up crushing our own freedoms? In order to feel safe, what do we sacrifice? It's beautiful and poetry and stimulating and I'll watch V for Vendetta over and over."
Stacie-5,"Apr 2, 2006",10/10,"In our present Hollywood time of overwhelming sexualized imagery I really loved the relationship in this movie. The sensual images of the dancing a formal distance apart but arms entwined, the gentle hand on the back and the intimate exchange of breath. No humping butts and naked boobies and yet more erotic. Along these same lines, Hugo Weaving, who played V has an incredible voice and it gave a lot of power to a faceless character which fed into the eroticism.I would have liked to have known more about V - that part of the story felt unsatisfying but all in all, this was a very good Swashbuckling Zorro Meets Phantom of the Opera Meets A Few Other Things But With A More Sensual Love Story film.P.S. I saw the film again and I am just entranced by Hugo Weaving's powerful voice for V."
idancelikethis,"Jun 21, 2006",N/A,"Was it just me, or was the movie really really fast, blurry, and kind of drifted. I felt as though everything was going so fast, I couldn't breath, listen, register, and sink in the words and thoughts of the movie. And it was surprising how Eve & V from the beginning were so comfortable with each other. Natalie played Eve as though there was no real character choices. Like it was her portraying herself instead of the character. The movie makes me want to read the book, and see for myself. And I've read and watched F451, 1985, etc... and this movie reminded me of a combination of those books. Movies these days are so sensationalized, and even audiences are getting tired of it, and seeing past the hype and are laughing at the style."
moore_ella,"Jul 4, 2006",9/10,"When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty. Thomas JeffersonThat quote, modified by V in the movie, hints at my opinion of the film- (call it a simplistic one if you will). I loved this film. The Count of Monte Cristo revenge plot is given an interesting twist by the immersion in fictitious national political scene. The tyranny imposed on the citizens was inspired by both the past AND present, both fact AND fiction. The writers should not *mask* (bad pun) nor NEED to mask their political views. Everyone should be able to freely and openly state opinions and ideas! This is a key point of the film.The Count of Monte Cristo revenge plot is also transformed by a romance. Evey becomes V's conscience by the end of the film, in addition to becoming his love. Both changes were enjoyable to watch. The actor who played V gave an Oscar worthy performance without having access to the main tool of an actor - facial expressions. Astoundingly well done.And for those who criticize because V for Vendetta b/c they believe it to be a poor adaptation of the graphic novel I say this: No movie adaption of a book is made for the people who ""loved the book."" It's made for people who like movies! I love both so I count myself lucky. I just look at the movie as being inspired by the novel only. ...as one interpretation by a set group of people... just as Blade Runner was inspired by Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by PKD.I'm not saying the movie is perfect. Suspension of disbelief is quite necessary at many points! But if you keep an open mind I bet you'll find yourself enjoying it!"
darknight-13,"Mar 1, 2008",7/10,"Based on the 1980s graphic novel by Alan Moore, ""V for Vendetta"" had tremendous potential: A fabulous source book, top-notch actors, and brilliant directors. And then they blew it. The graphic novel, which was more libertarian than liberal, was very even minded, not truly siding with either point of view. It contrasted two extremes: anarchism and fascism, and let the reader decide which was preferable. Most importantly, it was most definitely about England, not America. This was their first mistake. They changed the plot to appeal to modern audience, but what they ended up doing was injecting US politics into a British story. Not nearly as even minded either, the film completely sides with the title character, who has gone from a libertarian anarchist to a liberal revolutionary. Worse still the plot line's back story is now a thinly veiled analogy of the 9/11 attacks though the eyes of conspiracy theorists. A tragic waste, considering the film's good points. The acting was phenomenal, especially Hugo Weavings, had to do the entire film masked, depriving him of the benefit of facial expression. The special effects were impressive too, reminiscent of the Wachowski Brothers work in ""The Matrix"". Unfortunately all this is lost in the poor storyline, which reduces this potentially operatic masterpiece to a sloppy political satire."

I tried to keep an open mind as I sat through the worse action scenes I'd ever seen. I tried to find some redeeming qualities for the poor actors, I like Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, who had to spit out the worse duologue I've heard in years. The Brothers Wachowski must have still been taking their psychedelic drugs, you know the ones they were on when they made the second and third Matrix films. This movie suffers from the same types of issues as Aeon Flux, no story or a poorly told story. Even a bad story can be made good by a storyteller who knows how to pull out all of the best elements.

""V for Vendetta"" deftly avoids these pitfalls and stands out both as a thinking film and as pure entertainment. The plot is driven by thought and action, increasing its appeal to a wide audience. Upon its release I thought ""V for Vendetta"" would be a sleeper, a cult film appealing only to those of a certain oeuvre; the huge positive response it's generated from film goers of all bents is proof of its success. I attended the theatre with my teenage children who each enjoyed it for different reasons. Viewers familiar with the graphic novel may take umbrage to deletions and changes within the story but the spirit of Alan Moore's vision is intact.Few actors can carry a starring role without benefit of facial expressions but Hugo Weaving is delicious...his mellifluous voice carries just the right weight for the hefty speeches his character makes, never over the top.Natalie Portman surprised me: I always considered her a lightweight actress but she gave a well measured performance, earning kudos as her character develops throughout her ordeal.I've always liked John Hurt; he adds interest to any film and is perfectly cast in a mercurial role.There's no doubt the years will be kind; this kind of film holds up well and is destined to become a classic."
Sir_James_Spensley,"Aug 3, 2006",10/10,"I was astounded by this Movie. Really. I say that because, after Reloaded and Revolution (which disappointed me even more than I expected), I used to think the Wachowski Bros had cheated us all with the Matrix first (and only, I might add) chapter, and that the real dimension of their talent was the one we had the luck to ""appreciate"" with Assassins (which, IMHO, is going to be remembered as one of worst movies ever). So, although (or should I say ""since"") I'm a HUGE fan of Alan Moore's comic, I have to admit that I was a little skeptical. What can I say? I don't know whether I was wrong about the authors or not (who cares, anyway?), but this is a surprisingly TERRIFIC movie and I can't wait for the day the DVD shall be released in Italy! Good acting (Natalie Portman is one of the best young actresses in the biz, only Scarlett Johansson could be reasonably compared to her) and, most of all, a Great Screenplay (but maybe we should thank Alan Moore for this) make this one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, no doubt about it. Not mentioning some typically brilliant genius idea, such as John Hurt playing the right-winger chancellor (a homage to Michael Radford's ""1984"", I guess). I realized that what I was seeing was a work of art right from the beginning, but the more time passed by, the higher the pleasure. I think that one of most frequent misconception about this movie could concern the genre it belongs to. Well, in my opinion, this is not an action movie. Or better yet, this isn't JUST an action movie, and this is its strong card. X-men is an action movie. Superman returns is an action movie. V for vendetta is much more. It's not just the story of a guy with a mask who gets bored of all those Nazi bullshit and goes berserk, kicking asses and blowing up buildings. It is a wonderful representation of emotions, feelings, situations and characters in a well-balanced mix of action, dialogues and poetry and, most important thing, the plot is not so far from being a realistic picture of the world we're currently living in (at least, some part of it). This movie is a perfect mix between Orwell, Edmond Rostand's Cyrano (well, just a little bit angry) and the Matrix, played by really good actors and based on one of greatest graphic novels ever. So, whether you've read the comic or not, this masterpiece is a must-see, because there is really no reason why the 5th of November should ever be forgot."
short_dancer3,"Aug 7, 2006",10/10,"Remember, Remember the 5th of November the gunpowder treason and plot. I see of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.This movie starring Natalie Portman and Hugh Weaving was amazing. I saw it on my birthday and I couldn't get it out of my head. This movie was based on the comic books. I haven't read them but I don't think that you would need to read them to love this movie. This movie was about freedom and the way that some countries might end up. People control government. Not the other way around. This movie was heavy at times but really made me think. I think that this movie was wonderfully done and exceeded all of my expectations. The performances were brilliant and Natalie Portman really did a great job with her character. See this movie!!!"
url-16811,"Mar 19, 2017",10/10,"To sum up the brothers' masterwork in one word is a quite impossible task, but I have come to the conclusion that V For Vendetta is 'perfect'. Nathalie Portman as the hapless chick is one weak link because she is not a good actress and her English accent is as bad as the Bridget Jones Diaries but the rest if just brilliant. Making this film all the more compelling is the classical music perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the cult love bestowed upon it, especially the social movements it has aided. It deserves all these awards and more. V For Vendetta is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. The good guys and the bad guys are so complex, so scary and so relevant that it will remain an immortal film forever. Homosexuals, Muslims, freedom fighters, media folk, cops, politicians and regular folks who believe life is just drinking beer and being stupid will benefit from watching this."
imdbbl,"Nov 29, 2008",N/A,"I watched this movie last night and I thought it was OK. Just OK... The story itself is quite interesting, and the concept although its not new its something I find rather fascinating.V for Vendetta is about a futuristic English society controlled by a manipulative and fascist government.People are so afraid and insecure they don't see the dictatorship they live in. ""V"" is a mysterious man fighting for freedom while Evey is a news reporter who unwillingness joins V's quest. What I'm not so fond of is the poetically almost theatrically way things happen. It doesn't feel real.I have to mention the stunning Natalie Portman that once again has proved her value as an actress.Deserving of a spot in the Top250 ?Not even close. If you like this kind of story read the book Globalia by Jean-Christophe Rufin,its way more interesting. 5/10"
daninemec,"May 3, 2017",6/10,"Pompous, meaningless and boring, very boring, well, quite right, so much And how pathetic. If you like to watch movies where the ending is Known in advance, where there is no plot where the main character simply is, Where bombs are cleared in the last seconds, where popularity is achieved by the rebellious temper of teenagers, then this is for you."
xNecRosex,"Jan 4, 2021",10/10,"Very much inspired by 1984 and other dystopian novels, but it truly is the depiction of our current world in most instances.Who would have known they got it so right.
Natalie Portman's performance is very good as well."
BruddanChrist,"Apr 5, 2008",7/10,"I have mixed feelings about this film. There are aspects that I really enjoy and others that I despise.Hugo Weaving's performance is my favorite part of the film. The fact that he had to do it all behind a mask makes it doubly impressive. He has a great, expressive voice, and he makes full use of it here. He is able to be engagingly delightful one minute, then become terrifyingly intimidating the next. Natalie Portman is a good actress and a beautiful woman, but she's too petite for a movie like this. I feel like a stronger actress would have been better (both physically and emotionally).The story is not very original, which ties into my biggest complaint with the movie. Instead of being a new take on an old idea, V For Vendetta's story feels more like a political statement than entertainment. I understand and even admire the writers for taking such a strong stance on their politics, but I feel like the story is riding on top of the political statement.When it comes down to it, I like this movie. The acting and the execution is impressive. However, the imbalance between the story and the politics leaves a bitter aftertaste in my mouth."
dircpitt,"Nov 21, 2019",9/10,"Solid characters, actors of absolute thickness, remarkable direction. The subject addressed is tremendously current; unfortunately today the dictatorships in our society have stopped assuming the appearance of a villain to take those of untouchable holdings, multinationals and banks against which it is much more difficult to fight because they are not a physical enemy and sometimes are not even perceived as such. To see and review."
MilosH18,"Oct 31, 2021",8/10,"An impressive film, the choreography was outstanding alongside the cinematography and editing. The story flowed well and the character progression for V was beautiful. I constantly had the urge to see Hugo Weaving underneath the mask, but I guess that was not the point. Fabulous performances from the cast, more notably John Hurt as he played Adam Sutler. A classic film that I would place in my recommendations list. Happy 5th November!"
hazzaboombatty,"Oct 4, 2022",10/10,"I've loved this film for many years and now I love it even more. Yes there are some flaws, well one. Natalie Portman is ok. Everyone else is great! The story and direction are amazing - the whole thing is superbly rendered, I doubt we will get many more films like this. Well, we won't.What started as liberal nightmare about right wing authoritarianism has now morphed into a flipped version of the same story.We are now in a position where if you don't think and act a certain way, you could imagine being black bagged. Not literally, but digitally.The meaning of words has indeed changed. ""Racist"" doesn't mean now what it meant 3 years ago. Whose driven that? Not the political right. Division in society is worse than ever. Distrust. Paranoia. Misinformation.Whatever your take. Watch out for McReady. He's in your greenhouse!Remember remember the 5th of November."

cynsk8,"Mar 26, 2006",N/A,"V for Vendetta explores one man's courage to stand up to a government that continues to isolate its constituency. Not unlike the Frodo character in Lord of the Rings, V is one insignificant human that inspires a nation and changes the course of its history. Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) plays the enshrouded V, who, within the course of a year turns the tide of a fascist and oppressive dictatorship. On a more symbolic level, the movie reminds viewers how seemingly insignificant violations of liberty can lead toward the consolidation of power.On a historical note, one need only know a tad bit of British history to really appreciate the metaphor behind the lead character V.The Facts: Guy Fawkes (April 14, 1570January 31, 1606) was an English soldier and a member of a group of Roman Catholic conspirators who attempted to carry out the so-called Gunpowder Plot in 1605. The plot was an attempt to assassinate King James I of England (James VI of Scotland) and the members of both houses of the Parliament of England. To do this, Westminster Palace was to be blown up during the formal opening session of the 1605 Parliament, in which the king would address a joint assembly of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Guy Fawkes was in large part responsible for the later stages of the plan's execution. His activities were detected, however, before the plan's completion. Following a severe interrogation involving the use of torture, Fawkes and his co-conspirators were executed for treason and attempted murder. Guy Fawkes is remembered with Guy Fawkes Night on November 5"
dafaro,"Mar 19, 2006",10/10,"Very well done. I believe it was better than the matrix. In fact, it was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I was worried in the beginning that the show would be to literary and I would feel like I was sitting through Shakespeare. But it turned out to be just a clever V Tung twister. Although I did like the random Shakespeare quotes.I am worried that some people may take the political overtures to far and try to relate them to what is current. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However it is a bad thing if it is done in the wrong way and destroys the original message. Reminiscent of A Brave New World (good book.) I think I need to go read 1984 now."
potter_flies,"May 1, 2006",6/10,"This movie is after all not so bad, but it lacks everything that stirs inside me after an 'interesting' movie. Well, you should say 'it not the movie stupid', 'it is you', but however...Along visual pleasure, a movie should scratch something on your memory or emotions, so that you can connect with the fictional world. Sadly, the only thing that leaves me with something is Portman who is a perfect vulnerable actress close to the flirtatious Scarlet Johanson in Match Point.As for the Utopian nightmare, London as a Leninist brave-new-world-1984 meets Matrix-goes-to-the-opera is anyway my kind of 'bullocks'. Yet this nightmare is a corny fantasy as long as the authoritarian/totalitarian context is totally misconceived. I have lived my first thirteen years in a communist nationalist regime, and the fear, or the real nature of terror is just pulp here."

I am open for anything, as long as it challenges me and doesn't turn my brain off completely. I always took IMDb seriously, but seeing this film on #173 of Top 250 films makes me strongly doubt the intelligence of this site's average user. The story is horribly copied from other classics, i.e. not original, the plot is full of illogical holes, it is totally unbelievable and the lesbian woman subplot made my toes curl. This film is totally overrated and embarrassingly bad. Even 1 Star seems inflated. If you want to watch intelligent cinema dealing with the future, watch Brazil."

ryanprestwich,"Mar 19, 2006",8/10,"A standard has been set for those of us who live in a society of fear. ""V for Vendetta"" was clearly made as a slap in our face- something to wake us up from our lazy fat slumber; a shot of adrenaline against the narcotic filth that our society fills us with every day.Many themes run through this movie, many borrowed from works we've already at least heard of. Vengeance, courage, truth, true freedom. Though the themes are not original, and even some of the movie is reminiscent of some classic works, the presentation is fantastically original and new. It's a reminder of what we have and what we're slowly giving away.This is something everyone should see."
maxolau,"Aug 27, 2006",10/10,My favorite movie ever! Absolutely the best movie I've ever seen!!! Saw it 4 days ago and still can't get over!!! How can one write the story like this!!! The most brilliant story and cast and filming!!! The characters are so well played! It's unforgivable! I'm not normally watching the film a second time. But with V for vendetta I just can't wait to see it again! Will have to get a book and also a DVD to add to my very-very strict DVD collection.Don't expect just to relax and watch the movie. It's very tense and it's getting tenser to the end of the movie. You will be completely overwhelmed by the time you finished watching it.A try peace of art! The top of my list! Highly recommended!!!
kevinfaftine,"Aug 12, 2024",9/10,"V for Vendetta is probably the most underrated comic book movie of all-time, like, I never see it in top 10's, but I legit think it can be a top 10 comic book movie OATFantastic script, like I remember watching it for the first time and continuously saying ""remember, remember, the 5th of November"" nonstop for WEEKS: Rewatching it yesterday reminded me how many quotable this has, so many catchy and fantastic quotes.Hugo Weaving voicing V is fantastic, this movie does not work without his fantastic voice. Natalie Portman also gives on of the best performances in a comic book movie of all time, and I actually mean this, specially if I'm considering only female characters, its definitely top 5.Visually stunning, amazing choreography, story moves fantastically well, the pacing on this is so good, Portman's character gets put through the ringer, and its fantastic to watch her character's arc.Yeah, V for Vendetta, need it to get more love."
SPZMaxinema,"Jun 16, 2025",9/10,"This is a very smart film with great writing and an interesting plot as well. It was kind of ahead of its time and was not only relevant politically for the time-period it came out, but for the present as well with a lot of current issues! I remember watching this film years ago and not liking it for some reason, however after rewatching it I really think it's great and would recommend it for many audiences. Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman both play their roles very well, as well as John Hurt. The music, the ending, the story that Eve finds and reads in the ""prison"" and the twist after that, all very beautiful. The film looks good too (with the cinematographer having experience and working on multiple James Bond movies beforehand and sadly dying around the time this movie was released, RIP).What a genius production and delivery!"
dakuchonekobing,"Apr 30, 2022",10/10,"I watched this movie when I was a kid. And swear to God, this movie changed the letter V in my head forever.It can be said that this is the best movie about the riot - the overthrow of the dictatorial government and the best honor of heroism movie ever.This is proof that movies are not just entertainment, they can do something else.It's rare in a movie where an important character can't reveal his face and still can express his emotions like V.Unfortunately, in the area where I live, no one sells this mask."
jayschlike22,"Mar 29, 2006",7/10,"I must admit, I expected something completely different from this film. Instead of a ""Matrix-esque"" type of action film, I found myself in a political statement film. Based on a hugely popular comic book, this movie shapes the viewers into thinking about today's political society. It presents ""Ideas"" as they stated throughout the film as the beginning of regaining control of your government. Many obvious shots at the Bush administration, Bill O'Reilly, and the Fox Network as all propaganda factors for today's government. Obvious characters formed after George Bush and Dick Cheney. They also visit terrorism in all forms, and actually state "" sometimes you have to destroy a building"". Hmmmm. 9-11 reference ? Or just trying to stir the pot on what brings HATRED. Because our masked hero admits to being a MONSTER and he had so much hate. Are we supposed to have some sympathy for those who attack us ? Or just look deeper ? Why do they hate us so much. A lot to handle from one action film, but worth the price of admission.You will be disappointed if you expect all action. Some great explosions and a great grand finale showdown between the man who represents Dick Cheney, and the masked hero. Natalie Portman is superb in this by the way.An above average movie, and one that will speak volumes about the political societies today..........I'm sure each country can relate some of the factors in this film to their own government's, past and present. And the movie at the end will remind you that all this just represents an ""idea"". An idea can change history and many people will die to protect or live up to an idea. The masked hero known as ""V"" actually just represents all of us. An idealistic people who will and can demand change when we need too. Do we need too demand this change now in real life ? And don't other cultures and countries have this same right too ? The viewer is left to ponder ........."
aleksanderk-95350,"Mar 29, 2021",7/10,"Not what I was expecting, but it was a great film. It's funny how the plot is very similar to what is happening in the world now. The film does not have that much action in it. When the fights do happen they are well worth the wait. V is very imposing on screen. When the fight scenes happen they are very stylish and well done."
calsonic1000,"Jun 16, 2007",1/10,"Now, I don't usually have it in for films as much as this one, and indeed, I thoroughly enjoyed to work of the rest of the cast, but Natalie Portman! what was she doing? I've seen balsawood give better, more nuanced performances than her, and what was going on with that accent? Evey is meant to be a working class girl from inner city London, with an estuarine or cockney accent, but half the time she sounded Australian, and the other South African! she continually managed, throughout the entire film, to single-handedly wreck ever single scene she was in! Even V, with that Guy Fawkes mask had a less wooden face, she comes across like a plank of wood mistakenly cast into one of the movies most pivotal roles, nary a worst bit of casting have I seen."
bobn-10809,"Jul 15, 2022",10/10,"I have watched this masterpiece many times and each time I find more nuance and subtlety.Easily Natalie Portman's best performance so far (2022). Hugo Weaving is invisible behind a mask and yet his delivery of the poetry that is the essence of the film is simply sublime.For me, it's in the equal of Shawshank, The Godfather, Django, Pulp Fiction and Peaky Blinders.It's 'arty', it's 'cerebral' and it's political and social challenging... I love my John Wicks, 'Pirates' and Empire Strikes Back as much as anyone, this is next level."

Dan_W_Reviews,"Feb 21, 2023",9/10,"V for Vendetta is a thrilling and capturing film that explores issues of freedom, government control, and personal responsibility. Set in a dystopian future Britain, the film follows the story of a masked vigilante known as V, played by Hugo Weaving, who seeks to overthrow a totalitarian government and inspire the people to rise up against their oppressors.The film visually is absolutely stunning, with a dark and brooding aesthetic that perfectly captures the film's dystopian setting. The action sequences are well choreographed, and the use of slow-motion and stylized camera angles really adds to the sense of drama and tension. The score is also impressive, with a mix of classical and electronic music that complements all of the film's themes and tone.The standout performance of the film comes from Hugo Weaving, who portrays the mysterious and charismatic V fantastically. Despite being hidden behind a mask for the entirety of the film, Weaving is able to convey a wide range of emotions and create a compelling and sympathetic character without needing to show his face. Natalie Portman is also excellent as Evey, a young woman who becomes caught up in V's revolutionary plans and undergoes her own personal transformation.One of the film's strengths is its use of historical allusions and references. The film is set in a dystopian Britain that draws heavily on the historical context of Nazi Germany and the rise of fascism in Europe. The film's exploration of these themes and historical allusions adds depth and richness to the story, and helps to make it more resonant and impactful.Overall, V for Vendetta is a well-crafted and thought-provoking film that is as entertaining as it is insightful. The film's excellent performances, stunning visuals, and intelligent storytelling make it a must-see for fans of dystopian fiction, political thrillers, and action movies. While the film's themes may be challenging for some viewers, they are handled with skill and nuance, making this an important and worthwhile film that deserves to be seen."
NakedJeepBoy-1,"Mar 22, 2006",N/A,"I chose to see this movie based only on the trailer that I saw when I went to 'The Hills Have Eyes' and knew nothing at all about it. I must say though that it will probably rank as one of the best, if not the best, movie of 2006 (for me, that is.) I'll admit to being somewhat of a conspiracy theorist, and also admit to being rather mistrustful of our (US - G W H Bush) government. This movie though, should serve as a warning to all that may chose to give up 'liberties' to gain some vague 'security.' The totalitarian regime depicted in this movie isn't really all that far off from some that are currently in power in several so-called 'free' countries and we really must maintain vigilance that our leaders do not gain the powers that the leaders in this movie have gained.I won't give anything away here, but I strongly urge ANYONE who is concerned with civil liberties and free will to see this movie and to recommend it to all their friends.Writing this review a full five days after viewing, I still must give this film a complete (and totally out of character for me) ten out of ten, not for any acting, directing, or editing, but simply because I feel that it conveys a very valuable message that ALL people who value their hard-earned freedoms should take heed. Our founding fathers would probably love this movie, much as I did.Enjoy!!"
dublin9,"Apr 2, 2006",6/10,"Where do I begin? ""V for Vendetta"" is a fun movie, with an annoying aftertaste that gets more pronounced as you leave the theater and begin the walk home.I never read the book. I don't believe that a movie must stick to the dogma of the book that was its inspiration. It's a movie, with liabilities and assets that don't necessarily work in both mediums.It should be noted that as a right-of-center libertarian type who believes that the United States is the last hope for maintaining liberty in the world, I view things from a particular perspective.I like the concept of fighting for freedom in a repressive society. I'm not against the concept of using violence to overthrow tyranny. I don't mind borrowing themes from different movies and books. And I think that Natalie Portman is maturing into a decent actress. I don't even mind the occasional cliché, even if it pokes fun at my wonderful United States.But you know... you can't base a movie on clichés and political correctness. And that is exactly what the core theme of this movie is all about.I don't believe what I'm about to say involves spoilers and apologize if it inadvertently does, but in this flick, the villains are Christian males of European extraction, hereafter referred to as ""Pale Faces."" The film takes place in England. The United States is a warmongering trouble maker who has screwed up the world and the British Torries are a bunch of authoritarian tyrants who have turned Great Britan into a police state.In England everyone is a ""Pale Face,"" because they have expelled or killed everyone else. Naturally, the expelled Arab Moslems, West Indians and Africans were total innocents. They were in no way responsible for the violence, drug dealing and terrorism that apparently made the ""Pale Face"" majority kick out the Labor Party and vote for Torry fascists. And the British Labor Party (renoun for passing anti-free speech legislation and firearms confiscation laws) has passed from the scene.But wait folks, because it doesn't end here. Homosexual ""Pale Faces"" have been forced back into the closet and the Koran has been banned because it is a tremendously beautiful and profound work of art. Naturally, nothing is mentioned of the Bible where the Book of Psalms is generally considered to be one of the best done prose ever written. That goes well with the rapist pedophile Christian clergy that support the tyranny and are even in it's government.After all, we know that Moslem clerics are universally peaceful, never condone violence, believe in free speech, religious freedom, strenuously object to honor rapes and slowly sawing infidel's heads off like turkey legs.The only thing omitted to make this skewed scenario complete would be to have a few Jewish Doctors harvesting the organs of illegal aliens for sale in Tel Aviv. But I guess that would be too much, even for the Worchowski brothers to capitalize on. And by the way, I'm a practitioner of the Jewish faith and a military officer, so get over it.What a world! What a world! This is definitely not Kansas anymore.Up from the ashes comes a ""Pale Face"" hero in a mask. But wait a minute. He's not really a ""Pale Face,"" because diabolical genetic engineering has morphed him into a scarred and mangled ""any man"" (or ""any person"" if you wish).Natalie Portman gets her head shaved, truth and justice reigns and it can be assumed that ethnic drug dealers, terrorists and illegal aliens are invited back into England to restore civilization under a Socialist Labor government.Somebody give me a break."
auskooper,"Sep 12, 2025",8/10,V for Vendetta I feel like could be good for political commentary today. It focuses on a version of the UK that had partaken on a fascist government and a story following an uprising against it. I feel like it could be a good view of the overstep of government's power and the rights of the people. DC seems to be pretty good at making darker themes work and this proves just that. Action could be a plus. Overall a solid film.
SnorriGodhi,"May 29, 2006",1/10,"It seems appropriate that the 1812 overture is part of the soundtrack for this movie: Tchaikovsky might dazzle for a short while, but you wouldn't want to listen to it for over two hours.Even those who have not yet seen the movie, probably know that the Wachowski brothers have jumped on the anti-Bush bandwagon. The political message is not too blatant, but knowing about it helps to understand the symbolism.The movie is set in a future dystopian Britain (confusingly called ""England"": perhaps Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have become independent?). There is a second civil war in the USA, and ""England"" has fallen under a dictatorship with Christian theocratic overtones. By the look of the regime logo, the official religion seems to be Eastern Orthodoxy.For some reason, the title character thinks that blowing up the Old Bailey and the Houses of Parliament would help to restore the rule of law and democracy. He styles himself after Guy Fawkes, a Catholic terrorist who tried to blow up Parliament with everybody inside.Actually, the entire script appears to be written in blissful ignorance of the real world. For example, the dictatorship bans the Koran. What are the reactions of the 1.6 million Muslims in Britain? the movie does not acknowledge that they even exist. Another example: the movie opens with a British televangelist saying that America has fallen because it is more Godless than Britain.The internal logic of the movie world is just as shaky. The regime is only nominally Christian, so why does it waste police resources in persecuting apolitical homosexuals? and why does it impose a late-night curfew?It gets worse. One might think that an American civil war would generate enough fear to sustain a few dozen dictatorships, but the British regime fakes a few terrorist attacks for good measure. This conspiracy looks useless twice over when it transpires that people do not believe in the regime propaganda.On the other hand, people immediately believe the first TV broadcast from a masked man who speaks against the government without offering any evidence whatsoever. This is what I call the ""Running Man"" plot device: an anti-government video is shown on prime time TV, and popular opinion is immediately turned around. It is becoming a popular plot device.One might also wonder why V prefers knifes to guns, or how he manages to live in style in the very center of London, but this is nitpicking.There is a pretense that the plot devised by V is very clever. To support this idea, we are shown how very clever he is with falling dominoes. In practice, the entire scheme devised by V can be reduced to the following:BEGIN SPOILERS: The regime Security Chief has been plotting to murder the Dictator and take his place; V asks the Security Chief to carry out the execution in front of him; the Chief obliges (for reasons known only to him); finally, V kills the Security Chief. Incidentally, this is the only significant action scene, and it is poorly choreographed: the Chief's bodyguards stand like mannequins, waiting for their throats to be cut. END SPOILERSThis is not much of a plot, so it had to be padded with a revenge sub-plot, some prison scenes, and some explosions.In summary, this movie has two confused and illogical plots (the movie plot and V's own plot) which show no knowledge of the real world; and no points of interest other than a character with a cool costume. If you want to see what life might be like under a modern theocracy, see The Handmaid's Tale: it has a low-budget look, but what do you expect in a theocracy? If you want a well-told dark story with a masked super-hero, see Batman Begins. And if you want exciting sci-fi action with a decent plot, see Terminator 2: Judgment Day."
SoundJoeDunn1888,"Mar 6, 2024",8/10,"A cleverly put together story which is probably difficult for politicians to watch as it does not hold back on highlighting their weaknesses as human beings. Some real throwbacks to 1984 and casting John Hurt as the overlord was a clever touch. Weaving, Porter and Hurt all give great performaces. Stephen fry also is great in his role as the TV talk show host. Exciting and controversial. V for vendetta offers a look at a well tread genre of totalitarianism in film. With the added realism of being quite believable in terms of the possibility of the plot actually happening. Not with the bizarre character of V. But the premise is not totally unbelievable. Well made. Excellent twists and turns and thought provoking. Solid 8."

Hope they can make it someday.""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.""What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance?--Thomas Jefferson.There is an old saying in China:Those who are benevolent are called thieves, those who are righteous are called disabled, and those who are disabled are called men. When they hear about killing a man, they have never heard of killing a king."
berestov,"Apr 20, 2025",8/10,"Oh, these masks, which I learned about long before the film, which spoils the impression of the film quite a lot, but not for long and only at the very beginning.Well, the movie Literally 1984 is not because the main villain is played by the main character from the film adaptation of that very dystopia. Although such a decision in the selection of an actor really seems funny.Film adaptations of graphic novels have always been rare, and good ones even more so. Moreover, in the era before the popularity of Marvel and the rolling of all this to an incomprehensible conveyor of dubious quality.In almost every frame, it feels like the storyboards were drawn long before the film was made, and the competent transfer to the screen + the impeccable acting made the film so good."
brooksrob1,"Jul 22, 2023",10/10,"I saw this movie in 05 and loved it's message. I knew nothing of Alan Moore or Guy Fawkes...In 05 The internet exploded with DSL making its way into the homes of selected areas...2005 was the year it made it into Philadelphia and I began my journey of discovery of who we are, who the government is, our uncensored history. Despite being a USAF veteran from the Reagan era, I was still very ignorant of that information...I just finished watching V. It is probably the 4th time since its first showing. I have since used the last, nearly, 2 decades to learn. I share a birthday with Mr. Fawkes (april 13) as well, we two share our birthdays with Thomas Jefferson. For some reason, being born on that date, stirs a certain wont for justice and freedom.V for vendetta is a stirring masterpiece...Its message should be viewed and understood by all. Much has changed in our lives and it's very parallel to what Alan Moore and David Lloyd created all so many years ago. Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici.Veritas Vos Liberabit."
yolandezvabva,"Dec 12, 2024",10/10,"This is a politically charged, visually striking film that combines action and philosophy. A dystopian thriller set in a totalitarian future Britain, where a fascist government rules with an iron fist, controlling the masses through fear, surveillance, and propaganda. The film centers on ""V"" (played by Hugo Weaving), an enigmatic vigilante wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, who seeks to overthrow the oppressive regime. His plot intertwines with that of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman who becomes both his ally and an unwitting symbol of revolution.The film explores themes of freedom, tyranny, resistance, and identity, often drawing parallels with real-world political situations. It interrogates the role of government in individual lives and the cost of resistance. At its core, V for Vendetta asks: what is the price of freedom, and who gets to decide what is ""just""?The Guy Fawkes mask, which has become a symbol of protest worldwide, is central to the film's thematic focus on the power of symbols in challenging authority. V's mission to ""blow up the Houses of Parliament"" is not just about the destruction of a physical building, but a broader call for the destruction of the institutions that uphold oppressive regimes."
