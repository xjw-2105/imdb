Sleepin_Dragon,"Jul 9, 2023",10/10,"Young FBI agent Clarice Starling is on the trail of a ruthless serial killer, enlisting the help of the notorious cannibal and master manipulator, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.If suspense thrillers are your thing, this has to be counted among the greatest ever made. The film is genuinely unsettling throughout-you're never quite sure who is playing who.There's an absence of blood and gore; it relies purely on story and acting. For my money, it's infinitely superior to the sequels. The psychological terror is what makes this film so enduring.Jodie Foster is excellent as Clarice, but Anthony Hopkins... what can you say? Another performance that fully reminds you he's one of the very best. Outstanding.The chemistry between Hopkins and Foster is off the scale: the tension, the unease, the uncomfortable yet compelling bond-it's riveting.I think this is where my love of Chianti comes from.10/10."
MaxBorg89,"Oct 22, 2005",10/10,"The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.Best watched with a nice Chianti...P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?"
Scudder-3,"Feb 19, 1999",N/A,"Sweeping all five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) is quite an accomplishment.  Doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of Oscar voters.  It is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at the top of their craft.`Silence of the Lambs' is  the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another.  Foster's performance is absolutely brilliant.  While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie together.  The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  This is the perfect way to play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice.  Her only bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind.  The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.Director Jonathan Demme is masterful.  There is one scene late in the movie that I will not spoil.  It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  However, through skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at the theatre.  It set the stage for an edge-of-your seat climax.Do not miss this movie.The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see."
rogersellie-08609,"Aug 28, 2023",9/10,"Admittedly, I am not the most well versed when it comes to cinema and more importantly well thought-out and thorough reviews of cinema however I wanted to attempt to talk about The Silence of the Lambs.This is quite possibly one of my most revisited horror films, I find myself returning to it without boredom quite often. Re-watchablity is something I have noticed to be heavily lacking in the horror genre, something I personally equate to the overuse of the jumpscare, which isn't such a terrible thing but the intended effect wears thin by the third viewing.Silence of the Lambs being a more psychological horror does an immensely interesting job in their depiction of ""deranged"" or mentally ill criminals. Obviously Hannibal himself can become quite alluring given his disturbed charisma alongside the dustings of his criminal, cannibal, activities. His interactions with Clarice are superb and I don't get tired of watching their bizarre chemistry. Plus Jodie Foster did an excellent job as an up and coming FBI student, evidently a small fish in a large, male dominated pond.On that note I think the depictions of her relationships with men in the film are rather well executed. I would love to one day do a deeper more insightful reflection on this film and actually take into account story and cinematography, all factors really but I'll leave it here for now."
Fella_shibby,"Aug 11, 2021",10/10,"I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs and i still remember how two very old ladies were petrified n blabbering about the movie to my dad and one thing which stayed with me after that conversation was the praising of Hopkins acting by the two grumbling old geezers.I revisited it in the early 2k on a dvd which I own and was in awe by Hopkins mesmerizing performance.Revisited it the third time today but this time with my kids as they are 18 now but my wife is still not agreeable.Everything has been said about this first class thriller n there seems to be nothing left but i jus wanna contribute a lil by praising the performance of Hopkins.In the entire movie, it is Hopkins' screen presence n footage which keeps u glued.His character is charismatic but very dangerous that u don't wanna be rude with him.Some scenes are far fetched but like i said it is the mesmerizing performance by Anthony Hopkins which is the highlight."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jan 17, 2007",10/10,"I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic."" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things."
Vampyr-4,"Nov 14, 1998",9/10,This has to be the darkest and most brilliant film I have ever seen! The scene where Agent Starling is caught with the lights out has brought back my childish fears of the dark! Hopkins is one of the finest actors of our time. E-LECTORfying!
jennifernolanphoto,"Jul 17, 2024",10/10,"A masterful psychological thriller that remains one of the most chilling and compelling films ever made. The story follows FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) as she seeks the help of imprisoned cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter to catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill.Jodie Foster delivers a powerful performance as Clarice, portraying her determination and vulnerability with great depth. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is iconic, with his chilling calmness and unsettling charisma creating one of the most memorable villains in cinematic history. The chemistry between Foster and Hopkins is electric, making their scenes together tense and riveting.This movie is a deep dive into the complexities of human psychology and the darkness within. Its ability to blend horror with psychological depth makes it a timeless classic that continues to captivate and disturb audiences."
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Aug 28, 2004",10/10,"I've seen way too many thrillers. You name it: ""Identity"", ""Seven"", ""The Usual Suspects"", etc., etc., etc. I remember my friend being so obsessed with ""Silence of the Lambs"", that it drove me crazy. And I hated the movie naturally and refused to see it. But everyone told me that I have to see this, so I let my guard down. And had an open mind, and I'm glad I did. My friend was right, this is a great movie. It is so well acted, I couldn't even describe. I loved ""Silence of the Lambs"" and would recommend it to anyone. It's creepy and exciting. Trust me, you'll love it.10/10"
daoldiges,"Oct 11, 2022",7/10,"I saw Lambs during its original release and thought it was pretty good. Having seen it again recently I did still enjoyed it but not quite to the extent I did originally. One thing that didn't hold up was Foster's performance. She still does fine but it did feel a bit forced at times. Her concerns regarding her background and the flashbacks seemed slight this time around. The wrap up regarding Buffalo Bill character seemed a little convenient here. As for the dialogue it still mostly worked but some of it did come off as trite and while not exactly dated, just ordinary. Despite some shortcomings The Silence of the Lambs is still a solid thriller worth checking out."
tfrizzell,"Jul 21, 2000",N/A,"Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal.  At the heart of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5."
bobshiruncle,"Jul 23, 2024",10/10,"Upon watching, I have to say I was quite surprised by the distinct and rather blasé lack of wooly ruminants that the film's title suggested. Despite thoroughly enjoying the film once I realised it was about psychotic serial killers and not cloud shaped mammals, I cannot help but feel as if I was sold a little short by the title.Josie Foster is outstanding as the FBI agent, I did expect her to play a farm hand however, and Anthony Hopkins may well have delivered his best performance ever as the infamous Hannibal Lector, even though I had him pictured as the charismatic and loveable village vet, helping to heal the broken vocal chords of the widower's flock.Film Review: 10/10
Title Review: 1/10."
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Nov 16, 2005",10/10,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsRookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention. Truly remarkable. *****"
notoriousCASK,"Aug 1, 2017",10/10,"The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece you cannot miss, it's a masterwork of suspense that blends the elements of horror, crime and psychology into one tight and smooth story. It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.Based on the novel of the same name, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to make him help with the case.The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous, as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats, from the moment Howard Shore's ominous score hits the screen till the end of the film, especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nail-biting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish, and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience, while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of close-ups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette and minimal lightning from start to finish, which further enhances the darker ambience the story was aiming for. Moreover, the production design team has done a magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted, richly detailed and very well-lit. The script by Ted Tally, also packs a very well structured and tight plot, every character has a well-defined arc, all the themes are smartly addressed, the attention to detail is quite impressive, and the complete story and narrative are perfect.The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma, high intelligence and destructive violence, and gives a bone-chilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities, as with such an elegant and minimal performance, he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. Due to the charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors every scene they share becomes an instant classic.In conclusion, the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction, smart screenplay, splendid camerawork, tight editing, marvelous score and exquisite performances, that cemented the legacy of both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster by engraving their iconic characters into the annals of cinema. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets, for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is an outstanding achievement in genre filmmaking that has inspired and influenced countless thrillers since its release, and is not only the quintessential suspense and psychological horror film but also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see."
sherwoodbandit-1977,"Jul 2, 2024",8/10,"This is surely one of the greatest films of all time. It lands in the top 100 of several lists at the very least, and remains the only horror film to ever win a Best Picture Academy Award. I've watched it many times and it holds up incredibly well 33 years after its release. Howard Shore's haunting score tends to be the game changer for me. I know exactly what is going to happen and yet that music and Jonathan Demme's storytelling still manage to have me tense throughout the entire movie. The performances are all excellent and well deserving of the accolades they received. As often as I have watched the entire trilogy of Lector films, it is odd that I've never actually read the books. I think it is past time for me to dive into those but until that day I will continue to enjoy every single piece of cinema devoted to our favorite cannibal."
maeshamahmud,"Aug 20, 2019",7/10,"This movie has great directing, alright cinematography, amazing acting, solid plotline, brilliant writing, well-crafted characters, and average soundtrack. Although it was wasn't my cup of tea, this thriller movie is enjoyable from beginning to end even if you're not into those type. It is a slow-paced film but it gets intense after a while so patience is key and the acting in this movie made it far more interesting, especially Anthony Hopkins' and Jodie Foster's. Personally, a 7/10 but could be an 8 the next time I watch it again."
Sargebri,"Jul 12, 2003",N/A,This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and gore to have a good suspense film.  Anthony Hopkins performance as the deranged genius Lecter earned him a well deserved Academy Award and the same was true of Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling.  This film should go down in history as one of the greatest suspense films in the history of cinema.
TheAnimalMother,"Oct 30, 2022",8/10,"Without doubt the most well known and respected of all the modern serial killer films, and with good reason. While most point to the acting of both Hopkins and Foster as the main strength, the script is also very well written for the screen, and the entire atmosphere, well chosen music, and suspenseful pacing provided by director Jonathan Demme is nothing short of fantastic. To me it is really Demme's work here that separates this film from the pack. Anyway you slice it, you must see this monster if you're interested in serial killer films much at all. I saw it in the theatre during it's original run, as many did. In fact at the time, Silence set an all time box office record for an R rated film.8.5/10."
nickpal1983,"Jul 17, 2005",10/10,"There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)"
KastrJvsk,"Jul 10, 2025",9/10,"I've watched a lot of films in these genres, really a lot. This genre is not for everyone.For me, it was a revelation when I watched this movie. It's NOTHING like the trash that film companies churn out like they're on a factory line.Of course, the talented Anthony Hopkins did his part - the Oscar was completely deserved. Those 16 minutes of screen time he had turned into a masterpiece.Jodie Foster also did a great job in her role, and I was unfortunately disappointed in the next film, Hannibal (2001), when a different actress took over the role.Also, I have to mention the movie poster - I absolutely loved it. The design is stunning and perfectly captures the eerie, chilling atmosphere of the film. It's one of those posters you could hang on your wall and still feel the intensity of the film every time you look at it.Truly unique cinema!"
rnmqbxm,"Apr 14, 2025",8/10,"I watched this movie almost a couple years ago after reading the book almost a year before that, and while I thought it was a good movie, I thought it was kind of predictable and straightforward. Besides, I don't think it qualifies as a horror movie. The creepiest thing about the movie is the iconic poster. Is it for the faint of heart? No, but it's nowhere near as scary as it's made out to be. It is still a good movie, just maybe not the ""best scary movie of all time."" If you want a truly scary movie, this isn't it. The acting is still really Oscar worthy. Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster did a really good job with their character portrayals. Another thing people get wrong about this movie is that they think Hannibal Lecter is a psychopath. While he does have some really unhinged traits, he is not a true psychopath as he does have feelings for Clarice.In summary, Silence of the Lambs is still a good movie, but it is not a horror movie, or the best movie of all time. Just because it's overrated doesn't mean it's bad."
Clothahump,"Mar 20, 1999",10/10,"Great job by Foster and Hopkins.  Hannibal's part could have been fleshed out a little more, though (sorry, couldn't resist that one).  The book described him in more detail and made him even more reprehensible; the movie could have spent five minutes more and done the same."
chiragrathod09,"Apr 12, 2023",10/10,"A psychological crime thriller, fully agree to say it wow on the basis of raw crime scenes of brutal killings and FBI investigation of a psycho killer to catch another!The story is presented simple and not too much complicated by the director and writer i.e. To catch a psychopath killer with the help of another psycho killer who is behind the bars.Although the story is not about too much mind games, it's just of some psycho killings in which the director created some ruthless killing and postmortem scenes which will be very difficult to see if someone fears to see the blood.Technically it is a well-crafted movie where the camera is used very beautifully to capture closeup shots. If we talk about acting performances, every character did a great job.Overall its will be a delight to watch this crime thriller in which viewers will not have to put their mind. It is just to experience a few brutal killings and crime scenes and How FBI agent ables to catch the killer."
qvmmq,"May 31, 2023",10/10,"This movie is so gorgeous. Its like an art project. The cinematography makes me wanna take my eyes out because after this movie, theres nothing else I can see that hits that level of beauty. Anthony Hopkins did an amazing job and so did Jodie Foster. But even the more minor roles are amazing like Kasi Lemmons as Ardelia Mapp. The plot is so thoughtfully put together. The characters are great, creepy, and like a painting. I cannot describe how well this movie is made when it comes to the creepiness. Or anything. This movie deserved all of the awards and I hope everyone will enjoy it as much as I."
Klingon-3,"Jan 22, 1999",10/10,"""Silence of the Lambs"" is one of those movies a person could watch over and over again and never get bored.  The mixture of acting, screenplay, and direction make it one of the jewels of American cinema."
chinaskee-418-613225,"Nov 9, 2021",5/10,And am scratching my head as to why it won a Best Picture Oscar. It's not a terrible movie but it's a pretty standard B thriller with A list actors in it. I won't be going out of my way to see it again. And I'll be skipping the special features on the DVD. Nothing about this film impressed me enough to watch any promos on how it was made.
pooch-8,"Jan 12, 1999",N/A,"The Silence of the Lambs, having accomplished the rare feat of winning all five of the major Academy Award categories, is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.  Gruesome, pulpish material was transformed by dedicated participants on all levels of production, and a film that would have failed in the hands of many others wound up becoming a modern masterpiece.  Taut direction and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film's power, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performances of Hopkins and Foster.  Their interplay -- and remember, they only share a handful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting."
Theo Robertson,"Oct 30, 2005",8/10,"It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to ClariceSadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so HopkinsI know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it"
TheLittleSongbird,"Jul 15, 2011",10/10,"I have seen some great movies, old or new. The Silence of the Lambs is an amazing one, while not my personal favourite of the year of 1991 it was a well deserved Best Picture win in my opinion.Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the film is shot in a ceaselessly atmospheric manner and Demme never lets the suspense drop. The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking.The Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well. Jodie Foster is the one who holds the film together and her performance here is one of her most excellent, and I mustn't forget Ted Levine who is very chillingly effective as Buffolo Bill. Anthony Hopkins however steals the film, it is his perhaps most iconic character and he proves that although he is in only a portion of the film his performance lives long in the memory.All in all, amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
salmanalkhamees,"Dec 26, 2024",8/10,"I believe this film occupies a unique niche and could be classified within a specific genre of its own. It expertly blends various elements of horror, seamlessly incorporating aspects of thriller, psychological, gothic, and crime genres of horror. While the psychological elements are undoubtedly the most dominant, the other themes complement the film in a distinct way that feels just right.I must commend Anthony Hopkins for his portrayal of Hannibal. His performance was nothing short of horrific, adding an eerie and dark undertone to the movie. The surrounding environment subtly reinforces the gothic themes, enhancing the overall atmosphere of the film.Overall, this was a highly enjoyable experience, and I am certain I will rewatch it to unravel more of its mysteries. I have no doubt that I will discover plenty upon revisiting it. While the film doesn't necessarily require multiple viewings, it is enjoyable and you may still find, from the depths, new images from the same material."
pippocanadese,"Jul 16, 2021",9/10,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, it won all the major Academy Awards as a proof that it's one of the best films ever made and that Demme is one of the best director ever existed. So sad he passed away too soon. The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours. Anthony Hopkins delivers such a powerful performance: it's impossible to forget him. The brilliant film's ending leaves us asking for more."
Leofwine_draca,"May 11, 2014",10/10,"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter. Most importantly, it's never less than gripping and completely frightening. A true masterpiece of a movie."
witch king,"Oct 22, 1998",10/10,"The normal human being's fear of being attacked, bitten open in a violently impersonal manner and then taken in as food is as old as the first human being's shattering witness of such a primordial act. In the thousands of years of human evolution, intelligence has armored [most of us] against predations of that horrible sort. But even more incomprehensible is an attack, for mere hunger's sake, by one human being upon another! When first we see Dr. Hannibal Lecter, his madness is merely the subject of comment, responsible or otherwise. As we view him [uncomfortably] from the safety of a theatre seat, we can only imagine the deep wells of need which forced him to savage his fellow human beings in this manner, and this makes all the more terrible the awful scene in the Memphis courthouse. Into all this walks Clarice Starling, her innocence and anxiety both touching and troubling. She is essentially tricked into taking the assignment to ""interview"" Lecter by her superior, Jack Crawford, who callously deems her expendable. She somehow summons the rural courage of her youth, forged from the furnace of her weary sufferings, and becomes the blank sheet for both Crawford's and Lecter's amusement. As the result of being pulled in opposite directions in the murderous tug-of-war between Lecter and Crawford, Starling is almost totally alone in the film. In spite of her genuine liking for Aredlia Mapp, Starling's isolation is nearly so complete as to be claustrophobic. Director Jonathan Demme's finely-nuanced work here is well served. Her enlightenment takes place primarily in darkness, whether the setting is Lecter's cell in the dungeon, or whether the apotheosis takes place in the demon's lair. There are almost no likeable characters in the film save Starling. This makes it easy to root for her to overcome the furies which have pursued her since her tenth year. Clarice's predatory instincts are to bring a vicious psychopath within the scope of punishment. In sharp contrast, the other main characters in the film are possessed of predatory natures of a baser, more primitive kind, whether it is Dr. Frederick Chilton's need for sex, or Crawford's need for control, or Lecter's need to destroy for pleasure. The music score by Howard Shore is reminiscent, in a eerie way, of Bernard Herrmann's work in Psycho. Shore's opening theme foreshadows the loneliness and desperation of Starling's dual quest, which is to kill both beasts: the one without and the one within."
DrEbert,"Dec 28, 2007",9/10,"The late Gene Siskel hated ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" thinking of it as being far too gruesome and distasteful and as having zero originality to it. Roger Ebert gave the 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying that he did enjoy the film but that some scenes were lacking, such as the ending.Siskel missed the point. The chill from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" doesn't come from revolutionary originality, which it doesn't have. The chill of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is in how it maximizes fear and suspense in a plot that one could simply describe as ""police on the hunt for a serial killer."" It is here where ""The Silence of the Lambs"" set the bar; it takes a B-movie concept and raises it to the level of a taut A-level thriller.The plot has the FBI on the hunt for a serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill"" (played by Ted Levine). Stuck, the lead investigator (played by Scott Glenn) wants to get the perspective of another serial killer, to try and see inside the psychotic mind. He recruits the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) to talk to the brilliant and cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (played by Anthony Hopkins). Lecter agrees to help Starling, but only if she will grant him the sadistic pleasure of allowing him to see inside her mind.Even though the plot is about Buffalo Bill, with Lecter only having 16 minutes on screen in a 2-hour movie, Lecter and Starling are way more interesting and end up being the driving force for the film. In many films, an excellent performance by the villain can steal the show away from the hero. (Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" featuring a brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson as The Joker, is a prime example of this.) In ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" we have strong performances by both of the lead actors. Hopkins' Lecter is clearly everybody's favorite character, but Foster's performance as Starling is powerful enough to not get eclipsed by Hopkins.Not getting eclipsed is something of a theme for this film. Our heroine is not trying to be heroic. Starling is strong and courageous and could kick anyone's butt, and yet she comes across as vulnerable. She is a woman in a man's world and everywhere she goes, there is a sense of being dominated. She is 5'3"" in a film where most other characters are over 6' tall. (The camera often skillfully has Starling occupying only the lower half of the frame; seeing so much space above her head makes her look shorter and more vulnerable.) Her black hair (which is different from Foster's natural light brown) makes her appear paler than she really is. Other characters are always hitting on her. She always whispers and is always giving a nervous smile. Even her slight Southern accent gives her a ""country girl"" appeal that helps the audience identify with her. Starling is an FBI agent-in-training and is clearly quite skilled at handling dangerous situations, but she still shares our vulnerabilities. As a result of this, her fears are our fears. This is the true skill of Jodie Foster's performance; she manages to play Starling as a woman of great strength and vulnerability at once.Credit should also go to the film-makers. One strong point is their choice to only be selectively gruesome. This is one key difference between ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and garden-variety serial killer movies. The latter often derive their scares by showing incredibly brutal images and portraying utterly disgusting scenarios. Fear is generated by the audience's own horrified reaction to what is being shown on screen. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does not give in to that temptation though. It casually shows us several rather gruesome images to get us nervous, but then keeps some of the most disturbing stuff cleverly off-camera. Of course, this serves to only make them scarier; what could be so gruesome that not even this creepy film is willing to show it on camera?I do have criticisms. My main complaint is that Buffalo Bill is a lightweight who left me longing for the much more interesting and menacing Hannibal Lecter. Buffalo Bill is sick, twisted, and downright nauseating, but he also is a coward, who has to resort to trickery and gadgetry to make himself formidable. Lecter, on the other hand, has all the tools he needs right there in his brain. He is the smartest character in the film and he knows it and he loves it. He is so charismatic that he can enter the mind of anyone, no matter how hard they resist. This makes Lecter scary even when he is off-camera. Buffalo Bill is not really all that scary even when he's on camera; he's more just plain gross.The thrill of this movie is psychological. We don't feel thrilled because of cool action sequences or original plot ideas but rather because of the fear that we can relate to and the mind games that Lecter plays. Something of a void is left in scenes in the latter half of the film, where Lecter is absent. (Here, I agree with Ebert.) Nonetheless, Foster's performance makes up for that. Even in the final showdown with Buffalo Bill, the thrill is still there because we feel Starling's fear, even though the audience has not been particularly scared of Buffalo Bill up until now. (Here, I disagree with Ebert, who feels the showdown is lacking.)""The Silence of the Lambs"" is thrilling and chilling. The main villain is a lightweight, but the secondary villain is among the most menacing and evil in cinema history. I think that after we walk away from this film, we somehow are left with the feeling that, at least for those 2 hours, Hannibal Lecter managed to get inside our own minds as well."
LeonLouisRicci,"May 2, 2013",7/10,"Heaps of praise have been given to this multiple Oscar winner by Critics and Fans alike. It is sometimes disturbing, sometimes terrifying, and sometimes the Characters are engaging. Sometimes.The Film is inconsistent in both style and substance. There are way too many close ups. After a few, the intended uneasiness is lost. Most of the sets are attractively unappealing and does give the sense of a forbidden place.A striking performance from Hopkins but some of his cryptic inclusions using anagrams are uninteresting and at worst confusing and make no or little sense of irony. Jodie Foster seems forcing it, especially when asked to reveal some secret recalling the title of the Book and Movie. There are also some less than brilliantly enticing lectures from Hannibal about coveting and a scribbled note that is laughably sophomoric and we're off to catch the truly creepy Buffalo Bill.Overall it adds up to be less than it seems. Some clever stuff but it is carelessly sewed together and with some tugging starts to unravel. Overrated, but influential, with some disturbing and dank scenes that make this a bumpy, irritating, and not quite completely satisfying ride to the Dark Side."
uzielis,"Jul 12, 2017",4/10,"Sorry, but... I'm with Gene Siskel on this one, though I didn't dislike it as much. It was a rather well acted film, but the glowing reviews made me expect too much... When I sat down in the cinema, I said, 'Scare me.' The movie went along. I said, 'Scare me.' The climax came. 'Scare me.' The movie was about to end. 'Scare me.' And then it was over. I didn't find it scary at all... I mean... Boyz In The Hood should've won the Best Picture Oscar... That one had a heart. This one... It's not the worst film, but it wasn't my cup of tea.'Dream much, Will?'"
FrenchEddieFelson,"Aug 10, 2019",N/A,"I just saw, for the second or third time, this cinematographic masterpiece, during an « UGC culte » evening, in Paris. The list of the Big Five Academy Award winners is short. There are currently three of them, in nine decades:It Happened One Night (1934),One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)and ...The Silence of the Lambs (1991). This is not really surprising, this film being excellent, endowed with a script skillfully elaborated byThomas Harris, with an irreproachable casting includingAnthony Hopkins,Jodie FosterandScott Glenn. In addition, the directorJonathan Demmedelivers a work obviously enjoying an admirable preparatory work.Without unduly spoiling the script, if you have not seen it yet, by the greatest fluke: a psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is able to provide Clarice Starling with providential information about Buffalo Bill . But he agrees to help her only in exchange for information about the young woman's private life. Between them is established a link of fascination and repulsion.As a synthesis: a thrilling must see. 9/10 of 10"
OrangeSequins,"Jul 2, 2024",9/10,"""Silence of the Lambs"" was released in 1991 and inspired several thriller films, as it has become a classic. However, it also has some graphic violence, so it's not for everyone.I have to say, although I liked the movie, I appreciate the movie ""Seven"" (stylized as ""Se7en"") much more because it was more twisty, even more tense and visually even more stylish and unique. I actually consider ""Seven"" the greatest thriller film ever made and also one of the best movies ever made. But that doesn't mean ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a bad movie! In fact, I find it really outstanding in many ways.Jonathan Demme's direction is brilliant, one of the film's strengths. Another thing that makes the film excellent is the acting of Anthony Hopkins. But the other performances are also good, for example Jodie Foster is also really great in her role of Clarice Starling. The characters are multi-dimensional and interesting. The writing is great, the atmosphere is often tense and suspenseful, and the dialogue is just excellent.So, all in all, ""Silence of the Lambs"" is actually a really great and suspenseful thriller movie worth watching."
User24503154,"Jun 21, 2024",10/10,"I watched this film a few nights ago and I love it. A lot of people that I know don't like this movie but a lot of people I know love this movie. Going into it, I didn't know if it was going to be good or not. After watching, I can comfortably say that this is one of my favourite horror movies at the moment. I can't wait to see the sequel to this film since it follows up from the end of this movie. If anyone is thinking of watching this film, I recommend you to watch it because it is one of the best physiological horror movies of all time. The characters are great, the kills are great and so is this film."
martyfoxzorro,"Jun 29, 2024",9/10,"Thomas Harris is my favorite novelist when it comes to bringing his novel to film. Michael Mann's Manhunter was exceptional and William Peterson created a role that would later rule television in CSI. Great casting and effective direction brought this novel to life setting it apart from other serial killer films. Hopkins is great, but this was more an extraordinary role and character, rather than stellar acting. Jodie Foster, who is always good, is just right in her understated performance but again I attribute this to Harris' exception character development. If you loved this movie as much as I did, watch Harris' earlier work and the movie, ""Black Sunday"". It's just great storytelling that isn't over-manipulated when brought to the screen,"
mulhollandheart,"Jun 2, 2025",10/10,"The Silence of the Lambs is groundbreaking for numerous reasons. Its critical and commercial success made it the film most directly responsible for the rise of plots centered around the hunt for serial killers in the 1990's. It's one of only three films to this day to sweep the Big Five categories at the Oscars. To top it off, it's the only horror film to date to have won Best Picture among all 97 winners. I personally believe the reason why it'll remain such a beloved classic for many years to come has entirely to do with the fact it has something real to say about human nature. Moths, in particular, serve as powerful motif for change. All three of the core characters have undergone some form of life-affirming transformation. Clarice Starling's strong sense of justice made her want to pursue a career as an FBI agent, following her father's homicide at the hands of burglars. Buffalo Bill/Jame Gumb is heavily implied to have been made into a heinous individual, rather than being born as one, to achieve his own metamorphosis. His likening towards cocoons act as a clever symbolism for repression of personal identity. And then there's Hannibal Lecter, whose background is wisely kept enigmatic but is revealed to have been incarcerated for cannibalistic deeds towards his patients. Lecter is easily one of cinema's most complex and nuanced villains due to his eerie charisma, as well as his dangerous embodiment of finding fulfillment in exploiting psychological wounds for his own amusement. Ted Tally's intricate adapted screenplay and the brilliant central performances by Foster, Levine and Hopkins greatly assist in conveying its thought-provoking thematic elements. Demme's direction, accentuated by Craig McKay's seamless editing chops, is relentlessly observant and palpably tense throughout, until it culminates in a wickedly nail-biting cat-and-mouse chase in its third act. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography captures the beautiful solitude of its Midwest setting that accurately reflects Starling's isolated inner world. Howard Shore's score is as sweepingly majestic as it is fittingly creepy. All in all, The Silence of the Lambs works because of its sensible approach to a disturbing subject matter and profoundly artistic presentation."
mattlocke-39277,"Jul 15, 2020",6/10,Watching this flick in 2020 has a much different feel than doing so 20 years ago. To me it simply hasn't aged well.
BaronBl00d,"Jun 19, 2000",N/A,"With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre.  It is a first-rate production all around.  It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two lead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in all aspects!"
Atle_O,"Jun 26, 2024",8/10,"I just finished watching The Silence of the Lambs, and wow, it was really good. This movie had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It's a thriller about an FBI trainee named Clarice Starling who is trying to catch a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. She gets help from another killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is very smart and really creepy.Jodie Foster, who plays Clarice, did an amazing job. She made me feel like I was right there with her, trying to solve the case. And Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter was just incredible. He was so intense and scary, even though he didn't have a lot of screen time. Every time he was on screen, I couldn't look away.The story itself was really interesting. It wasn't just about catching a killer; it was about getting inside the minds of these characters. The way Clarice and Hannibal talked to each other was so tense and full of suspense. I also liked how the movie showed Clarice's struggles as a woman in a male-dominated field. It made her character even more relatable and strong.The music and cinematography were also on point. The dark and eerie atmosphere added a lot to the creepy vibe of the movie. The scenes in Hannibal's cell were especially well done, making you feel trapped and uncomfortable, just like Clarice.Overall, The Silence of the Lambs is a fantastic movie. It's scary, smart, and keeps you guessing until the very end. If you like thrillers or psychological movies, you should definitely watch it. I can see why it's considered a classic. This movie is going to stick with me for a long time."
LucaProvini11,"Jun 9, 2025",10/10,"A truly exceptional film that keeps you glued to the screen from beginning to end. Excellent direction, very beautiful the suspense that the film gives, the plot is fantastic, it proposes that of the book in a superb way. Excellent acting too, especially that of Hopkins in the role of Dr. Lecter, a truly fascinating and scary character at the same time, perhaps the best psychopath in the history of cinema. Fantastic also the dialogues between Clarice and Hannibal, whose relationship is truly intriguing and engaging. Excellent the ending and really beautiful the escape scene, which struck me particularly. Fantastic, a true masterpiece."
pulpficat,"Sep 30, 2023",9/10,"Directed by Jonathan Demme, The Silence of the Lambs is a film that walks the fine line between fascination and repulsion with all the grace of a serial killer at a masquerade ball. First and foremost, the film's accolades are as numerous as the bones in a crypt - five major Academy Awards to be precise. It's a cinematic experience that's impossible to ignore, much like the eerie whispers of Hannibal Lecter himself.But what truly sets this film apart are the meticulous details. The way it lovingly depicts the art of skinning humans, the delicate ballet of butterfly chrysalises in a room filled with decaying corpses, and the unsettling sight of a severed head submerged in a jar - it's like a gruesome culinary show for the morbidly inclined. All these scenes could both send shivers down the spines and elicit eerie laughter from fans of the horror genre. Who knew that watching someone prepare a meal could be so riveting?And as if that weren't enough, The Silence of the Lambs introduces not just one, but two extraordinarily captivating serial killers! It's a marvel (albeit a macabre one) that Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the cannibalistic genius with a taste for the finer things in life, is portrayed with such malevolence and danger while exuding a magnetic, irresistibly seductive aura. He manages to bewitch not only the main protagonist, the heroic Clarice Starling, but also the audience itself. Hannibal's charm is so potent that it could make you forget that he's one bite away from serving your liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. But who could resist those fiery, almost crimson eyes and that sinister grin, filled with rows of tiny, tantalizing teeth?In The Silence of the Lambs, horror, charm, and an unsettling sense of allure perform a deadly waltz. It's a captivating dance, much like how Clarice Starling steps through danger with the grace of a deer in a lion's den. This dance seduces you even as it sends shivers down your spine, and makes you question your own sanity for enjoying it, much like relishing a slice of forbidden fruit in the garden of the bizarre.The Silence of the Lambs is a testament to the brilliance of its characters and their complexity. It's a film that plunges you into the darkest recesses of the human psyche while simultaneously drawing you irresistibly closer to the abyss. Enjoy it like it's a gourmet meal; just don't forget to check under your bed for any unexpected dinner guests after watching it."
daltonbriant894,"Apr 23, 2023",10/10,"Rewatched February 27th, 2021A favorite of mine for years and a worthy Beat Picture winner at the Oscars, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins give the performances of their careers. Now whether or not you agree with category placement for Hopkins, which I've for years agreed as leading due to importance to plot but after this viewing I'm actually seeing it more as supporting, his along with Foster's are Oscar deserving performances. Ted Levine is also incredible as Buffalo Bill and was deserving of awards attention but sadly did not. The screenplay by Ted Tally had incredible dialogue especially between Foster and Hopkins and allowed them to showcase their talents. The film would not have been as successful without masterful direction by Jonathan Demme. As far as techs go, editing is top notch. It's no surprise to see that the costume design was completed by 12 times Oscar nominated with 4 wins Colleen Atwood, because her work combined with the production design by Kristi Zea and Karen O'Hara brings magic to the screen captured by the exquisite cinematography of Tak Fujimoto."
TheRealBatman87,"Nov 4, 2025",10/10,"I just got out of the cinema, and even though I've seen The Silence of the Lambs countless times before, this big-screen experience felt truly special. The film hasn't lost any of its intensity, if anything, it feels even more chilling and immersive in a theater setting.There's really not much left to say about Anthony Hopkins, he is Hannibal Lecter. Every close-up of his face, every look, every movement radiates pure control and menace. The way he never blinks when talking to Clarice makes him all the more terrifying. It's a performance beyond acting, it's transformation.And then there's Jodie Foster, who completely owns her role as Clarice Starling. In a male-dominated world, she portrays both strength and vulnerability with incredible authenticity. The POV shots in particular make you feel her tension, her fear, and her determination.The Silence of the Lambs isn't just a thriller, it's a psychological duel between two brilliant minds, executed with precision, intensity, and haunting beauty. Even after all these years, it remains a cinematic masterpiece, gripping, disturbing, and absolutely unforgettable."
Primtime,"Oct 23, 1998",9/10,"After watching this movie, one can only imagine Hannibal Lecter waiting around the corner for them in great anticipation. Yes, this movie has a creepy theme to it that is usually saved for B-grade horror flicks, however it works very well in this intelligent and thought-provoking film. Hopkins performance was one of the ten best I've ever seen. Demme's direction was almost flawless and kept the viewer feeling disturbed throughout the film with his use of uncomfortable situations (ie- someone following you in the dark, being stuck in a well, being locked in a room with no way out). What struck me most about this film was the glorification of Hannibal which seemed to portray him as a good guy even while the viewer knows about his murders, cannibalism and mind-manipulating. I felt good about Hannibal getting free, which really disturbed me.A must-see and must-have for one's video collection. 9/10 stars."

jonsefcik,"Dec 4, 2025",7/10,"People put this movie on a pedestal like it's one of the greatest films of all time. 8.6/10 average user rating on IMDb, and #22 on the IMDb top 250? Come on guys, it's not THAT good.I believe this movie is held in such high regard because 1991 was a weak year for movies, and this handily won Best Picture simply by virtue of all the competition paling in comparison.It's very good, possibly great, and I can see why it was a pretty groundbreaking cinematic achievement for its time. I could see how it inspired stuff like Se7en and The Sopranos. The technical aspects and at times creative camerawork are top notch, and the grounded writing makes the world feel more palpable. Why don't I fawn over it? I think it's just because the characters feel a little detached. The whole movie is people doing their jobs, and as a result we feel like we never really get to know them. The filmmaking, though technically impressive, feels a bit cold and doesn't help immerse me in this story.It might sound like I'm having trouble putting my thoughts in writing, but Silence of The Lambs is just one of those intangible ""it just didn't do it for me"" movies. Remember when Captain America: Winter Soldier came out and everyone was hailing it as one of the best action movies of recent memory? It just didn't do it for me in the same was that film didn't. People are always shocked when I tell them it was just ""alright"" or ""pretty good"". Silence of The Lambs fills a similar space in my memory. I can enjoy it when it's on, and I appreciate what it inspired, but I feel there's many other movies that do this sort of serial killer procedural a lot better.7.6/10. I could MAYBE see my rating going up to an 8 with time, but rating it that high doesn't feel right just yet."
ThunderKing6,"Oct 2, 2020",5/10,It was not bad. Mainly an over hyped.The pacing felt like a distorted quilt.The whole movie was saturated with grainy character development. I was unsure of the direction this movie wanted to take. Felt all over the place.The jail scene and the ending are the only parts worth watching.Main character was subpar. Not bad and not outstanding either. I didn't care for her past. It's the usual only the main character goes through trauma and flash backs as they try to solve a problem.Hopkins did very well but this whole movie is still overrated. It's an award-winner that's undeserving of so much hype. The Silence of the Lamb is just like the DC Joker movie. It won awards but the movie was lackluster.Verdict: Odin What have you done?
TheRealDarkFang,"Jul 14, 2025",9/10,"Retro Review: The Silence of the Lambs is the first movie of the 90s with crime/mystery genre which i had watched it was a near-perfect experience.The Silence of the Lambs follows Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee, who is sent to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and imprisoned cannibal, to gain insight into another serial killer, ""Buffalo Bill,"" who skins his victims. As Clarice digs deeper, Lecter toys with her mind but offers key clues, forcing her to confront her own fears and trauma. It's a tense, psychological game of cat-and-mouse, with horror lurking beneath the surface of every conversation.The plot, the twist, and the ending were great, and I just love the theme and simplicity as well. Anthony Hopkins's acting was great as Dr. Hannibal Lecter-the smart and dangerous type-and the main protagonist, Clarice, played by Jodie Foster, was also great.

muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 25, 2025",9/10,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. What makes it so brilliant is the incredible tension and psychological depth between its two main characters, Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. Their scenes together are a masterclass in filmmaking, with the camera work often putting you right in the middle of their intense, cerebral face-offs. Jodie Foster is fantastic as the determined and vulnerable Clarice, and Anthony Hopkins' performance as Lecter is iconic, chilling, and unforgettable. It's a gripping, intelligent, and expertly crafted film that gets under your skin and never lets go.Is it a remake of another film? No, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is not a remake. It is a film adaptation of the 1988 novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. It is the second film to feature the character of Hannibal Lecter, after Manhunter (1986).Is it worth watching? Yes, it is absolutely worth watching. It's a classic for a reason and one of the rare films to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay). It's a genuinely scary and expertly crafted thriller that remains a benchmark for the genre."
drakeking1,"Jul 14, 2023",10/10,"The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite of all time. It is a masterpiece of suspense, horror and psychological drama. The performances of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are unforgettable, as they play a rookie FBI agent and a brilliant but twisted serial killer who form an unlikely alliance to catch another murderer. The film is full of memorable scenes, such as the first encounter between Clarice and Hannibal, the night vision chase in the basement, and the chilling finale. The Silence of the Lambs is a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, makes you think, and stays with you long after it ends. It is a classic that deserves all the praise and awards it has received. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves cinema.🎬"
Billy_Boy_,"Apr 28, 2025",9/10,"The Silence of the Lambs is one of those movies that completely lives up to its reputation. It's smart, creepy, and somehow gets better the more times you watch it. Jonathan Demme crafts a thriller that's not just about solving crime - it's about diving deep into the minds of its characters.Both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster deliver career-best performances. Foster's Clarice Starling is tough, smart and vulnerable all at once, which makes you really feel her fear and determination. Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter definitely is one of the most iconic characters in cinema history. He's chilling, fascinating, yet somehow weirdly charming - all while being on screen for about only 20 minutes. Their dynamic really is the heart of the movie.If I had to nitpick a bit, the middle part drags just a tiny bit, but honestly, it is a rather minor issue compared to everything the movie does right."
marifevisitacion-99018,"Aug 1, 2024",10/10,"The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours. Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him. His character, Dr. Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like). A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer. The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist. He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners. If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors. Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling. Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more."
roens_reviews,"Jun 28, 2024",6/10,"This movie was a MASSIVE letdown. I've heard so many great things about it that I thought I was in for the best movie of my life. It was not.The ONLY thing that kept it afloat was the acting/casting. Hannibal Lector is truly an incredible character (with also the coolest name ever), and Anthony Hopkins absolutely nailed it. He was of course the stand out, but all of the others were fantastic too.With the exception of this, there was nothing else to the movie that really stood out to me. I did, however, find myself confused a few times.Overall, I don't know that l'd recommend it. I have no idea how it became such a classic, but to each their own I guess. Final score of 6.5/10."
Sanjeev-902,"Jul 25, 2025",10/10,"The Silence of the Lambs is one of those films that just gets under your skin - and stays there.Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter? Straight-up terrifying. He's in the movie for like 15 minutes total, and still manages to be one of the most unforgettable villains in cinema history. Calm, polite... and absolutely chilling. That voice alone gave me goosebumps.And Jodie Foster? So good. Watching her play Clarice - smart, vulnerable, determined - was incredible. Her scenes with Lecter feel like a chess match. You're watching two brilliant minds go at it, and you can't look away.The film balances horror, mystery, and psychology perfectly. It's not all blood and gore - it messes with your mind. You feel the tension in every scene. It's uncomfortable... but also addicting.The writing, the direction, the acting - all top-notch. It totally earns its place as one of the greatest thrillers ever made."
Mustafa-716,"Aug 29, 2025",10/10,"This movie is the best film I have ever watched in my life. The acting, script, cinematography, subtext, suspense, flow-everything is nearly perfect. Even though Anthony Hopkins appears in this film for only 16 minutes, he left a lasting impression on everyone's memory. Truly outstanding acting. At the same time, Jodie Foster also delivered an unforgettable performance with her exceptional acting in the film. In my opinion, a score of 8.6 is too low for this movie. Even that is not enough for such a masterpiece. If you haven't watched it yet, watch it immediately-you won't regret it."
blazeklopp,"Nov 16, 2024",10/10,"I am in a film study class in school and my teacher has this poster put up in class. And I have always wondered why it's call "" Silence of the Lambs"" and what makes it such a good movie. I found some free time yesterday so I was able to watch the movie. Safe to say I was not disappointed.This movie is totally worth the watch. The way that this movie is constructed is a pice of art. The scare factor is also there. There are plenty of weird scenes that make the viewer want to turn off or close there eyes. I for a fact had one scene where it was very hard to watch, but that's what makes this movie so good for a scare movie. It puts those scenes in the movie."

Rewatching The Silence of the Lambs, I'm once again struck by why this film remains such a standout. Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Thomas Harris's 1988 novel holds the esteemed honour of being one of only three films to sweep the Big Five Academy Awards. After watching it again, I fully understand why-it's an absolute masterclass in suspense, character, and storytelling.Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both deliver performances that are nothing short of stellar. Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling still feels raw, determined, and vulnerable in all the right ways. I'm consistently drawn into her internal struggle as she navigates the grisly world she's thrown into. Hopkins, of course, is unforgettable as Dr Hannibal Lecter. Even knowing what's coming, his chilling yet charming presence still manages to create a satisfying unease. The way he plays with silence and stillness adds so much to the tension.Demme's direction is incredibly tight, balancing character-driven drama with psychological horror. I really appreciate how he uses close-ups and framing to create intimacy and unease, making me feel like I'm part of these tense conversations. The screenplay does a fantastic job of translating Harris's book to the screen with a clear reverence for the source material. It's faithful but never afraid to make smart adjustments to enhance the cinematic experience.I love how the film doesn't rely on cheap scares but instead builds its horror through character and psychology. It's the kind of thriller that stays with you long after the credits roll, and I'm always impressed by how well it holds up over time.The Silence of the Lambs is more than deserving of its accolades. It's a timeless thriller that still feels fresh, with performances and craftsmanship that set the bar for everything that followed. An absolute classic.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.0

Movie-Dood198027,"May 26, 2025",9/10,"The Silence Of The Lambs is one of the BEST Psychological horror movies ever made , it is gruesome , Stares directly at your soul , Vicious , and Dialouge-heavy.The Movie itself has been recognized as one of the best psychological horror movies ever , winning a LOT of oscars(5) which is amazing , The work in this movie was absolutely marvellous, Jonathan Demme's Directorial Performance was Very well done , The Zoomed in shots of the victim and the confronter is amazing , such a nice touch because the movie makes you feel like YOU are part of the conversation , in a way it strikes your body to feel the creepyness of Anthony Hopkin's Performance as Hannibal Lecter.Hannibal Lecter is Probably one of the SCARIEST villians of ALL TIME , the way he talks is BONE-CHILLING, and his chosen words are spoken to strike fear into the viewers bodies , and the way he STARES at the camera (Like i said nice touch by Mr. Jonathan Demme ) is horrifying , the way he speaks and talks on its own is such a way to show that this is not an ordinary psychopath this is Hannibal Lecter . Anthony Hopkin's Performance was LEGENDARY he indeed deserved that Oscar that he has won and the performance is still remembered till this day and it is without a doubt a very horrifying character , his Smart moves combined with his scary presence is on itself one of the key factor elements to this whole character that was made to be one of the scariest villains of ALL TIME.Jodie Foster did an amazing performance , i went to this movie not expecting a ""WOW"" performance by the lead actress but she definitely made a Huge significance being in this motion picture , her accent and the way she interviews the Serial Killers is amazing , she is agressive , Young , Bold , Vicious , The way she deals with ordinary stuff so easily is So good and the way she interviews the last victim and that Scene in his house was SO freaking scary.The soundtrack i did NOT expect it to be this good , the soundtrack combined with those bone chilling performance is amazing , the soundtrack sounded very good and it was like it was really for this movie the composer definitely did an awesome job.Overall one of the most critically acclaimed Horror films but still nowhere near as GOOD as the shining but this was One of the movies i HAD to see , the performances , the camera movements , the way the characters stare and the bone chilling dialogue-heavy layout of this movie is Astonishing this was definitely One of the TOP scariest Films ever made. 9/10."
AgentDice,"Oct 8, 2013",10/10,"Once upon a crime, Hannibal Lecter was a manipulative psycho-killer compensating for his incarceration by messing with people's minds. Then Hannibal happened and he suddenly turned into a dandy anti-hero... Watching The Silence Of The Lambs again really puts things into perspective. Jonathan Demme's astute adaptation of Thomas Harris' last good book entwines the horror and detective genres to enduringly shocking effect, while Anthony Hopkins' Lecter and Jodie Foster's Starling fizz up an unsettling chemistry that was utterly lacking in the sequel.I haven't seen a movie this perfectly wrapped in a while. I recently re-watched it and it blew me away and it only gets better the more you see it.The performances from everyone are great. Foster sold every scene she was in. But, of course, Hopkins stole every scene he was in and was a powerful anti hero who was scary even when concealed because you know his mind is working at every second. Always planning and he's rarely wrong. His escape was an amazing scene. Levine gives a suitably scary performance but just doesn't stand up to the greatness of Foster and Hopkins.All the characters main characters are deep people are deep people with clear motivations. The police officers are the complete contradiction to this who abuse their power to do what they believe is right, and end up being wrong. It's clever.Everything is wrapped together really well, the performances were great and it's full of memorable scenes.I'm giving The Silence of the Lambs a 10/10."

It was O.K."
murtaza_mma,"Apr 24, 2009",9/10,"Silence of the Lambs is a quintessence of a profound character study and a rare and vivid demonstration of an actor's subtle brilliance and his improvisation in manifestation of a nebulous entity (Lecter), almost single-handedly immortalizing it and in the process elevating himself to a position of unqualified envy and ubiquitous acclaim. In fact, one is likely to suffer, either from inarticulacy or verbosity while describing Anthony Hopkins portrayal of sadistically sophisticated Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's trademark, his wide open glacial eyes, devoid of any emotion, not only makes him deviously equanimous, but also egregiously peculiar. The fast, slurping-type sound invented by Hopkins that Lecter does, is as fascinating as it is chilling and Lecter's infamous ""Good evening, Clarice"", is as enthralling as it is vicious. Anthony Hopkins's performance is the shortest ever and the most memorable to win an Oscar in the leading category.Hopkins as Lecter, is incontrovertibly and incredibly at the top of his game and it is his brilliance that gets the best out of the other actors, especially Jodie Foster. In fact, it won't be a hyperbole, that Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs and more so in its sequel, Hannibal (which is my favorite of the series, as the story completely revolves around Lecter, giving him more exposure), is one of the best, the world of cinema has ever seen or offered. In spite of having some of the most gruesomely disturbing and viciously graphic sequences, Silence of the Lambs, is one of the most decorated and enthralling movies of all time. A must watch for avid fans and eclectic viewers.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
joyous-sunshine,"Jul 8, 2015",9/10,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" deserves its recognition as a classic and one of only three movies in history to win the ""big 5"" Oscars. The protagonists were brilliantly portrayed. Hopkins very much adds to the story through his creepy performance. His articulate speech and refined southern English accent were jarring as he rarely blinked and calmly expressed his cannibalism. The way Lecter masterfully picked at Starling's insecurities while she tried to get his assistance in finding Buffalo Bill made the character all the more terrifying. Foster, unsurprisingly, is extremely believable as a young woman who wants to prove her worth for her future occupation by tackling the ambitious case. The directing flows smoothly. Great use of extreme close-ups are used to see the actors' emotions and connect with them. The flashbacks were introduced before they seamlessly illustrated the effects Lecter's prodding conversations has on Clarice, making these scenes easy to follow and making Foster's character more of a protagonist. On a side note, I appreciated the conscientious effort made to include a diverse cast in the film, with African- Americans featured prominently in important secondary roles. With that being said, I did feel that the movie was not perfect. The way Clarice finds a lead as to where Buffalo Bill is hiding seemed far- fetched to me. I felt the case could have been further developed before Starling reached the conclusion she arrived to. Moreover, I felt that Buffalo Bill could have used more of a back-story than what is given in order to increase the depth of his character. While some insight is given by Lecter, it is not enough to understand what caused the gender/identity issues that drive Bill to kill. This made his character seem a bit two- dimensional as the antagonist of the film. In contrast, I found Lecter's character rich in depth, as he would be considered a bad guy unless he was helping to find another mentally ill murderer. His character does not hold back his psychopathic ways or complete, self-centered disregard for the well- being of others if it doesn't suit his needs. All in all, this was an incredibly well done film that could probably only be improved if not for time restraints."
Movie_Beta,"Apr 4, 2024",9/10,"The Silence of The Lambs as a novel adaptation and stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins plus a strong support cast. This is one of those rare generational movies that has morphed into pop culture and is ubiquitous (and notorious) beyond the boundaries of cinema.Released in 1991, it has to be admitted that it is not as shocking or terrifying as it once was, as we as a generation have become desensitised to the topic of serial killers through mass media exposure. However, even 33 years cannot diminish the power of this movie and most notably the harrowing portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter by Anthony Hopkins.Hopkins is outstanding and terrifying in equal measure as the highly intelligent and psychopathic doctor, playing him as still, cold and calculating which is somehow scarier than some outwardly unhinged maniac. It's a truly superb portrayal of a killer that has since redefined how such a character is portrayed in cinema.Foster, though also superb, is asked to overplay the gender role of being a (young) woman in a male dominated world, and as such is portrayed as weaker than she should be, to reinforce this stereotype (as a highly trained psychologist I'm pretty certain she would not fold so easily upon meeting even such a monster as Dr. Lecter), but this is a minor quibble that is only highlighted through time and changing gender roles in greater society.This is a truly great movie with performances and a story that is clever but not too over the top, combining to make some really special cinema and will make you rethink your meal wine selection choices for many years to come!9/10."
WorldMovie99,"Apr 1, 2023",10/10,"The movie is mind boggling still. I watched it many years ago and I had to see it again to understand it clearly. At the very first watch it would seem unclear but you need to be thorough to grasp it. Technically its a top notch film and performances are Oscar worthy. The script and narration are perfect too with all important edges covered. A warning to all its viewers that the gore themes are not compromised due to its story. You need to be interested in crime genre prior watching this.Hannibal's psycho behavior seems convincing as the embodiment of fear. Buffalo Bill too is good, the BGM is well expressive and the camera works are very impressive. A women among the gang of men also is a courageous theme within it. The two criminal story going side by side along with the sincere lady going to arrest one with the help of the other is also a thrilling set up. But I am yet to clearly get the meaning of the title in reference to the film. That is the reason behind the name 'silence of the lamb'. Could it be the metaphorical, representing humanity slaughtered by psychos?The film is about a women investigator Clarice who needs to help her seniors in catching a serial killer. Clarice hard work ultimately helps her to get the suspect. Hannibal help to Clarice is also clear. He wrote the clue in her files and she decoded it with the help of her accomplice. She intelligently followed her clues from one to another and finally caught the criminal. Hannibal's psychological type weapon hit exactly the spot which helped him to get access to the pen. And he got his freedom. The maker is praiseworthy for going very deep in studying criminal characteristics. He also successfully visualized it through a thrilling storyline. A really masterpiece film upon serial killers but Caution required for watching it. It's a dark themed movie with gory details of crimes and not all people are into such genre. A 98 on a scale of 100."
PartTimeCritic,"Mar 5, 2023",10/10,"Is it a strange thing to say that this is my favorite serial killer movie of all-time? I guess I could put it more politely and say that it's my favorite ""crime"" film of all-time...that's better right? For whatever reason, especially as a young adult, I had a fascination with crime stories - especially serial killer stories. There's just something inherently fascinating to me about a human who has crossed a sacred line of humanity into great evil. What can we do in the face of it? I know I'm not alone here; the history of cinema and television being filled with crime and murder stories demonstrates many of you are fascinated by it too. So what is it about The Silence of the Lambs that makes it stand out from so many of the other crime stories? For my tastes, the film features one of the best fictional crime stories ever told, layered that story with just the right thematic strands, and executed it all with the unmatched craft. In other words, it's everything I think a great crime story should be."
saramolenass,"Mar 3, 2019",10/10,"T is definitely one of the best films in the 90s and one of the rare films that well deserved its oscars.Demne tells the story very patiently through proper character development. this a thriller and they can't go through every single details of the characters . However the film explains the psychology behind crime and the motivations of Clarice Starling very well. See Jodie Foster in the very final scene while buffalo bill is wearing his night vision goggles . Truly terrifying scene and Jodie's performance is just amazing,"

moonspinner55,"Mar 27, 2002",6/10,"Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence Of the Lambs"" is a grisly spook show, and one without any sympathy for its victims (or for the audience, who get a good hammering on the head). Yes, the Oscar-winning performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have become legendary (and for good reason, they are both intensely focused and driven), but the picture leaves scummy feelings in its wake, as if Demme had suddenly turned carnival barker for the ultimate freak show. FBI trainee Foster, invited into the gruesome investigation of a serial killer, seems to climb the ranks awfully easily, being allowed to do potentially dangerous work on her own as well as going mano a mano with Hopkins' Dr. Hannibal Lecter, an imprisoned cannibal who may hold the key to the crimes. There's chilly art in Demme's presentation--it's a polished piece of work--but I soon tired of the Woman as Hero underlying theme, complete with a who's-in-the-dungeon finale that doesn't work at all, the sacrificing of real human drama for shock value and lots of outlandish violence (such as a mutilated security guard hanging from the top of a prison cell like an angel). The black-humored kicker is that all this perverseness is good for a raunchy thrill, and what better way to arouse a stultified audience than to give us two psychopaths--one who eats his victims, the other who carves up women. **1/2 from ****"
saffron-3,"Oct 6, 1999",2/10,"This film has a silly premise, a lousy script, an implausibility factor of about +100 and a dreadful performance by Anthony Hopkins.  It's the last point that I'll mention about first:  has a more pretentious, breathy performance ever been seen on film before (outside of the Richard Burton oeuvre)?  As for plausibility:  can you imagine the FBI sending a trainee to interview a serial killer, seeking information about another serial killer on the loose?  That was a major flaw in the (also overrated) novel.  I guess it's easier to write about, or make a movie with, a younger woman who's still apt to get all scared-ified and emotional and who doesn't have those annoying crows-feet.  The script is terrible, too--it tries to present Hannibal Lecter as being some kind of 'psychic vampire'.  Witness Hopkins' expression after Jodie Foster tells him her tale of lamb-napping woe--like a famished person who's just been given a good meal.  Give me a break!  And don't tell me that the FBI couldn't have made a connection between the missing skin pieces on the dead girls' bodies and figured out what the loony-tunes they were chasing was doing.  It takes Jodie Foster's character seeing a dress pattern with darts on it to make the connection.  What a group of dim bulbs.  And they wait until HOW MANY young women are killed before they scratch their heads and say, ""Hmmmm, maybe the killer knew one of the victims!""  How did this stupid waste of celluloid ever garner any critical praise?  I mean, I know the Oscars annually bestow 'Best Motion Picture' awards on undeserving titles, so I don't care that this movie won so many--but what were the nation's film critics thinking when this made so many 'Top 10' lists?"
manikas8,"Nov 7, 2005",10/10,"One of the best movies of the 90's and one of the few thrillers that can match up with Alfred Hitckok's movies.Certainly the perfect choice for the character of Hannibal Lekter, Sir Anthony Hopkins who manages to make the ""cannibal"" a kind of hero. The film won 5 academy awards but in my opinion it worths for more. I would like to stay more in the performance of Anthony Hopkins that is really majestic and gives the film more quality.Hopkins gets to the skin of his role and makes you to feel that he is a real psycho killer.Also the direction is perfect by Demme and makes the viewers to be absorbed by the fight of the FBI agent Clarice Starling and Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Jodie Foster fairly wins the Academy Award for Best Actress in Leading Role."
Derek237,"Mar 16, 2003",10/10,"The Silence of The Lambs explores the life and mind of Clarice Starling, a female FBI agent who has a lot of issues to deal with. Somehow by fate, she ends up meeting Hannibal Lector, and they strike up a very unusual relationship. The most interesting parts in the movie deal with the 2 of them just talking.The highlight of the movie is obviously Anthony Hopkins' performance. He's delightfully creepy as Hannibal. The whole suspense of the character is thinking he's about to do something violent, since throughout the movie you only hear stories about the terrible things he's done. When he finally does do something, it really pays off because it's one of the scariest and most memorable parts in the movie.The Silence Of The Lambs appeals to many people. That's because it can be viewed from so many angles, and that's why it's become a part of our pop-culture. I'm not going to write any longer, because I'm having an old friend for dinner.My rating: 10/10"
eldante-33692,"Jun 28, 2016",10/10,This movie is the greatest psychological thriller. It has all the makes of a great serial killer movie as well as twists and turns on plots. The story was written perfectly and the actors performed their best in their roles. I wouldn't change a thing about it except that I would of like to see a newer rendition to this movie. I love the series and which more would be done with it. In my opinion it's a must watch movie along with the prequels and sequels to this movie. Anthony Hopkins was the best lead role in this movie and his performance was beyond astonishing. I would recommend everyone to watch all of his movies especially this one.

bkoganbing,"Aug 3, 2007",9/10,"It seems as though there is a serial killer out there who's grabbed the daughter of a United States Senator and this guy has zoomed right to the top of FBI's Most wanted. This man's modus operandi is to keep the victims alive for a while before killing them so they're racing against time to find him. Desperate situations call for desperate measures.The desperate measure is, you want to catch a serial killer, bring in one as a consultant. That's why FBI trainee Jodie Foster goes to visit Anthony Hopkins in prison. Hopkins is not just a killer who eats his victims, he's a brilliant psychologist himself with insights maybe no one else has.Of course his price are some cheap insights into Jodie Foster's soul, thrills he probably got when he was in practice.The Silence of the Lambs in less capable hands could have just been another cheap slasher flick. Instead the leads who walked off with the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress give riveting performances of a sick twisted psycho and a woman who became the biggest feminist icon since Sigourney Weaver by confronting some demons of her own. It's the best work that Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have ever done and let's not forget the Oscars won by Director Jonathan Demme and the Picture itself for being the Best in 1991.A couple of players who made their marks on television later on also score well here. Anthony Heald who was Buffy the Vampire Slayer's handler plays the psychiatrist in the institute where Hopkins is incarcerated and who Hopkins makes a fool of and says at the end he's far from done with. Also Ted Levine who is Captain Stottlemeyer on Monk plays the serial killer the FBI is trying to catch. Also look for a good performance by Brooke Smith as Levine's potential victim.The Silence of the Lambs with its taut direction and riveting performances has an appeal far beyond the horror genre. See it and you'll know what I mean."
Sammy56,"Sep 3, 2005",10/10,"I think there is not much to say, all who like thrillers know this one. This is just so brilliant movie, Brilliant Thriller, more of the mind than action. With spot on cast for this kind of movie, especially the chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster is great. And Jodie Foster was perfect choise in her role,as she is known to be very clever/genius and gifted, and was known this in her childhood.Very good example how good movie can be made around few things, if people doing it are the right one. Last line is of course for great Director who made this all possible.I hope there would be more like this, but todays lines in Hollywood is not giving much a chance for that , its a shame."
SnoopyStyle,"Dec 5, 2015",9/10,"Trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is recruited right out of Quantico by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Services. He's investigating serial killer Buffalo Bill who skins his female victims. He's interviewing imprisoned killers but Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to cooperate. Starling is sent to talk to Lecter.Director Jonathan Demme takes the serial killer genre onto another level. It is brilliantly intense and brutal. It's a solid entry but then there is Hopkins' Lecter. It is an iconic villain for all times. From the moment he first appears, he steals the movie. It's rare that somebody can produce a character that is so original and so memorable. He is so impressive that he actually overshadows the penis-tucked human-skinning lotion-basket transvestite serial killer. Foster is also pretty solid. She brings a competence to the role that is needed for the outrageous villains to shine."
druryd,"Oct 2, 2003",6/10,"Silence Of The Lambs is an average movie that has been hyped to classic status. The superb performance by Anthony Hopkins is the only saving grace of this film.  Jodie Foster is terrible as usual, she has to be one of the worst actress of our time.  The biggest problem with the film is the absurd premise that a FBI student (She is not an agent) would be left alone to handle an investigation of this magnitude. Sorry but that just isn't going to happen.  This movie is worth one viewing for Hopkins performance and that's it.  It shouldn't even rate in the top 500 movies of all time.  5.4 on a scale of 10."
mjneu59,"Jan 3, 2011",3/10,"Despite the impressive credentials this so-called thriller is nothing more than quality exploitation with highbrow pretensions, none of which can patch the many plot holes and jarring improbabilities. The script presents an awkward adaptation of what must have been a much fuller (if equally unpleasant) novel, compressing the material with too many transparent narrative gaps and shortcuts, including some amazing FBI deductions worthy of Sherlock Holmes.The idea of using one psychopath to help catch another is intriguing, but having two serial killers dilutes the impact of the story, especially when it focuses more on cartoon cannibal Anthony Hopkins, already in custody until his illogical, unlikely escape. Nothing much is learned about the other killer-at-large (an apparent reject from a David Lynch freak-show), and the film ends as a typical damsel-in-distress drama with haunted house shock effects.The screenplay is overloaded with bogus psychological significance and padded with irrelevant flashbacks, and the film was shot entirely in blunt, video-format close-ups, with director Jonathan Demme apparently trying to get inside the mind of his characters by simply shoving the camera in their faces. The manhunt is also highlighted by a gratuitous excess of explicit gore, but that doesn't stop it from having a happy ending, for everyone involved, including cannibal/killer Hannibal Lecter."
Michael_Elliott,"Oct 17, 2011",N/A,"Silence of the Lambs, The (1991)**** (out of 4)Intense masterpiece about an FBI trainee (Jodie Foster) who is tracking down a perverted serial killer and must receive help from Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector (Anthony Hopkins). THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a rare example of a film picking up Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay. It's a very rare thing for any film to do that but once you see this film it's easy to see why it was such a hit back in the day and why it hasn't lost a bit of its impact in the years since. I've always felt that the film was about as close to flawless as any film could get and it's strongest aspect is the brilliant performances mixed in with some of the greatest characters ever written. The film really is a mechanical workshop for how to build up suspense and beat the viewer over the head each step of the way. I've heard many people say they love the film but felt that it was just too intense for its own good, which I think is almost fair to say. Director Jonathan Demme does a masterful job at building all of this tension up and I really love how they pretty much try to make each and every scene something very creepy. This film has rightfully become legendary over the years and many of the best scenes contain some of the greatest suspense. The early scene where we first see Lector looking out at us. A wonderful sequence where Foster must crawl into a garage not knowing what she's going to find. There's a creepy autopsy sequence. Then, there's the famous scene with Lector inside the ""new"" jail cell and of course the perfect ending. The movie certainly doesn't throw in cheap humor to try and break the tension and instead it just continues to assault the viewer. The violence, while graphic at times, never takes away from what you're viewing and the film is so classy that it never falls into some sort of cheap exploitation flick. The performances really bring the characters to life and the way Foster and Hopkins play against one another has rightfully put them as some of the most memorable of all time. The way the two play their little chess match while trying to gather information from the other perfectly adds to the creepy atmosphere and you really do feel as if you're watching something very special. Scott Glenn is also very effective as Foster's mentor. Ted Levine plays the serial killer and I've always felt that he's the one who most often gets overlooked. There's no question that this film belongs to Hopkins and Foster but Levine is just so terrific in his part of Buffalo Bill that I've always been somewhat shocked that he doesn't get more attention. The tense music score, masterful cinematography and wonderful dark look just adds to what really is the perfect thriller. Since the release of this movie there have been many sequels, rip-offs and countless other films inspired by this one but nothing has come close to the perfection which is this movie. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a rare example of a blockbuster actually delivering the goods and it's clearly not only one of the best films of the decade but also one of the greatest ever made."
bulleetz37235,"Jun 29, 2005",10/10,"Reasons this is so good:It has some of the best characters ever created embedded in a storyline that is so famously crisp, and clever that to watch it even after 100 previous viewings is still an absolute delight.It is a film of sheer talent, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins play each others nemesis yet hide this in a tight net of trust and curiosity over each others character. and I think the unbelievable potency of Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter is so strong that to actually merge him into reality is totally feasible.Jonathan Demme also pulls off such fantastic direction, that is shockingly vivid and imaginative, and the atmosphere created with eerie scores in the background and repulsive locations (such as Buffalo Bill's house) is brilliance to a high degree. If you only ever watch one film a year I suggest you watch this."

leosmith-11166,"Dec 18, 2015",10/10,"I have seen lots and lots of films, but none were ever so well written like Silence of the Lambs. The characters are amazing and there is a lot of shown development with them, especially with Hannibal Lecter, who has to be one of cinemas greatest Villains. The film tells a gruesome story that you want to leave your memory immediately after you've watched it.The Silence of the Lambs is more a thriller than a horror. There are few intense/scary/suspenseful scenes, but besides that it's just a story of a creepy mystery. Beware an awesome plot twist awaits you.I'll would like to keep on writing, but I'm having an old friend for dinner"
jelenasharpova,"Aug 4, 2013",10/10,"I think Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors ever, no one could have played Hannibal the way he does, really not. The way he looks at her and talks to her, it's amazing. I also love Jodie Foster, she's not some kind of barbie girl and I like that. She has a personality. It's one of the best movies ever. It's honestly legendary. It's the best part of the trilogy, really. The others are kind of wanna bes, of course, Hannibal is amazing but it's not the same.I love all of the actors and actresses. I had a blast watching it, it's so exciting, it scared me but in a good way. The first time you watch it, you never know what is going to happen, that is really awesome."
SpelingError,"Jul 9, 2016",9/10,"When hearing about how terrifying Hannibal Lecter is, one would likely be confused after they look up reviews which explain why he works so well. It's really hard to do what Anthony Hopkins did in this film. While most other actors' performances would be likely dismissed as bland and boring, Hopkins nailed his performance so well that he rightfully earned his place amongst the very best movie villains ever put to screen.A serial killer who goes by the name of ""Buffalo Bill"" kidnaps and kills women to skin them and make them into coats. An F.B.I. cadet named Clarice Starling has to confide in a cannibalistic serial killer locked up in prison to help her locate him before he kills someone who he recently captured, Catherine Martin.When the viewer is first introduced to Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Starling is walking down an ominous hallway. She walks past other criminals locked up. The first few she walk by behave as you would expect. One is smiling and saying ""Hi"" to her, and the last one is jumping up at the prison bars. When she gets to the end of the hall, Dr. Hannibal Lecter is standing up and facing her with a blank expression on his face. He is still and motionless. He says ""Good morning"" to her calmly. He seems harmless. As Starling continues to talk to him, the viewer has a minor sense of relief for what the film could've thrown at us, but Hopkins' voice gives the viewer a feeling of deception which makes that sense of relief vanish. This is the first time we're introduced to him, and Lecter is able to unnerve the viewer so much by conveying so little. The great scripting and great acting made him quite a memorable character.Seeing his calmer moments on screen are very memorable. However, it leaves you wondering what he's capable of. Eventually, about 2/3 of the way into the film, the viewer gets to see Lecter pop in one of the most horrifying and memorable horror movie scenes of all time. The scene is so unexpected, and the sheer creativity of it is out-and-out disgusting to even think about. Watching the film a second time, it's frightening to find out what could've happened to Clarice Starling if their calm meetings had played out differently. However, it becomes very apparent that he wouldn't harm her as he grows to value her company. He never threatens her, and he always acts helpful and nice to her. Also, after he finds out how they both share similar childhood wounds, the viewer loses suspicion that he'll do something bad to her. Also, it took me a little while to pinpoint how that was a very effective piece of dialogue which got me to actually identify with Hannibal Lecter.It's a great accomplishment that the film gets us to like Hannibal Lecter. The reason is because he helps Starling locate Buffalo Bill which would also save Catherin Martin from him in the process, and he proves to be very helpful to her throughout the film. Also, the audience senses that he won't hurt her. On top of that, Hopkins performance brings wit and style to the character. The character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter succeeds on so many different levels.There are several scenes from the film which work very well at terrifying the viewer. The scene when ""Buffalo Bill"" kidnaps Catherine Martin is a believable technique which seems like it would work in real life. It shows how after you get too close to ""Buffalo Bill"" for too long, you would reach a point of no return, and by the time you realize that something bad is going to happen, it would already be too late.One of the most memorable kill scenes from horror movies happens near the final 1/3 of the film. I won't spoil it, but it works very well. Earlier in the film, it hinted that something was up after he stole a character's pen. Once you realize what's going to happen, you're left waiting for Lecter to pop as you've waited to see for a long time. The scene is very gory, and the aftermath of it is even more sickening. When you think that the scene's finally over, the film pulls the rug out from under you, and it shows you a creative, yet highly appalling image which likely won't leave your head anytime soon.The scene at the end in Buffalo Bill's was an amazing idea for a climax. It is so suspenseful, and as soon as it starts, you have minimal hope that it will turn out good. Then, director Jonathan Demme adds in one final aspect into the movie to up the tension so high that it's one of the most suspenseful climax's ever for a film. He makes it seem clear that Starling won't go home unless she either gets a miracle or gets badly injured in the process. This scene is terrifying, because of the film's clever manipulation of the visuals and the fact that we've come to really like Starling, and we don't want anything to happen to her.In conclusion, this is definitely a masterpiece, and it's one of the best horror films of all time. Anthony Hopkins' performance was perfect, and this movie should be looked at and studied off of for years to come. Other horror movie directors should study off of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and many actors should definitely try to do what he did. After the viewer witnesses all of the pros that this movie has to offer, it leaves you a brilliant closing scene which lets you go off on a high note. Anyways, I do wish that I could talk about this film longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner."
tylerkom,"Nov 27, 2020",7/10,"This is a film that has entered the pop culture consciousness on behalf of the supporting character Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins') chilling performance. And if there is really anything that makes this film noteworthy it is his legendary performance.Beyond his performance, there are other reasons to like what this film does. It's very well paced and the dialogue is well done. The characters are mostly logical and smart. The classic thriller trope of ""finding"" new evidence is done tastefully and the investigation that takes place in the film seems mostly believable. The characters are well written with nice depth for the lack of time spent on character development. And finally, the film wraps pretty well into a very nice package. Jodie Foster also does a solid job in the lead role.Unfortunately I must point out some small...missteps that happen throughout the film. This isn't a spoiler: Starling is a member of the FBI academy and not a fully fledged agent yet. I am led to believe that this relationship is more fleshed out in the novel, but as the film presents it, it's hard to say why she would be a prominent investigator on a high profile FBI investigation. Without spoiling the plot of the film, I will also say that she makes somewhat questionable decisions to the end of the film. Furthermore, her deductions, although fine on the surface, seem problematic in that they are quite elementary. It seems like whatever investigators were previously on the case should have checked out the things which Starling ends up investigating. Curious to say the least.All in all, it is a great film that is pulled down by some slight missteps that break the illusion of grandeur for me."
aidanmanleyfilmmaker,"Aug 4, 2012",9/10,"What separates this movie from other horror movies is, nowadays horror movies have lots of gore and blood. But this one had scary dialog, and real suspense.Hannibal Lecter really got me! I mean he was described as a psychopath and he looked calm, then he showed us his true colors!""Buffalo Bill"" was crafty and crazy! The only thing he shows affection for is his poodle ""Precious""Clarice Starling proved that she has what it takes to be a professional when she used her skills to track down the sadistic ""Buffalo Bill"".For these reasons and more this movie will remain a suspenseful masterpiece."
b-61888,"Jul 6, 2022",10/10,"I personally really like the metaphor in the movie, every time you watch the movie, you find something new, and there are a lot of movies now that use it. Besides the excitement, it makes you forget it's fictional."
werefox08,"Aug 14, 2012",9/10,"Anthony Hopkins creates a character who is intelligent, calm, calculating, charming and.....he enjoys eating people. (a slight personalty flaw !!). This is a completely compelling man...who loves the ""high arts"", is articulate ...is a Doctor...but beef ,pork , chicken and lamb ..just don't ""do it"" for him. Dr Lecter needs that pure unmistakable taste of homo sapien. The Lecter persona has become as big as any movie ""legendary character"".(we must remember--of course--he IS a monster !!) The movie does have a few flaws here and there , but Silence of the Lambs is a really great psycho thriller. Made in 1991, it remains a landmark motion picture. Hopkins was born to play Lecter....One feels almost hypnotized when those bright eyes are sparkling (or if he appears hungry)."
Wrapper30,"Jan 12, 2011",9/10,"I had read this book by Thomas Harris and thought it would make a great movie but was concerned when I heard that Jonathan Demme was making it. How wrong I was though and I was overwhelmingly surprised. It was the first film about a serial killer where it did not rely on strong elements of violence and gore but simply left it to the imagination. Obviously Hopkins and Foster get all the plaudits and rightly so but this is one of the only films that has so many superb minor characters such as Barney, Ardelia Mapp and Bill himself. I urge those who like this movie to watch the making of documentary as it is truly fascinating. A roller-coaster ride of emotions and tension which I enjoy every time I watch it."
sandeepjoseph,"Aug 5, 2005",9/10,"I found this film extremely scary and haunting, even though the actual violence wasn't overpowering by today's standards. In some ways, the suspense and the build-up to scenes is quite ""old school"" and proves that this approach still works. There are has been a lot of analysis why this film is so powerful. One talks about how Hannibal Lecter only appears for a very brief time in the movie, yet others talk about him and build him up, how some of the set pieces refer to our deep psychological fears...in the end, it works well, and I would highly recommend it. I have read critics who say that the killer Clarice is pursuing is too stereotypical, or simplistic. I would beg to differ: I find that that character too is quite scary, though doesn't have the three-dimensional nature of Hannibal Lecter. And what of Clarice? she is brave, and even though it was made in the 90s, I think this film is still one of the first I saw with a woman as lead detective. Full marks to the script, and the book of course, because Clarice is quite fallible, not perfect, and this makes the story more real and unsettling. We're fighting in her corner, as it were, but we're not sure if she will win, unlike other male-dominated movies. And one personal quirk: watch out for Tom Petty's song, ""American Girl"", I found the usage interesting, fun and ironic, and the song has stuck in my head post the movie."
bardia-moose,"Sep 23, 2014",9/10,"Very well directed with a heavy and ominous tone that shadows the entire movie. The sound and editing all function in creating and maintaining the film's eerie atmosphere. Reviewing this film, how could one not mention Anthony Hopkins chilling and creepy performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He portrays, without a doubt, one of the best psychotic characters in cinema history. He's so good that at one point, you may start to, dare I say, root for him? The chemistry between Hopkins and Jodie Foster's character is brilliant and the dialogue between them is masterfully crafted. Once you let Hannibal into your mind, you can never get him out. After watching The Silence of the Lambs, I don't think I can ever forget it. Are you up for the challenge?"

rhrunge,"May 6, 2013",6/10,"Saw this movie when it first came out and thought it was pretty great. Suspenseful, well-acted, different....and critics were heavy-handed with praise; which probably heavily influenced my opinion. Recently re-watched it, and had a more critical opinion. 1) What was the deep inner turmoil that Starling was suppressing all those years? That she saw a lamb get slaughtered on a farm as a young girl? So what??? 2) Did she REALLY surmise ANYTHING from the ""clues"" he gave. Seems she somewhat randomly stumbles onto his house. 3) Too many closeups; too many plot contrivances. Nearly every scene is a closeup shot. Adds intensity at first, but quickly becomes annoying. That Lechter could uncuff himself from behind with the tip of a pen and overtake the two Keystone cops, not very believable. Less believable that he was ever placed is some makeshift iron box in the middle of a library or gymnasium. 4) She chases him down into his night vision dungeon? C'mon!! OK I get it for the movie's sake...but way too unrealistic. And with all the FBI's resources and knowledge they're somewhere else storming the empty house of a false lead? C'mon."
NEFARlOUS,"Mar 25, 1999",1/10,"Having read both the Prequel (Manhunter) and Silence of the Lambs, I was looking forward to seeing how the transition to the screen went.A while back ""Manhunter"" was released, and although abridged and with a different (but better) ending, I loved it. Particularly Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter, soft spoken, analytical and very, very calm. However, always an undercurrent of danger and a mere whisper of insanity.Now on to ""Silence of the Lambs"" - Hannibal Lecter has gone from being an all too believable real-life monster to a giggling Hollywood psycho - a veritable troll complete with his own dungeon (alas, no smoking torches) and a set of eyes wide enough to make Marty Feldman blink.Serial murderers such as this, particularly highly intelligent ones, do not prance about revelling in how evil they are, nor do they speak in such ridiculous snidley tones.They appear quite normal - the reason why they managed to get away with what they did for the length of time they did. Occasionally they speak in monotones and look at nothing in particular. Check out interviews of real-life serial killers - you won't find Anthony Hopkins's fairground pastiche there.The story itself rambled, the interplay between the two characters did'nt work - Hopkins possibly due to the material, Foster due to the lack of a believable protagonist. They have thankfully both done far better work than this both before and since.There were some (very few) well designed moments and images but the end was both predictable and dissapointing.Films are supposed to mirror real life, not the expected perceptions of the mainstream. Otherwise, what happens to creativity?Oh dear - we're back in Hollywood again.Dan"
PeterZZ,"Jul 9, 2005",10/10,"If you want a movie to watch in the dark, look no further than The Silence of the Lambs. Jonathan Demme's tense thriller combines excellent actors and a wonderfully adapted screenplay to make, what seems to be one of the best, if not the best, thrillers of all time.The film follows three main stories, those being that of rookie FBI agent, Clarice Starling, the psychopath murderer Buffalo Bill and imprisoned psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, imprisoned for murder and cannibalism. Clarice is sent to Dr. Lecter to attempt to gain information on Buffalo Bill, because he was a former patient of Hannibal, however all Hannibal is interested in is getting inside Clarice's head. As the film goes on Clarice becomes more deeply involved in the case, right up to the dramatic and excellent climax, as well as Hannibal becoming more deeply involved in Clarice's mind. Meanwhile Buffalo Bill continues his murderous spree, killing and skinning women.This movie is like no other. It combines tenses scenes with a cast like no other. Anthony Hopkins was born to be Hannibal, and why Michelle Pfeiffer was originally suggested for the role of Clarice over Jodie Foster is bizarre, but because Jodie Foster got the role, it doesn't really matter. When it comes to violence this film is very intense. There are some graphically violent scenes, however the worst violence in the film is the mental violence. Hannibal's ability to destroy someone mentally, is incredibly disturbing, and the films motives are pretty full on. However this contributes to the films overall feel of horror, which is why The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most mentally frightening films of all time.Stars: 10/10"
PinappleDude,"May 15, 2013",9/10,"The acting is of a very high level. Foster put down a good role as Clarice Starling and the supporting cast was very good (think of Buffalo Bill, for example). The star of the show is Anthony Hopkins. The role he put down here is really nothing less than genius. The dude is perfectly cast and is both friendly and polite, and very creepy and smart about it. I think it's an incredibly and fascinating character. Hannibal is for me one of the best psychopaths I've ever seen in a movie.Overall I highly recommend this movie if you love thrillers and detectives because this is definitely one of the best in its category for me. And i think this movie is also in my top 10 films!!"
toblessed2001,"May 3, 2014",9/10,"The 1991 suspense thriller, Silence of the Lambs, finds Clarice Starling, actress Jodi Foster, as a student at the FBI academy in Virginia. She's been chosen by her instructor, actor Lawrence Bonney, due to her noticeable keen senses, to visit with Dr. Hannibal Lecter, actor Anthony Hopkins, an incarcerated murderer. The intention is that Starling can use Lecter's insight into the mind of a murderer to find Buffalo Bill, actor Ted Levine, a serial killer whose victims are young girls.The theme of this film is control or power. In the film Clarice Starling is controlled by her drive to succeed as an FBI agent. She also has not found the power to control her memories of her childhood and the screaming of the lambs, which through her dealings with Dr. Lector she realizes. Ironically Dr. Lector himself, through his ability to manipulate minds, is perfectly able to control any and all situations; even through his incarceration has the power to affect others. Buffalo Bill on the other hand believes himself to be a transsexual and had been turned down for sex change surgeries from all major hospitals in the area. Therefore, his only way to express his control was by abducting young girls and murdering them and using their skin to create a woman's body. Ironically enough there is a pattern here. The majority of the power and control struggles are between Clarice and the men throughout her life and the story line, and with Buffalo Bill and his sexuality, and the young girls that he kills.The lighting and the angles used in the basement scene where Agent Starling was in the home of Buffalo Bill attempting to arrest him also aided to the theme of control. Buffalo Bill had shut off the lighting to the basement, leaving Starling unable to see a thing. Consequently, Buffalo Bill had on night goggles and was able to see every move Starling made. A terrified Starling scrambled around the basement, although blinded, searching for Bill. Finally, the simple sound of the trigger of Bill's gun being pulled back was all it took for Starling to locate bill and shoot the deadly shots that ended his terror (Bloch 1960). The overall lighting of the scenes throughout the film also aided to the theme of control. Early on the scenes tend to be more dark and dismal, but it seemed as though as Clarice gained more control, by having increased confidence, more insight, more acknowledgment from Crawford, and more trust from Lector, and got closer to solving the crime, the lighting itself became brighter throughout.The plot of the movie is to find a missing girl in West Virginia and to end serial killer Buffalo Bill's rampage. Special agent Jack Crawford, actor Scott Glenn, chose Cadet Clarice Starling for the task of interviewing a psychotic murderer Dr. Hannibal Lector in hopes that he could aid in the arrest of Buffalo Bill. Throughout the film Starling runs into obstacles and snares that seem to stand in her way, however her drive in solving the crime is stronger than those things standing in her way. One such obstacle is Dr. Frederick Chilton, actor Anthony Heald. Dr. Chilton is, to me, a little squeaky, weasel type character. He is out for self gain only and is trying to use Lector and his knowledge for his own benefit. Ultimately, Dr. Chilton met his doom in the end of the film by none other than Dr. Lector himself. After a botched attempt, at the direction of Jack Crawford, to find the most recent missing girl, Crawford and Starling were not permitted to speak to Lecter further. However that did not stop her from attempting to find and speak to him in attempt to find the killer. Although the male FBI agents had their leads, Starling had her own, and she was the one that ultimately solved the case.I can compare the theme of control and power of this film to that of Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho. This film also has heavy displays of gender and power. The circumstances that stand out to me most are that of mental illness displayed in both films, the way that Norman Bates and Buffalo Bill have similar conflicts and are somewhat trapped in their roles and act out in a sinister way. There is one particular scene that I recall that immediately brought to mind the comparison of the two films. The scene where they were reviewing pictures of some of Buffalo Bill's victims showed a young girl lying face down, naked. Her eyes were wide open (Bloch 1960), and as they showed a close up of that picture I instantly saw the shower scene where Janet Lee lay on the bathroom floor, eyes wide open, and the shower water running (Bloch, 1960).Overall, I rate this movie very high. The suspense thriller allows the viewer to enter into the minds of Agent Starling, Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill. It exhibits the affects of control and power, be it strong and weak, psychologically stable or unstable, educated or uneducated, male or female. Silence of the Lambs, takes us on an emotional ride of disbelief and terror as we see the story unfold."
kbeck9575,"May 20, 2008",9/10,Before I saw this movie Star Wars was my favorite film. I don't know if my tastes suddenly matured or what but when I walked out of the theater after seeing this movie for the first time I knew that Luke Skywalker and the gang had been trumped.Anthony Hopkins was superb as Hannibal Lecter. I have never seen anyone in all the years I have been watching movies seen an actor portray intelligent insanity any better. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Many times when I go to movies I sometimes think of other things that are related to the movie or not. In this film that did not happen and it was due mostly to the performance of Hopkins. I was thrilled that the film won the Academy Award for that year. I thought the rest of the cast was great to. Jodie Foster is good in anything that she chooses to take on and the casting was perfect for Buffalo Bill. Ted Levine really fit that freaky hick part so well.I thought the pacing of the movie was great to along with the cinematography which added to the suspense a great deal. Awesome direction and execution throughout the whole movie. I would consider this movie to be a must see for everyone interested in the thriller or psychological genres.

sddavis63,"Sep 23, 2002",10/10,"Immeasurably superior to its disappointing sequel ""Hannibal,"" ""Silence of the Lambs"" must surely rank as one of the absolute greatest thrillers of all time.Given the nature of the movie, there is surprisingly little graphic violence contained in it. The story focuses instead on the complex psychological relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and the imprisoned cannibalistic serial killer and ex-psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins.) Both Foster and Hopkins are brilliant. Foster has the larger role, and carries it off well, but Hopkins steals the movie with a frighteningly realistic portrayal of a frightening serial killer. Lecter, approached by the FBI because they believe he might be of assistance in helping identify a current serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill,"" sees in the FBI's interest an opportunity to escape imprisonment, and plays a series of mind games with Starling (and anyone else who wants to speak to him about the case.)Director Jonathon Demme effectively weaves two stories (the hunt for the serial killer, and the Starling-Lecter relationship) together into a taut thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. And, in the end, has there ever been a better, funnier and more thoroughly chilling line in any movie than Lecter's closing comment to Clarice: ""I have to go now. I'm having an old friend for dinner.""I can't identify a single weakness in this movie. 10/10."
Ham_and_Egger,"Sep 6, 2005",10/10,"I ate 'The Silence of the Lambs' up the first time I saw it and I've gone back for more who knows how many times. I can clean my plate and watch the whole thing, or just snack on certain scenes and be satiated. It is fine dining.I admit it's a little bizarre, but if I'm in low spirits I sometimes put *this* movie on to cheer myself up, especially if I'm depressed because I've watched some garbage modern movie. The sheer perfection of it never fails to raise me up a little, and the fact that it was made in 1991 gives me hope that the current crop of Hollywood actors and directors isn't unremittingly bad.The scenes between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are masterful, they're like the cadenzas to a violin concerto. I've watched those scenes by themselves about twice as often as I've seen the full movie. To see them feeding off each others performances is beautiful, a feast in itself, it doesn't even require fava beans or a nice chianti.But it isn't just Hopkins and Foster. There really isn't a poor performance in the entire film, maybe it's because I'm biased and I've seen it two dozen times but it seems like even the actors in the bit parts are far above average. The bug guys, Miggs, the deputies at the funeral home in Elk River, the chauffeur who ""detests physical labor.""Jonathan Demme's directing is so brilliantly subtle that it's easy to overlook given the gripping story and the incredible acting, but the last time I watched the entire movie I did indeed, ""feel eyes moving over Clarice's body."" I'd read about this before, and undoubtedly processed it subconsciously, but I'd never seen it so starkly. The fact is that throughout the movie men are staring at Jodie Foster, judging her, ordering her around, lusting after her, and finally trying to kill her. This produces an undercurrent of suspense even in scenes that don't necessarily have any other suspenseful elements.Finally, that they managed to do all this and still keep it so realistically lurid is, to me, nothing short of amazing. The pictures of the flayed girls, the bloody fingernail stuck in the wall of the pit, whatever that thing is in the bathtub, it's all so marvelously grotesque you get the feeling that certain too-polite elements of society would love to shun it, but the film is so good that it demands to be watched."
stevewalker-46959,"Nov 16, 2015",10/10,"The film ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has changed a lot, above all, our standards. The audience drastically changed their view of the concept of a good thriller. Balanced center of gravity was found on the graphical violence but also the intellectual and psychological rally, where there was essentially what we are already showing what is sketchy, with the potential to happen. With each repeated viewing, we recognize the key elements behind the facade fascinating serial killer in order to discover a whole range of people of different walks of life, crossed in a single unattractive existence. Almost twenty-two years since first screening, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" remains the definition of thriller of our time. Too bad Jonathan Demme did not direct not nearly as good as this that today is undoubtedly a classic."
datorsiers2,"Dec 6, 2015",10/10,"After watching it, i was simply stunned. It is seriously magnificent, this film has so many awesome qualities to it. It is deep, thrilling, full of suspense, has super interesting characters, especially, Hannibal Lecter.Could very well be the best crime/thriller movie ever made, there really are no movies, you could compare it to, it is unique and elegant in a different way. Dr. Lecter(Anthony Hopkins) truly is an unforgettable character and his conversations with inspector Clarice(Jodie Foster) were the best thing in this movie for sure. There is a reason Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, both(!!!) won an Oscar for this film, not to mention The Silence of the Lambs has 5 Oscars to its name altogether, surely the best movie of 1991.Doesn't matter what kind of movies you are into, you will thoroughly enjoy The Silence of the Lambs, it just has too many outstanding qualities, that it should be impossible to dislike this and even if there are any flaws, you will not notice them, since they get overshadowed by the super interesting and suspense storyline."
hitchcockthelegend,"May 27, 2010",10/10,"Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young rookie FBI agent, is enlisted to help in the hunt for a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). To aid the investigation she is requested to interview an already incarcerated psychopath, the infamous Dr Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Cunning and very intelligent, Lecter takes a shine to Starling but will only assist her if she is prepared to let him into her personal make up. As Buffalo Bill kidnaps the daughter of an American senator the clock starts to tick downThe Silence of the Lambs is directed by Jonathan Demme and stars Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. It is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. It won the top five Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay. With a production budget of $19 million the film went on to record a staggering Worldwide profit of almost $254 million. Those awards and those figures don't lie, The Silence Of The Lambs is one of the rare occasions where everything came together perfectly.The source novel is in truth brilliant anyway, but how many times have we seen film makers make a hash of good material by either cutting corners, or by trying to be too Hollywood in the telling? Too many is the answer. Jonathan Demme and his team know that not much needs tampering here, their task was to understand Thomas Harris' complex characters and give them narrative strength, which they got courtesy of Ted Tally's brilliant writing. The portrayals of said characters have gone down in history to an extent they barely need me to have an opinion. From the first meeting of Starling and Lecter down in the bowels of the asylum, to the cheeky and unnerving closure, Foster & Hopkins engage and chill respectively, one of the weirdest, yet most tender relationships to have hit the silver screen. Scott Glenn is professional personified as Jack Crawford, while in the wake of Hopkins' classy monster show it gets forgotten just how brilliantly twisted Ted Levine makes Buffalo Bill. Two quality monsters for the price of one movie here, a bargain if ever there was one.For all the plaudits for cast, direction and writing et al, ""Lambs"" climbed to the top echelons of 90s cinema because it also exists as an excellent thriller, even a pant filling horror at times. While it also works very well as a criminal procedure movie. We know who the killer is quite early on in proceedings, but with Lecter tossing out conundrums and the FBI utilising all their tricksy scientific methods, it makes for a fascinating watch. And lest we forget that Demme shows himself to not only be a purveyor of adroit pacing, but quite a dab hand at thrilling set-pieces too-one that would be a spoiler should I mention it, and the other coming during a wonderful double handed twister as the net hopefully closes in on Billy Boy. While for hold your breath tension, night vision goggles are your pal, or not as the case may be.Not just one of the best crime/thriller/horror film's ever, one of the best film's ever, period. 10/10"
sxjTheFirst,"Jul 4, 2005",8/10,"I first saw ""Silence of The Lambs"" soon after it was released, as a schoolboy. It was one of the first ""mature"" films I saw and to this day the movie is kind of a benchmark against which I measure films. The creepy feeling it leave you without trying any of the cheap tricks (sudden loud noises, shots of copious amounts of blood ) that other thrillers do. I saw it years later in 2005 and still loved it.The movie's strong point is Jodie Foster and Anthiny Hopkins' acting skills ,again the benchmark against which I measure acting. The two make a great team and that was missing in the sequel ""Hannibal"".This is a movie of many skins its a thriller, a detective movie, a horror movie an entertainer and it deals with the nature of the human psyche too. Not an easy feat to be so many things at once but the director and cast pull it off.Certainly one of the best movies ever made."
Cinema_freak,"Dec 26, 2017",7/10,"I find ""Silence of the Lambs"" to be one of those movies that is hailed by one and all, and yet is underwhelming once watched - definitely good, but still underwhelming. You wonder what the hullabaloo was all about.The settings were cartoonishly murky and dungeon-like, to the point that Lecter's asylum (and at points even Clarice's FBI training centre) looked like Hell itself. I also personally disliked the ""screaming lambs"" scene; it felt unnecessary and dragged, and Jodie Foster's emotional reactions to Hannibal's questions felt absolutely out of place. As if he miraculously healed her of her long nightmare-sufferings in an Osho-esque way.
Overall, the camera work, sound and direction are all great. I especially loved those first-person shots with Hopkins and Clarice. Very claustrophobia-inducing.Coming to the acting, Anthony Hopkins, though mightily entertaining - very often chuckle-inducing with his sly sarcasm - came across as far from real. His performance was in no way what a true psychopath (especially one so well educated) would be like. I honestly did not find the man scary, though I did find his screen-presence charismatic and imposing.
Jodie Foster was excellent , her vulnerability, her subtle pretence in font of Hannibal, everything.
Ted Levine was marvellous - that strange voice, his quirky dialogue and body language - it all added up perfectly. A great example would be the scene where he gives a slight chuckle, and then runs behind a corner, when confronted at his house. Hard to believe this was the same man who played Pacino's subordinate cop in ""Heat"".
Scott Glenn underplays his role so well, that he seems disarmingly real - cool and calm. It's no surprise that Clarice wanted to work for this guy.Conclusion: SOTL is by all means a very a good film, but to be called one of the greatest movies of all time? I don't think so.
It's predecessor ""Manhunter"" (1986) is by all means the superior Hannibal film, and in my humble opinion, much, much more significant a film (and by significant, I mean more worthy of being preserved in archives for times ahead, than ""Silence of the Lambs"") . Sadly, ""Manhunter"", although a cult classic now, has always been criminally under-appreciated and misunderstood (strong emphasis on ""misunderstood"") and has since remained under the shadow of this one."
horror69,"Apr 19, 2002",1/10,"After hearing how great this film is i had to see it for myself. It isn't ""all that"". The story-line is boring and stringy, very much NON-VIOLENT and really really drawn out stalking scenes.I will give credit to the FLAWLESS acting though, Jodie foster and Anthony Hopkins were Outstanding. I really feel that more could have been done with this movie than what they did.The main reason people like this film is because its a ""psychological"" thriller, implying that if you dont like this film you are considered dumb.(which is not the case).This is a very overrated film...very overrated but its worth seeing..so you can say ""I have seen silence of the lambs."" If that doesnt thrill you...dont see it."
lagudafuad,"Dec 20, 2012",9/10,"With a screen time of not more than 17 minutes, Anthony Hopkins pulled off a memorable performance that gained him an Academy Award; I think no actor has won an Oscar for such a short screen time. His was so great that even in this short screen time he puts the fear of his cannibalism in you that he also earned the title of the 1 Villain of all time in the AFI (American Film Institute) 100 Years... 100 Heroes & Villain for his portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter in this movie.There is just so much about this movie that just makes you love it, the high intellect showed by Lecter, the way he master minds the people he is talking to making them bend to his will in such a way that they have no idea, and how he can draw you in for just a bite of your nose. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.Silence of the Lambs is one of three movies to win all five major Oscar awards, those awards are: Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. The other two films to achieve such are It happened One Night in 1934 and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975.The movie plot is about a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to apprehend another serial killer, known only as ""Buffalo Bill"".Clarice was sent to Hannibal Lecter with the hope of gaining a better insight into the mind of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, by talking to another psychopath (Lecter). Dr. Lecter used to be a psychiatrist, until he turned psycho. He has a powerful mind and he is an excellent mind manipulator.This 1991 classic is based on the 1988 novel of the same name by Thomas Harris, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter. His first book in 1981 Red Dragon was where Lecter was first introduced as a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. Red Dragon was the first film adapted from the Harris novels and it was done in 1986 and named Manhunter it starred Brian Cox as Lecter, spelled ""Lecktor"".A remake of Red Dragon was done in 2002 starring Hopkins as Lector and the movie was adapted from the same novel as Manhunter, released to a generally positive review Red Dragon was a critical and box office success, making over $200 million on a $78 million budget.This movie (Silence of the Lambs) was a box office success and it is one you will one to watch, but warning it does deal with cannibalism and it is graphical in some sense.www.lagsreviews.com"
enigmaticmaniac,"Sep 22, 2011",9/10,"In simple language the movie is truly remarkable. The direction of the movie is simply awesome and I loved the screenplay as well. The conversations between Starling and Hannibal Lekter are shot so well and dialogs are written so fine that even though the character of Hannibal don't appear much but still its the one that you'll never forget. Even the character of Buffalo Bill is very much creepy but Lekter wins for me. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal has delivered a stunning performance. Jodie Foster has also done a good job. The psycho-thriller theme is well established throughout the movie. Its creepy in a sense. The movie is nearly perfect in every aspect. Even the background score settles well enhancing the environment. Its one of the movie you won't forget. Though the character was introduced first in manhunter, its now that it marks its true nature. I would really recommend it to all."
thegamegkht,"Jan 30, 2024",8/10,Dr hannibal lecter is a brilliant psychiatrist as well as a cannibalistic serial killer who eat his victims for the apparent rude behaviour of theirs.Lecter is deeply offended by rudeness and prefers to eat the rude so as to speak.No one at the first glance can say that lecter is a killer because his mannerisms are very calm and collective his thoughts are.Only once he attacks a nurse and bites off some flesh off her face they have to restrain him and put a mask on his face to stop further damage.This seemingly charming individual is incarcerated at a correctional facility and clarice seeks some help from him to find another serial killer.
jakethesnake-42007,"Feb 26, 2021",10/10,When you want to make a good psychological thriller look at this film. It's perfect in every way. From the amazing acting to story to directing. It's edge of your seat the whole way. What can't all thrillers be done like this.
gorillagolanking,"May 17, 2007",10/10,"Hannibal Lecter is a scary non-vegetarian in this meaty thriller.Seriously, this film is regarded as one of the best films of all time and deservedly so. Jonathan Demme is at his absolute best here building suspense and tension into a blend of physical and psychological terror rarely matched in film.But, the reason this film works and kicks so much ass has everything to do with its stars: Jodie Foster (Genius) and Sir Anthony Hopkins (Knight). The chemical reaction that takes place between these two on screen is so palpable and acidic you find yourself hardly able to watch.Their dynamic is what sets this film apart from any other serial killer/horror/suspense/thriller ever made. The verbal jousting never wains when they are on screen. These are mind games unlike any other portrayed in the movies before or since.This is a must see for horror film lovers, suspense film lovers, and just plane film lovers. A great movie."
jacobtgill,"Jun 12, 2018",6/10,"The Silence of the Lambs is only the third movie to win all 5 major Oscars (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is another): Best Picture, Director, Actor (and Anthony Hopkins has some of the least screen time for a best actor winner), Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is the only horror film to ever win Best Picture, and it made all sorts of money-- staying on top of the box office for like 5 weeks and already having made back its budget in the first. So the data coming in would say that I would probably write a review on how good Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster were, and how this is such a landmark horror film that would rival The Shining as being the best ever. But I'm not going to. I believe this movie has been highly overrated, and if you allow me to explain, perhaps you'll end agreeing with me too.When you think about this movie, the first thing you think of is either fava beans or Hannibal the Cannibal. But the star is Jodie Foster... What's her character's name again? Clarence, Karen, Carly? You know what, doesn't really matter. We'll save Jodie Foster for later because Anthony Hopkins is really what this movie is known for. And there's a lot of good to indeed say. His looking right at the camera as his character is introduced, his improv mocking of Foster's accent, his unblinking eyes and famous lines. Oscar Winner? Sure. It's all there. My criticism will be discussed later when we talk about the director. What I will say, however, is that Ted Levine is vitally underappreciated as Buffalo Bill. First, I'm glad to see Teddy in a role that isn't a sheriff or cop. Buffalo Bill's luring of women and skinning his victims already made him a viable villain, but it's his dancing in front of the mirror that takes the crown and serves as the creepiest thing in the film.Okay, I can't hold back any longer. Gotta talk about how this movie suffers. Over the course of filming, I have no issue with the directing. It's not too special, but it's not bad; the camerawork is a different story. It's inconsistent, sloppy, and moves around too much. It tries creating a style that just doesn't work for the film. The exception is Dr. Lecter's scenes. Everything works there, but it seems like the film basically was built around what happened there. Which brings me to the actual story and the editing. We start with Jodie proving herself in the FBI and toughing it out as a female there. It's brief, and some exposition is quickly thrown in to establish her character because, after all, we have to hurry up and get to Hannibal. Which still doesn't seem totally logical. They go to one of the most dangerous and cunning psychiatrists to help catch the notorious Buffalo Bill, and they send an FBI agent who hasn't even graduated? That doesn't add up for me. Fast forward a scene or 2 and we get introduced to Buffalo Bill. It's a disturbing scene, but now we know who everyone is looking for. So the small amount of film dedicated to detective work really hardly serves any purpose because, after all, let's just get back to Hannibal. However smart the Hannibal scenes may be, they're also predictable. And the music really is more nonchalant than anything, and when you mix it all together, you get a film that really isn't all that scary. It's a cop story with a good, not great, female lead and an unremarkable story, so it all dwindles down to Hannibal. And he's truly a pretty great movie psycho, but surround him in a film that is surrounded around him, and the result is just eh.The climax has predictable moments, but it was leading up to the tense finish I was hoping for the entire film. And then the decisive moment happened and it was so lame. The redeeming part is how the movie ended because despite my criticism from before, I thoroughly enjoyed the ending. So there is that. But if you want an actually scary film with a cool, strong heroine, go watch Alien, Zero Dark Thirty, or just something else.

MFC9,"Jan 21, 2024",9/10,"Finally a deserved Oscar winner from the early 1990s! Among so many best picture mistakes, the Academy got it right in 1992, as Jonathan Demme's borderline-horror masterpiece still manages to terrify and unsettle more than 30 years after being awarded Best Picture.The performances of Hopkins and Foster have become legend, particularly Hopkins as Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector, who charms and manipulates his way through the film so brilliantly we actually end up rooting for him.Foster's Clarice Starling is an FBI cadet trying to find serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine, way too convincing as this sick maniac) who is skinning his victims. Only Lecter can help Clarice solve the case, but can she get him to cooperate before Bill kills again? Brilliant thriller 9/10."
danjakubik,"Feb 21, 2010",9/10,"Only the third film ever in Academy Award history to sweep the top five awards. Also, the first time a thriller wins a Best Picture Academy Award. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is most famous for Anthony Hopkin's memorable chilling performance as the clever, charming, cultured, well mannered serial killer Dr.Hannibal Lecter. Hannibal Lecter's character is a composite based on several real life serial killers, including Ted Bundy. Jody Foster gives a powerful, intelligent complementary acting performance as the FBI agent trainee recruited to help catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill, with the help of Lecter.What's most impressive about the film is the pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. They both bring intelligence, believability and a strong minded directness. They play exceptionally well off each other: Lecter is intelligent, but obviously crazy, while Starling is very sane, determined and intelligent enough to match wits and will against the evil, charming, well mannered and clever Lecter.Not having seen the film in several years, with a fresh perspective, it came across to me as an unusually creepy, strange psychological film. That's a compliment. We have a rare portrayal of a transvestite serial killer, Buffalo Bill. The film contains two scenes I've never seen before, ever, in any film. The first involves Clairice Starling at the beginning of the film, shortly after she first meets Hannibal Lecter in the insane asylum dungeon. The second scene is near the end of the film and involves a very bizarre disguise used by Hannibal Lecter.Hopkins performance in this film, is my all time movie villain favorite. As a thriller, it works well most of the time, narrative wise. There are a few factual errors. The film is best when both Hopkins and Foster are on screen together. Then it's quite a powerful and gripping psychological drama."
jacobalanmuzzy,"Feb 22, 2023",9/10,"The plot was amazing, great characters, the Buffalo Bill investigation was very compelling, and Hannibul is one if the best characters in film spanning 10 years. The build up and introduction to Hannibal is so perfect and now iconic. The dialog with Hannibal is so expertly crafted, every conversation had me on the edge of my seat. The action is also great that scene at the end had my heart beating. We have to acknowledge the gore. The gore in this movie was brutal but interesting. Overall this movie did so many things perfect and was so unique in it own, no wonder it became an instant classic."
danielll_rs,"Oct 9, 1999",9/10,"First of all I have to say that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the film which inspired all the serial-killer films of the 90's (good ones like ""Se7en"" and silly ones like ""Kiss the Girls""). But ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has many things the other thrillers don't have.In this film we can see two of the best performances ever. Anthony Hopkins is just perfect as Hannibal Lecter, and so is Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. The dialogues between these two characters are brilliant, and so is the whole screenplay.The film has a great story which explores deeply the main characters. It is not just a serial-killer story, but above all a deep dramatic thriller.""The Silence of the Lambs"" impressed me so much that I've watched it many times.So if you hadn't watched it, take your time and see it.Surely one of the best films ever made.Rating: 10/10I heard that Ridley Scott is about to direct the sequel of ""The Silence of the Lambs"", with Sarah Michelle Gellar as Clarice Starling. Well... I truly love Sarah and she's one of the greatest actresses of her generation. But we see Clarice Starling as Jodie Foster and, you know, many people will compare Sarah's acting with Jodie's."

yog2302,"Jun 16, 2013",9/10,"A tight-wound thriller, and sequel to Thomas Harris' 1981 novel Red Dragon (though the movie Red Dragon came almost a decade later on this movie's shoulders), this is quite simply one of the best novel to movie adaptations till date. It can be easily compared with great adaptations like To Kill a Mocking Bird, One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest, Lord of the Rings Trilogy among others.Coming to the characters, 'Hannibal' played so dexterously and chillingly by Anthony Hopkins still gives me the creeps, with good all round performances by others. Jodie Foster as an FBI trainee plays her role to perfection in finding a serial killer with Hannibal's help. 'Buffalo Bill' played by Ted Levine has also done great job in his portrayal as a psychopath killer whom the FBI is searching for.The plot is simple yet the viewer simply can not escape the tension throughout the movie. There are enough twists and turns to keep the viewer glued to the movie. You wait for Hannibal to come on screen in the same way you wait for dinosaurs to come in the Jurassic Park. The direction is impeccable and editing is spot on. The suspense is brilliantly maintained and the sound track adds to the atmosphere.No wonders this movie won all the major academy awards for the year including best actor to Anthony Hopkins.If you have not watched this movie and even if you are not a fan of horror or suspense movies, you are certainly missing one of the best creations in the history of cinema. Go watch it!!"
BasementBeatz,"Feb 9, 2023",8/10,"I recently watched the acclaimed movie after hearing many positive comments about it. The storyline was beautifully composed and kept me interested through all of its length. I loved how each character contributed to the overall story line, as well as the way they were portrayed in their own unique moments throughout the movie. There was suspense, action, intrigue, horror, investigation and more. I just learned that there are five movies that follow this story (Hannibal Rising, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal) and I cannot wait to watch them all. I would highly recommend this movie to be added to everyone's ""must see"" list!"
mlee-reclaw,"Feb 17, 2021",5/10,Both Hopkins and Foster over acted so much that it was difficult to take them seriously. The movie itself was rather boring and slow paced. The idea of this invincible villain in the guise of an old Englishman is ludicrous. I never understood what the fuss was about. It wasn't scary; it was just silly.
EllisDee,"Oct 4, 1998",10/10,"""Silence of the Lambs"" will never be silenced.  It easily ranks among the best movies of the 90's.  Anthony Hopkins steals the show here, even though he is not the serial killer at large.  He manages to be menacing yet charming at the same time, which is often a quality of our most infamous serial killers.  Jonathan Demme did an excellent job directing this move, and rightfully received an Oscar reward for best director.  He kept everything going at just the right pace and allowed enough time for character study to flavor the film further.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" is loaded with memorable scenes; my favorite one is where Jodie Foster has to feel her way around the dark while the killer (wearing night-vision goggles) just toys with her for a while.  Since ""we covet what we see everyday,"" try not to give in to the temptation of seeing ""Silence of the Lambs"" everyday as there is no telling what might happen then..."
sarkestuartowenfarrell,"Oct 13, 2015",9/10,This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and gore to have a good suspense/thriller film.I was never a fan of this kind of movie genre but this movie caught my attention from start to finish. I couldn't look away or sleep well at night. This is a movie based off a few real life killers which makes things even scarier if you ask me. Anthony Hopkins performance as the deranged genius Hannibal Lecter earned him a well deserved Academy Award and the same was true of Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling. This film should go down in history as one of the greatest suspense films in the history of cinema.
ziancara,"Apr 13, 2023",9/10,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a 1991 thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme, based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. The movie tells the story of Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who is asked to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer, in order to gain insight into the mind of another serial killer who is still at large.The film is brilliantly directed, with Demme creating an intense and unsettling atmosphere that keeps the audience on edge throughout the movie. The performances are also excellent, with Jodie Foster giving a strong and compelling performance as Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins delivering a mesmerizing and chilling performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, and their interactions are some of the most memorable moments of the movie.One of the strengths of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is its focus on character development. Clarice Starling is a complex and intriguing character, and the movie explores her past and motivations in a way that makes her relatable and sympathetic. Similarly, Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a fascinating character, and the movie does an excellent job of exploring his twisted psyche and motivations.The film is also notable for its exploration of themes such as gender and power dynamics, as well as the nature of evil and how it manifests in different forms. These themes add depth and complexity to the story and elevate it beyond a typical thriller.Overall, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a masterful film that expertly blends suspense, horror, and drama to create a chilling and unforgettable experience. It's a must-see for fans of the thriller genre and anyone who appreciates exceptional filmmaking."
neil-douglas2010,"Aug 10, 2023",10/10,"It's been a while since I've seen this movie, I'd have rewatched it months ago but my dvd version was kaput. Luckily the TV came to my rescue.Very rarely does a psychological thriller win a best picture Oscar but this exceptional movie bucked that trend. Jodie Foster plays Clarice Starling, a student FBI agent who is employed by her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to talk to Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) about serial killer Buffalo Bill.It's really less about the serial killer but more about the chemistry between Clarice and Lecter.Superb performances from Foster and Hopkins rise this far above other films in this genre and I doubt it will ever be beaten."

jp_91,"Oct 31, 2021",10/10,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the smartest horror-thriller ever filmed, with a spectacular screenplay based on the novel of the same name written by Thomas Harris, which in turn was based on the American serial killer Edward Theodore ""Ed"" Gein (for the character Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb) and in the Mexican murderer Alfredo Ballí Treviño (for the character Hannibal Lecter). The script masterfully adapted by Ted Tally plays with suspense, mystery and horror in a way never before matched, touching on subjects of psychology and criminology. The performances of Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins and Ted Levine are superb, leaving their characters as icons of cinema and pop culture around the world. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography is a visual enchantment, the music composed by Howard Shore is an aural delight, and Jonathan Demme's cinematographic direction is a marvel that has no equal. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the only horror film in history to win an Oscar in the category of Best Film of the Year, being since 1991 a film that became an instant classic. 30 years later, Hannibal Lecter continues to be an icon of horror that makes an impression on audiences. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" the masterpiece of the '90s, unsurpassed."
drqshadow-reviews,"Jul 10, 2023",9/10,"Though he's merely an important supporting player in the plot's bigger picture, Anthony Hopkins completely dominates The Silence of the Lambs as the complex, cultured mass-murderer with a taste for human flesh, the disgraced Doctor Hannibal Lecter. It's a genuinely transcendent performance, the likes of which we're lucky to catch once or twice per decade. Jodie Foster more than pulls her weight in the leading role, a tenacious FBI cadet who endures misogyny and harassment at every stop, but it's Lecter who brings the real sizzle, and their mutually perplexing psych ward interactions transform a rather pedestrian production into something downright hypnotic.Himself a trained psychiatrist, Hannibal has made no effort to disguise his contempt when confronted by the bureau's more highly-accredited shrinks. He's the smartest, most refined man in the room and they all know it, so why pretend otherwise? Lecter clearly stopped following such social niceties years ago. By contrast, he sees something intriguing in the young, ambitious Clarice Starling. Maybe it's her open honesty, her bald naïveté or her willingness to brazenly march straight into the lion's mouth. He senses a not-so-distant trauma in her past and gamely chases it, indulging his professional instincts and savoring the hell it puts her through. For her part, Starling is perfectly willing to play that charade, even if it means plumbing a number of deeply uncomfortable personal depths, to aid the state's pursuit of a different psychopath. Though it's faltering and unsettling, the quid pro quo works for both of them. And for us.I alluded to this earlier, but the nuts and bolts of The Silence of the Lambs really aren't very good. The editing is hammy, the score's worthy of a TV movie and the production values are obviously low. Neither Hopkins nor Foster were the studio's first (or second, or third) choices, but fate, gladly, intervened. With those actors, in those roles, reading from this screenplay, it's bonafide movie magic. Damn near perfection. I'd gladly watch Hannibal and Clarice match wits and decipher puzzles in that clammy prison basement for hours upon hours, and suspect I may do exactly that over the course of the next few decades."
ibngg,"May 21, 2020",5/10,"This is the first time my opinion vastly diverges from the public one. For me this is just a plain movie, no suspense, no fear, boring at times and just confusing at others. The saving grace is Hopkins which acted amazingly. Foster on the other hand...is just annoying with her accent and general demeanor. She truly was like a lamb when speaking to Lecter which might be intentional but is just annoying. I also get that the shots were filmed in a way to make the space look smaller and more close up to amp up the anxiety but there were so many cuts, close ups etc. that again were annoying. I didn't feel anything during or after the movie which would justify the ""phycological thriller or horror"" title."

White. Upon graduation, she aspires to work in the agency's Behavioral Sciences Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While still an apprentice, Crawford asks him to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, until now, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to realize that the task is to collect Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern US, all young women, slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large stripes of fur. She also imagines that Crawford chose her, as a woman, in order to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking with Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, and often she will have to read between the very cryptic lines that he provides. She has to decide how long the game will continue, since her request in exchange for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more serious turn when a sixth victim is discovered, from whom they can retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being frank about its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high-profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Sen. Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), who puts increased scrutiny on the case as they search for a Catherine who is hopefully still alive. The one who can influence what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), the prison warden, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, which means a higher profile for himself if he can successfully insert himself.

Hopkins portrayal of Lecter has been voted by AFI as the the number 1 villain of all time and deserves it all time.

classicalsteve,"May 25, 2011",10/10,"The Silence of the Lambs, based on the Thomas Harris book of the same name, is one of the most disturbing films based on fictional material to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Director. When you consider that films like ""My Fair Lady"", ""the Sound of Music"", ""Gandhi"", ""the Hurt Locker"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Rain Man"", and ""Forrest Gump"" have also earned the Best Picture prize, Lambs stands alone; similarly disturbing films are predominantly historical dramas. The only other Best Picture winners equaling the horror of ""Lambs"" are ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Platoon"", and ""Unforgiven"". But none of these movies ever dealt with not one but two serial-killer sociopaths in a suburban-rural setting.An outstanding horror-suspense film, ""Lambs"" is not for the feint of heart. ""Lambs"" centers around three characters dealing with intense psychological dysfunction. Each character in turn not only reacts to their dysfunction in their own style but is in very different circumstances. Two of the three engage in horrific behavior of extreme violence, succumbing to the darkest side of human behavior as a result of their mental illness and dysfunctional pathology. At the story's beginning, one of them is in an institution for the criminally insane, having had a history of violent and sadistic behavior. The second is on the loose, dispatching young women for reasons yet unknown. The third character deals with her psychological issues by joining the FBI, and her reason d'etre becomes a mission to stop such behavior and rescue potential victims at the hands of psychological killers.If a ""story"" is about the growth and change of a character, then Lambs' narrative is really about Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who is majoring in the Behavioral Science division which does psychological profiling of criminals, particularly serial killers. Her first real task, or test in a sense, is to psychologically profile the serial killer Hannibal Lecter, nicknamed ""the Cannibal"", played with such a believable yet sadistic sensibility by Anthony Hopkins that make Dracula and Frankenstein's monster seem more like Saturday morning cartoon villains by comparison. Lecter is possibly one of the most fascinating and simultaneously repulsive characters in fiction and film. He is a fusion of an Ivy League liberal arts professor who easily quotes ancient philosophers and the Monster of Venice, an Italian serial killer who dispatched victims, usually women, without a shred of empathy. But Lecter also has a fondness for high culture, displayed by his drawing of the Duomo in Milan. Italy.We learn Lecter had been a university professor of psychology who made it a habit of eating human victims. At story's beginning, he resides at a prison of mentally disturbed criminals where Starling first meets him in person. Also, we learn the FBI is hot on the trail of a strange woman-killer, the second character nicknamed Buffalo Bill by the press. Starling and Lecter form a strange yet compelling bond, not quite true friendship but something more meaningful than mere acquaintance. Part of the story is the evolution of Starling's and Lecter's relationship. A very subtle undertone of sexual flirting is hinted at in some scenes and yet we know that these two worlds could never permanently mesh.Eventually, Starling begins to solicit the help of Lecter to arrest the perpetrator of the horrid acts . We believe it's an accidental interaction at first, but then we learn that the solicitation is the brainchild of the head of the FBI's criminal behavioral division, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). Other agents had tried and failed to convince Lecter to assist, so he tries another tact: send a green trainee to Lector without telling her Crawford's real intentions. Buffalo Bill has dispatched five women, but no one at the agency can figure out his motive. With Lecter's help, Starling begins to unravel who Buffalo Bill is from a psychological standpoint as a means of finding out his identity and where he lives. Part of the narrative involves the revealing of both Starling and her target Buffalo Bill, although the most interesting and colorful character, Hannibal Lecter, remains completely enigmatic. The story then pushes into a new direction when a young woman from a prominent family is kidnapped and it is believed she has been abducted by Buffalo Bill. Can Starling extract enough information from Lecter to save the young woman before Buffalo Bill dispatches another innocent victim?One of the first elements that strikes you about Lambs is its foreboding atmosphere with some scenes having a quasi-medieval flavor. When Starling first visits the corridor inside the mental prison which houses Lecter, you feel like you're walking into a medieval dungeon. The stone brick is dirty and damp, and the inmates seem like something right out of Dante's Inferno (Hell). The same is true for Buffalo Bill's hideout, a maze of dark corridors filled with strange objects, like mannequins and costumes. The place where he imprisons his victims rings of something out of the Spanish Inquisition. Themes of raw sexuality permeate the entire story, although there is no love affair between any of the characters. Simultaneously, there are also overtones of objectifying human beings. Dr Chilton, the doctor in charge of Lecter at the hospital, boasts of having his sociopath patient, ""So rare to capture one alive. From a research point of view, Lecter is our most prized asset,"" as if Lecter is a rare object rather than a person. Also, the serial killers objectify their victims as a means of rationalizing their behavior.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the best horror-suspense films of its type with absolutely first-rate acting by the leads and the supports. And one of the most disturbing. But if you're looking for escapist innocent fun, Lambs will have you running under the covers, or at least switching to ""My Fair Lady"". Lecter and Buffalo Bill are the stuff nightmares are made of."
Cosette-2,"Sep 23, 1998",N/A,"From the first time I saw ""The Silence of the Lambs"" my greatest aspiration has been to be a criminal psychologist.  The screenplay was so plausible, and the characters so vivid, that at the moment Hannibal Lecter utters the final words, I was ready to run off and apprehend a few serial killers myself.The imagery is stunning in this classic tale of good and evil that leaves the viewer disturbed by the graphic nature of the tale, and yet reaffirmed in their knowledge that there are Clarice Starlings out there, ready to battle the forces of darkness for us.I never go more than a month without watching ""The Silence of the Lambs""."
the-gossip-king,"Apr 27, 2008",10/10,"This movie was amazing. The dialogue was witty, clever and sometimes chilling. The directing was beautiful and the acting was absolutely superb. Jodie Foster was great as the the FBI agent Clarice Starling who is on the trail of a serial killer. Foster was good but the star is of course the magnificent Anthony Hopkins who steels the show with his rolling eyes and taunting voice. Both actors deserved the Oscars awarded to them. So did the director Jonathon Demme. The story was great, the only clique was with the ending that has always bugged me. The movie is an intelligent chilling thriller and there was this great build up to something that didn't meet the audience's expectations. Besides that everything about this movie was perfect. Highly recommended."
rayyquintero,"Jul 27, 2022",7/10,"I can't say I was in love with this movie, but the story was decent. The main killer ""Buffalo Bill,"" was just not very interesting to me, and honestly not very well written. Jodie Foster was a good protagonist, but she felt kind of bland for most of the movie, in terms of her uncovering the murder mystery. However, Anthony Hopkins really steals the show with his grim portrayal as Hannibal Lecter. His dynamic with Agent Foster is absolutely brilliant from start to finish, and he's definitely one of the best psychopaths I've ever seen in a movie."
jiver2,"Apr 13, 2008",1/10,"I was not impressed with this film, and it's phoney psychiatry. I have some professional experience in working with the criminally insane, in the US and UK. While there are a few staff in the profession who would allow themselves to be manipulated in the way that Clarice Starling does, I cannot conceive any real life situation where so many of her colleagues would allow this situation, known as ""team splitting"", to continue. It is routine behaviour for psychopaths to attempt to team split, as Lekter does, but it is such a standard ploy that it would be recognised in any institution other than the toyland one in the film and quickly dealt with, and I resent the attitude of the storyline in glorifying this behaviour. Trust me people, if you are in this situation, don't allow patients to split you away from your colleagues, you may think they are interested in you but they will get bored with playing with you in the end. When patients are given this power, which they cannot handle, it makes them more scared, and less likely to learn. In his attempt to make Frederick Chilton, the character that should be the good guy, in to the bad guy, either the actor or the director has gone way over the top, to the point where where pathos becomes bathos, and as for Anthony Hopkins, he lost all credibility for me when he announced in a British tabloid that he was sorry for seeming to condone violence in the role he was playing, and then within a few months proceeded to repeat the role in the sequel, ""Hannibal"". That's why I never bothered to see the film until just recently."
stryker-5,"Feb 5, 2000",N/A,"Demme and his long-time collaborator, Tak Fujimoto, have a crack at turning a weird novel into a movie.  I'm afraid to say that it doesn't work.There are moments when the film seems about to go somewhere interesting, but each time the idea fizzles out.  Clarice's flashback memories are evoked by Lecter's nasty mindgames, but in the end her feelings for her lost father are opened up too pedantically and the chance to do something truly disturbing is lost.  An exquisite dilemma is set up - should Agent Starling flout her orders and training, and subject herself to appalling risks, in order to save the endangered Catherine?  But Lecter decides to pursue other objectives, and the potential is squandered.Intelligence is a fine thing in a film, and it is very satisfying for the viewer to see the clues unravelled in a thriller.  However, cleverness for its own sake, unanchored in the bedrock of character, is a pernicious thing.  Lecter's anagrams ('Hester Mofet') don't come off, partly because they are too remote from the chase itself, and partly because they have to be explained to the audience.  ""We covet what we see every day ..."" - this is hopelessly poor as a clue, and when the agents solve it, I for one am reminded of the TV ""Batman"" episode when the Penguin commits robberies all over Gotham which, when marked on the map, sketch out the shape of his distinctive hat.  It's as far-fetched as that.Doctor Chilton is awful.  He is a cartoon character, outlandishly pompous and unsympathetic.  The prisoner's escape ploy makes me cringe, it is so preposterous - wouldn't the paramedics actually try to examine the supposed facial wounds?  And why are they pumping him full of Ringer's solution without ascertaining that he's losing haemostatic pressure?Admittedly, Clarice's time in Bill's house is psychologically gripping, but this has nothing to do with the film's alleged cleverness.  It is the oldest device of all, to get us to 'know' the girl, so that we make some emotional investment in her, then stick her in an old dark house with the creepy bad guy.  Nothing about that final sequence stands up to even the lightest analysis.  Why doesn't the FBI agent simply call for back-up, and stay put?  Once she locates the victim, isn't her duty to stay with her to protect her?  Once Bill eludes the agent, why doesn't he just escape?  He can't want to kill the agent as part of his compulsion.  She doesn't come close to fitting the victim profile that the film has so laboriously developed for us.  He must know that if he remains at the scene, other agents will arrive soon.Lecter is interesting enough initially, but one has to question the way the film makes a hero of him.  Are psychotic killers imprisoned in cages in large rooms like this?  Are they handcuffed to the bars at mealtime?  And supervised by a team of two no-brainers?  Can they dupe SWAT teams and medical staff with ease, and escape, blood-soaked, from busy cities?  Do we really prefer Lecter to Chilton?  And if we do, should we?  I don't want Hannibal inside my head, not because he is terrifying (which he isn't), but because he is a waste of my time."
ktibo-2,"Nov 4, 2000",10/10,"The first horror film that won 5 Academy Awards... And this is the movie that was worthy of it! This is a movie that changed our thoughts in connection with thrillers: a horror movie can be clever, very breathtaking and can cause catarsis.The plot is excellent, not just the script but the book is first-class too; the actors are brilliant: Jodie Foster in the role of Clarice Starling is so sensitive and so fragile and vulnerable; Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter is so calm and he is a such a cold-blooded killer that we can hardly stay relaxed in our armchairs...(Remember the scene where he kills the 2 cops and than listens to classical music...) Jonathan Demme directed very well: he knew what to do to feel claustrophobia in the prison-scenes, and to be afraid when we are in the house of the serial-killer. My favorite scene is the last action sequence: Clarice cannot see anything, but the killer sees her: and what comes after, knows everyone. If you don't know what comes after, you have to check it out... The best thriller from the 90's!"

Ever since this movie came out back in 1991, I do not recall one morning in my life when I have woken up in a dry bed. Nor have I gone by a day where the image of Anthony Hopkins creepy appearance has managed to spurt out some of that joy-juice. Burt Reynolds has mentioned this in Boogie Nights and I must say it acts quite like a fire hydrant.Good luck with this one."
jdberkley,"Feb 8, 2004",10/10,"You realize you're in a different sort of thriller when Clarice Starling walks down that corridor, trying to ignore the cat-calls of a cell-block full of lunatics, only to find that the most dangerous inmate on the block is standing calmly in his cell, waiting for her, almost as if he's welcoming her to a cocktail party. Rare is the movie that gets everything right, but ""The Silence of the Lambs"" comes awfully close to providing the perfect example for a modern thriller. It's so disturbing to watch for some people that it's often described as a horror movie, which says more about other films involving serial killing, in my opinion, than it does about this one. We're not used to crime thrillers that actually show killing and its aftermath in gruesome, clinical detail-- ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. We're not used to films showing us psychopaths of unnerving ferocity-- ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. Most importantly, we're not used to seeing this kind of story presented in such a matter-of-fact way-- ""The Silence of Lambs"" is never showy in its camera work or its performances. Most crime thrillers don't quite thrill, and certainly don't frighten, because you never quite believe them. You believe ""The Silence of the Lambs"", especially when you wish you didn't."

MovieAddict2016,"Jun 22, 2004",7/10,"Hannibal. The very name sparks fear, discomfort, and ultimately recognition. He is one of the most popular screen characters of all time, the incarnation of evil, and yet strangely likable despite his distasteful savoring of human flesh. ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice bottle of chianti,"" he tells FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) after she meets him in a prison, metal bars their only means of separation.Their first conversation and face-to-face interaction is a vital element of the film's narrative; the bars represent Starling's own self-defense; they have wide-open spaces that are easily penetrable. And Hannibal Lecter, a psychologist and cannibal, knows exactly how to reach past her own mental cell bars and crack into her brain, and he does so in the classic scene where she recalls memories from her childhood, of the lamb she tried to save...Agent Starling is on the case of a bizarre serial killer whose victims tend to be young women. Although they are unaware of his motives, it turns out the infamous ""Buffalo Bill"" is using the skin of these unfortunate victims for his own sick pleasure. He's not the sort of person you'd feel comfortable being stuck next to in an otherwise empty elevator.Clarice is smart, a feminine icon of the movies. Her brains are what propel her own investigation into the case while her desire to unearth the truth and succeed past the results of her male counterparts stems from a sort of egotistical dominance. Not many people comment upon Sterling's own sexuality, her almost overly excessive efforts at saving the victims (who happen to be females). Buffalo Bill seems to represent her own image of men: cruel creatures who inflict pain and suffering upon helpless women. Her sole friend, the only man she can rely on for help and inside tidbits, is an outcast upon society -- a metaphor for the repressed homosexuals who are abandoned by their own societies, shunned by those who feel they are not ""normal."" Harris's underlying implications of homosexuality and female dominance in the novel are admittedly stronger than in the film, although the presence of the suggestions is clearly evident under close examination.Or, it could just be about serial killers and FBI agents. You decide.Sure, the movie is famous, but we must ask ourselves whether or not the film's reputation has given it a better face over the year than it has deserved. It is well directed, but never does the film fascinate us as the bold and daring ""Se7en"" did. ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a fine film, but pales in comparison to some of its imitators and fellow genre occupants.The acting and writing is not at fault. Hopkins and Foster are superb. Hopkins received the most critical acclaim, although in 2001 we all realized that Foster was a key to the series as well, when she was unsuccessfully replaced with Julianne Moore in the sequel, ""Hannibal,"" directed by Ridley Scott, which was a total failure and disappointment for the fans of the original and source material, the novels by Thomas Harris, who has reportedly never seen ""Silence of the Lambs"" for fear that it would influence his writing.""Lambs,"" more than any other film in the series, is terribly manipulative, complete with tacky flashbacks that are out of place and all too convenient. That's where the film ultimately fails. The direction by Jonathan Demme is, truth be told, rather poor and borderline mediocre; Demme does not use cinematography to his advantage, does not use darker tones to evoke feelings from the prints as Fincher did with ""Se7en."" It's a great movie with convincing performances and a realistic script packaged in the form of a typical Hollywood thriller -- it might have a good reputation, it might be a good movie, but compared to other classics of the genre, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" just doesn't hold up as much as I had hoped it would after all these years. It's revolutionary, but isn't the masterpiece it used to be.On the plus side there's always that terrific ending to look forward to."

Soon after Starling and Lecters interview Buffalo Bill abducts 25-year old Catherine Martin, the daughter of the US Senator Ruth Martin.

It is true that the afformentioned genre has not been overly exploited, and in view of a collection of films described as having ""a questionable degree of merit"" that is probably a good thing.Jodie Foster is excellent as a trainee FBI agent, but her performance is a little overshadowed by that of Sir Anthony Hopkins in the role of Dr Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lector. A lot has been said about Hopkins' portrayal of the cannibalistic serial killer, and as I'm limited for space all that I can say is that after seeing the movie, Lector seems a more believable character than Hopkins himself (that's a compliment by the way).In short, an extremely effective movie, and one that has for many embodied the cinema of the '90s."
nafriedman,"Jan 29, 2000",10/10,"When I first saw this movie I was scared out of my wits! Everyone involved knows how to scare the audience, especially Anthony Hopkins, whose performance is chilling. If you've seen it, get the Criterion Edition, which is jam-packed with extra features."
Mohamad021,"Mar 2, 2021",9/10,"A brilliant psychological film with simply superb performances.
A rare treat of a film. A horror/thriller with the dramatic and psychological gravitas to stand among the greatest films ever made. The film takes big risks and manages to succeed on almost every front. Hopkins nails the role of his lifetime. Hopkins' performance may be the film's bravura showpiece, but Foster's goes the whole distance, steadfast, controlled, heartbreakingly insightful, a fine addition to his gallery of characterizations."
punctate,"Sep 10, 1999",10/10,"This movie is probably my favorite thriller of all time. The silence of the lambs is the only horror / thriller to win an Academy award for best picture. It also won for best director, best actor for both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Buffalo Bill is murdering and skinny women across the country. Clarice Starling a student is sent to interview Dr. Hannibal Lector in hope that they will be able to create a profile for Buffalo Bill. Dr. Lector is called Hannibal the cannibal you can pretty much guess what he did. Dr. Lector keeps giving Starling clues in an exchange for answering his questions about her childhood. Anthony Hopkins performance stuns me every time it's simply brilliant. Scott Glen performance as the psychopath who wants to be a transvestite was bravo as well. Jodie Foster received an Academy award for her excellent performance as well. The scene when Jack is watching Clarice as she goes through the house is chilling. The story is strong and compelling with a stunning score. The movie is shocking, frightening and even disturbing with its subject matter. 10/10 The best thriller of the 90's."
famasymas7,"Aug 3, 2014",9/10,"Hannibal Lecter is a psychopath that is way more intelligent than we can comprehend. We get some memorable quotes from this movie.

I have to have 10 lines ayy. OK well Many good movie start with a boom and a bang and a splash then a splat. Boyhood is a great movie but is only playing in UK soil and that sucks.

aboyer1,"Aug 2, 2006",10/10,"Silence of the Lambs is a true work of art. It stands as my favorite film not only in the thriller/suspense genre, but of all films in existence. The story is original and never goes stale, all of the characters are interesting, the dialogue between the bright, young Clarice Starling and the maniacal, manipulative Hannibal Lecter is phenomenal. Hannibal Lecter is one of the most terrifying characters in film due to his extreme intelligence and disturbing habits. The camera work in this movie is also outstanding, especially toward the climax of the film, when the florist is ringing the doorbell; that's all I will say as to not give it away, but it throws you for a loop. Who can forget the eery ""Goodbye Horses"" tune with the infamous dance? The climax will have you on the edge of your seat, just waiting to jump. The film is puzzling, intense, suspenseful, anything you could ask for in a thriller. The film is mesmerizing and has yet to be beaten by any other film as my top choice."
davidslicer,"Feb 15, 2001",10/10,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the most suspensful,graphic films I have ever see.It is a pretty damn good one too.Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins have great chemistry and the directing by Jonathan Demme is brilliant.Probably the first horror film to win the academy award for Best Picture."
octopusgardener,"Jul 4, 2025",10/10,"Forget favorite horror movie, this is my favorite MOVIE hands down. Love it. I can't describe exactly what it is about it, maybe it's the bizarre sort of charisma that Lector has or his strange partnership with Clarice? Whatever it is, I adore this movie.Clarice's character feels so real, and so visceral, and the contrast between her and Lector feels so odd and bizarre, heightening the tension even in scenes when you know he's behind bars. The overarching themes of Clarice's own trauma and her experiences with misogyny blend into the rest of the film, not as a central theme but a vital one nonetheless.The way Hannibal describes, psychoanalyzes, and mocks her to her face is chilling, and absolutely delights every time. I'm a huge fan of this movie, and I could go on, but alas. Very good. Classic for a reason."

iepes,"Aug 21, 2003",9/10,"My absolute favorite ! Glued to the screen from frame 1 till the end. There are a lot of good things to be said about this movie and have already been said. One thing however, which I find is great about this movie, but which is hardly mentioned is that it keeps you at a 100% suspense level without going into a ""shocking"" scene. I mean there are no kiekaboe scenes (you expect someone to jump from behind a tree in the opening scene, etc), no special stunning effects, no bloody scenes (the camera is on Lectors face when he kills the policeman), etc, etc. Nothing really scary is directly shown, all is in the suggestion that something is going to happen. Great !"
yahewage,"Apr 19, 2021",3/10,"This may seems a masterpiece for some of us, but why.? What's the point? . Anthony Hopkins could only scare ""Jodie"" who is trying her best to be get scared by Anthony. Close up shots and big eyes didn't work for me. Not Oscar worthy either. Were not there any good movies at that time?.I gave it a shot because I thought this would make me feel alike Mads mikkelssen's Hannibal.I can't get my 2 hrs back."
doug_funnie,"Aug 21, 2001",10/10,"I saw Hannibal (the sequel) before seeing The Silence of the Lambs and I was very interested in watching the original. Whenever this movie is mentioned among people, they ALWAYS say it's incredibly scary. No one can sleep after watching it, and that's why I was so intrigued to watch it. I was a bit nervous while watching Silence because everyone made such a big deal about how scary it was. While watching it, I realized Silence is an incredibly action filled movie. It is done so well, the acting is perfect and the way everything turns out is amazing. I have to say that I didn't find it very scary ONLY because I had seen Hannibal before Silence. However, the ending is very, very intense, and I can see why people say it's scary. Also, just the fact what Hannibal Lector and Buffalo Bill do is scary enough. It's scary and not a movie to be seen alone on a rainy Friday night, it is a movie to see though because it is very well done."
ShadySovereign,"Jan 24, 2006",10/10,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is truly a masterpiece. It's a thriller that requires brains to figure out the twists and turns. It's not a mindless horror movie either; the horror elements are very psychological and tend to be disturbing. Furthermore, the film is almost exactly like the novel of the same name.I really love the characters in the movie because they stayed true to the characters in the book. Jodie Foster played the role of FBI rookie Clarice Starling in a very realistic setting, and Anthony Hopkins played his role as the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter superbly. Both characters were very convincing, thanks to the powerful performances done by Foster & Hopkins.The cinematography is outstanding. Everything about the background imagery mentioned in the book sprang to life in this film. Some locations look very beautiful, while others are downright creepy.The theme music throughout the movie is good and scary, enough to make your nerves tingle. There are also little scenes where familiar popular songs are featured.To conclude, this is a very rich film and sticks to the book very well. It is just as enjoyable as the novel.I give this film a 10/10."
big_alex_2002,"Jul 16, 2010",10/10,"Winner of 5 Oscars, Silence of the Lambs remains a dark, sinister and chilling tale with a chemistry between the two main leads that has to be seen to be believed.Rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster) seeks advice from the brilliant and cannibalistic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) for information on a new serial killer named ""Buffalo Bill"" who has a perverse habit of skinning his victims.Hopkins puts in a career best performance as the titular Doctor, providing us with one of cinema's most creepy and cold-blooded characters, his voice gets under your skin and stays with you forever. Foster is equally as superb as the rookie student, her vulnerability giving way to hardened and steely resolve during the cat and mouse climax.However, it's Ted Levine who steals the show as Buffalo Bill, his sexually-frustrated nature is enough to make even the most hardened viewer shudder (THAT dance).Chilling, goose-bump inducing and compelling, Silence of the Lambs is still one of the most decorated and riveting thrillers of the 90's."
AeroJeen,"Jan 11, 2000",9/10,"This is the most intriguing study into the mind of a psychopath I've ever seen.  The performances are astounding (how can you go wrong with Hopkins and Foster?) and deserve Oscar nominations for the next 20 years for this movie! The only thing that was missing - probably intentionally so - was insight into how Lecter became Lecter.  I would love to know.  I still watch this movie at least once every 6 months or so, just to get captivated all over again.  Some people can't watch it alone.  I'm not one of them."

ronakkotian,"Aug 12, 2020",9/10,"What can I say about The Silence of the Lambs that hasn't already been said. This is one of the best thrillers made.The Silence of the Lambs follows Clarice Starling, a FBI agent, who tries to find a serial killer that skins his victims by getting help from the creepy Dr. Hannibal Lecter.An absolute classic, The Silence of the Lambs is a thriller that manages to get under your skin. It's 2 hours long but it doesn't feel that way because of how engaging the story and characters are. A huge reason why this film succeeds are the performances. Jodie Foster is absolutely fantastic as Clarice Starling and managed to garner herself an Academy Award for it. However, one person who makes this film really memorable is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. With less than 20 minutes of screen time, Hopkins' portrayal of Lecter is phenomenal. His tone, expressions and way of delivering dialogues is very unsettling which makes Lecter one of the creepiest villians to ever exist.Apart from the performances, The Silence of the Lambs is exceptionally well made. Jonathan Demme's direction is terrific. Ted Tally's screenplay is filled with excellent dialogue that fleshes out each character to the fullest. The editing is really good. There isn't a single dull moment and the dark tone is consistent throughout which keeps you on the edge of your seat. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography creates such an eerie atmosphere to the world it's set in and the camerawork is filled with excellent shot choices. Whenever Clarice and Hannibal are together, the use of close-ups is applied effectively as it heightens the intensity of the scene. My only issue is the lighting during the night vision scene at the end but it's a very minor flaw that can be overlooked.The Silence of the Lambs is a 2 hour thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's filmmaking is handled extremely well and the two performances by Foster and Hopkins is absolutely iconic. If you haven't seen it, definitely check it out."
drkisa4,"Jan 11, 2015",9/10,"This movie was amazing. The dialogue was witty, clever and sometimes chilling. The directing was beautiful and the acting was absolutely superb. Jodie Foster was great as the the FBI agent Clarice Starling who is on the trail of a serial killer. Foster was good but the star is of course the magnificent Anthony Hopkins who steels the show with his rolling eyes and taunting voice. Both actors deserved the Oscars awarded to them. So did the director Jonathon Demme. The story was great, the only clique was with the ending that has always bugged me. The movie is an intelligent chilling thriller and there was this great build up to something that didn't meet the audience's expectations. Besides that everything about this movie was perfect. Highly recommended."
cradled_silence,"Jul 24, 2002",10/10,"I, regretfully, saw Hannibal before Silence of the Lambs. But it of course made me want to see it. I went out and bought the DVD. Watched it. Then, watched it again. This is the kind of movie that gets under your skin and stays there. Anthony Hopkins delivers a staggering and realistic performance as Jodie Foster compliments his 'lead' in every way possible. I can't wait for Red Dragon. Definitely one of the most thoroughly enjoyable films I've ever seen. Since seeing it, I've gotten the moth (from the DVD cover) tattooed on my back. The movie itself enchants me. There's a fine line between genius and insane, Hannibal walks it without stumbling."
jmauro98,"Mar 29, 2006",10/10,"The silence of the lambs is one of the creepiest ever made. However, I say that in a good way. It is the type of scare that doesn't pop out of the corner, but instead it get's into your head and plays around with you. That is the type of scare that i want to see in a movie. Buffalo Bill is probably one of the most messed up movie characters ever made. It rubs the lotion on it's skin or else it gets the hose again, is the line that I say to my friends and they get creeped out (he also does a ""dance"" in front of his camera). Hannible Lector, played by Anthony Hopkins, is the greatest villain ever in cinema history (it's true because the American Film Istatute named Hannibal the number 1 villain of all time). Why was he named that title why?. Well you are going to have to watch the film and find out for yourself."

Boyo-2,"Oct 1, 1999",1/10,"Other than Anthony Hopkin's performance, this movie has no value whatsoever and, in my opinion, is the worse movie to sweep the Oscars.

duce122,"Oct 26, 1999",9/10,"Silence of the Lambs (1991) C-118 min. D: Jonathan Demme. Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Anthony Heald. Suspenseful detective yarn about an FBI trainee whose only way to track down a notorious serial killer is to ask for help from another one, the infamous Hannibal `The Cannibal' Lectar. Pretty good mystery/thriller has some disgusting subject matter (even for the TV version, which is what I viewed) but hits home in a bravura finale. RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and gore, strong language, adult themes, and disturbing subject matter."
jbdorsky-2,"Feb 8, 2001",9/10,"When I sat down to this marinated, spiced-up thriller, I wasn't expecting such a treat!  After all, rarely does a film come along that's as delicious as this.Well anyway, while on my appetizer I lost my appetite a bit while I tried to swallow Anthony Hopkins's excellent acting and the vulgar themes of the film, but then as I chewed on the cannibalism, skinning, serial-killers, and dark tones a little more, I began to enjoy the meal.THEN I was launched into a SUPERB main course.  As I dove deeper into the course, I found that my meal had more of a special flavor (and Anthony Hopkins can certainly cook up a memorable line), and not to mention the excellent Jody Foster, whose explosive dish is in no way overshadowed by Anthony Hopkins.Then I came crashing down to the end...A delicious dessert that leads right into the sequel (which you can enjoy after February 9).And so, if you can stomach it, I dare you to make this YOUR main course. You'll be surprised what you can swallow.No pun intended."
kkjacclkec,"May 1, 2004",10/10,"the silence of the lambs is a truly excellent and clever film. it mixes action, suspense and sends shivers down your spine. throughout it has witty dialogue, which adds to the brilliance of the film. not only is the plot and the screenplay good, but the stars are on top form as well. the young jodie foster shows us her acting skills as she portrays the up-and-coming fbi agent clarice starling. she plays the character so well and she deservedly won the best-actress oscar for this film. anthony hopkins, as the psychotic hannibal ""the cannibal"" lector, doesn't let jodie have all the limelight and puts in a stunningly good performance as a villain. just like jodie, he deservedly won the best-actor oscar for ""silence of the lambs"". it is not surprising then when the best scenes in this film are between starling and lector. the chemistry is undoubted and i thoroughly enjoyed the chilling conversations between the two. silence of the lambs also won the oscar for best film . i would recommend this film to anyone."
SirTopher813,"Feb 11, 2007",9/10,"In your opinions, list the best Hannibal movies of the series in order...I haven't seen 'Hannibal Rising' yet or 'Manhunter', so I can't put the films in a legitimate order myself, but I will say 'Silence of the Lambs' is simply the best thus far (I'll be surprised if anyone thinks other wise). Personally, I thought 'Hannibal' was a piece of crap (maybe because I couldn't accept Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling, however, I preferred Harvey Keitel as Jack Crawford in 'Red Dragon').So for me at this point, I'll say... 1.Silence of the Lambs 2.Red Dragon 3.Hannibal 4.??? 5.???"
Blade-61,"Sep 27, 1999",10/10,"Undoubtedly one of the best films ever made complimented by numerous exquisite facets,Hopkins performance is unforgettable.His acting talent is used to what may be its full extent(I can never tell with him)and the evil psychopath is so well conveyed I almost forget that he is actually bad,I am almost endeared to him and found myself cheering him on.Only the scene of his escape demonstrates the insanity contained within the small unimposing figure who is capable of such violence and brutality.I simply cannot fault this film and to those who also share my love for this you can go to the Roger Ebert website.Why?you might ask,well while Mr Ebert gives a generally positive review his criticisms are ridiculous."
Movie_Rating_n_Ranking,"May 27, 2022",8/10,"It's the brightest jewel in the crown. The entire saga, including the subsequent novels, was made around and thanks to this dark and sinister film. Anthony Hopkins brilliantly portrays one of cinema's most iconic villains, unfurling his tentacles into the silhouette of the young innocent but cunning police trainee. In addition to Hopkins and Foster, excellent general direction decisions stand out, an adapted script that covers the best parameters of cinematographic suspense including unexpected turns and overwhelming silences. Photography and editing stand out equally.Unfortunately, it is not exempt from the Yankee imprint by including elements typical of North American cinema, involuntarily lowering the quality of the final product.Still, it's one of the best pieces of cinematography of its decade.Totally recommended, for people with a strong stomach."

bluepink,"Apr 14, 2020",6/10,"It's a really good movie... but to me - it doesn't align with the overall IMDb rating. Don't get me wrong - it is a great movie... the storytelling is good. The acting was great too, in particular - Anthony & Jodie were perfect in their roles.
But the movie did become a little bit boring towards the end and I was willing for it to wrap up. Perhaps because something major happened in the middle portion of the movie, and then after that it quickly went flat. The ending was bland. I've watched it twice now, and I've felt the same both times. I much prefer 'Red Dragon' over this one. I easily gave that a high rating.
But I don't want to take away from the fact it is still a good movie and was enjoyable."
BaldJean,"Jul 31, 2007",5/10,"Very overrated movie, in my opinion. Not really bad, but nothing special either. I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. The story is only so-so, with a few logical holes. For example, why should one serial killer be able to understand another serial killer better? It really makes no sense to me. The acting is good, but nothing special either. I believe it is only so very popular because it broke one of the last taboos (cannibalism) in a mainstream movie. But that is not enough for a good movie. I admit I am a bit old fashioned about movies; for some things it is better if they are not shown but only hinted at. This sets the imagination of the viewer into work. Unfortunately many people have lost the grasp for these subtleties."
keithsalinas,"Jun 17, 2024",10/10,"I adore this movie! Amazing acting, thoughtful plot.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a chilling masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of traditional horror and thriller genres. Directed by Jonathan Demme and based on the novel by Thomas Harris, the film weaves a gripping narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.At the heart of the film is Anthony Hopkins' mesmerizing performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant yet monstrous psychiatrist imprisoned for his heinous crimes. Hopkins' portrayal is hauntingly compelling, delivering lines with a chilling charisma that lingers long after the credits roll. Jodie Foster shines as Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee tasked with advising Lecter on how to catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill, played with unnerving intensity by Ted Levine.The brilliance of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" lies not only in its nail-biting suspense, but also in its exploration of complex psychological themes. It delves deep into the psyches of its characters, especially Lecter and Starling, unraveling their motivations and fears in a cat-and-mouse game that is as intellectual as it is terrifying.Demme's direction is meticulous, creating an atmosphere of dread and unease through skillful cinematography and a haunting score. The movie's pacing is impeccable, building tension with each scene until it reaches a heart-pounding crescendo in the unforgettable climax.Beyond its thrills, The Silence of the Lambs is a thought-provoking exploration of power dynamics, identity, and the darkness that resides within all of us. It challenges viewers to confront their deepest fears while questioning the nature of evil itself."
Maniac-9,"Mar 3, 2012",10/10,"Anthony Hopkins gives one of the absolute best movie performance ever as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, like he was born to play the role. Even though Brian Cox played the role earlier in Manhunter a prequel to Silence of the Lambs(which Hopkins later re-did in Red Dragon), but Hopkins just makes you think no else should've ever attempted to play this role other then me. Since no one else is ever going to do as good at the role so even trying to do so is a futile effort.Jodie Foster starred as young FBI agent Clarice Starling who goes to the facility that Lecter is being held to interview him to get help find another serial killer, Buffalo Bill.Silence of the Lambs is one of the few movies to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director(Jonathan Demme), Best Actor(Hopkins) and Best Actress(Foster).One of the best suspense movies ever made."
imdke,"Apr 7, 2007",10/10,"Congratulations are in order. Each of the films has lots to offer (Manhunter the least), but Silence of --- offers the most. I've never seen a better performance from Jodie Foster. Anthony Hopkins will forever be remembered as Dr. Lector. Who else could play the role? Johnny Depp, as fine an actor as he is?On to the most despicable characters; they are so easy to hate, more so than Lector's murderous cadre of acolytes, who, after all, have an excuse. In order of increasing odiousness: 1. Catherine, the rich, loudmouthed senator's daughter. Whatta bitch! She would have done better as a capacious frock. 2. Freddy Lounds, the flaming asshole tabloid publisher. Whatta spectacular way to go! 3. Dr. Chilton, the smarmy director of the mental hospital, who never tired of tormenting his prisoner, Hannibal Lector. Did he go well with fava beans? We can only hope so, for Lector's sake.Finally, is that Barney who gets off the plane in the ISLANDS, MON, with Dr. Chilton? There was a remark made about security for the Big Shots. If so, that was just desserts.One of the most sensuous scenes in any film I have seen is when the blind woman, Reba, is taken by Dolarhyde to 'experience' the beautiful tiger, under sedation. The way she listened, took in the scent and touched the animal, finally burying her cheek in its fur. Now, THAT was a scene! It beats the pants off Salome's dance, eh?"
bellino-angelo2014,"Sep 20, 2022",8/10,"SILENCE OF THE LAMBS has achieved a cult status. It has 8,6 and it has the distinction (shared with AS GOOD AS IT GETS and a few others) of the Best Actor and Best Actress. Few months ago I finally saw it and I have to say, it's not exactly a masterpiece but still good.Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is a rookie FBI cadet that is assigned by her chief Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to investigate on a series of murders that look like made by a same person that has the same object of ossession: young women. Her only help is Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who is enclosed in an asylum because he has also nourished on human flesh. Clarice will then find the psychotic Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) and when she'll be promoted in the FBI Lecter goes in the Bahamas unnoticed in the crowd.It has all the elements of a great thriller, and the performances by Hopkins and Foster are worth deserving of their Academy Awards. The nature of it (about a serial killer that murders young women) might be a turn off, and it's also one of those thrillers to follow carefully.Overall, a very good thriller but certainly not a classic like its position in the top 250 might make you think, but mostly it achieved a cult movie status thanks to the Academy Awards."
kpat,"Oct 26, 1998",10/10,"Silence of the Lambs is a well constructed suspense/thriller taking us to depths of the human psyche that are repugnant to the Christian soul.  And while we turn our heads and hide our eyes at grisly demise and naked evil, at the same time we are intrigued by the motivations and actions contained therein.  Jodie Foster plays the role of Clarice Starling with a hardened vulnerability which surfaces in her encounters with Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).  The first time I watched the movie, I was engrossed in all aspects of it- the disappearance of the senator's daughter, the mystery of Buffalo Bill, and the terrifying aspect of Hannibal Lecter.  But in successive viewings, the part that stands out the most is the interaction of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins.  It is this interaction that allows this movie to transcend the genre of suspense/ thriller and defines a class unto itself.  Lecter uses his finely tuned manipulative instincts to peel away the layers of Starling revealing the closely guarded motivation for her entire life's work.  He delves beneath her mask of coolness and self sufficiency revealing her inner vulnerability.  And somehow, while revealing the most intimate secrets about herself, she still manages to deceive Lecter and gain the upper hand- if only for awhile.While this interaction is the core of the movie, there is a plot, and it is a very good one.  For what I have outlined thus far could easily be a romance, but the twist is Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer with a very loose sense of morality and Jodie Foster is an FBI agent whose moral code is strict and uncompromising.  And while Lecter is peeling layers from Clarice Starling's walls, he is chilling us with his icy demeanor- describing how he loves to eat human liver and fava beans- and leading Starling on a merry hunt for clues to the name of the elusive Buffalo Bill; who has captured another victim with time ticking away.  In summary, the greatness of Silence of the Lambs lies in its ability to bring the demons of its heroine's past and intertwine them around a complex suspense/mystery, and keep the audience interested the entire time."
matiascg,"Jul 17, 2025",10/10,"The Silence of the Lambs is not just a film-it's an experience, a chilling descent into the darkest corners of the human mind. Directed by Jonathan Demme and based on Thomas Harris's novel, this 1991 psychological thriller is a masterclass in suspense, atmosphere, and character study. It's a rare cinematic achievement that effortlessly blends horror and crime drama while introducing one of the most iconic villains in film history.At the heart of the film is Clarice Starling (played flawlessly by Jodie Foster), a young FBI trainee with a quiet strength and vulnerability that make her instantly compelling. When she's sent to interview the brilliant and incarcerated psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (played by the legendary Anthony Hopkins), the psychological cat-and-mouse game begins. Lecter isn't just a prisoner-he's a genius, a manipulator, and a cannibalistic serial killer whose chilling calm and piercing intellect steal every scene he's in.What makes The Silence of the Lambs a 10/10 film is its perfect balance between terror and intelligence. It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares or gore to horrify its audience. Instead, it explores the monstrous aspects of the human psyche through dialogue, silence, and unnerving close-ups. The interaction between Clarice and Lecter is the film's core-tense, layered, and psychologically charged. These scenes feel like duels fought with words and glances rather than weapons.Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of Dr. Lecter is iconic for a reason. With just 16 minutes of screen time, he creates a character that is both terrifying and oddly charismatic. Every word he speaks, every controlled movement, is calculated and hypnotic. Jodie Foster, on the other hand, gives one of her finest performances. Clarice isn't a typical Hollywood hero-she's smart, determined, and deeply human. Her quiet struggle to prove herself in a male-dominated environment adds another layer to the story's depth.The film's pacing is impeccable. It never lingers too long in one place, and the sense of dread builds with each scene. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto uses shadow and symmetry to amplify the unease, while Howard Shore's haunting score perfectly complements the mood. Every element-direction, acting, writing, editing-works together seamlessly.What elevates The Silence of the Lambs beyond its genre is its thematic richness. It explores power, fear, gender, and identity in subtle and thoughtful ways. The famous line, ""I do wish we could chat longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner,"" lingers not just because of its wit, but because it encapsulates Lecter's terrifying mix of civility and savagery.More than three decades after its release, The Silence of the Lambs remains just as gripping and disturbing. It won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress-and deserved every one. Few films have managed to be so intellectually engaging while still being viscerally terrifying.In short, The Silence of the Lambs is a flawless film. It's a psychological thriller that doesn't just entertain-it gets under your skin and stays there. A true 10/10. Unforgettable, unsettling, and utterly brilliant."

Sabriane,"May 19, 2000",4/10,"For me, this movie was a pretty blah experience. That it managed to grab the top five Academy Awards is a mystery to me; 1991 must have been a truly dismal year for the movies if the Academy chose to honour this rather average offering. I've been really anxious to see the film after I've heard so many good things about it, and as I sat through the first rather unremarkable half-an-hour, I kept saying to myself: ""Ok, it should get brilliant any time soon now... shouldn't it??"" But it didn't. It wasn't involving, it wasn't chilling or scary or compelling in any way. I usually adore Jodie Foster, but here she gave an unremarkable performance and I didn't care for her character one bit. Anthony Hopkins almost saved the movie for me with his truly brilliant turn as Dr Lecter, but I felt that it was a supporting role at best. Overall, Se7en is a way better movie than this so-called ""masterpiece""."

tony's,"Mar 13, 1999",10/10,"I became a devoted fan of Hopkins and Foster after I saw this movie.  I also bought my own copy.  It's one of those movies that keeps you on the edge of the seat, wondering if 'our little Billy must be searching for that next special someone' in our neighborhood.  Apparently there's a possible sequal in the making.  Let's hope so.  The cast of this movie must have made quite an impact.  Watch FREEWAY and notice the multitude of actors with small parts in both movies.  Enjoy!"
Inliten,"Dec 13, 2002",10/10,"'The Silence of the Lambs,' the second adaptation in a trilogy of Thomas Harris novels, is simply outstanding.  Jodie Foster (Best Actress) and Anthony Hopkins (Best Actor), as FBI trainee Clarice Starling and the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter, steal the show.Clarice Starling is summoned into FBI Agent Crawford's (Scott Glenn) office, where she learns that she will be interviewing the brilliant cannibal. what ensues is a fantastic rendition of Harris's crime novel.  Obviously, any film that garners 5 Oscars is sure to be an exciting dose of entertainment.If you enjoy this film, you're sure to enjoy 'Red Dragon' and possibly 'Hannibal,' although the latter was botched significantly."
MAJ-8,"Apr 21, 2000",10/10,"Having read the book, I was prepared for this film but I could hardly believe that it would stand up to the book. After 6 times it still attracts me. Anthony Hopkins performance is insuperable, Foster is brilliant and Demme's direction will be unforgettable."
perfect382,"Jun 20, 2004",10/10,"since i first saw ""The Silence of the Lambs"" when i was 12 years old, i have been terrified. This first time i laid eyes on Hannibal Lector questioning Clarice Starling about her unfortunate past, i knew i was hooked. The pure evil he held in his eyes has captivated me since. Jody Foster should now be considered one of he greatest female movie detectives of all time. She provided an excellent view into the life of a struggling student with real skills that was able to overcome her previous experiences. I now consider ""The Silence of the Lambs"", not only my favorite horror/suspense film of all time, but just my flat-out favorite. Anthony Hopkin's portrayal of Dr. Lector deserves every snippit of praise it has received, and could probably deserve much more. I wish the other ""Lector"" films could hold up to this one. EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS FILM!"
Bon_Jovi_chick,"Jan 26, 2004",10/10,I only watched this film because I'm studying Jodie Foster films for my university thesis. I started the thesis three months ago and Ive become somewhat hooked on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. A truly magnificent and definetly Jodie Foster's best. Sir Anthony Hopkins was incredibly chilling in this film and its one of the few films that does send tension and chills through my spine.Both Foster and Hopkins deserved the acting Oscar for their roles- Foster was so perfect as the brilliant but vulnerable Starling. Its a shame that HANNIBAL could not beat this film.It deserves a higher ranking on this list than 26!10/10H xxxxxx
bo3tb,"Dec 12, 2025",7/10,"First of all, I went into the movie expecting a big plot twist, a tight story, something really strong. But honestly, I was surprised that it turned out to be a regular classic. Yeah, it was an excellent movie for its time, but it might not work for people who are used to a fast pace and heavy, complex stories. That's the first weak point for me - the movie is purely classic.It's worth watching for general audiences, crime-psychology fans, and people who love old-school films. But it's not really for anyone who likes fast pacing. The progression of events was good, the acting was really solid, but the story itself is simple and has been repeated a lot over the years - even though it was unique and groundbreaking back in 1991.Overall, my advice before watching it: don't expect a lot of plot twists or some deep, crazy storyline. Just enjoy the tension, the character performances, and pay attention to the dialogues. It's a good movie - I'd give it a 7/10."

Cthulhucult,"Aug 15, 2001",10/10,"Silence of the lambs was one of the few horror movies that has actually terrified me, and probably the one that has scared me the most. Instead of relying on startles or cheap slasher gore for effect, this movie operates on its extraordinary direction and plot. The incredible imagery, and masterfully developed characters of this movie suck you right into a world of surreal horror and insanity. This is a must see if you enjoy scary movies."
rhuffer,"Nov 30, 2000",10/10,"Hands down the greatest thriller of the 90's, if not of all time. If you have not seen Silence of the Lambs you are missing out on one of the greatest films of all time. Anthony Hopkins seems born for this role (as is evidenced by the fact that it was HE who invented that hissing noise Dr. Lecter makes at Clarice). Jodie Foster, in one of her greatest roles ever, plays rookie FBI Agent Clarice Starling. These two actors, along with the inspired director Jonathan Demme and marvelous screenwriter Ted Tally joined forces and created one of the best films ever. A brilliant psychological thriller and a golden gem of movie making, it is must see for everyone."

OriginalMovieBuff21,"Mar 7, 2006",10/10,"The Silence of the Lambs is about a young FBI agent named Clarice Starling, who is assigned to save a missing woman kidnapped by psychopathic killer with the help of another killer. The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best films of the 90's and the best of 1991 by far. The acting is the main reason why this film should be looked at. Jodie Foster, Ted Levine, and especially, Anthony Hopkins have excellent performances and they make this Oscar winner, a great one to watch. The screenplay written by Ted Tally is excellent and the rich dialogue, gave Anthony Hopkins's 19 minute screen time an Oscar, mainly because of his greatly used dialogue. The directing, cinematography, and soundtrack also made this an enjoyable and fantastic film to watch. I highly recommend it!Quote of the movie: ""A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.""Hedeen's Outlook: 9.5/10 **** A"
Karok-2,"Nov 26, 1999",10/10,"Has been for many years my favourite movie, and Jodie became my favorite actress. There is a great movie, thanks to Mr Hopkins and Mrs Foster. They did great performances, and the Oscar was deserved. All movie deserved the five major award. I enjoy the movie every time I see it again. Jonathan Demme did a great job directing this thriller, that keeps you interested about it since the first moment you hear a conversation in the movie. Is just great!"
mooshmassacre,"Aug 24, 2024",9/10,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a masterful blend of horror and psychological intrigue that crawls under your skin and refuses to leave. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter delivers a performance so chilling, it's like watching a predator toying with its prey-every word a calculated strike. Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling, vulnerable yet fiercely determined, pulls you into a dark world where the line between hunter and hunted blurs.Jonathan Demme's direction turns every frame into a tense, claustrophobic dance between fear and fascination. The film doesn't just scare you; it makes you think, leaving you with questions that linger long after the final scene. It's a disturbing, unforgettable journey into the darkest corners of the human psyche."
victoriabizet,"Nov 3, 2023",6/10,"This movie is about a woman called Clarice Starling, an agent from the FBI, that is looking for Buffalo Bill, a serial killer.I liked the movie, but i think that there were much different things compare with the book (which i read first), so maybe I was expected more.What i liked about the movie was the suspense, like in every minute I wanted to know what was going to happen next and I think that suspense is so important to attract people.I would give this movie six stars out of ten since I was expecting more about it.I would recommend this movie to the type of persons that like criminal and thriller ones. 🤗"

It's a such boring movie."
vac71684,"Nov 30, 1999",10/10,"Silence of the Lambs is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, psychologically that is.  It is definitely a must-see and Anthony Hopkins delivers a magnificent performance.  Jodi Foster is also excellent and delivers her part with such realism."
apilon,"Jul 18, 2003",10/10,"The silence of the lambs earns its prestigious distinction as the third movie ever to sweep the big five at the Oscars. Foster plays young but exceptional Clarice Starling, who in efforts to hunt down a serial killer holding a woman hostage, must interview another such psychopath. The mind of former psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter is twisted but brillant, and may hold the key to the mind of the man the FBI is looking for...but in order to get at this information and earn his trust, Clarice must use her only bargaining chip: The revelations of her own deepest fears and vulnerabilities. Truly creepy, smart and astoundingly good, this movie deserves the hype... A must see"
peterw1210,"Mar 28, 2022",8/10,"This is one of those films you watch and just have to give praise to the director, writers, and casting. The casting was terrific, the scenes were well written and executed by the actors. Cinematography made the film really creeper, which is what it was intended to invoke. Really well done. Soundtrack could've probably been better, but this was a great film all in all.Overall, 8/10."
imdbfan-8111396081,"Mar 15, 2025",9/10,"'The Silence of the Lambs' is a near-perfect blend of psychological horror, thriller, and crime drama. From start to finish, it grips you with its tense atmosphere, brilliant storytelling, and unforgettable characters. Jodie Foster delivers a phenomenal performance as Clarice Starling, bringing depth and determination to her role. But it's Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter who truly steals the show-his chilling, calculated presence lingers long after the credits roll.The film's pacing is excellent, building suspense with every scene while never feeling rushed. The cinematography and score add to the unsettling tone, making the film an immersive experience. It's smart, intense, and masterfully crafted.The only reason I'm not giving it a perfect 10 is that a few minor details could have been explored further. But overall, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is a must-watch, especially for fans of psychological thrillers."
marmar-69780,"Jun 29, 2020",10/10,"Silence of the lambs is from now one of my favourite crime thrillers ever made and putting a lot of horror elements in it just helped this movie to be seperated from others and to become something much and big cult classic,during whole runtime i wasnt bored at all and i found every scene to be fascinating but also very creepy and unsetteling in a good way,jodie foster give wonderful performance and when she appered for first time on screen,i immediatly like here and started to root for her,what can be said about hopkins here,him was absolutly brilliant and even if in two hours movie he had only 15 minutes of screentime,he was brilliant and memorable in every one of them,ted levine was great to at least as creepy as hannibal,and he was even able to hold his own with two leads,silence of the lambs was a creepy but also very effective and astonishing horror thriller"
MaximillianZeus,"Apr 6, 2025",7/10,"Watching The Silence of the Lambs was an experience that I can only describe as once in a lifetime. It's an excellent thriller that grips you from the very first moment and refuses to let go-a film that is both horrifying and unforgiving in its portrayal of evil. The acting is nothing short of extraordinary, with Anthony Hopkins delivering a performance so subtle yet terrifying that it remains seared into your memory.From the meticulous direction to the raw intensity of every scene, the film creates a world where danger lurks in every whispered word and every measured pause. Hopkins' portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a masterclass in restraint; his calm, almost polite demeanor belies the monstrous intellect and chilling menace within. Coupled with Jodie Foster's determined and vulnerable performance as Clarice Starling, the film succeeds in drawing you deep into a narrative where innocence is constantly under threat.That said, I couldn't help but notice moments where the film feels tonally inconsistent. There are times when the tension seems to waver, as if the narrative hesitates between stark terror and a more clinical, procedural approach. Moreover, the musical score, while often atmospheric, occasionally feels out of place, disrupting the otherwise relentless buildup of suspense. Despite these minor missteps, they do little to detract from the film's overall impact.Ultimately, The Silence of the Lambs is a must-watch-a film that challenges you to confront the darkest aspects of human nature while never compromising on the quality of its storytelling or performances. Even if you find yourself questioning the occasional tonal shift or off-key musical moment, the sheer power of Hopkins' performance and the film's unyielding exploration of evil and innocence make it an unforgettable cinematic journey."
bilging,"Apr 25, 2025",2/10,"The movie is often described as a masterpiece, but to me, it feels like a very ordinary serial killer story wrapped in an exaggerated package. The plot follows a formula we've seen many times before-a young agent chasing a disturbed killer, with the added gimmick of another killer offering advice. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about it once you look past the film's reputation.What makes it worse are the performances, which feel overacted and artificial. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter is iconic to many, but his exaggerated style borders on theatrical parody rather than delivering a truly terrifying figure. Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling, meant to be a determined and relatable heroine, often comes across as stiff and unnatural. The emotional connection is missing, and most of the interactions feel scripted rather than real.Visually, the film is decent but not memorable, and while the score tries to create tension, it often feels forced. Instead of offering a deep psychological exploration, the film leans heavily on clichés and surface-level shocks. For a movie so highly praised, it delivers little more than a standard crime story with performances that never let you forget you are watching actors, not real people.My ratings for Performances - 2/10, Story/Screenplay: 2/5, Acting: 2/5, Cinematography: 3/5, Music/Score: 1/5, Emotional Impact: 1/5, Originality: 2/5, Rewatch Value: 1/5, Thriller/Suspense: 1/5."

pieintheface,"Jun 1, 2003",10/10,"Silence of the Lambs is a modern day classic. That is all anyone can say about it. From the day it hit theaters, this was the movie that defined the psycho-serial killer drama. Even more, though, the movie is able to escape the horror genre and explore other themes, which is perhaps the main reason it has garnered as many accolades as it has. In recent cinema, I cannot recall another movie that had won the top five awards at the Oscars (Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor, and Actress) and all deserved for that matter.The movie still keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it, and believe me, I've watched it numerous times. The best part about it is that I find new things to marvel over every time I watch it and the special features on the DVD version enlighten me to even more exciting new things. This was the role of a lifetime for Jodie Foster. In fact, Foster's portrayal of Starling was a pivotal part of the movie. Her humility and vulnerability contrasting with her strong convictions and go-get-em attitude created the perfectly believable character. Her role as a young FBI agent separated from her male counterparts opens the door for gender analysis as well. Furthermore, the chemistry between Hopkins and Foster was so strong that it created the `Beauty and the Beast' relationship originally intended by author Thomas Harris.It's hard to pinpoint exactly what is so remarkable about Demme's film, other than that it's just a good movie. Oftentimes, the film is dark, but it is executed with such deft that the film never loses its viewer."
pinkpixiedust,"May 15, 1999",10/10,"Silence of the Lambs is the best movie I have seen, so far. I loved how it wasn't so much blood-and-guts-flying-across-the-room horror, but more psychological. The performances of Hopkins and Foster were so real you forgot it was a movie you were watching and not real events and they truly deserved the Oscars they picked up for their roles. I suggest you also watch Manhunter which is based on the prequel to the novel Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, which has a Dr. Lecktor in it. There is also plans for the upcoming sequel to the book, Hannibal, to be made into a movie, so watch out for that, I'm sure it will be just as excellent as Silence of the Lambs was."
TJ_at_the_drive_in,"Nov 18, 2025",10/10,Hannibal the cannibal. One of the best villains of all time. Jodie Foster is incredible in this. Still to this day the only horror film to win the academy award for best picture. The book is even better. Buffalo bill is.. eccentric to say the least. This is one of those films everybody has to see at least once.
DaisyS-93,"Jul 29, 2025",10/10,"This movie is seriously one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. The cast is spot-on, and Anthony Hopkins absolutely crushes it. If you're in the mood for something creepy and chilling, I'd totally recommend it. Clarice is such a fantastic character, and she really enhances the plot. I won't spoil anything, but that first part when she visits Hannibal is just gross. It's super eerie, and I think it's a must-watch for anyone!"
shadock-2,"Feb 8, 2001",9/10,"This film is supposed to be scary, and it is.  The tension throughout is unbelievable.  However, unlike others in the ""thriller"" or ""horror"" genre, the horror is never gratuitous or hard to take.  As such, being a hater of this genre, I only got around to watching this several years after it was made.  Now I wish I had seen it before.Unlike the villains who cut and slash in the standard horror films, we understand that the psychos in this film have motivation.  You actually feel empathy for these people, even the man who doesn't have any - Hannibal Lecter.  You feel sorry that this obviously cultured, intelligent and, yes, dedicated man is trapped not in a prison, but by the fact his brain can't stop him from carrying out the worst things he can imagine.  As such, this film sheds as much light on the criminally insane as any twelve films that could be made about Charles Manson or any of his ilk.  Demme actually tries to understand what makes Hannibal the man he is, and in the end we start to understand as well.Add to this an excellent plot, engaging characters, and ""good guys"" that seem more out of it than the villains and you have a must see movie even for the most squeamish.That being said, I hope the sequel can live up to the original.  I have my doubts, but all being said, I hope Ridley Scott pulls it off."
Kuki,"Jan 18, 1999",10/10,"One of the most brillant film I've ever seen. Hannibal Lecter really can ""touch"" us. In the night I've seen The Silence of the Lambs I couldn't sleep. Just suberb!"
oscardandridge,"Aug 29, 2024",9/10,"Being a fan of the Thomas Harris books, I have to rate The Silence of the Lambs as one of the best thriller movies of the 20th century. The cast is outstanding in all of their performances, with Jodie Foster shining supreme in that regards. Though Anthony Hopkins plays a very sinister version of Hannibal, I found there to be a comedic element to it, that left me feeling a bit cheated from the books. Regardless, The Silence of the Lambs is one of those films that must be watched on a regular basis due to it's outstanding nature. Out of the adaptions to screen of the Hannibal series of books, this comes in second to Hannibal Rising in regards to closeness to the books itself."
