mattatthemovies,"Dec 6, 2023",8/10,"I've seen a ton of people misrepresent this movie as the one about the pervert who creeps on his daughters friend. But that evaluation completely misses the amount of substance there is that lies below the surface.This movie is about a bunch of people who live unhappy lives and have no real means to change that. It is about their desperate attempts to overcome their unhappiness. The acting in this movie is fantastic, and they all do such a great job bringing these characters to life.The soundtrack is well done, the direction is wonderful, and script has a unique sense of humor that almost seems charming. I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it."
RueMorgue,"May 29, 2000",10/10,"This film is one of a kind.  After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach.  It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism.  However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind.  Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film.  I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time.  I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it.  I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating.  However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film.  While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind.  I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a ""comedy-drama"", I don't see anything about this film as funny.  Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty.  But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.My Rating:  10/10"
SD-4,"Mar 22, 2000",10/10,"I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice.  Everyone saying that it was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes.  Nevertheless, this one was a certain exception.It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the American community and about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in the community, habits of behaviour such as ""...if you want to succeed, you always have to seem successful..."" or ""never stop smiling"", parasites of the community, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are ""different"", who are ""freaky"" to some extent; and eventually, there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to wait for the very ending of the film, to discover this.With very deep and accurate exaggeration, (most of) the characters in the movie demonstrate the worst, the darkest sides of their personality, while still remaining very human, very touching and very involving the observer. Everyone can find a certain similarity with characters and persons who he met in his life, in the characters described in the film.  The tragi-comical events, the little pieces of funny, disturbing irony dripping from almost every episode, lead the observer to exploration of the American Beauty -- the beauty in life, and the way that we fail to find it, for all our life; the way we hide our feelings and emotions, even behind sullen walls of our sepulchre.The acting is truly brilliant, the episodes are built logically, coherently, the dialogues are deep, thrilling, intriguing; every sentence and every word is deeply constructed, containing profound irony and intelligent elements of humors.  The plot is very intelligently built, constructing a true indication of the sad situation of the American society, and an excellent ground for the actors.An amazing movie, strongly recommended.  10/10"
ryan_lynch,"Feb 26, 2000",10/10,"""American Beauty"" is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes' brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own 'American Dream' - yet, in the end, only one character truly attains it.Having seen ""Happiness"" only recently, I could not help but draw comparisons: both films centre around a microcosm of society in which the people, in their own unique way, all strive to be successful or simply 'happy'. But here the similarities end: the characters in ""Happiness"" undergo a self-realisation process through which they become increasingly aware of their meaningless existence, and go on to wallow in their own depravity. ""Happiness"" shows no signs of redemption; whereas in ""American Beauty"" the audience is offered a sense of hope, of salvation, though the characters must endure a similar fate, or more accurately, they must endure the way of life in which they are trapped.The pivotal character upon which this theme centres, is the father Lester, played impeccably by Kevin Spacey. He is presented to us as a bit of a loser who plays the subjugated figure in the home and at work. He appears resigned to an unhappy life in which he is treated badly by his wife and daughter and his boss at work. Seemingly beyond redemption, Lester transforms from being a loser.Mendes portrays this transformation admirably well: he shows Lester on his 'path to enlightenment' pushed up against a grim background of suburbanite existence. These early scenes are well balanced, forming a steady rhythm of TV commercial-like vignettes which prove very comical, if at times unsettling. As Lester reflects in the film: ""My life is like a commercial"". And how this rings true: like in ""Happiness"", all the characters hide underneath this veneer of normality and respectability, yet they are all revealed to be nothing but the opposite: depressed, depraved and desperate.Lester's wife, played by Annette Benning, is the most success-driven character in the story which renders her the most hopeless in the film's tone of moral conviction. ""In order to be successful in life one must project the appearance of success"" is the maxim she adopts from the 'king' of real estate, Buddy King. It is a phrase which resonates throughout the film: for Benning's pawn, life is all about keeping-up appearances. This is where Lester differs from her: his emancipation is enabled by him discarding the constraints of 'normal life' and following what his heart desires.Lester is the catalyst in this narrative in which the ancillary characters either follow suit (as does his daughter and Ricky) or pay the price (as does his wife and the Colonel). The irony inherent in this film, and it grows with resonance as the film draws to a conclusion, is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.This film left me gasping for air: its hyper-realism conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban comedy, a jolting-shock of realisation, and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who, to varying degrees, all strive for a certain 'American Dream', yet so few actually attain it. Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label, the beauty of ""American Beauty"" is that it sits half-way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best."
reesew18,"Jul 7, 2001",10/10,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her ""typical teenager"" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His ""purpose"" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.Most films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to ""move"" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember."
andrew7,"Feb 5, 2002",6/10,"I first saw this in theaters back in 1999.  I loved it.  I really really loved it.  I've seen it four or five times since, and each time, I like it less.  I just saw it again a couple of days ago, and I stopped it before it was over.  At that moment, I decided to sell my DVD.  It has now been excised from my DVD Collection, about which I have considerable pride.The main reason is that I have come to feel very strongly that this film doesn't know what it wants to say.  It takes a bunch of characters, constructs various relationships between them, and sets them loose to run around for two hours, at the end of which, what have we learned?I've heard lots of people make comparisons between this film and another highly acclaimed movie of 1999 which I hate:  Fight Club.  Both films include philosophically flimsy but highly entertaining critiques of materialism.  With Fight Club, the critique on materialism is made by the character who turns out to be the villain of the piece, who seeks to replace it with fascism.  In American Beauty, the anti-consumerist is, first of all, a total hypocrite, and second of all, has a life changing epiphany the moment before his death, but never gets a chance to expound upon what that epiphany was.On the hypocrisy charge, consider the oft-quoted scene when Lester Burnham (magnificently portrayed by Kevin Spacey) yells at his wife Carolyn (played in an over-the-top caricature by Annette Bening) for placing too high a value on material things, in this case, a sofa.  Fine.  He makes a good point.  No one else seems to have noticed, however, that this is precisely the same scene where it is revealed that Lester has bought a 1970 Pontiac Firebird.  Since we at no time see Lester enjoying the use of his car, the implication is that possession of the object is a good in itself, which is the very apex of materialism.There are lots of other things that we don't see, and I never noticed until I ""looked closer"" how conspicuous they are in their absence.  We never see Angela or Jane don a cheerleading uniform after their initial cheerleading scene.  They never make any reference to being cheerleaders.  The whole concept of cheerleading, then, is merely a mechanism (and quite a contrived, not to mention cliched mechanism at that) to introduce Lester to Angela.I also noticed, when I looked closer, how painfully bad much of the dialogue given to the younger characters is.  ""Lame-o""  ""Geekboy""  ""Take a whizz"" It's just horrid.  And why, exactly, was Jane looking at a breast augmentation website?  First of all, her breasts don't appear to need augmenting (when I saw this in theaters, I thought she must want to reduce her breasts, but upon looking closer, the computer monitor clearly says ""augmentation"", which means a process of adding to).The worst flaw of the film, by far, is the fact that we have one horrible cliche repeated twice in the space of minutes in the final act.  The homophobic marine turns out to be a repressed homosexual, and the slutty cheerleader turns out to be a virgin.  For the love of God, who let those two howlers slip through.  Bad enough that either made the final cut, but both?!!  It defies understanding.The scene that made me turn the film off, this final time that I watched it, was the scene were Jane and Ricky decide to run off together.  I was never very comfortable with this scene, because, call me conservative, I'm just not thrilled about a girl dropping out of school at the tender age of seventeen (or so) and running off with her drug dealer boyfriend.  But what really got my goat was when Ricky ridiculed Angela by calling her ordinary. Fair enough, Angela had it coming.  But for Ricky to not only accept Angela's principle that ordinariness is bad, but to use it against her... that bothered me.  Ordinariness or lack thereof is not a valid criterion for judging the worth of a human being.  Ricky, having been set up (clumsily) as a heroic character, shouldn't have descended to such a twisted and hateful principle.The whole film has the feel of having been made up as it went along.  It is radically different from how it was originally planned to go.  The prelude sequence and the scene later in the film which it foreshadowed have become utterly pointless since the removal of the subplot about Jane and Ricky being blamed for Lester's murder.  Now, that subplot is a bit ridiculous, and was cut for a good reason, I agree.  But why leave the set up if you're cutting the payoff?  [Notice that Ricky shuts off the camera before Jane says ""You know I'm joking, right?""]The sequence where Col. Fitts spies on Ricky and Lester is straight out of ""Three's Company.""  Fitts sees just enough to draw the conclusion that the writer wants him to draw, and nothing else.  That's a classic example (and the most blatant I can recall from any film) of bad, contrived plotting. What exactly was up with Mrs. Fitts?  Presumably, her scenes meant something in some previous, unreleased version of the story.  The initial meeting between Lester and Ricky is built on numerous coincidences... Ricky just happens to be working there, and he works there just long enough to meet Lester!!!  And what self-respecting drug dealer would give a man $2,000 worth of merchandise on the assumption that he'd be willing/able to pay for it later?  It would have been more contrived if Lester happened to have $2,000 in cash while jogging, but ""I know you're good for it"" isn't much better.This film is ambitious.  There are lots of individual pieces of greatness in it.  There are a lot of really good ideas.  But on a fundamental level, it just doesn't work."
Philip_Pugh,"Nov 29, 2003",10/10,"Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of a mid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his teenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter (Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; ""a typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused..."". And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) has an obsession of her own, her public appearance.Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new neighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the outside.As life begins to improve (with most of the main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comes crashing down in the climactic final day.The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more amazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film screen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experience writing TV sitcoms -  not  that you'd be able to guess from the tone of this film).The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes manages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast, who are all faultless. No doubt Mendes' theatre directing past played a huge part in directing the actors so well.Another person worthy of a mention is the late director of photography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscar recipients for this film.All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, steals this film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what it is. Truly an ensemble effort. 10/10."
Falko_h1,"Jul 9, 2024",7/10,"""American Beauty,"" a 1999 film directed by Sam Mendes, offers a provocative and darkly humorous examination of suburban life and the disillusionment that can lurk beneath its surface. The movie follows the story of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man experiencing a midlife crisis, and his attempts to find happiness and meaning in his mundane existence.The film is notable for its strong performances, particularly by Kevin Spacey, who brings depth and complexity to the character of Lester. Annette Bening is equally compelling as his ambitious and emotionally distant wife, Carolyn. The supporting cast also delivers memorable performances, adding richness to the film's exploration of various themes.Visually, ""American Beauty"" is striking, with cinematography that enhances the film's mood and tone. The use of symbolism, especially the recurring motif of rose petals, adds a layer of poetic beauty to the narrative. The film's soundtrack, featuring an evocative score by Thomas Newman, complements the story perfectly.While the film's satirical take on suburban life and its critique of the American Dream are thought-provoking, some viewers might find its portrayal of certain characters and situations to be overly cynical or exaggerated. Despite this, ""American Beauty"" remains a compelling and visually stunning film that invites viewers to reflect on the complexities of life, identity, and the pursuit of happiness."
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Aug 14, 2001",10/10,"This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90's. ""American Beauty"" stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of ""American Beauty"" is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam, a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading, a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him, a daughter who practically hates herself, and is judged constantly as a looser. But all of a sudden, he sees his daughter's friend, Angela, and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes, the dreaded by most Americans, a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances. Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life, it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves ""the precious moments in his stupid little life."" You have no idea what he is talking about I'm sure, but don't worry, you will some day. Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100%.Annete Benning plays Carol Burnam, Lester's wife. She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale. Her image in life is ""in order to be successful, one most project an image of success at all times"". You can tell, she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company. Again, seems horrible, but it helps her in the end. Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film.The supporting cast: Thora Birtch who plays Janie, Lester and Carol's daughter, is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself. But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him, she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family. Mena Suvari plays Angela, Janie's best friend, Lester's crush, and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful. Some say that this was a very stupid scene, but I disagree. His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple. He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude. Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie. Chris Cooper plays Ricky's father, Col. Frank Fits. He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end. Chris also should've been nominated.The most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits, Ricky's mom, and Frank's wife. She was so beautiful and perfect. Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky, everything is so quite, and she says ""I'm sorry, what?"". Ricky says ""Mom, no one said anything"". When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation, Ricky says ""Mom, I'm leaving"". Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better, she knows this is best and says ""OK. Wear a raincoat"". Allison was just amazing and didn't get enough credit for her role.If there could have been nominations for every role in this movie, they were well deserved. This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult. It'll make you look again at your life and think. What a great movie.10/10"
The Woof,"Nov 5, 1999",10/10,"This movie was a joy to watch.  I didn't know what to expect when I came into it.  I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.Kevin Spacey plays this part to a ""T"".  He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed.  His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well.  I think they both should be nominated.The support cast is also spectacular.  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled ""Teenagers"" in the film. Of particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance, worthy of a supporting nomination as well.This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition.  When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter's at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated with her beauty.  Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change all aspects of his life.  He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and his libido.The music in this film is also very well chosen.  There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion.The plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go.  I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.See this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say, trash.This should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine.My Rating (1 - 10):  10"
uhmartinez-phd,"Nov 12, 2007",10/10,"The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place, perfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me of his character in ""The Ref"" and that could only be a good thing. Annette Bening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloid version of a ""Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf"" Which means very close to someone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star. He is amazing in ""American Beauty"" the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face up to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object of his attention and the film, I believe, is here to say."
bootsy-4,"Dec 14, 1999",10/10,"What can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster.  I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price.  Boy was I happy when I left.  Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times.  This film is virtually perfect.  The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes).  What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done.  In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography.  With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about.  In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc...  Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all.  Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that either film will out-shine American Beauty.  This film should easily win a substantial amount of the Oscars this year.  What's up with all the cirtics awards snubbing it so far?"
USFbobFL,"Oct 13, 2023",10/10,"This movie is so great because it's so relatable. I would rather watch this for the 10th time than watch most of the crap that Netflix is putting out there. Give me the Bravehearts and the Gladiators. I know I'm going to catch hell for not really reviewing American Beauty. This is more of a general praise for the great classics such as this one. Contrasting relationships. Couples that totally get each other and others that are completely clueless what the other really wants or needs. Cautionary tale about communication, or lack thereof. The character development in this film is amazing. And that's really what you want in a movie. You want to care about the least some of the characters."
filmbuff-05706,"Dec 18, 2023",10/10,"I first saw American Beauty when I was 17, about 8 years ago. It was interesting, but the plot was a bit creepy. But as time went on, I grew to appreciate the movie, and it's now one of my absolute favorite movies.American Beauty is about a 42-year-old man named Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey. He's in his mid-life crisis, and he hates his life. He hates his job, his realtor wife argues with him and they don't have sex (she even has an affair with another realtor), and his daughter Jane and him have a broken relationship.Lester does not like any aspect of his life, and says that choking the chicken (to be less crass) in the shower is the highlight of his day. But then he meets a friend of Jane's named Angela, a gorgeous 17-year-old who, he thinks, will be the key to his satisfaction.American Beauty has a clever way of showing desire- the color red. The Burnham's have a red door- their house is one of desire for happiness. Carolyn even cuts perfect roses in a covetness for happiness.When Lester lusts for Angela, we see rose petals surrounding her in his fantasies. When he has a chance with her near the end, we see roses near them. And when he sees what he truly desires, we see roses again. These are just a handful of examples for Lester.His wife Carolyn desires sex, but can't get it. At the dinner table, roses are in-between her and Lester, showing that she can't reach what she desires. But when she cheats on Lester, we then see them eat together with no roses on the table. Instead, Carolyn wears a shirt with a rose pattern. She got what she desired, while Lester has not- the roses are further away from him.These clever symbols kind of tell their own story, and enhance the one told plainly.As a Christian, and simply a person with morals, I remember how uncomfortable I was with the movie when I first saw it. Lust is a sin, how can I admire a movie that, while well-made, is about a married man lusting over a teenager?However, the more I watched it, the more I realized that this immorality makes it one of the most moral movies I have ever seen.You see, American Beauty is a story about the danger of dissatisfaction- with your marriage, with your job, with your life. That greed and dissatisfaction leads to downfall- to lust, to adultery, to greed, to immoral behavior, to selfishness.When we look to God or selflessness instead of material things to be happy, then life has more meaning, more meaning than ogling over teenagers or getting a new car or job. We learn this from Lester's actions, and it's not too late for us.American Beauty is a dark, unhappy movie. But it's a powerful and thought-provoking movie too, one that makes you think about it long after you watch it.The tagline of the movie is ""look closer."" When you do, American Beauty has an effective message to give- the danger of dissatisfaction."
kenjha,"Aug 11, 2006",6/10,"Much-praised film about a man facing mid-life crisis in suburbia, dreaming of playing Humbert Humbert to a Lolita that is his daughter's friend. There is only one word to describe this film: pretentious. Mendes thinks he is making the Great American Motion Picture but it is populated with cookie-cutter characters and it superficially touches on what the filmmakers regard as important themes. The acting is mediocre at best. Spacey gives the kind of performance that the Academy loves and awarded him with the Oscar but his acting here can be best described as mugging. Benning does not fare much better as his desperate wife."
elliesouthcombe,"Nov 10, 2023",10/10,"This movie is perfect in my opinion. There is so much to talk about, and so many layers of interpretation. A look into the 'perfect' American suburban life reveals that even if you have everything deemed perfect (marriage, children, a nice house, two incomes) you can never truly be happy. Everyone has a different interpretation of beauty and this is highlighted brilliantly in this film. The script is brilliant and the acting follows, amazing cinematography and the soundtrack is perfect. Everytime I watch this film I have a different idea pop into my head about the meaning of life, and you will too."
RM851222,"Jun 10, 2024",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""American Beauty"" (1999) is a great movie that i watched like 4 times in the last 25 years since it was released. This is a great movie that never gets old. Screenplay by Alan Boll was amazing - smart, darkly funny and involving. Directing job by Sem Mendes was top notch - the pacing of this movie is superb and it never drags in its almost 2 hours run time. Acting was outstanding by everyone involved - Kevin Spacey & Annette Bening were at the top of their game here.""American Beauty"" is about many things and it blends them together seemingly at the same time with this dark sense of humor. Its a very funny film but its not a comedy, its a dark film were sexuality and finding yourself i think plays a key role, but its not oversexualized. Every character here is two dimensional, and nothing is black & white or as it seems at first sight.Overall, ""American Beauty"" is a tragic story, comedy and great movie - all at the same time. Its amazingly acted, written and directed as surely is a true classic at this point that everyone should see at least once it their lifetime. Great movie."
d_penn,"Dec 24, 2023",10/10,"American Beauty is, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite movies. The cast is beyond incredible-Kevin Spacey appears to have a sketchy personal life, but this isn't about his real life-his acting in this movie is brilliant. His relatable, funny and intelligent style has you glued to the screen from start to end. Annette Bening is superb; I can see no one else playing this role; she's simply fantastic; everyone else was spectacular as well-from the entire neighboring family to Mena Suvari, all did an outstanding job both independently and as a team. The plot line and twists were just genius; it's so real and bittersweet at the same time. This movie is one I constantly bring up to new friends and acquaintances and although it premiered almost 2 decades ago, it has left a lasting impression. If you haven't already, and you're looking to be thoroughly entertained, watch American Beauty. I can't say enough good things about it. It is truly one of a kind."
laurinarmenta,"Sep 9, 2023",10/10,"Although a 10/10 might seem a bit over the top, this movie really deserves it, every single detail and aspect of this movie is pretty much perfect. The visuals combined with the sound design and music make this movie truly worth watching. The acting is believable and realistic and among the best ever. The message this movie delivers about how we all see beauty differently is really well delivered. A great thing about this movie is how it keeps on tricking you into thinking that you know how this movie is going to end, but you truly don't until you've actually finished the movie. Unpredictable and truly amazing movie."
gsh999,"Apr 19, 2022",10/10,"Greed and hate has destroyed the fabric of society in the USA and this film depicts a broken family that could be millions of families in suburban USA. I often think acting doesn't take much skill but movies like American Beauty help me appreciate truly fine acting. The film shows how one man finds redemption by breaking out of the cage his life had become. Despite a tragedy, the film ends on a positive note with the narration of the central character. One of my top 5 favorite movies. Congratulations to everyone who took part in the making of this movie."
UniqueParticle,"Oct 21, 2019",10/10,"Makes me smile at so many scenes, well deserving of the 5 Oscars! The writing and emotions are exquisitely powerful yet somber. I absolutely love Kevin Spacey despite his personal life troubles and Annette Benning blows me out of the water every time. I'm delighted to own such a piece of art on Blu-Ray; American Beauty has been among my top favorites for a very long time I'd say number 8. The Soundtrack is one of the greatest things ever, to me this film is like a perfect tapestry after using the paint brush and Sam Mendes created it so well! Hope my thoughts aren't to over the top I just very much enjoy this movie!"
jacobwspringer,"May 17, 2019",6/10,This should not be in the top 100 movies of all time. The acting is good but it's not even Kevin Spacey's best. The plot is often forced and many characters are left undeveloped. The dialogue is so-so. Anyone that calls this a 10 or the best movie of all time is likely pretentious or dumb. Perhaps they want to be deep but just don't actually know what is or isn't deep. Also the score is downright terrible.
bobsgrock,"Jan 31, 2008",10/10,"This is a masterpiece, perfect in every way. It has completely changed the way I view films and the way I look at life. The acting is excellent, especially with Spacey and Bening. The directing by Mendes is one of the best I have ever seen in a film. The cinematography is so beautiful with the strong contrast between the red and other colors. Aside from being visually beautiful, the story itself is this film's best feature. It is original, with hints of humor, noir, drama, and sadness. Overall, it is thought-provoking in a way very few films are. It is hard to watch what these characters are doing because we know that they are only leading themselves to their own demise. Ball's screenplay is one that should be required reading in film schools and the final sequence is perhaps the most beautiful thing ever filmed. It is a stunning achievement, deserving of every award it got. It is, in my opinion, one of the 10 best films I have ever seen and the best film of the 1990s after Schindler's List. It is so real, so poignant, so heartbreaking. Powerful and serene, this is why I love movies. They can change your thinking."
dbim00123,"Oct 15, 2024",10/10,"I'd seen this for the first time shortly after its release. I was quite pleasantly shocked on revisiting it today some 20 years later that it's fired off a few more synapses this time around.Its seemingly intimate comprehension of humanity's psycho-social condition was easily on display throughout the entire film. And, equal in vision for each viewing, here and then, that its simple production never detracted from the story. Only in my initial viewing reaction did this feature create a some what formulaic value to it.Time on me, no doubt played a big part in my seeing and enjoying it's nuanced features in a new light. Nonetheless, the timeless nature of this film seems relevant still. Ranked among the giants!"
dashwilson-40000,"Oct 12, 2023",10/10,"Please don't listen to anyone who tries to discredit this film because of Kevin Spacey. He is an actor and American Beauty is a perfect example of his brilliance at the craft.Now to the film. I remember watching this in 1999 when I was 16 years old and it left a mark few films ever have. It had depth and nuance and is about everything and nothing all at the same time.The screenplay, direction, acting, cinematography and music are to me, perfect (it won 5 Oscar's for a reason). This film gets under under your skin because it's a remind of what it is to be human, to be lost, to be seen, to be heard. And to be real. Utterly sublime.Look closer."
snoducky,"Feb 10, 2024",10/10,"Speechless.This film is perfect from start to finish. This film has a certain balance between reality and imagination that just makes it feel so genuine and authentic which is rare to find nowadays. The actors in the film are so talented and they make the film feel like someones reality, the acting is so natural almost like your part of their story, their world. The movie conveys how murky and unclear our lives have become, how we've drowned ourselves is societal norms, the idea of blending in and success which slowly makes us numb and unaware of the beauty around us hence the quote ""There is so much beauty around us"". It reveals that humanity has evolved to think that life is so complicated and has so many various elements to it, but in reality life is simple, we don't need all the things we have, we don't need to strive to be normal, we don't need to follow the crowd it just goes to show how all these unnecessary factors of what we think is life is severely blinding us to beauty. It shows how much of life we take for granted and it foreshadows how one can only truly understand and believe in what I just said after a life time of living in a controlled, confined and trapped illusion that we call reality. Overall an eye opening film."
brandonpartin,"Jan 25, 2024",9/10,"I remember when I was really young and always seen the cover of this movie at Blockbuster.Of course, looking at the cover I would be way too young to watch it, but it always intrigued me.Being an adult now, I think it's a film that I would be able to resonate with now.This was my first time watching this film and I think despite it being a product of its time coming out at the turn of the millennium in 1999.In my opinion, its themes and topics remain relevant, uncovering the dark underbelly of American life and how families on the surface try to put on a perfect facade to their lives.The cast were all perfect in my opinion, they all felt like believable and dysfunctional families. Out of the whole cast Annette Bening really stood out.Multiple scenes were stunning to watch especially with the rose petals covering the ceiling with the character Angela.The symbolism of the color red showing up in multiple frames, over all it was beautifully shot and told a compelling story."
toh786,"Dec 3, 2018",9/10,"I just decided to watch this old movie for the first time, since I heard it was a classic. This is one of the few movies where I had water in my eyes. The story was very powerful, the drama was powerful, everything was powerful. ""There's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it."" I do not this see anything wrong with it, it was a simply a great movie to watch. Highly recommend it."
Atle_O,"May 26, 2024",9/10,"American Beauty (1999) is a deeply engaging film, Directed by Sam Mendes. The movie offers a captivating look at the complexities of suburban life. The story centers on Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, who is going through a midlife crisis. His journey towards self-discovery and rebellion against societal norms is both thought-provoking and entertaining.The film excels in its strong performances, particularly by Kevin Spacey, who brings a compelling mix of humor and sadness to his character. Annette Bening, as his wife Carolyn, also delivers a powerful performance that highlights the strains in their marriage. Their interactions are a key part of what makes the film so memorable.What makes American Beauty stand out is its brilliant critique of middle-class values. It manages to blend humor with serious themes, making the audience reflect on their own lives. The movie's visual style, with its stunning cinematography, adds an extra layer of depth to the story.Moreover, the film is filled with poignant and thought-provoking scenes that stay with you long after watching. The characters are well-developed, each adding to the overall narrative and emotional impact of the movie. The screenplay, filled with sharp dialogues and meaningful moments, is another strong point.In conclusion, American Beauty is a film that offers a unique and powerful look at the human condition. Its mix of excellent acting, compelling story, and beautiful cinematography makes it a standout film that earns a well-deserved 9/10."
syjeme,"Jun 25, 2024",8/10,"American Beauty is a scathing critique of American suburbia and the pursuit of the American dream. The film follows the life of Lester Burnham, a suburbanite who becomes disillusioned with his mundane existence and embarks on a journey of self-discovery. With its nuanced characters, thought-provoking dialogue, and stunning cinematography, the film is a powerful examination of the darker side of middle-class American life.Kevin Spacey's acting in this movie is undeniably amazing, but all other major actors are also doing their best in terms of showcasing impressive acting skills. Coupled with great dialogues and writing, this movie shines bright as a very good character drama."
ohlabtechguy,"Feb 18, 2019",6/10,"Here we have yet another highly polished Hollywood flick that seeks to derive entertainment value by depicting two suburban families loaded with mental illness and/or behavioral disorders. Yet, the subject of mental disorders is not addressed and therefore, no meaningful message is given. Instead, the mainstream audience, not fully aware of signs of mental illness, are led to believe that characters with all the signs of mental disorder, are merely quirky, eccentric and at worst dysfunctional. Not a movie I would recommend and no meaningful message given. Hollywood just doesn't get it."
Pulpthatsfiction,"Nov 12, 2007",10/10,"The first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie and about a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about and then say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like this movie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performances are one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The directing by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar. Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and there's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out( Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was the first movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and over so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This movie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank number 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was the only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven Spacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey brings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great character. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the Oscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much, also did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and should have more notice. Sam Mendes does a great directing job and is one the best film debut ever. This film was one the best ever made and should be seen by everyone hows looking for great movie or how just want have fun watching a movie."
moranfields,"Feb 24, 2024",10/10,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie."
Gymnopedies,"Feb 26, 2024",9/10,"American Beauty is a deeply penetrating and thought-provoking film. It is truly a top notch drama, effectively a dark satire about suburbia the fallacies of chasing The American Dream. American Beauty would explore such themes as loneliness, conformity, depression, redemption and repression. Lester Burnham, (Kevin Spacey) is an articulate depressed suburban father in a mid-life crisis. It is abundantly clear that Lester is a prisoner of his own life. Whilst every character is in their own prison of loneliness, they are incredibly self-aware of their predicament, for example, Ricky Fitts (played superbly by Wes Bentley) who obsessively captures the most mundane things using his video camera to help him remember the beauty. His character, greatly affected me, I found myself taken aback by how insightful and profound Ricky Fitts was. I mean, how does a teenager become so wise? What events in his life have unfolded to give him such an outlook on life? You can almost see the visceral pain in Ricky's eyes and also his voice. There were many thought-provoking scenes which really affected and resonated with me - to the point where my view of the world has certainly been altered. The unforgettable bag scene - this dancing plastic bag teaches us all a lesson, to appreciate the simple beauty that is all around us:""It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it. Right? And this bag was just dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid, ever. Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... I need to remember... Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it, and my heart is just going to cave in.""Thomas Newman's minimalist score for the film is moody, reflective and extremely moving. The cast was superb, Kevin Spacey thoroughly deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor, his performance was so charismatic. The supporting cast of Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari was nothing short of magnificent. At the Academy Awards of that year, American Beauty won five Oscars, including for Best Picture, along with Best Director for Sam Mendes, Best Actor for Kevin Spacey, Best Original Screenplay for Alan Ball, and Best Cinematography for Conrad L. Hall. This is a film that has stayed with me and gave me a newfound appreciation to Look Closer!"
decastrojehnjehn,"Jun 19, 2023",9/10,"The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.What I love about American Beauty is not only the complex characters, but also the stylish filming, haunting score, side-splitting scenarios, the intelligent and darkly funny screenplay and the assured direction from Sam Mendes. Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable, especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari give wonderful support too. Quintessentially, American Beauty is just a wonderful, funny and brilliantly performed and directed film."
Prismark10,"Nov 21, 2013",7/10,"This debut film from Sam Mendes won the Best Picture Oscar.A quasi comedy-drama about middle America, Kevin Spacey stars plays Lester Burnham, who has a mid-life crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari).Annette Bening is his materialistic wife, who has fallen out of love with him and is having an affair. Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter who at first plays second fiddle with the more beautiful and forward Angela, but later finds solace with their new neighbour played by Wes Bentley.At first she finds Wes strange as he keeps trying to photograph her. Chris Cooper is his militaristic father who is a stern disciplinarian but seems to have deep personal issues of his own.When I saw American Beauty upon its release I did not think much of it and I note its reputation seems to have declined over the years.Like a lot of Best Oscar picture winners in recent years, some people think it was undeserving of the top prize.Strangely, after re-watching this film after a number of years I have revised my rating upwards. Maybe it is because I am now older along with now older children. I viewed this film differently and interpreted the story with differing nuances.Spacey is probably in a rare role where he is likable. He realises that his life is in a mess, besotted by a nubile college girl, trapped in a loveless marriage and lost his job.However he is trying to improve himself, working out and staying optimistic but fate has a different story for him.The themes in this film will vary at different points in your life. If you are middle aged with teenage children it might even be unnerving."
jomayevans,"Jan 22, 2024",8/10,"I was 18 when this came our & everyone thought it was a masterpiece. I have to say its still a great watch. Kevin Spacey was great as Lester a man wanting live life again. Now I'm older I really wish I had his drive. When younger people woukd say its about a middle age man having his midlife crisis, but I don't see that now, I see it as him bringing life back into himself. His funniest seen for me has to be him bumping into his wife at the fastfood restaurant. Such a great scene.. Mina surprised plays tge Teenage model wanting to be Worldwide known, who brings life back to Lester with her youth and beauty. She Really was a knock out love her with blonde hair, tbh the girl over a decade later in AHS still looked just as young.. both thora birch and wes Bentley do well with their chemistry if too inverted coming together and her mum Caroline is defo who I've turned into with age just not as successful. The film has a lovely music score and presents you with the smallest familiar images and cinematography from a more beautiful time for me. With occasional meaningful narration. This is nothing action packed but could make for a ok Comfort movie, bar a little sadness to it. But enough dry humour to conteract."
august_sanders,"Feb 21, 2025",7/10,"Kevin has always done a great job playing the villain in movies like Usual Suspects and Se7en and that doesn't change here. Although I wouldn't quite call him a villain in this movie, the way he acts is disturbing. Its more of a creepy air to that he gives to the main character as the movie progresses that just hits the nail on the head.Once again this movie is distressing and overly sexual for my liking but I understand the reasoning behind it so I don't care that much.The plot is good and shows how abandoned and alone people can feel. It also highlights how people change quickly in certain situations. But it did feel a little haphazard with all the different subplots it was trying to juggleGreat movie that used the R rating well. (Definitely not for kids under 16)"
Bored_Dragon,"Jun 22, 2021",10/10,"""My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood; this is my street; this is my life. I am 42 years old; in less than a year I will be dead. Of course, I don't know that yet, and in a way, I am dead already.""""American Beauty"" is placed in an indefinite suburb somewhere in America (there are indications that it is Chicago), where a seemingly harmonious and quite ordinary family is going through the turbulence caused by the middle age crisis of both parents, as well as the puberty of their teenage daughter.A patriarchal family, ruled by a conservative father, a military man, moves next door to them. While the daughter of our antihero Lester starts a relationship with the neighbor's weird son, and his wife has an affair at work, he, not so secretly, obsessively falls for his daughter's girlfriend.This black humor drama is only seemingly extreme and eccentric, while in fact, it shows quite realistically what many of us go through at various moments in our lives. Admittedly, most only in their heads, and those who dare to take drastic steps usually hide it better. But the fact that most of us would never admit such thoughts and actions does not prevent, but perhaps only makes it easier for us to better connect with the characters and feel their drama more deeply.A strong, well-written story needs actors capable of bringing it to life before our eyes. ""American Beauty"" did not fail in that field either. The excellent character study on paper makes the job much easier, but you can always rely on Kevin Spacey for a really impressive role. A man who somehow manages to be at the same time a nerd and a macho, slimy and sexy, a villain and a victim. Sexual and emotional frustration and the middle age crisis are by no means an excuse for Lester's actions, and yet, Spacey awakens sympathy and compassion in the viewer, rather than repulsion and disgust.Annette Bening skillfully keeps pace with Spacey in the role of a frustrated woman, trapped in a long-extinguished marriage. A woman who, with the last twitches of common sense, tries to balance between a family in disarray and a career that she can never raise to a level that would satisfy her.There is also Thora Birch, an unpopular teen, escaping from the collapse of her family home in a relationship with the eccentric Wes Bentley, as well as the insecure Mena Suvari, who is hiding under the mask of a confident and popular cheerleader. Her transformation from ""Lolita"" that seduces Lester to one of the most impressive scenes in the film, where she is half-naked, trembling under Spacey, does not deserve to remain unmentioned. Although her character is secondary to the others I mentioned and only serves as a support for Spacey's, Mena's performance is unfairly underrated. And last but not least, Chris Cooper who convincingly played a homophobic colonel and stole every scene in which he appears.For me, the two most striking things in this film are the use of red and the unusual disturbing sounds that accompany Lester's fantasies, in contrast to the mainstream rock music that fills the rest of the movie. And of course, the ending is a bit over-the-top, but it perfectly rounds off the story and adds to its strength.The film won five Oscars for best picture, directing, screenplay, cinematography, and Spacey's performance, and was also nominated for editing, music, and leading female role. Each well deserved.10/10."
The-Last-Prydonian,"Jul 11, 2024",9/10,"Lester Burnham is a middle-aged husband and father of a neurotic and shallow wife and a typically sullen teenage daughter. Employed in a well-paying job he lives out a dull, miserable existence in his middle-class neighborhood. Finally being pushed to breaking point, and grown jaded with the banality and unjust office politics of his job, he quits and takes to smoking pot and finding new employment in a fast food restaurant. Embracing what it was once like to be a carefree teenager in what appears to be the ultimate mid-life crisis, in this cynical and tragic examination of the artificiality of the ""American Dream"".Having cut his teeth as a theater director, before moving to the movie screen, American Beauty marked Sam Mendes's debut feature which would earn him not only critical acclaim but a win for Best Director, as earning a further gong for Best Picture. Written by Alan Ball, both he and Mendes created this dark satire on suburban cultures with added themes of forgiveness and redemption. Casting Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, a forty-something who from the afterlife narrates in voice-over about his life before fate took it from him. A suburbanite advertising executive as well as a husband and father trapped within the confines of his unhappy marriage. Suffering a midlife crisis, and bored with the monotony of his everyday existence, he butts heads with his self-centered, neurotic, materialistic wife Carolyn (Annette Bening on brilliant form) as well as his smarmy supervisor Brad, who he eventually blackmails due to his complicity in covering up the managing director using company funds to pay for a prostitute. Leading him to quit his job, and leading him on an odyssey of essentially attempting to reclaim the youth he once had. Much to the chagrin of Carolyn as well as his a-typically sullen daughter, who is eternally embarrassed and resentful of her parent's spats and dysfunctional behavior.Lester's home-life with his family is beautifully paralleled although contrastingly so, with his new neighbour, retired Marine Colonel, Frank Fitts, a strict and abusive disciplinarian homophobic conservative who lives with his near-catatonic wife and his more liberal, wayward son Ricky (Wes Bentley). Who records brief, random moments of the world around him on his camera, which he calls capturing the simple beauty that exists within it.Mendes and Ball depict a portrait of contemporary Americana at the turn of the millennium. Where, as with Joel Schumacher's Falling Down a man attempts to come to terms with the pressures, inequities, and injustices of modern society. While also capturing the social division in the social hemisphere. Although both undertake very different means in their quest to do so. Not least when Lester develops an unhealthy infatuation with her cheerleader best friend Angela (Mena Suavari giving a splendidly precocious turn).Equally poignant as it i sharp and funny, it is anchored by Spacey who delivers what is most probably a career-best performance, and I say this as someone who rates him as an underrated actor. However the role of Lester just somehow seems to have called to him. Undeserving of the Oscar he received, he did at least warrant a nomination. His trademark sarcasm sets him in good stead here as is his acerbic cyncicism as he becomes more empowered and emboldened as the movie's story progresses. Striking a blow for the everyday working stiff in one of the movie's relatively earlier scenes when he faces off against Brad. He's supported by an accomplished cast of Hollywood talent and some splendid storytelling, with both Birch and Bentley's scenes together as two lonely, lost souls who manage to find some solace together of palpable resonance.Needless to say, it has to be said is a powerful satirical drama that, delves into the apathy that can come with mid-life, suburban life, and the struggles therein and will stay with you long after the credits have ended."
Giugi1101,"Jul 7, 2025",10/10,"I already knew American Beauty was a great film, but I didn't expect to love it this much. It's absolutely stunning - a masterpiece that pulls you in emotionally, making you deeply care for some characters while absolutely despising others. The plot twists are brilliant, timed perfectly, and the finale is breathtaking. Even though, the movie tells you from the start how it ends, it still manages to surprise you in the most powerful way. It's that rare kind of film that feels complete, clever, and emotionally raw all at once. I can't believe I waited this long to watch it. A true cinematic gem."
Zeyders,"Apr 29, 2025",8/10,"I was hesitant to give it an 8 out of 10, but this film has something going for it. I won't say it's a perfect film, there are things here that could have been done better, but it interestingly shows something that is rarely seen in principle in the way it is shown.There are a lot of different positives here. The play of actors that you believe, the music that seems unusually interesting and old pleasant as they did in their time, the plot showing different moments revealing different themes, and the direction with the production itself.But I don't like the drawn out certain provocative scenes. They may exist, but not for as long as they do now. It could have been shown quickly, it seems to me, and not focused on it so much. The character's reaction to the situation at the end of the film, to me, seemed odd and unrealistic. Overall, the whole film feels a little weird.The film, in a way, perfectly conveyed the end of postmodernism and the mood, the problems of 21st century society. The film is a little strange, but it has its own thing that a lot of people love it for."
thomasgouldsbrough,"Mar 14, 2022",10/10,"This film, alongside Fight Club, marks the best film of 1999. It's deep, complex and enchanting. The film explores themes such as the definition of beauty, the dangers of obsession, or the delusion in denying who you are, amongst many other themes. At the same time, it's just an excellent film, with a brilliant story that can be watched without trying to analyse it.Kevin Spacey's character is very well written. His life has turned docile and he no longer has anything to live for. In a situation like this, it makes perfect sense for him to be obsessed with a girl. It's not particularly the girl that matters, it's finding something to live for in a life that has nothing to offer him anymore. Anyone who has ever obsessed over someone can properly connect with this film. You build up an idea of them in your head, only for that idea to erode away slowly, until you're faced with the ugly reality of who they really are.It's possibly to go on and on about the complexities of each character. The only criticism of the film one could argue, is that apart from Kevin Spacey's character, none of them are particularly likeable. However this could be argued that it was deliberately written this way as stereotypes of modern America. Regardless, this film is a masterpiece, and the ending is very impactful."
Doylenf,"Mar 17, 2001",N/A,"Enough pro and con comments have been written about this so-called Oscar-winning ""masterpiece"" for me to make this review a brief one--but to the point. 'American Beauty' took up too much time to tell a relatively uncomplicated story of mid-life crisis involving several severely disfunctional personalities. If it gives you pleasure to watch Kevin Spacey be little more than sarcastic for two hours or to watch a shallow youth show you a plastic bag pushed about by the wind as a sample of beauty in little things, then this movie is for you. The only genuinely moving and original character in the movie is not Spacey--it's Chris Cooper as the homophobic neighbor who suspects his son is having an affair--with tragic results. His performance in the climactic garage scene is stunning. The symbolism of the rose petals was overplayed and much too simplistic. As was the lengthy shot of the floating plastic bag which so many viewers found deep meaning in--but struck me as arty, pretentious and boring. With a rambling and vulgar script, this emerged as no more than a sad commentary on the complete collapse of American culture. All of the characters are not only weird but unlikeable. For me, this was an ordeal to sit through--the only jolt I got was from the ending (which took too long to get to)-- and then, mercifully, I was able to take the cassette out, certain that I would never want to view the movie again, despite the fact that it won a Best Film Oscar.  As someone once said, ""the mirror of life should be tilted upwards"" more often to make films more inspirational. The gutter is not a pleasant place to spend two hours of your life--look for true beauty elsewhere. A big thumbs down on this one."
kkordon,"Jan 19, 2022",7/10,"Not a bad movie. But, as they wrote in the magazines, it is very overrated. Nevertheless, the feeling after it is strange-pleasant. Interesting concept of the picture. So many fates! Unfortunately, not everyone is happy. The screenwriter did a good job. A new vision of beauty, revealed not even in the well-known beauty / ugly story, but in a small bag, silently circling along with a bunch of leaves. At that moment, such an unshakable harmony was felt that I really wanted to think about the beauty of our life with you. Of all the heroes, I would single out, perhaps, Ricky. As odd as he may be, and perhaps not exactly a good person, his view of the world is truly amazing. What is the meaning of our life? After looking at the picture, we will hear from Kevin Spacey, no matter how unsuccessful, stupid and insignificant life would be, we must see the beauty in it. Then we will be happy. - which."
Heibbi,"Jun 13, 2025",10/10,"What an absolut phenomal masterpiece. The story fits the end-90s themes of rethinking your life / is your life worth spending in an cubical / is life still life if you're spending it unhappy / try to find beauty in the small things but also scratches themes that are more in the modern zeitgeist like masculin urges and the fragility of the male ego, especially when it comes to homosexuality.And the performances.. what can i say - in my opinion more people should've been nominated for an oscar (i know thats not possible, but besides Spacey and Bening i think the acting of Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper and Mena Suvari was criminally underrated. Even the actress who playes Ms. Fitts does an unbelievable job."
mehdiblcn-09740,"Jun 26, 2018",5/10,"1999 was the year of cinema in the US of A. I don't think I have ever had seen as many movies in terms of quantity, but also in terms of quality. It was the year of the Green Mile which I still don't like, but many cinephiles would argue otherwise. It's also the year of ""The Sixth Sense"" the outsider that year and the popular choice.
In that year, the Academy chose American Beauty. They should have picked M Night Shyamalan's movie instead.
Don't get me wrong, I love American Beauty, and still think it's a masterpiece, but I don't like the message it conveys and the agenda it tries so hard to push. 
The performances are all top notch. Whether you like him or not amidst the Me Too movement and its ramifications, he delivered what some still argue as the performance of his career. Again, the cast is top notch and my favorite character is Jane, beautifully played by a young Thora Birch. 
The movie tackles issues that are actually non issues if that makes sense. Living in the suburbs can be seen as the epitome of happiness. Not in American Beauty, where the characters are so bored they're looking for things that make them happy, only to end up completely disappointed. I'm not gonna spoil the movie for those who are yet to enjoy it, but for me, the movie is not really worth watching anymore, expect for the performances."
Marwan-Bob,"Apr 3, 2023",10/10,"""American Beauty"" is a masterful exploration of the complexities of modern American life, directed by Sam Mendes and released in 1999. The film presents a provocative, multi-layered narrative that delves into the psychological and emotional lives of its characters, examining their struggles with identity, sexuality, and the pursuit of happiness.At the center of the film is Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man played by Kevin Spacey, who has become disillusioned with his life and decides to shake things up by rebelling against his mundane job, unhappy marriage, and unfulfilling suburban lifestyle. Spacey's portrayal of Lester is a tour de force performance, bringing to life the character's sarcastic wit, seething anger, and poignant vulnerability.Annette Bening delivers a nuanced and powerful performance as Carolyn Burnham, Lester's wife, who is struggling to maintain control over her family, career, and personal life. Thora Birch is outstanding as the couple's teenage daughter, Jane, who is grappling with her own insecurities and frustrations. And Wes Bentley shines as Ricky Fitts, a mysterious and troubled teenager who becomes involved with the Burnham family and unlocks a world of beauty and truth that they had previously ignored.The film's themes are deep and multi-layered, touching on issues such as the pursuit of happiness, the emptiness of the American Dream, and the complexities of human relationships. The script, written by Alan Ball, is a marvel of narrative economy, weaving together multiple storylines and characters in a seamless and engaging way.Mendes' direction is exceptional, using visual metaphors and symbolism to heighten the film's emotional impact. The cinematography by Conrad L. Hall is stunning, capturing the beauty and banality of suburban life with equal grace and precision.In conclusion, ""American Beauty"" is a cinematic masterpiece that is as relevant and thought-provoking today as it was when it was released over two decades ago. With its complex characters, rich themes, and stunning performances, the film is a must-see for anyone who appreciates powerful, provocative cinema."
poproxopera,"Apr 16, 2021",9/10,"This movie is honestly a true work of art. I fully recommend turning off your phone and just draw full focus to this film for 2 hrs and 2 mins. What's truly intriguing as well as significant to comprehend as the storyline progresses, is the relationship the protagonist has and develops with each of the other characters. The ending really puts everything in perspective if you remembered all the key details of the variety of things that go on throughout. Oscar well deserved."
fredrikgunerius,"Aug 18, 2023",10/10,"When a film is able to combine taking itself seriously with attaining an ironic distance from its subject matter, when it manages to be both dramatically valid and powerful as well as humorous, then it may be on course for greatness. American Beauty is that kind of film.The starting point for screenwriter Alan Ball is a dissection of modern suburban life, a philosophical look at themes that have been frequently discussed in film in recent years: the meaning of life, integrity, truthfulness, midlife crises, and - of course - lust. A mushy dabble around these themes often results in a trivial movie, but in American Beauty it is all handled elegantly, and the film is anything but trivial. As directed by first-timer Sam Mendes, this is a character study with such remarkable rhythm and precision that it attains an almost poetic quality. And that's not because of the most obvious segments, such as the plastic bag shot, but rather how the film brings our deepest secrets to the forefront before rendering them harmless. Yes, we may lust for our teenage daughters' friends. Yes, we may be closet homosexuals acting as homophobes. And yes, we may be desperately hung up on keeping up appearances. But know this: It doesn't matter, because everybody does.Just like Forrest Gump five years ago, American Beauty is both an homage to and a satire of everything arch-American. The result is simple entertainment with artistic depth. Mendes' aforementioned direction is arguably the film's greatest asset. As far as directorial debuts go, this is up there along with the very best in movie history. It's hard to imagine Mendes being anything other than a unique talent.Still, the be-all and end-all for a dramatic comedy is its characters and our ability to see ourselves in them. In American Beauty, there's not only a wide array of them, but we're also absolutely spoiled with brilliant performances. Kevin Spacey has had a great decade, from his mini-breakthrough in Glengarry Glen Ross in 1992 to his commercial breakthrough in films such as Seven and The Usual Suspects. Here, he finally gets his big break as a leading man, a responsibility a lot of people ostensibly doubted he could carry. The fact is, however, that Spacey rises to the occasion. He's also the kind of actor who looks better middle-aged than he did as a young adult, meaning that we'll probably see a lot more of this guy in the coming years.Spacey is surrounded by pleasant and impressive supporting performances. Annette Bening (the gal who crushed a lot of women's hopes when she married Hollywood's most eligible bachelor, Warren Beatty, in 1992) delivers a wonderfully manic part, while the trio of kids - Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari - all give very credible performances. Birch, a former child actress who was great opposite Elijah Wood in Paradise, has an exciting future ahead of her. Most impressive, however, is John Sayles regular Chris Cooper, who delves deep and strips down bare in a challenging part.American Beauty may well become a modern classic. It is simple in its own quirky way, but it's exactly this simplicity that makes it so universal and timeless, transforming its concise observations on life into a pensive and poignant tragedy of classic proportions."
chrisklugh,"Mar 22, 2023",9/10,"The first time I watched this movie, I must have been about 15. I must admit I probably did not quite understand its popularity. It was probably the boobies.Fast forward about a decade later, in my mid 20's, I start to see what this movie is. Yet, I still don't understand it. I suppose I did not relate to any of the characters. Still a good movie, but not quite sure why its as good as many say.Decade later. I'm 37. Now I get it. One of those movies you need some life experience to understand.Break it apart, and you have every character with their own story. Their own messed up needs. Messed up lives. Given the setting is that classic white fence neighborhood where everything is perfect, you get to see what those neighborhoods are full of. Broken and artificial people. People trying to be who they are not. People who don't know who they are. But this is the dream. Yet its not working for nobody. And this was BEFORE the internet and Social Media...If you have not seen this movie, your probably young. Mostly everyone alive back then surly has seen it. If its been a long time, please watch it again, as I'm sure your older self will get more out of it then it did back then. As for you younger people, I'm not sure what you'd get out of this. This is probably just another day of your troubled little life."
Benedict_Cumberbatch,"Nov 27, 2007",N/A,"Okay, so I don't think there's much left to be said about this masterpiece. ""American Beauty"" is one of those rare instant classics, a landmark of the 90's and one of the best debut features ever (which is both a blessing and a curse for a director - let's hope Sam Mendes doesn't end up like Orson Welles).This bittersweet tale of ordinary suburban lives about an average husband (Kevin Spacey), his ambitious wife (Annette Bening), their unhappy only child (Thora Birch), the weirdo next door (Wes Bentley), his severe father (Chris Cooper), his catatonic mother (Allison Janney) and a certain blonde cheerleader (Mena Suvari), reaches a heavenly level of authenticity and poignancy thanks to a witty, pitch-perfect script (by Alan Ball, who would later create the brilliant TV series ""Six Feet Under""), a wonderful cast (Spacey and Cooper, especially), Mendes's sensible directing, Conrad L. Hall's beautiful cinematography and Thomas Newman's unforgettable score (which has been copied ad nauseam since then, by the way).""American Beauty"" is as thought-provoking and sad as it is, in a weird way, uplifting. To realize the mediocrity in your life; to try to change it or let it be, that's the question. Whichever's your choice, there'll be a high price to pay; thus, no one's a complete hero or villain in this story. Lack of communication, character flaws and hypocrisy all add up to what happens to these people; we feel bad for them, despise them, and root for them, for they all ring so true. That's because they're real, and great writers like Ball have a special talent to expose the good, the bad and the ugly in human nature.My only ""problem"" with this film is that it came out in 1999 (one of the greatest years for films, ever), just like my all-time favourite, ""Magnolia"", which was almost completely snubbed by the Academy (which gave ""American Beauty"" 5 Oscars, including Best Picture and Director). Naturally, I'd have liked ""Magnolia"" to win, but AB is a more than acceptable replacement since the Academy actually awarded a great film that year. ""American Beauty"", even without being the best film of its year, still manages to be a masterpiece.""It's just a couch!"", Lester (Spacey) yells in one scene. ""This isn't life, it's just stuff. And it's become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that's just nuts"".And isn't he right?...look closer. 10/10."
yasinhussain-14721,"Aug 23, 2023",10/10,"Winner of 5 Oscars, including Best Picture, American Beauty (1999) is a romance drama starring Kevin Spacey (as Lester Burnham) which tells the story of three simultaneous relationships and their impact on one another: A sexually frustrated father's infatuation with his daughter's best friend, said daughter's peculiar attraction to the strange yet curious new boy next door, and Lester's stern, industrious wife's amorous affair with her business arch rival.Woah. A film like this has no business being *this* good. I never thought I'd be saying a romance drama is now one of my favourite movies of all-time, yet here we are. And I truly mean it by the way, for those of you reading this on Letterboxd, I am seriously pondering putting this in my top 4, which I also didn't think I'd say for a very long time. Whilst I'm likely going to come to the conclusion to keep my top 4 as it is, this is still definitely in my top 10 at least.But now onto why I'm rating this so highly. The main reason is none other than the story. A wholeheartedly deserved Oscar for Alan Ball, the writer, speaks volumes to just how astonishing the writing is. How he was able to transform a romance plot into a script which explores themes such as perversion, homophobia, drugs, suburban dysfunction, and most of all family, is simply awe-inspiring.I'm still in shock at how spectacular this picture was, I haven't seen a film this extraordinary in a while. Funny thing is, for the first two acts, I was sat there wondering how on earth this got such stellar reviews! Don't get me wrong it was still pretty damn great during those acts, but I didn't think it was worthy of the critical acclaim that it so received just yet. But Act 3, oh my word. It was that sensational that I watched it back about half an hour later! I just couldn't stop thinking about it. So many unexpected moments, moments that even made me stand up in shock, that made it all the more enthralling. The story advances so peculiarly, in ways which at first you think make no sense at all, then you soon realise they make perfect sense. If that doesn't scream masterpiece I don't know what will. And I adored the cinematography too. There were some very powerful & dramatic scenes which the cinematography accompanied very well, and it helped to strengthen the impact of those striking, and sometimes even dark, segments of the feature.Certain members of the cast were outstanding. Recipient of the Best Actor Oscar, Kevin Spacey, was an excellent lead. Initially it seemed like he didn't suit the role but once I got into the movie I could see that he was actually a phenomenal choice. He presents his character arc so well as he highlights both Lester's overwhelming determination to woo the girl of his literal dreams and his slovenly insouciance to the responsibilities of the working world. I have to admit it baffled me at first to see Annette Bening (as Carolyn Burnham) nominated for Best Actress, but in hindsight as I look back as her performance, I get it. In the aforementioned dramatic scenes, she was one of the prominent figures who, as a result of contrasting with Spacey's character, had a staggering presence, and those scenes would not be the same if it wasn't for her and Spacey so she deserves her plaudits. I would also like to praise Chris Cooper (as Colonel Frank Fitts) who was undeniably phenomenal, to the point where I find it impossible to believe that this role could've been played any better by anybody else. Having seen him in a similar role in the film October Sky of the same year, it doesn't surprise me that he absolutely smashed his performance out the park here. From a certain point within the movie, he creates a sense of fear within you everytime you see him on screen, and whilst that's partially aided by the fairly erratic behaviour of his character, it is primarily thanks to Cooper's faultless acting. Nothing short of remarkable. And I also appreciated the acting of Wes Bentley (as Ricky Fitts) as in contrast to his father's turbulent nature, he was rather obedient and stolid, and it is this contrast which allows you to see Bentley's highly admirable showing in all its wonder.In conclusion, this is undoubtedly a must-watch. It doesn't matter whether or not you're a fan of the romance genre, as you will definitely be entertained, I can assure you of that. This picture is simply too astounding to even want to miss out on. You may have noticed that I haven't even mentioned any negatives (I did say Act 1 and 2 weren't amazing, but they were still fairly brilliant to enjoy), and that's because there pretty much aren't any worthy of note. I wasn't the biggest fan of the editing but that's it, and besides, it was such a minor downfall that it didn't in the slightest affect my rating. So I see absolutely no reason not to give this a try, and I honestly can't fathom why anybody wouldn't at least take a liking to this movie. It is a sensation."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 30, 2023",7/10,"Kevin Spacey was one of the hottest actors in Hollywood before he ran into his period of decline. There was no film, nor role, that he could not handle. He was versatile, had a sense of humor, and could play deadly dramatic roles with the greatest of ease. He excels in this film about the alienation of a middle-aged man with his unfortunate lot in life. He wants to be successful, but he hates being a yes-man, a man who has no substance, merely form. In other words, his two-faced insincerity begins to gnaw at his inner self. His hypocritical behavior is temporarily halted by a pretty young thing, but eventually, his true character comes to bear, and that is not in any way, shape or form like the pretty young thing. There will be millions of middle-aged men who will be able to relate to this film."
liopotsi,"Jun 26, 2021",10/10,"Just finished watching this movie and i gotta say....wow. I must firstly point out the performances of the actors, they were phenomenal. Not only did they manage to keep us in the edge of our seat but they also managed to give the characters of the movie meaning. Also it is worth mentioning how weird some scenes are it may be one the few movies that has attained this level of weirdness. All in all it is a movie with a special plot and great characters,definitely worth seeing."
nathandm-75297,"Feb 12, 2023",10/10,"Lester - ""Did you ever see that movie where the body is walking around carrying its own head and then the head goes down on that babe?""Ricky - ""Re-Animator""One of my favorite film references ever.Many things amaze me when it comes to American Beauty, but the most astounding aspect is the way this film touches on nearly all of the insecurities and desires that are experienced in life and turn it into a 2-hour dark comedy drama. To say that this movie is dense with meaning and symbolism would be a massive understatement.I know there are a lot of people who have denounced this film ever since Kevin Spacy's allegations, which is something I completely respect. Personally, I learned a long time ago that I had to separate the art from the artist if I was ever going to enjoy the art that is important to me. But even before that, I knew people who just never cared for this movie saying ""It's just about a guy who's having a midlife crisis and wanting to sleep with a high school girl."" Which in my opinion is a very crude oversimplification.Sure, those are elements in this story but American Beauty is so much more than that. This movie is filled with so many themes that related to the human experience and its all shown through this deconstruction of American suburbia. Themes of morality, love, desire, repression, freedom, redemption, regret, family, and of course, beauty. This film is overwhelming with its many meanings and emotionality but in a way that feels rewarding and eye-opening. It's nearly impossible not to wanna reflect on our own life after seeing it.""It's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst.""This is one of those rare films that makes me feel better about life. It inspires me to wanna recognize the beauty in the world as opposed to hating everything about it. American Beauty has helped shape my perspective on the human experience for the better. And any film that can do that for me is a film that I consider to be a masterpiece."
thedanny-10831,"Apr 6, 2021",9/10,"This film is not only about American Beauty, but also about the full concept of beauty, which concerns everybody. This deep theme is able to trap us into the story and make us feel the same feelings of the protagonist. The movie has a clear message: don't waste your time believing you're not going to make the difference in some way, get out, look around you and discover the spark that makes you feel at the highest level of your life. This is how I think of it. Sam Mendes, at his debut, already scored and the acotrs' performances were among the best of the decade. And you also find the poetry especially in the music by the incredible and underrated Thomas Newman.Simply beautiful."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 13, 2010",10/10,"I wasn't expecting to like American Beauty, but I did, loved it more like. The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.What I love about American Beauty is not only the complex characters, but also the stylish filming, haunting score, side-splitting scenarios, the intelligent and darkly funny screenplay and the assured direction from Sam Mendes. Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable, especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari give wonderful support too. Quintessentially, American Beauty is just a wonderful, funny and brilliantly performed and directed film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
simonwidmann,"Apr 1, 2023",10/10,"""American Beauty"" is a masterpiece that disguises itself as a simple comedy, but in reality, goes much deeper. The characters may seem stereotypical at first glance, but the longer you watch the film, the more you realize how unique and interesting each of them is. The story delves deep and offers a multitude of meanings that can vary depending on perspective and interpretation. Personally, I love this film and haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time. It's a clear recommendation for anyone looking for a film with depth and personality.Another outstanding feature of the film is the acting performances. Kevin Spacey shines in the lead role as Lester Burnham and rightfully won the Oscar for Best Actor. The other actors, such as Annette Bening, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley, also deliver convincing performances.The cinematography is also remarkable. Director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall use the camera to provide deep insights into the characters' lives and create a unique visual atmosphere.Overall, ""American Beauty"" is a film that is both powerful and subtle, capturing the human experience in a unique way. It is a timeless masterpiece that still holds its meaning and impact after many years. It is a clear recommendation for any film fan looking for a masterpiece.I can totally relate to the feeling of uncertainty that often follows watching a movie, especially when it comes to rating it. However, with 10/10 films, there is no such hesitation. I always know right after finishing the film that it deserves a perfect score, because the ending has left me thoroughly impressed. This was precisely the case with ""American Beauty,"" and I can confidently say that it has now become one of my all-time favorite films."

stryker-5,"Jan 26, 2002",N/A,"Hmmm ... Let's just take a cool, objective look at a few of the comments made by IMDb users who have reviewed ""American Beauty"". ""Haunting.""  ""Riveting.""  ""Brilliant.""  ""More than meets the eye."" ""Uplifitng.""  ""Never contrived.""  ""By far the best I have ever seen."" ""Makes you think.""  ""Exceptional.""  ""Never gives stereotypes.""  ""Classic masterpiece.""  ""Movies don't get any better than this.""And that list is by no means exhaustive.  Now let's contemplate the actual film that these people have been watching.Lester Burnham is Suburban Man.  An unremarkable individual not valued by his employer and ignored by his family, he has wasted his entire adult life by succumbing to the routine of work and home, and failing to indulge his own individuality.  When two key events coincide (the loss of his job and the dawning of a 'crush' on his daughter's friend) Lester is suddenly free to ""beat his drum"", slough off years of conformity and be his eccentric self.Yes, that's right, yet another dull, cliche-ridden suburban situation comedy hinting at inchoate unease deep in the soul of bourgeois America. All the predictable bases are touched during this smug box-office home run - petty snobbery, keeping up appearances, repressed yearnings for Bali Hi, and that profound American lament, ""I've Never Been To Me"".And what does Lester do to express his newfound rebellious individuality?  How exactly does he challenge the suburban world which he has rejected?  Form a witches' coven?  Invent a world language?  Assassinate Castro?  Reproduce indian cave art using bison dung as paint?  No.  He drinks beer in front of the TV set, and gets a job in a hamburger joint. Can America's big-budget Dream Factory come up with nothing more exciting than this?Before dealing with the wider themes, I would like to tackle some details which bothered me.  What is a gun doing in this story?  Are Hollywood's screenwriters so bankrupt of ideas that they can't construct a plot without relying on the dreadfully-overworked device of pistol-packing? The opening shower sequence was embarrassing.  Adult jokes are fine by me, bawdy humour is great ... but this was unnecessary and degrading.  It simply didn't belong.  A narrator who announces that he is dead isn't a clever touch, it's just sloppy work.  Is Mena Suvari REALLY the embodiment of American beauty?  I find that hard to believe.  And what about the total loss of nerve surrounding her character?  Isn't this brash film supposed to be proud of its handling of adult issues?  So why does the temptress have to be revealed as a trembling little virgin?  We hear a great deal of American trumpeting of feminism as a cause.  Can't anyone see that this moral cave-in is profoundly anti-feminist?  On a similar note, what was Thora Birch's topless shot all about?  It defines the term 'gratuitous'.And so, back to the broader picture.  ""American Beauty"" isn't any of those amazing things that people have claimed it to be.  It isn't even mediocre.  It's a tired, self-satisfied, deeply unimaginative rehashing of a format which was outworn by the time ""My Favourite Martian"" hit the TV screen.  Challenging the regularity of suburban life isn't clever and isn't funny.  It is gut-achingly DULL.The question which arises, then, is why so many people are sincerely convinced that ""American Beauty"" outshines ""Citizen Kane"".  I offer this for consideration ... they feel that way because they are told to.  It doesn't work every single time, and sometimes it misses spectacularly, but Hollywood knows that as a general rule, advertising pays dividends.  Tell people often enough that they need to see this mighty film, and they will accept the premises - both that they need to see it, and that it's mighty.Barnum said that nobody ever went broke by under-estimating the public. There's truth in that.  Just provide the bread and the circuses, and the docile populace will take you at your word that the bread is delicious and the circuses thrilling.The public wants what the public gets."
FBCorey89,"Dec 18, 2007",10/10,"This movie is the first one I have written a review for, because it is the one that means the most to me.No word in the English language can give enough praise to do this film justice. I could write a whole book about the significance and meaning of every artistic shot, of every remarkable performance, and every event and still not capture the essence of this movie.The truth is that this is the most complete portrayal of human emotion and interaction I have ever seen. It encompasses every aspect of mankind; from jealousy and intolerance, to romance and happiness. Every single aspect of each scene has a meaning and message, and if your mind is open, then this movie will affect you in so many ways.On a more technical note, this movie is not only superbly written, but executed flawlessly. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of the century, hitting every nuance of his character with grace and style. In a lesser movie, his performance would have been the sole reason to watch. Yet this is not the case. Annette Benning also shines with her portrayal of a troubled housewife that is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. The musical score also stands out as a fantastic attribute of the experience; not overpowering, yet still just as relevant.I could go on and on about the flawless cinematography and lighting effects and such. But I can sum that all up in a different manner: ""There is no bad aspect of this film."" Everything works together to perfection to provide the most outstanding movie of this age.""American Beauty"" is quite simply the most significant film of its time. Yet this movie also transcends time to provide an emotional and thought-provoking experience for years to come."
ijtfalcon,"Oct 11, 2007",10/10,"So much has been said about this movie that it's hard to think of what else I could add. I wasn't even going to comment on the film for this precise reason, but then I figured I needed to give my favorite film of all time a shout out.To start, I honestly believe that this is one of the true masterpieces of the decade. This is a beautifully crafted movie on absolutely every level but it's the use and exploration of character throughout that makes it truly astonishing. I find each of the characters incredibly fascinating and very rich. The tagline ""Look Closer"" is spot on because there's always more going on than what you observe on the surface. If I'm ever missing the beauty in my own world, this is a great work of art to remind me that I don't have to look very far."
TomatoFork,"Oct 14, 2017",10/10,"A movie brilliantly disguised as an entertaining sitcom-ish family drama that takes every opportunity to establish the characters' individual story lines to the point in which the plot has expanded to twice the scope it had in the beginning.Every character feels like grounded people with their own arcs by the end and it's surprising how detailed they become. The comedic undertone slowly becomes more unsettling as the events spiral to the extremes.Kevin Spacey, Anette Bening and Chris Cooper all give great performances in this movie that help make their characters more sympathetic while still with questionable acts.The trailer makes the movie seem like a generic 90s American family comedy where the focus is in Kevin Spacey but that couldn't be further from the truth.It's a great subversion of the ideal American family taken to an extreme in which it could go any direction. And that it does."
johnugomessina,"Jun 21, 2021",9/10,This film is wonderful. I saw it again after so many years. Too bad that Kevin Spacey can't act anymore because of the metoo things. It is second to none with his character interwining in a beautiful way.
Duncan07,"Aug 25, 2023",6/10,"I watched this film the first time and I didn't really enjoy it that much I thought it was kind of boring and overrated I tried to engage to the he story but didn't find it that interesting and kind of weird but now that I've watched closer I find the film to be an amazing piece of art. I say ""watched closer"" but actually I came across a YouTube video that analyses films and TV shows and it analysed american beauty and I thought wow. How smart ? It's like a satire of our society with every character representing a stereotype and even the ending was changed. To anyone who hasn't watched this film and about to or want to... I'd advise you to watch closer like in a critical point of view you'll see how good the film is.Rating went from 6 to 7.5."
djtroycook,"Apr 25, 2021",8/10,I find myself referencing this movie in my mind all throughout my life. It sticks with you. Spacey and Benning are perfect for the leading roles.
cdimidenko,"May 28, 2022",9/10,"I was hesitant about watching this movie after all the reviews about an old man having an affair with a young girl, but after finally watching it, it's one of my favorites. It just made me see the beauty of life, how even though there are painful and messed up things (as well as beautiful things), it doesn't mean we have to act like they don't exist. We just have to realize that every little thing in our ""stupid little lives"" (as the main character says) is meaningful. It's when we take all that for granted that unnecessary problems start to occur, families get broken up and we resort to lesser means of finding fulfillment. I think the scenes/story of Angela and Lester is meant to signify coming alive. Angela made him feel things he hasn't felt in a long time, and actually wanted to take care of himself. At first, he thought his end goal was to get with her, but eventually he realized that it was to see his life from a positive perspective. Maybe the reason he was drawn to her was because it allowed him to finally realize the beauty that he already had in his stupid little life."

pulpficat,"Sep 26, 2023",9/10,"American Beauty is a deep dive into the absurdity of middle-class existence, served up with a generous side of existential crisis and dark humor.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged suburbanite with a job that's slowly sucking the life out of him and a family that's barely holding it together. His life takes a bizarre turn when he develops an inappropriate infatuation with his daughter's teenage friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). But Lester's not alone in his quest for self-destruction. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is an uptight real estate agent whose obsession with success rivals his own descent into madness. Meanwhile, their daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is the poster child for teenage angst, complete with a penchant for eye-rolling and dark poetry.The film's humor is as dark as a black hole, often veering into the territory of uncomfortable laughter. It's a satire that takes aim at the façade of suburban perfection, exposing the emptiness beneath the manicured lawns and white picket fences. From Lester's hilariously inappropriate fantasies to the dysfunctional dynamics of the Burnham family, American Beauty revels in the absurdity of it all.However, beneath the dark humor and biting satire, the film delves into deeper themes of identity, desire, and the search for meaning. It's a midlife crisis that transcends the clichés, offering moments of genuine introspection amidst the chaos. It reminds us that even in the most mundane of lives, there can be moments of profound revelation and transformation."
fernandoschiavi,"Dec 28, 2022",9/10,"American Beauty is a chronicle about ordinary people living through relatively ordinary dramas and that, in a way, end up reaching equally ordinary conclusions. Perhaps this is precisely the secret of the film, which, at the end of the projection, manages to lead us to curiously intense emotions: the fact that its message is universal. How to avoid identifying with a man as normal as the one played by Kevin Spacey? Directed by Sam Mendes, following the routine of a group of ordinary citizens, the plot portrays a family in the process of breaking up. Lester (Kevin Spacey) and Carolyn's (Annette Bening) marriage is a sea of coldness and arguments. Suddenly, he starts fantasizing about Angela (Mena Suvari), a teenager who is his daughter's friend. From then on, the protagonist makes major changes in his life that end tragically.Sam Mendes' cinematographic debut, American Beauty has extremely symbolic moments that visually express the concepts inserted in its plot, skillfully captured by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall. The first and most important of these elements, which should be visible to any viewer, are Mendes' framing that insistently highlights the presence of roses in the environment in which some sequences take place. These are not simple roses, but American beauties. Present in the original name of the film and in its literal national translation, american beauty is a variation of rose that is very common in the United States, visually perfect, but without smell or thorns. The subtlety with which Mendes presents them makes a parallel with the American suburban families that star in his story and that, apparently perfect with their beautiful homes, cars and smiles, are emotionally and evidently empty.The main couple, composed of Carolyn and Lester, has so many facets that their characters, added to the fantastic interpretations of Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey, can be analyzed from multiple perspectives. The apparently controversial relationship that the two share, extremely maternal, is what stands out the most. It is enough to notice Carol's corporal imposition on Lester, who is constantly bowed before his presence, or the childlike treatment he receives from his wife. This dominant-dominated involvement is evident to the point that a sequence with sexual content between the two appears to be almost incestuous.The fact is, Lester is unhappy. Ignored by his wife and daughter, he has worked for over a decade at a magazine that confines him to eternal servitude and the betrayal of all his youthful dreams. An existence where ""Yes, sir"" is as common an expression as ""Excuse me."" That's when his entire perception is altered by a magnificent vision: Angela, his daughter's teenage friend. Swept away by this new passion, Lester wakes up from the 'coma' he's been immersed in for years and decides to give himself a new chance. His goals are humble: he doesn't want to be rich or elected President. He just wants to respect himself and be happy. How not to be moved by a purpose so simple and, at the same time, so complex? Initially a defeated guy who can't even express his opinions aloud, Lester gradually regains his self-esteem through small victories. One night, for example, he has an argument with his wife and manages, after years, to say what he really thinks. His huge smile right after the fight highlights the importance of that apparently ridiculous situation. And his next sentence is a little pearl of common man wisdom: ""It's great to realize that we still have the ability to surprise ourselves.""But Alan Ball's beautiful script is not just a midlife crisis: the story is a small revolving machine gun that does not bother to spare some of the most deeply rooted values of the American way of life (and of any reasonably industrialized civilization - read itself: dedicated to consumption). From the gay neighbors (apparently the most balanced in the film) to the family that lives next door to the Burnhams, everyone has something to hide: the great truth is that keeping up appearances is an art to which we all dedicate ourselves - and the film, in turn, , is dedicated to exposing this little hypocrisy that has become the norm in today's world.The film has a multitude of details and symbolism that at first may go unnoticed by the viewer. The house where the families live reflect what they aspire to be: perfect and symmetrical. Inside Lester's house, all the furniture is symmetrically placed, has cool colors and has a specific function and at a given moment, it becomes clear that they are more important to his wife than himself. The garage, where he becomes his refuge, is a messier place, colorful and open to novelties. Which reflects directly on the couple's relationship, where Carolyn has much more space and much more power than Lester. Nor does Jane's room bear any resemblance to her personality, which ends up making the film incredibly fascinating, as it talks about appearances, about projecting an image of something you are not. And the Burnhams are far from a happy, close-knit family.Kevin Spacey, however, is largely responsible for the success of American Beauty: there is not a single moment in which Lester's ""saga"" rings false - despite the absurdity of some situations. His initial lethargy is convincingly replaced by hilarious cynicism, finally giving way to absolute serenity. The expression on the actor's face when teenage Angela reveals to him that his daughter is in love represents, in itself, one of the most touching moments seen on film in years. When he finally says 'Good for her', the last movement of his transformation takes place: Lester finally realizes that happiness has always been within her reach - his frustration is what kept him from realizing it.The other characters, however minor participation some may have, in no way can be considered disposable or supporting, as American Beauty is a work of many protagonists. Jane Burnham, played by Thora Birch, has the usual problems of adolescence that add to the upheavals that her family suffers, and she doesn't quite know how to behave in the face of it. When she meets Ricky (Wes Bentley), her new neighbor, she sees in him a possibility to put aside her fragility. Furthermore, newcomer Wes Bentley surprises by portraying a young man whose apparent madness is mere disguise for his poet's soul. Contrasted with the passivity of Jane's father, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), Ricky's father, is extremely disciplinarian and castrating, and throughout the film one understands the reasons that made him that way. Probably partly to blame for his wife's sanity, the colonel also makes his son's life untenable. The apparent one-dimensionality of Chris Cooper's character turns out to be a clever mask of the true complexity of his feelings.Almost everyone in American Beauty seeks something, but ends up giving up or getting frustrated. Jane wants new breasts, but she gives up when she realizes that what she has is enough for the boyfriend she finally finds. Angela builds a sexually active persona to be accepted (a kind of search for otherness in pre-internet times), but when confronted with who she never was, she reveals herself as just an insecure little girl. Carolyn wants to achieve material and professional victory, but she does not have the competence to do so. The colonel wants a world governed by order and discipline, but fails when trying to do this in his own home, exposing how much his family is a failure. In the case of the colonel, the failure is even greater because he does not fall alone, since he does not even realize that his biggest defeat is far from his son: his catatonic and lost wife. Only Ricky and Lester, in a sense, by giving up the materialistic pursuit and acceptance of others, supposedly find their happiness.Ball's script builds a side shadow announcing the protagonist's death and developing a series of small arcs that can open up countless possibilities to the public regarding the author of the murder (the recording of Ricky and Jane, Ricky with the keys to the gun cabinet of the father, Carolyn learning to shoot). It is a well-made primary narrative resource, but it is built through a script that develops so much thematically that, many years later, little or none of it is remembered. The basis of multiple themes and the acidity on which the ""who's going to do it"" of Lester's murder is based is much more perennial and striking.American Beauty shows the consequences of a completely dehumanized and materialistic society that contrasts with the most intimate concerns of being. It seeks a critical look at our reality, in which we play roles, we constantly put on masks to try to fit into patterns. Our society is like a great masked ball, which changes over the years: son, father, grandfather, etc. All this to form a lifestyle, an aesthetic based on appearances and artifices, which began to take shape after the Second World War with the promotion of the American way of life. It is interesting to see how these masks are lost when sex appears on the scene, when individuals allow themselves to be carried away by these passions. From Lester to Colonel Fitts, passing through the teenagers Jane and Angela (Jane's friend), all succumb to desire and let their authentic yearnings and insecurities show through.Sam Mendes' film presents the harsh consequences of our contemporary society, shows how fear is the main culprit of trying to keep up appearances and not accepting ourselves as we really are. We deny, hide and use a multitude of masks in order to adapt and survive the established patterns. Undoubtedly, appearances are deceiving."

kelvinselimor,"Dec 1, 2021",10/10,"American Beauty. Not everyone will be able to understand and see the beauty. In a good way, a very unusual and at the same time ordinary film. The plot is quite simple, but the message of the film itself can be understood in many ways. The acting is great, the music is amazing, and the film itself sinks into the soul for a very long time."
joshua-21622,"Jun 30, 2023",N/A,"Damn, I was not prepared to watch this...
This is the first movie here that I am not looking forward to rate as it just a psychological nightmare, make you think and examine your supper table and how your relationship is with those around it! I find it very hard to say this as i go on that write that ""it questions your existence, and your will to change"". Difficult nonetheless, the main characters does turn into positive as his end nears, and I find it somewhat ironical that the only good and normal guy in the entire movie is ..., giving the proverb the perfect time to shine ""A sudden change, brings sudden death"""
Theo Robertson,"Feb 4, 2003",6/10,"AMERICAN BEAUTY is good in some ways but its portrayal of American stereotypes is laughably unfunny . It`s almost a satire of a parody : Pathetic shmuck of a father , frigid wife , dope smoking lolita , a couple of gay neighbours . I mean hello ! MARRIED WITH CHILDREN and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD not mention hundreds of grunge rock videos were doing this stuff ten times better years earlier . The only person to think this is a real slice of American pie is Osama Bin Laden . These American stereotypes really suck man . WhateverThe cinematography is beautiful as is the incidental music and the ending is very haunting but there is no way the film deserved the praise lavished on it , AMERICAN BEAUTY was standing at number 2 in the IMDb top 250 film rankings at one point ! Can you believe that man ? And there is a very simple explanation for the reason that it swept the oscars that year - 1999 was a very poor year for films . Go figure"
markus_fekal,"Oct 29, 2018",9/10,"The American Beauty is a movie about - you guessed it - beauty. And not only are we talking about appearance, but also the beauty of the simplest things in life. As the main character says, ""Today is the first day of the rest of your life"". And you'll know it full well when you reach the end of this masterpiece.The movie was released in 1999 and directed by Sam Mendes. Kevin Spacey, embodied into Lester Burnham, tells a story about a middle-aged father trying to sort his life out. And his unbalanced in life wife Carolyn and anxious, misunderstood daughter Jane are really not helping him out. Each of them have their flaws and seeing them struggling to straighten things out is a true pleasure to watch.Now, right off the bat I want to say I've loved the movie. Seeing the plot unravel and the characters change in meaningful ways is frankly astonishing. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening (as Carolyn) and Wes Bentley (as Ricky, a creepy neighbour next door) really outdid themselves in this one. At first they caused me to cringe horribly (obviously as intended). But later on with their engaging performances we realize how endearing and relatable these people are. Discovering their complex (or sometimes the simplest) views on life really warms a viewer's heart.The movie was quite funny and I've lol'd a few times. The tone is mostly light - the audience can relax and enjoy a good film. What we also need to talk about is the soundtrack, which absolutely appealed to me. The music really gave the atmosphere of the movie a nice touch. And last thing, the dialogues were top notch, mainly the ones between Lester and Carolyn. The asparagus scene genuinely amazed me and it's definitely gonna stay on my mind for some time.In conclusion, the filmmaker was successful in his role - making me self-reflect and have a good time. The charming characters and their complex stories are truly worth a rewatch. American Beauty is certainly a title I'll come back to."
moonspinner55,"Oct 21, 2006",6/10,"Black comedy from screenwriter Alan Ball is alternately cynical and satirical as it examines life behind the Red Door in garden-filled suburbia. Unhappily married husband and father fantasizes about his teenage daughter's sexy girlfriend while his uptight real estate agent spouse has an affair with her mentor; meanwhile, their daughter gets to know the troubled youth next door, who has icy, dysfunctional parents so rigid they're like horrible cartoons. Overrated picture is thin--and so preconceived to be shocking that it seems rather embittered (although most audiences were not put off). Conrad Hall's Oscar-winning cinematography is exceptionally handsome and the cast is excellent (especially Kevin Spacey, who gives a slyly intricate Oscar-performance), yet the film is hampered by an over-ambitious third-act, unnecessary bursts of melodramatic nonsense (often with a sexual undercurrent), and smarmy vulgarities. Oscars also went to Sam Mendes for his direction, Ball for his original screenplay, and--incredibly--the film as Best Picture of the year. **1/2 from ****"
appletoanapple,"Oct 12, 2014",9/10,"You may read the little summary on the film up above and look at the movie poster and make assumptions about this movie, but the description is misleading. I know it was for me because when I finally watched the movie I was pleasantly surprised. This is one of those few movies that you will remember what you were doing while you watched it. The main point of the movie is not directly tied to the description up above - it is something that you will figure out for yourself..if you watch the movie. American Beauty is a breed of movie all its own, and should be watched with care- however silly that sounds. Overall, just watch it. Kevin Spacey's narration is perfect for this movie and he really adds to his character."
manzanitadulce-75273,"Jun 11, 2025",9/10,"The movie is precise from start to finish. The cinematography is an 11. The same goes for the photography. It has a very unique aesthetic and aura. Sam Mendes is a genius and he shows it here along with Kevin Spacey. It may not be a movie for everyone's taste but that doesn't diminish it. Sometimes as a man you have to know when to send things to hell when necessary. The soundtrack can feel nerve-wracking at times but is part of the atmosphere. Sublime, nothing more.(i have nothing else to say but I must meet quota, this is just extra text, please ignore, i still need 30 characters... mhhm, done!)"
mylikescucc,"Dec 18, 2013",8/10,"American Beauty is further strengthened by Chris Cooper's role as the Burnham's homophobic neighbor (October Sky, The Patriot, Seabiscuit) and Mena Suvari's role as the big-talking school girl Angela Hayes, object of Lester's desires (Kiss The Girls, American Pie). American Beauty is a film bursting with stage talent, one that benefits from solid direction, a well-designed screenplay, and superb dialog. Odds are, you'll either love it or hate it. But irrespective of your final take, American Beauty will invoke passion one way or the other. That's why this film ranks as a definite must-see...The Usual Suspects and L.A. Confidential with his Academy Award for Best Actor in this film. Some of the funniest scenes in American Beauty involve the depressed Lester Burnham and his mid-life crisis meltdown. The way in which Spacey walks out of his job is utterly hilarious, and his weed-smoking, weight-lifting regimen in an effort to get pumped up and impress his daughter's friend is classic. But Spacey's performance is not alone."
benowen-91207,"Oct 4, 2019",10/10,"My biggest fear before watching this movie was that I felt I was going to be unsatisfied with the product, I mean American beauty is considered the best movie of 1999 and hell some say of all time. I'm happy to say that did not happen, yes American beauty is a masterpiece in its own right
The brilliant direction by Sam Mendes and permanence from Kevin Spacey (less we forget) is really what pulls it together. The dialogue was also fantastic and had me laughing at several moments ( seriously that dinner scene after spacey quits his job is absolutely hilarious).
Honestly my biggest problem of the film was the whole 'Spacey's character is going to die at the end' draw. It felt unnecessary in the theme of the plot, the ending voice over of spacey talking about his life felt quite out of place honestly.
Regardless, you should check it out, this film is only a hair away from being a perfect 10 in my eyes. Maybe you'll love it even more"
bob the moo,"Apr 10, 2004",N/A,"Lester Burnham is stuck in a rut - he is having a midlife crisis, alienated from his wife and daughter, sexually frustrated and longing for a feeling that he had as a young man that responsibility robbed him of as an adult. When he meets his daughter's best friend it kicks off a realisation that his life needs to change, starting with quitting his job and acting less responsible.  Meanwhile the lives of both Carolyn and Jane Burnham begin to change in different ways as they also try to deal with the empty days that they seem to live.When this film came out it jumped almost to the top of the imdb top 250 list - much as many films that make a big audience think or feel something do. Also it gained award after award and was basically held up as a generally great film.  I saw it at the time and was very impressed by it as it touched a nerve in some regards.  Watching it several years later I still am able to take some thinks from it but am more open to the faults that are within it. The actual plot is exaggerated in terms of it not fitting in with the average audience member's experience.  However it's wide wings will mean that it will speak to a large section of it's audience.The points it has to say are very broad but are delivered in a reasonable manner - i.e. not overly veiled but not rammed down our throats.  I like to think I am a few years off a midlife crisis but I can see my life in Lester's feelings, as many of us can - hence the film's success.  This is not to say that the whole plot is perfect for it is not.  The film is slightly arty and, sadly, a bit pretentious.  I almost dare not say it as I know many audience members were very touched by the `bag scene', but I did think to myself that the film must be very good to be able to carry off a scene that is so full of cheese and pretension!  This happens at several points throughout the film in different ways and does take away from the film somewhat.  Likewise the film's lapse into `whodunit' towards the end doesn't really work either.  Happily the central plot and the classy delivery from director Mendes makes for a great film.The cast greatly helps and were appropriately rewarded for their work. Spacey may have been in the process of losing his edge by this point in his career (hopefully he'll get back to his best, but he hasn't at the time of writing).  Here he is great and his semi-comic delivery helps smooth out some of the unlikely edges on his character.  Bening is given a lesser role in terms of not being central to the story but her character is actually more emotionally real than Lester - she has to deal with life like the majority of us whereas Lester flees from it.  Birch is good and underplays well while it is nice to see Suvari in a film that isn't average.  Bentley has the least role of the film as his character is the most abstractly drawn and least realistic.  He is OK in the role but he is limited by what he has to work with.  Janney's role is small and one dimensional but her performance is great - it is hard to believe that this is the same woman that plays the super confident and talkative CJ in West Wing!  Cooper is as good as ever and small roles are well done by Gallagher, Bakula and Robards.Overall this is a very good film but I find it hard to accept that it has been consistently as high up the critics (amateur and professional) lists as it has been.  It has a good plot that has broad enough characters so that most viewers will find something to relate to, but this stretch also opens it up to problems that serve to weaken the film somewhat.  That said, this is still a film that is thoughtful, artistic, character driven and moving - and when a big Hollywood film manages to do that then it is a cause for praise, not complaint."
michaelRokeefe,"Nov 22, 2000",7/10,"I can not compare this movie to anything I have ever seen before. Well written and superbly directed. The acting was so good it made limit pushing activities look some what normal. Kevin Spacey is fantastic as the man trapped in a miserable life. Annette Bening is so real as the work obsessed wife with no time for her husband. Thora Birch is pedestrian as the daughter lacking self confidence. Talk about a show stopper; Mena Suvari plays the flirtatious tart with zest. She can make any man go to the garage and start pumping iron.A man making haphazard choices in trying to recover his life is not so much out of the norm. True this is a sad look at a  family that is set on self destruction. Sometimes it takes witnessing the likes of this to help you realize that your own problems are very small in comparison. Fantasy situations are part of real life. This movie will rank among the great ones.Also in the cast are: Wes Bentley, Peter Gallagher and Scott Bakula."
dolunayaka,"Dec 11, 2024",9/10,"American Beauty is a poignant and darkly poetic exploration of suburban life, individuality, and the pursuit of meaning in a world of facades. Sam Mendes' directorial debut is a triumph of visual storytelling and emotional depth, inviting viewers to look beyond the surface and find beauty in the unexpected.The film's ensemble cast delivers remarkable performances, with characters who feel authentic and layered. Each figure represents a different facet of longing, repression, and self-discovery, brought to life with subtlety and precision. Thomas Newman's evocative score and Conrad Hall's striking cinematography create an atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll.What sets American Beauty apart is its ability to find universality in the personal, exploring themes of freedom, authenticity, and connection with grace and introspection."
LeonLouisRicci,"Oct 15, 2013",7/10,"Could this ""Little"" Film be more Overrated. It's Doubtful. Living up to Best Picture/Director, etc, of the Year is quite a lot of Reputation to Bare. But here it is. A Liberal Wet Dream that is not very Clever or Insightful but does have a Teenage-Middle-Age/Class-American Dream-Angst going for it and all done Beautifully.The Acting is very strong all around and it has a Smooth Pacing, the Shallow Writing tackles some Touchy Subjects with a Bitten Tongue-in-the-Cheek, but to say that this is Great Stuff, Profound, New, or much more than Breezy Satire is Saying more than it Deserves.There are Semi-Predictable Twists and it wears practically all of its Pretensions and Points Boldly, like one of those Self-Made T-Shirts. For all of its Accolades can Anyone actually say that they haven't seen this so many times before, so much as to have become Clichés. So no, this is just another take on the same old thing and rather well done at that. But, come on, take a deep breath, and Stop and smell the Roses. Yea...they smell the same here as they did before."
crendine,"Mar 11, 2015",1/10,"I have to agree with those IMDb reviewers who simply cannot understand how this movie won the Best Picture award or for that matter, how it is even considered a good film. It's nothing more than an overblown, exaggerated view of a dysfunctional family set to the backdrop of a suburban lifestyle that, for the most part, seems totally unrealistic. While Kevin Spacey usually turns in consistent performances (although he always seems to play rather offbeat characters), I felt his performance here was very weak. He plays a middle-aged man going through his midlife crisis period but to me, just seems unconvincing. Even Annette Benning's performance seemed way below par. Quite frankly, definitely not worthy of Best Picture and not one that I would want to own."
CharlesLBC,"Sep 19, 2024",8/10,"I have to say it is quite obvious why this film swept the Oscars awards. Captivating picture, detailed performance, deep thought, valid illustrations. Although some clips and characters are a bit weird, surprisingly a taste of dark humor is added, spicing up the story.Besides, 'American Beauty' reminds me of a paralleled story, An elephant sitting still, which similarly reveals the tiredness and irrationality among the society.Personally speaking, the plastic bags metaphor is a little stereotypical and the camera guy is kinda creepy, which got me a bit distracted.Above all, a decent work can speak for itself and pop out spontaneously. Light 9 is a valid score, worth watching for several times."
galvinkahs,"Feb 27, 2012",9/10,"Well worth seeing, especially if you're a Kevin Spacey fan. Different than I expected, but fantastic. A lot of character development through out, where as I was expecting most to be focused on Spacey, a lot was spent on all characters which makes the movie all the better. You will not be disappointed if you decide to watch this movie. Very complex character interactions. Some odd/creepy parts but I think that it gives the movie its interesting touch and willingness to cross some lines made it unique. Along with Spacey, Chris Cooper also does a fantastic job and plays his typical character as a strict military man. Annette Benning also was fantastic. Great movie."

nikos-19,"Feb 22, 2020",8/10,"With 5 Oscars (best movie, director, actor leading role, cinematography and writing) and 3 more nominations (actress leading role, film editing and music) it is listed as one of the leading films in the history of cinema. Weird film, with Kevin Spacey being the only character in the play that played more as a comedian and much less as a drama, an element that sealed the film's weird character. The film is powerful, a mirror of relationships in a modern family. A family broken up inside, where its members seek communication, joy, love, esteem, outside the family context. Just the opposite of what the family window showcases, that is. And all this is embedded in the social context, with its anchors, its distortions, its exaggerations, its impositions, but also its instability. To conclude that the family self-destructs itself, which is ultimately the only element on which she could find support."
chera_khalid,"Aug 13, 2024",8/10,"American Beauty (1999) is a thought-provoking and visually striking film that earns an 8/10 for its compelling yet slightly flawed execution. Kevin Spacey delivers a standout performance as Lester Burnham, capturing the complexity of a man undergoing a midlife crisis with dark humor and pathos. The film's cinematography is stunning, with its use of color and framing adding layers of meaning to the story. Thomas Newman's haunting score complements the film's tone beautifully. However, while the film's exploration of suburban discontent is powerful, some aspects of the narrative feel heavy-handed, and certain character arcs could have been more fully developed. Overall, it's a great film with memorable moments but leaves room for refinement."
tr91,"Aug 18, 2013",N/A,"American Beauty is a brilliant drama, so powerful and moving. Having read roughly what the film was about before I started watching it, I was pleasantly surprised by how multi dimensional it turned out to be. There was much more going on than I expected and all the story lines were interesting in their own way.The plot goes much deeper than I imagined and it really is just a brilliant drama. It also has its comedy moments which help the film to flow. The cast in this all delivered very strong performances and made it seem so real, especially Kevin Spacey. Wes Bentley is also deserving of a mention for his portrayal of the very mysterious neighbour. The way it ended won't be to everyone's taste but for me it makes it more memorable.Overall it is a brilliant drama that I would highly recommend and I would certainly watch again.

fog-9,"Jan 25, 2006",6/10,"unlike some, i find the topic of the mediocrity of suburban life to be very interesting, as i can relate to the environment... often people say that these tales are of no value, and that characters in these settings should ""just get over it""... or ""why does anybody care about a bunch of spoiled boring people?""...i'm not of the opinion that suburban life is irrelevant... it's the situation many people find themselves in, and in it people face different struggles... perhaps not as monumental as fighting giant worms or dodging terrifying political violence, but still valid and human...thus, i have watched many movies that tackle the subject... a common slant is to infuse a little fantasy or poetry in the otherwise mundane, which brings out certain truths or extrapolates on the human condition...American beauty is no different... while other movies like ""lawn dogs"" firmly establish the fairytale idea early on in the movie, American beauty plays quite straight until its main character's fantasies are used to unlock hidden truths about the world he lives in... objects are given dreamlike significance, etc...American beauty also slips into an unlikely set of events, much like the awful ""desperate housewives""... our protagonist (played by kevin spacey) attempts blackmail to fund a life of teenage ambition... he gets a job at a burger place to annoy and frustrate the people in his life who have in turn, annoyed and frustrated him...what American beauty struggles with is its innate heavy handedness... at times the wisdom dispensed in the movie is trite, or just lame... it suffers from its absurd events, and clichéd ideas of people... if someone doesn't agree with your idea of fun, they're probably in the closet and violent...still, annette bening gives a great performance... it is funny and charming in places, and it does make you think... a good movie to see to introduce the idea of satire, social commentary, and drama... similar movies i've seen have been slightly better however, like the solid and bruising ""safety of objects"", or the devastating, vicious ""happiness""...i don't think this movie is a classic, but it is powerful and interesting in places... it's sad that the IMDb doesn't allow decimals, because this would be a 6.7 or so... worthwhile..."
natashagurure,"Dec 28, 2024",10/10,"It is a beautifully crafted exploration of suburban discontent, self-discovery, and the hidden beauty in life's chaos. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening deliver exceptional performances, breathing life into characters that are flawed yet deeply relatable.Review: A Mesmerizing Masterpiece - American Beauty (1999)Sam Mendes' American Beauty is a cinematic tour de force that blends beauty, darkness, and profound human truths into an unforgettable experience. Set against the backdrop of suburban America, the film explores themes of identity, desire, freedom, and the hidden cracks beneath the polished surface of everyday life.Kevin Spacey delivers an outstanding performance as Lester Burnham, a man undergoing a dramatic midlife awakening. His character's journey is both tragic and liberating, reminding us of the complexities of chasing happiness in a world full of societal expectations. Annette Bening is equally captivating as Carolyn, whose relentless pursuit of perfection becomes a poignant reflection on discontent and self-worth.What makes American Beauty so remarkable is its layered storytelling. Alan Ball's Oscar-winning script weaves humor, heartbreak, and existential musings seamlessly, leaving the audience reflective long after the credits roll. The film's exploration of beauty in unexpected places - a plastic bag swirling in the wind or the raw honesty of human emotion - invites us to question what we consider truly beautiful.Visually, Conrad Hall's cinematography is a revelation. The symbolic use of color, particularly the recurring motif of red roses, adds depth and artistic flair, while Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score sets the tone perfectly, pulling viewers deeper into the story.Mendes' direction strikes a balance between sharp satire and profound introspection, ensuring every character and subplot contributes meaningfully to the larger narrative. The result is a film that is not only a critique of societal norms but also a celebration of the extraordinary hidden within the ordinary.American Beauty is a timeless classic that dares to challenge and inspire. It's a film that holds a mirror to our own lives, asking us to see the beauty, chaos, and imperfection within ourselves. A must-watch for anyone who appreciates cinema that speaks to the soul."
johnrp-1,"Dec 20, 2003",5/10,"I'm not sure why so many people raved about this movie. It was entertaining and the acting was pretty good. Kevin Spacey was, as always, fantastic. In fact, I found that to be one of the sore spots in the movie. Spacey was so good that the other acting - albeit okay - simply didn't measure up.Still ... it's worth a see. But I don't think I'd shell out to buy it. Once was enough."
vovaneschadim,"Jan 31, 2025",10/10,"""American Beauty"" by Sam Mendes is a rather philosophical movie about whether we should conform to societal roles or pursue our inner desires. Set in modern-day America, it resonates with our potential and everyday experiences. The film highlights many issues that people often face in their families, such as exhausting routines, struggling relationships that decline over time, and misunderstandings that lead to unnecessary actions. It contrasts living rationally with our consciousness versus living emotionally, making decisions based on our unconscious mind. Like in real life, rationality can lead to a quiet, but dull existence, while emotions make life more intense, with all the ups and downs that come with it. It seems the truth lies somewhere in the middle. I highly recommend it, especially if you have a family and can relate to the main characters."
fullthundermoon-36564,"Nov 18, 2021",10/10,"We get to see all that goes on in Lester Burnham's neighbourhood. Every character gets their fifteen minutes of fame in this cinematic life-cycle. Serious issues are dealt with - tenderly and comedically. A wonderful film. Monologues, music and mood are exquisitely recorded."
MFC9,"Feb 22, 2022",8/10,"Timely film that tracks the disintegration of the nuclear family amidst mid-life crisis, sexual confusion and identity breakdown, all-too-familiar to those in middle age. Spacey and Bening deliver career best turns as Lester and Carolyn Burnham, while Birch, Suvari and Bentley are very good as the junior brigade tiptoeing around the alarmingly dysfunctional parents. Intriguing, entertaining and beautifully made, American Beauty is also weirdly uncomfortable on rewatch in 2022. 8/10."
mattias-mir,"Jan 29, 2022",10/10,"American beauty - 10/10.Saw it 22 years ago and loved it then. Love it just as much today. My taste usually changes a little over the decades. But not my thoughts about American Beauty.Easily top 10 of all movies I've seen. American Beauty contains: amazing characters, seriousness, depth, great humor, superb dialogue, authentic feeling, awesome actors, bold photo, wonderful soundtrack, perfect setting, the brutal end.American Beauty has a nerve there I do not know in any other movie have."

stealth4933,"Apr 23, 2011",6/10,"I'll will go ahead and say that I think there a lot of films out there (not just films but books as well) that I perceive as being ""faux"" deep. American Beauty is just this kind of film. The premise I thought to be a pretty typical premise, the main theme I thought to be a pretty typical main theme, the characters and acting I thought to be pretty typical. In the end though, the thing that turned me away from it was the execution. I just thought everything about this movie was soooo cookie cutter. For example, we took a break in the middle of the movie (I was watching it with friends) and they all started to talk about how cool it was that the main character smoked weed and was an adult. I rolled my eyes because that is the kind of hip bullcrap that directors and writers put in movies to sell to audiences. My final assessment of the movie was that it was Office Space, but without the comedy. Before people think that I am crazy I will explain this theory. So the main character goes through a religious style experience that shows him he should stop living life by other people's rules. It goes well for a while, but then it starts to alienate the man from his wife/girlfriend and drives her away. He ends up really hurting his best friends/neighbors and daughter. Then at the end of the movie the main character realizes that this lifestyle he has been leading really has no substance and that everything that he had before that lifestyle got out of hand is what gave his life substance. Of course, Office Space has a happy ending and American Beauty really doesn't, but the main theme is the exact or close to the exact same thing. Except American Beauty has not comedy..."
dexter-3,"Jun 4, 2001",1/10,"""American Beauty"" is excessively praised as a great piece of American film, when in reality it isn't even good enough to be a decent rip-off of better films.  Unfortunately, many viewers have fallen for it.  (""Moonspinner55"" and ""tubist38"" have good reviews.  Note that one person who initially praised the film reviewed it again a year later and said, ""What was I thinking?"")  Mendes wastes some excellent actors in these meatball scenes (for example, Spacey throwing the asparagus...who couldn't do that well?)  A lot of this film is some snappy one-liners or clever scenes strung together with...nothing.  Everything that happens is almost laughably predictable. And the crucial scene, where an empty plastic bag blowing in the wind is supposed to impart some deep meaning on the true nature of existence in the phenomenal world?  Right.  Finally, I must comment on Annette Bening, who is one of the better actresses working today being cast in the role of a cartoon...what a waste.This film is a ""1,"" and should in fact have a turkey symbol next to it. ""American Beauty"" is the perfect symbol of the decline of the serious American film.  ""Ordinary People,"" ""Out of the Blue,"" and ""The Sweet Hereafter"" are much better films."
sydneyjlevine,"Oct 19, 2024",10/10,"After all these 25 years, American Beauty still shows America in all its ugliness and with such sardonic humor. Is sardonic the right word? Director Sam Mendes uses Spielburgesque videotaping; even the ""King of Real Estate"" Peter Gallagher made his breakthrough in Sex, Lies and Videotape. Alan Ball, the writer intersperses the lyrics of such well chosen songs with the dialogue that you cannot separate dialogue from music at the most moving moments.Choreography BR Paula Abdul doesn't look like choreography at all....except for the funnily lame cheerleaders. But her touch of class makes you realize how well this film was planned and executed to the last detail. The list of songs used itself plays like a playlist you would want to put on a loop.Annette Benning continues to amaze us, just as when she conquered Warren Beatty. Kevin Spacey has faced his comedown. Thora Birch, while steadily working has never broken through to stardom, nor have the stunningly beautiful Mena Suvari or Wes Bentley. Chris Cooper seems to have had his day as well. But this ensemble cast has created a perennial. It's such a pleasure to be able to laugh at the tragedy of lives gone bad and to know that beauty is sometimes so grand that we can barely sustain its grandeur in spite of it."
talhatiwana-89119,"Aug 19, 2023",8/10,"I watched this movie and realised what I have watched is a masterpiece. The acting was superb. This movie revolves around dark humour and is a psychological thriller movie. I was quiet astounded by how the roles were being played.!No Spoilers Review!The movie revolves around a dad who is sexually frustrated by his wife and fell in love, sexually, with her daughter's friend. His wife also cheats with her partner. Her daughter falls in love with her new neighbour who is portrayed as a mentally disturbed man but is actually not. These were the main things but I recommend you go watch the movie by yourself.My favourite character in this movie was obviously Lester."

AbandonedRailroadGrade,"Feb 21, 2000",N/A,"Lured by rave reviews and a sexy ad campaign, I was nevertheless expecting not a whole lot from this Big Hollywood tragi-comedic look at a dysfunctional, upper-middle-class suburban family.  I mean, you've got the mild-mannered guy-in-a-suit who's going through a mid-life crisis (Kevin Spacey), the materialistic wife (Annette Benning), the snarling, goth teenage daughter, the sexy blonde cheerleader--stereotypes all, or at least they would have been stereotypes in the hands of a less capable director, screenwriter and cast.  But here, they're modern archetypes. If there had been nothing else to this movie, I would have been amazed and gratified simply on account of the skillful navigation of the fine line between caricature and character.  For instance, I would normally roll my eyes at the simplistic cliche and cheesy humor of a scene where the shallow, materialistic wife pours cold water on an abortive love-making session because she's afraid her husband will spill beer on her $4,000 couch with its Italian fabric.  But here, it makes sense, and the characters' motivations and interactions are believable, and it's even a little sad. And there's the arrogant, vain cheerleader:  In most movies you're expected to despise her without qualification, but here you get a few subtle hints of her underlying isolation and vulnerability that make sympathy possible, in spite of the fact that her character remains basically a prop.  All the characters, lead and supporting, morally ambiguous as well as evil, come out looking human.  While I wish Hollywood could make more movies about ""normal"" people, instead of the privileged suburbanites it identifies most with (maybe American Beauty could have transcended mere excellence and attained immortality if it had been about, say, an auto lube technician married to a receptionist), it seems that the film-makers have deliberately chosen the familiar milieu of a critique of the American Dream to serve as a vehicle for a broader message.  Spacey's family has the big house, the picket fence, the mini-van--but they don't have happiness.  That's the cliche, but this film rises up from 30 or 40 years of cynical cinematic commentary on the soulless emptiness of bourgeois family life to tell us that there is life beyond disillusionment, beyond (and within) the inevitable ugliness around us, and that it has been there all along. It does so in a way that isn't heart-warming in the way we're accustomed to (it has dispensed with sentimentality as well as cynicism, as they are two sides of a coin), but it is hardly cold, and it is touching and thought-provoking."
oOoBarracuda,"Mar 8, 2016",7/10,"Being a big fan of David Lynch, I quite enjoy a movie that is a little ""off"". Having a political science degree, I definitely enjoy a movie that deals with deep issues like society and expectations. Sam Mendes' 1999 Best Picture winner embodies all of the above aspects that I like. About 20 minutes into this film, I was certain I was going to enjoy it. I wasn't wrong.American Beauty highlights one suburban family's struggle with cultivating the normality that is expected of theirs, and every other family in America. The perfect house and lawn, the successful parents with good jobs, the well-adjusted high school teenager. There is just one problem with this picture--it doesn't exist. Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is a real estate agent vying for top spot in her market against a good looking competitor sweeping the field. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) makes a decent living in a job he hates increasingly more with each passing day. Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) is the disillusioned youngest daughter in the house, struggling to fit in at school and eager to start her life. When a run-in with one of Jane's friends sets Lester headlong into a mid- life crisis, each weave of the Burnham family's seemingly perfect life comes unstitched.The overarching theme of this movie deals with the question, what is normal? The fact is, that answer is different for each individual. We see three different variations of normal just in the Burnham's neighborhood, let alone outside their block. Expecting life to come together into the cookie-cutter image you've expected since you were cognizant of your place in the world just isn't reality. Unfortunately, many people don't understand that false reality and attempt, for far too many years of their life, to create what they've always expected. True liberation comes with learning to be yourself. For that reason alone, you should make time for American Beauty. Oh yeah, and Kevin Spacey."
damianphelps,"Sep 29, 2020",7/10,"This movie has a story, it has a support cast, it has music, drama etc etc.This movie IS Kevin Spacey, he steals the story and is fantastic throughout the entire film.I doubt very much that this film would be so revered had another actor played his role?If you are a fan of Kevin Spacey then you are a fan of this film."
mrbenjaminkahn,"Feb 1, 2022",9/10,"What is, and how do you define beauty? Beauty seems to be subjective as people's personal preference differ from person to person. Beauty is however all around us, and you just have to look hard enough to find it, and to appreciate it.American Beauty pitches several people in different stages in life, all trying to find their purpose in life. The ideal is similar for everyone as there is a perceived objective agreeable way in living one's life. The thing is that all the people we meet struggles to find this true way of living one's life, and is therefore stuck portraying a perceived life that looks good on paper, but in reality doesn't work.You can't review this movie without mentioning some of the many symbolic moments in this great film. Take the rose for instance. The rose is a marvel of true beauty given that you view it in a field full of similar flowers. When you isolate one flower, the beautification changes and you find thorns and a more complexity than what is usually perceived when one notices a flowerbed full of roses. The symbolic meaning of the rose is true in that regard, and the same case goes for the people and families we meet in American Beauty.As with the rose, there is so much more to this film than the pebbles. The way in which the movie alternates between stories, while simultaneously keeping a coherent message across all stories is marvellous to watch. The movie likes to change viewpoints while in the middle of a dialog to show us the viewer how the character in display feels. This is one of the main purpose of the character of Ricky.This movie truly has one of the best movie soundtracks of all time. Paul Newman captures the essence of identity and finding purpose excellently and the score gives so much more to this already great movie. As with the score, the cinematography is also excellent. There are simply too many clever camera tricks used to measure everything from power to mood, for me to be able to put them all into this review. However, I want you to pay attention to all the metaphors visualized during the movie.One has to mention the great acting of Kevin Spacey in particular. This is a performance taken to the next level, and it's a well-deserved Oscar for best performance.With a great score, and a marvellous cinematographic directorial vision Sam Mendes has created a masterpiece of a movie and it is astonishing to watch.My score: 93/100."

Go see it--I don't think you'll be sorry.while ALL actors are playing their roles excellent(the plot itself definitely helps with that or at least in how we perceive those as be) i was/am mostly focused on Kevin spacey. here is an example of an actor that has always choose his roles carefully.(his NEW movie as a director ""21"" is the only one kind of disappointing , but hey everyone deserves a ""try"" or 2 right?). in here he resembles so well an ""ordinary"" American and the life( or parts thereof) he might have in the ""suburbs""(same actually could go for the wife, Annette Bening).his whole , new found approach towards life changing resolutions creates situations of pure simplicity, yet generally socially ignored in any over developed consumer society; that is the reason for which the title has ""american"" in it and not ""chinese"" for example. all the characters will make the viewer reflect on past, present, future... and ""tense""..."
alice liddell,"Feb 17, 2000",N/A,"Can I please say, without contravening the IMDb guidelines, that this was a big, big disappointment, especially as the emotional response the film had generated had promised great things.  For about two thirds of its length it works well enough as a rather obvious comedy, but the complacency of the acting, the caricaturing of its female characters, the diffident direction that never masters the hardly original script all disappoint.  This sort of thing has been done with far more perceptively, and with far less pretension by the likes of Hitchcock, Sirk, Lynch or Burton (never mind the extraordinary RUSHMORE).  The next time you've got an astonishing, life-affirming (that's a laugh!  Facing up to adult problems too difficult?!), once in a lifetime film, make sure you do."
honest-abe,"May 1, 2001",1/10,I find it hard to believe that anyone would waste good money in making this type of film. I'm ashamed that this movie is out in the world telling all that this is what an American family is like. I have never met nor seen anything that comes close to anything like the terribly dysfunctional mess that was displayed on screen.
ben-clarke1996,"Nov 28, 2014",9/10,"I've had an account for close to 2 years now and after watching this film I felt the need to write my first review. To sum up 'American Beauty' in one word would be near impossible, Kevin Spacey's portrayal as the sick to death suburban husband and father who's desperately trying to figure out when and where it all went wrong is undoubtedly Oscar worthy on it's own merits, but as we all know Spacey always brings something to the table that others can't offer.He takes us through a journey of mid-life self discovery and is able to accomplish what many forty-something ordinary..unhappy, bored with life husbands and fathers cannot, he's the feeling in your gut, he's the voice in the back of your head, telling you to do it, do what would end the misery and open yourself to the beauty of the world.To watch this film for the first time 15 years after it's release and it still have an effect on the viewer says a lot for the film itself, it is becoming increasingly difficult for anything pre-2000 to stay relevant, especially in this modern mess of a world but 'American Beauty' delves into both adolescent and adult life with the tag line '...look closer' being so subtle yet so pertinent.Coming into a review it is incredibly important to remain objective, but of course if one is writing passionately it may appear subjective, reading a lot of negative reviews about 'American Beauty' it appears one of the main critical points made is that the film is full of cliché's, or is described as one big cliché. It's not hard to see where these opinions come from but it's important to realise that not all great films need to be bursting with taboo matters and subjects, sometimes the simpler stories are the most eye opening...'American Beauty' along side 'Fight Club' in my opinion is one of the most life affirming films that I have had the pleasure of watching, teaching that there's so much beauty in the world, in places and things you would never even think to look twice at, you've just got to be ready, and willing to be in that place, where you've not nothing to lose.To reiterate, 'American Beauty' cannot be summed up in one word, you just have look closer, if you're ready."

mw_ex,"Mar 2, 2012",10/10,"Whether you like it or not, you always watch a movie with an expectation. I didn't know much about this movie, and expected a sleazy and cheap flick about a horny old man. I have to say - I got a lot more than I asked for. I got a movie so filled with life lessons, so rich in so many ways, that I think it spoke to me. I loved the characters in this movie. The one that sees all the beauty in the world. The frustrated middle-aged man that is not happy with his life. The tough guy that does not know how to handle the social situations and problems he and his family is facing. I loved the music. I loved how it told such an important story with at times comedic means. Although I might have preferred a different ending, it still felt right.I don't know if you will like it. You might well hate it. It probably depends on your expectations. I know one thing for sure, though: This movie is the work of spectacular minds. It is a movie for people that like to think. And if you did not think before you started it, I bet you will when you are finished."
davidmetzer,"May 12, 2022",9/10,"American Beauty doesn't have much else to say about the decay of suburbia, but the performances make up for it. Spacey and Bening have never been better and commit to their somewhat unlikable characters. Thomas Newman's moving score is also very memorable."
patrickl-1,"Jun 26, 2002",N/A,"I have this movie on DVD and I watch it over and over again, and Alan Ball and Sam Mendes have shown me the omphh that has been missing in other films for a long time. I subscribe to a lot of the accolades to this film, but I do not think that it deserved Best Picture. It was an excellent film- but not an important one. As a kid, I grew up in suburban Orange County where there was truly a lot more than what seemed. I've seen comments posted that state that all of the ""corruption"" just isn't there: ""fascist, repressed Marine Corps colonels; middle-aged men obsessed with high school girls; drug distribution amongst teenagers; etc."" Well, I have news for those soccer moms who like to live in their hermedically sealed worlds and listen to Celine Dion- ""LOOK CLOSER""! Kevin Spacey deserved Best Actor and Annette Bening was quite impressive as the two-faced housewife. The supporting characters were just as good and this movie never seemed to drag. It is not for everyone: it is unsettling, disturbing and somewhat raw. But a majority of conservative societies don't want the kind of in-your-face dynamic which this movie has. Well, okay. That's why they have movies like ""Stuart Little."""
TheFearmakers,"Oct 29, 2022",6/10,"Rambling, unedited and unprofessional review of AMERICAN BEAUTY, which has not aged well, and it's NOT only because Kevin Spacey and his current problems... yet that's what Hollywood has claimed: Spacey's sexual abuse allegations (against young boys) has made this seem all-too-real (but these are the same people that flew to France to hand Roman Polanski his Oscar, and later signed a petition to get him off from finally facing said rape charges here in America)...Instead, BEAUTY, in deliberately trying to play on cliches, never fully progresses past them for the characters to be fleshed out as actual humans...Especially Annette Bening in what could be the WORST performance in an Oscar winning feature, screaming her lines as a shallow, work-motivated suburban real estate agent yuppie-from-hell as if she were in another movie altogether, or auditioning for an overboard parody of upper middle class families...And she seems created just to make our central hero look cooler and become more sympathetic, but he didn't need help since Spacey is actually quite good, charming, the suburb dad version of the usual ""lovable loser"" herein lusting for his bratty-deep, morbid daughter's sexy blonde friend... And how would his borderline Goth daughter be a cheerleader in the first place?But she has her own admirer, crushed on by the next door neighbor's even more morbid son... And his dad's a Marine who represents what Hollywood hates: An extreme right winger, homophobic, in the military, cold to his wife, abusive to his son, and get this... he's a homosexual and... well let's not spoil the ending...Overall, one of the aspects that inspired other films is the ghostly piano score, mellow, haunting, overly-moving, which you now hear the likes of in every ""important"" film's trailer (it used to be the more upbeat piano theme for Terms of Endearment)...Other than that, AMERICAN BEAUTY stole more from past films (or rather, cliches from past films) than it actually created yet, still, you can't say it isn't entertaining being a fun ride when not trying to be too deep, or too obviously trying to prove a point or agenda...Maybe if it were a more straight-line comedy instead of telling us to Look Closely the audience could judge for themselves what to get out of the story, because, for the most part, the themes are as forced to the viewer as Spacey's character's life was forcing him into the kind of submission he eventually dug his way out of...Yet, maybe... that was the intention all along."
DeeKyuBee,"Apr 27, 2016",9/10,"American Beauty is not overrated. It seems as though every time a movie gets so much praise at the Oscars makes it automatically bad. That's pretty idiotic. I don't get the negative backlash. The themes and characters are still timeless,and still resonates with us. Also, the bullshit about pedophilia gets me wondering why any human being would believe such trolls. I guess you could interpret that however.The movie is about Lester Burnham who is going through a mid-life crisis. He has a controlling wife who always nags at Lester, a rebellious angst driven teenage daughter, a horrible corrupt job, and he falls in love with his daughters friend. As you could probably tell, his life just goes downhill from here.This is one compelling and engaging movie. From the opening scene you are instantly thrown into Lester's life, right down to the explosive finale at the end. I don't think people get how much depth there is in this movie, or maybe they forgot. The movie was highly acclaimed by critics and was nominated for a lot of awards, yet for some reason people started hating on it years after. The movie has a multitude of themes however, from lust, marriage, purpose, motivation, insecurities, being ordinary, and homosexuality. Those are heavy topics, but the film actually has some dark acid wit to it. It's not a particularly depressing film, the characters are very interesting as they go through their own problems.The movie is a masterpiece, it has such a beautiful yet haunting score and the dream sequences were Lester fantasizes about his daughters friend gives symbolism and meaning behind his character. The plastic bag scene I have mixed feelings about, I could understand why they wanted to show it, gives meaning to one of the characters traits, but I thought the delivery was cheesy. The pace is suitably slow, I love the atmosphere of the film and how the film takes its time to flesh out the characters and themes. Sam Mendes does an excellent job at directing making each and every scene stand out.The flaws I have are some questionable scenes. Like when Lester is eavesdropping on his daughter and her friend and they hear something outside, Lester thinks they hear him and loudly runs down stairs. First of all, how did they not hear Lester? They hear one tap on the window but not the loud running just outside their door? Also, like the bag scene there are a lot of heavy handed moments in the movie in terms of acting and throwing symbolism's and metaphor's.Overall, the movie left an impact on me. Lester's mundane routine gets me worried if that stuff will happen to me in the future. Well, it probably will, since I already feel as though I have mid-life existential crisis's. Oh gosh. Anyways watch American Beauty, it holds up and its on Netflix.Score: 9/10"
Geeky Randy,"Oct 16, 2015",6/10,"Tragedy meets melodrama meets the fearless hip '90s, following the Burnham family as they deal with their first-world problems. Lester and Carolyn (Spacey and Bening) are getting older, and both are trying in their own way to hang on to the last moments of what each thinks is the prime of their lives; while their teenage daughter Jane (Birch) is having issues of her own, dealing with finding her identity and not feeling pretty enough next to her ""friend"" Angela (Suvari). Neighboring Fits family (consisting of Bentley, Cooper and Janney) work their way into the mix because the son is stalking Jane. A film that speaks to those who have seen a midlife crisis, and is still entertaining to those who have it to look forward to. Oscar-winner is entertaining right from the get-go, and is an experience as flawless as a rose upon first viewing. However, after you've seen it a few times, the rose begins to wilt, unmasking contradictory characters and inexplicable events that unfold just to appease its themes of confinement, conformity, redemption and sexuality—why does Lester lecture Carolyn about materialism right after HE's the one that bought a Pontiac Firebird? Why didn't writer Ball or director Mendes at least try to make Bening's character slightly redeemable? All the many other questions to raise require spoilers, but the list goes on... Hard to completely hate because it's easy to understand why so many people like it.★★½ (out of four)"
akagb,"Jan 12, 2011",1/10,"American Beauty comes with an aura of dazzlingly positive reviews -- which simply reflects the film critics' thirst for something original, irrespective of quality. There is not much quality to be witnessed in this film: it's not the worst I've seen, but it's one the most annoying movies I've ever seen! This movie was supposed to be looking underneath the surfaces to discover inner beauty. Unfortunately, this is accomplished with such a stunning lack of subtlety that it's shockingly disconcerting. The ""beauty"" is presented by the means of being insultingly obvious and forced, and by giving both teen actresses topless scenes. So we have this: a high-minded philosophical-wannabe movie, which succeeds only as a mediocre softcore flick."
hewhomustnotbenamed985,"May 3, 2016",10/10,"One of the best movies I've seen, probably the best. It has it all, great acting, great director and a magnificent story. I like all of it. Kevin Spacey did a great job acting in this movie, if I may say that this is his greatest performance on screen. Comedy parts of the movie are brilliant, especially the dinner argument I laughed so hard watching that scene. Music on the beginning of the movie is one of the most recognizable soundtracks of all time, I played it over and over again a thousand times. You could watch this movie a thousand times and never get bored of it. This is my very first review so excuse me for this amateur review."
dareelEARTHCHILD,"Mar 4, 2008",10/10,"I found out about this film completely by accident but am so glad I did. I had seen the trailer and was not that convinced, what made me want to watch the film was the amazing soundtrack performed mostly by Thomas Newman.I was completely hooked from the beginning and was not bored for a second. American Beauty really is a masterpiece and probably one of the best films ever to have been made. The film deserves a lot more credit for the storyline and was directed in an amazing way. Everything is perfectly timed and nothing drags along, it all fits together in a graceful yet unique way. The characters are all part of the jigsaw that the story unravels throughout the film to an exciting but shocking consequence.10 out of 10."
BA_Harrison,"Dec 31, 2015",10/10,"Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), 42, has spent years trapped in an unhappy marriage and an unsatisfying job. His relationship with his teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is almost as strained as that with his career-driven realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). When Lester becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), it marks the beginning of a severe mid-life crisis that sees him revisiting the carefree ways of his youth, but at a cost.Full of heart-rending pathos, yet told with an irresistible streak of dark humour, American Beauty is a thoroughly absorbing bittersweet drama, a poignant tale that peels back the layers of suburban life to reveal the pains of growing up and the disappointments of growing old. The big-screen debut of director Sam Mendes, the film boasts superb performances from an incredible ensemble cast (Spacey is particularly great, but no-one puts a foot wrong), excellent cinematography, and wonderful music (both score and soundtrack).10/10: one of the finest films of the 90s and well deserving of its five Oscars."
danfigh,"Sep 23, 2022",9/10,"If you're repulsed by fictional father's infatuation with his daughter's friend, you're no different than his wife complaining about spilling beer on the silk upholstered sofa; the movie has gone over your head. As someone who is a counsellor for sexual abuse survivors in real life, sexual assault of children is far more common by family or family friends than people seem to understand. So this is just being real. Taking issue with a fictional movie is ill-directed; your and society's reluctance to sit with this is and accept systemic issues what makes society so easy for perpetrators to operate within. Anywho, this brings me to the movie. It's refreshingly real and thoroughly enjoyable. I can see why so much was made of it at the time. Acting is wonderful, story brilliantly crafted and darkly funny. Recommended."
jcorey1513,"Apr 10, 2005",N/A,"This has to possibly be one of the greatest.....screenplays of all time. That's right, screenplays. I didn't much care for the movie itself, but I had an edge: before ever seeing the movie, or knowing who the actors in the main roles were, I read the screenplay by Alan Ball - and fell in love. The way it was written, the sheer POETRY of the words, made me want to just sit there and read for the rest of my life. I could physically see the action happening in my head, without even knowing who played the characters, and every single word was just as impactful (if not more) than if I had seen it on the big screen.This is an overall EXCELLENTLY written movie, with an incredible plot line and especially the twisted ending. The music also helps to bring out the true emotions of the film, utilizing every millisecond of the instrumental power provided by the excellent composing skills of Thomas Newman to intensify the raw power of emotion this film possesses. I love the script, I ADORE the soundtrack, and I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever listened to any of Thomas Newman's work, or seen any of Alan Ball's scripts."
CinemaSerf,"Jan 7, 2023",7/10,"Despite all the plaudits - including 5 Oscars, 6 BAFTAs and 3 Golden Globes - I didn't love this film. It focuses on the trials and tribulations of ostensibly happy, humdrum daily life with all of the idiosyncrasies engendered by the bored, frustrated and jealous people whose lives are pretty empty of meaningful experiences from day to day. I struggled from the outset to see why anyone would be besotted with the rather skeletal ""Angela"" (Mena Suvari); perhaps that is what makes Kevin Spacey's performance so appreciable as the pretty unlikeable voyeur (""Lester""). Are we supposed to like him; sympathise with him, hate him - all of those? I didn't know - and I don't suppose that I really bothered much either. His self-induced mid-life crisis was rather tedious as a storyline, regardless of the actor's (superb) quality of character delivery. Clearly Sam Mendes had a vision for this - but like life itself, it is all over the place. By the time we get to the repressed gay aspects of ""Lester"" and the shame/depression and brutality that it appears to evoke from his thoroughly flawed personality I needed to come up for air... Without a doubt it is a well constructed piece of cinema, but the underlying complexities are so convoluted as to render it little more than an over-long sad indictment of American suburban existence where all human life appears to exist within one single street..."
PCC0921,"Oct 13, 2020",9/10,"In an interesting shout-out to Sunset Boulevard (1950), you, the audience, already know the fate of the main character, Lester Burnham, played wonderfully by Kevin Spacey, as soon as the beginning credits to American Beauty (1999), are over. This is an excellent film. The best film from 1999. It is well worth, the Best Picture Oscar, that it won from the Academy that year. The plot of the film is a great exploration of life and the hang-ups, that accompany life, into old age. Lester is a clown, who is 43, but a person we can all relate to, especially if you are well into middle-age. Many taboos are covered in American Beauty (1999), and may be difficult for some sensitive viewers to watch.Sensitive issues are covered, like voyeurism, that is practiced by the boyfriend of Lester's daughter, Jane (Thora Birch). Then, a relationship begins to develop between Lester and a young, out-going, 17-year old girl, named Angela (Mena Suvari). Angela is a friend of Jane's from school. There also are moments, that explore homosexuality, which changes the direction of the film, at the most unlikely time. It is a crazy script, that explores the human personae, in all of its forms. Chris Cooper plays a tormented father, known as Colonel Fitts, who has no real idea, who he really is. His flirtations with his sexuality and his faith, has driven him to a boiling point. American Beauty (1999), is a great examination of the consequences, resulting from, the misinterpretation of different feelings. It is an excellent commentary on the mid-life-crisis phenomenon, that all of us have. American Beauty (1999), also travels along, with its tough, mature, sensitive story, with a wonderful music soundtrack.PMTM Grade: 9.2 (A-) = 9 IMDB."
Erik_Surewaard,"Sep 3, 2022",9/10,"Unexpected, raw, unique, flawless, art... just a few words that come to mind after watching this movie. I didn't expect that this movie would the THIS good.When I read the title, I originally thought that this movie would be about horses. I must have mistaken myself with the movie ""Black Beauty"". But after watching ""American Beauty"", the color black has some meaning. Because black stands for dark... and for certain it can be said that ""American Beauty"" is a dark movie!But OMG, it is so good. The acting of every one of the actors is just outstanding! Each one of them could have easily deserves an Academy Award.I can not give a bad comment about this movie. It easily deserves 9 stars."
SeanPennModernPowerhouse,"Oct 26, 2004",10/10,"I think that it's safe to say that American Beauty and M. Night Shyamalan's supernatural-thriller The Sixth Sense were definity the sleeper hits of 1999.Here Kevin Spacey shows the amazing form that he's been showing for the last ten years, in films like The Life of David Gale, K-PAX, Pay it Forward, L.A. Conifedencial and Swimming With Sharks. It's also funny that this is called an American Classic when the director, Sam Mendez (Road to Perdition), is in fact English.Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a loser who hates his wife (Annette Benning- The Grifters, Mars Attacks) and whose daughter (Thora Birch- Patroit Games, Ghost World) hates him, whose life changes when he black mails his boss, falls for his daughters best friend (Mena Suvari- Atomic Train, American Pie 1 & 2, The Musketeer) and is introduced to the world of drugs by his neighbour (Wes Bentley).I know wrote in a previous review that I see ""To End All Wars as better film-making triumph"" and I still stand by that, but you just can't help but to be drawn in to this wonderful movie by the amazing Academy Award winning combination of Alan Ball's screenplay, Mendez's direction and Spacey performance."
DTL,"Sep 25, 1999",10/10,"A definite addition to my Ten Best List for 1999,  is AMERICAN BEAUTY which is sure to earn Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning  (robbed in the past for her work in BUGSY and THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT),  and Alan Ball (most original screenplay to come along in awhile), Oscar nominations. It is the story of what suburban life and the pursuit of the American Dream can do to an American Family. But unlike the critic's darling from a few years ago ICE STORM, which left me freezing, this film is genuinely funny and moving at the same time. The ideas projected by director Sam Mendes literally leap off the screen.  Spacey's edgy performance as the ad exec pushed over the brink by the pressures of having to have it all and his passion for ""The American Beauty""  he missed when he was young enough to enjoy it, offer a visual feast.  Annette Benning as the Queen of suburbia, Spacey's wife, is  a sort sexy, gorgeous, Martha Stewart gone mad, convinced if she has just one more motivational seminar she will reach nirvana.  She is in a word ""wonderful."" The boy next door is sort of cross between Timothy Hutton in ORDINARY PEOPLE and Benjamin in THE GRADUATE.  He deals drugs, observes life around him through a video camera and convinces almost everyone that he is the straight arrow next door.  We know immediately, that like everyone else in this movie, he is not as he appears.  AMERICAN BEAUTY peals away, layer by layer, this oh so imperfect world of suburbia and those in denial who live there. If you have already seen NOTTING HILL you NEED to see AMERICAN BEAUTY."
kcasmey81,"Mar 5, 2008",10/10,"This movie is probably one of the greatest I've seen in my entire life. Every character in this movie plays his/her role phenomenal. A movie like this doesn't come around every so often. This movie deserved every academy award that it won (but it did deserve more.) Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham. This is probably one of the greatest acting performances in history. If you saw the movie then you would realize why I say this.The movie has a very dark tone about it. The theme of this movie goes much deeper than you realize, and explains how beautiful and how bad life could be.From Start to finish this is a masterpiece and I strongly recommend it. 10/10"
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Aug 5, 2000",N/A,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsAmerican Beauty follows pretty much in the outline of Fight Club,the best film I have seen in a very long time,in it's themes about commercial fulfillment,the barriers constricting the boredom of life,and human emptieness.The best scene to reflect this I found in here was when the films main charecter Lester,played by Kevin Spacey,has a go at his wife after she makes a quip to him about not spilling any of his beer on an expensive new sofa she's got.This scene quite brilliantly reflects how the commercial value of our possessions has become our main cause for concern,rather than concern for each other. Or maybe this is just the suburban situation in America.Whatever the wake up call was aimed at,whoever it's targeted towards ought to take note.Though the main character is initially seeming quite intent to accept his boring life,we learn that underneath the kind of easy going exterior he puts on,a lot of people are actually taking advantage of him,his boss,his colleagues,his daughter,his wife.This movie remarkably portrays how glamourous and satisfying breaking free from a constraint on your life can be.Aside from the main character, all of the other characters are pretty sad cases as well.His wife is a self obsessed,over expectant career woman,who only gets sad about what's bothering her.His daughter is a distant,stubborn teenager ,who does'nt give any clear indication of what she wants.Her friend is a narrow minded,pretentious,and stupid slapper,who prides herself on how sexually explicit her shenanigans with other men are.And as for the new neighbours,well.....................perfect example of how American families are supposedly losing the ability to communicate,understand,love,and,heck,even know each other.This film perfectly captures you in each of these shallow people's miserable lives,and gets you caring about their various outcomes.All the performances are,obviously,excellent,and Sam Mendes provides unique,insightful direction into a film which requires these new touches.Overall,having seen it,I'm glad American Beauty won all the oscars it did.For once,they gave them to a film that truly deserved it.*****"
gufi-04429,"Mar 16, 2019",6/10,"Everything in this movie is either very good or very bad. First, the acting game - Kevin's performance was excellent but I didn't like Bentley's and Bening's interpretations.
Second, I suppose the movie was trying to be deep and meaningful and in some scenes it really was but the rest was just plain moments full of hipocrisy.
But let's end with the best thing about the movie - the cinematography was just something else, it catched my eye from the beginning. So congratulations to that!"
Zeke-36,"Sep 5, 1999",10/10,"This has to be one of the, if not the best films I have ever seen. The performances by Spacey, Bening, Birch, and all the other actors were amazing. They will all be hopefully remembered at awards time. The thing that makes this movie so great is not only the stellar cast, but also the truthful and solid writting. This film was superb, and it will be remembered as one of the best films ever made."
twalker,"Mar 31, 2000",5/10,Number 2 on the IMDB list of all time best movies? Academy Awards out the wazoo? Frankly I expected MUCH more out of this movie. It was good. But JUST good. Many parts were downright vulgar and offensive. I saw it with my wife so it wasn't a problem but I would strongly caution against seeing this movie in mixed company. The very first scene involves Lester (Kevin Spacey) masturbating in the shower.I don't see what the big deal is about this movie. I have seen all of these actors do much better in other roles so it isn't the acting. The story is pretty good but it is not Oscar caliber in my opinion. This is simply a movie that attempts to be deep and intellectual and full of hidden meaning and symbolism. It misses the mark in my opinion. I give it a 5 out of 10.
heathershock,"Apr 7, 2005",10/10,"I'm not good in writing critics,i just wanted to say that this is definitely one of the best movies I ever saw.And I feel very lucky to know that it touched me, and reminded me of things I knew already but were hidden inside.The choice of the actors is also a big plus in this movie,they're all excellent.Anette's Benning was really impressing for me,I actually never pictured her in such a roll,but she was really brilliant.Nothing else I could add about Kevin Spacey...WOW! Sad to know,(like the first person to comment this movie said),that there's people who wouldn't watch this movie cause ""I would never watch a movie with a title like that"". How blind are we.P.S:Awesome the plastic bag scene :-)"
Adrian-32,"Oct 10, 1999",10/10,"Watching ""American Beauty"" is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order. This is not your average social commentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand, this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly ""perfect"" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if everyone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand, ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow. ""American Beauty"" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of beauty fused with violence and tragedy, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the main thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new realms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch also showcase excellent performances. A truly remarkable film."
jacobjohansson-50807,"Jun 4, 2022",10/10,"Once I saw this as a parody of grownups or something. Then you get older, watch it again and realize that American Beauty IS LIFE, with all the questions, fear, boredom, crisis and everything life will bring you.Absolutely amazing. Phenomenal acting. Great story, dark and insanely funny! One of the best movies ever - and what made Kevin Spacey my favorite actor of all time."
Z-Dawg,"Oct 10, 1999",10/10,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This movie was one of the funniest yet most disturbing movies I have seen in a long time.  Kevin Spacey gives what may be his best performance  (yes, I thought he was better in this than the Usual Suspects).  The directing was top notch and all the other acting was terrific.  I think this movie paints a good picture as to who we are as people. Not everyone in this world is a perfect, good looking person, and this movie plays on that notion.  Everyone should go see American Beauty."
sammylovescarrots,"Apr 11, 2022",10/10,The imdb description doesn't even skim the surface of what this film is really about.The plot twists are next to none. Nothing is predictable and everything makes you think something you may never have considered before. The deep meaning cast into this story is incredible. A must watch film in everyone's lifetime.
asda-man,"Nov 6, 2012",10/10,"The first time I saw ""American Beauty"" was when I was around 8 years old so it's a hazy memory. Unfortunately I had to go to bed about 40 minutes in, but some scenes have stayed with me since (I'm 17 now). The second time I saw American Beauty was on the eve of my blonde friend's birthday party (I must've been around 15) and I was totally gripped. Unfortunately I had to force myself to bed as it was on late, and left 40 minutes in, in order to be awake-looking for the early morning start the next day. Yesterday, I finally got the chance to see American Beauty the whole way through. And it was amazing.Those first 40 minutes hadn't really left my head before. They were just absolutely gripping, full of incredible visuals, cinematography and absorbing writing and character development. Thankfully, the rest of the film doesn't disappoint either and accumulates to being one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I wasn't expecting to give it a perfect 10, as I only reserve that for the most special films, but this really is an incredible and outstanding film. It thoroughly deserves its best picture award!What makes American Beauty works is its well-observed characters. At the centre of the film we've got Lester Burnham, who is fantastically played by Kevin Spacey (another throughly deserving award winner) and is going through a mid-life crisis. We can highly sympathise with him and his childish rebellion. You feel sorry for him and his loveless marriage, his ill relationship with his daughter and unforgiving job. You're almost rooting for him when he rebells. However, his acutely observed character is also wonderfully flawed by taking drugs and having vivid fantasies about his daughter's which are beautifully filmed.The other characters are also as gripping and never shunned. We've got his controlling wife, also going through a mid-life breakdown, his moody daughter and her sexy friend as well as the weird family who've moved in next door, with their strange son and awful army dad. The film would need very little plot at all to keep it entertaining as all the characters are memorable and well-crafted, which means American Beauty never has a dull moment. Right from the startling opening, which confesses that Lester is going to die, the film never loses its grip on the audience as we're all in suspense as to who kills Lester and why!The playful screenplay by Alan Ball is incredible. It's also philosophical and very deep at times, as well as being consistently gripping and entertaining. There are some hilarious moments as well as some emotional and touching ones. As flawless as the script is the directing by Kate Winslet's ex. There is some breath-taking cinematography and striking visuals which add fuel to the already high burning fire. About every single shot is perfectly framed, making the film even more involving and seductive. American Beauty felt hypnotic at times, sucking you into the world of the film like Black Swan and The Artist achieved so memorably.American Beauty builds up to an incredibly powerful and emotionally-charged ending. Bringing together all the characters and leaving some ambiguity, so we don't feel at all patronised. Lester's final narration is very touching, memorable and rounds the film off perfectly. American Beauty is an amazing achievement in film-making. It's a beautifully observed drama about family life and the baggage which comes with it. There's great use of humour, superb writing, Oscar-worthy acting and sensational directing. American Beauty is the full package and is quite simply one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It was worth the 9 year wait!"
J-Crew,"Jan 13, 2000",N/A,"A transcendant, beautiful film about suburban decay circa late 1990s. Dark comedy mixes wonderfully well with serious drama, creating a dreamy though realistic narrative sprinkled liberally with fantasy. Spacey has never been better; his range and delivery are amazing. Equally deft supporting work from Bening, Suvari, and Cooper, with Birch and Bentley creating a lovely, nuanced young couple that is rooted in their individual and collective uniqueness. A fiercely strong debut for director Mendes."
i_2fine,"Apr 16, 2000",6/10,"The film American Beauty is set on morals that are low. I being a christian am offended by the content in the film and how it is presented. I can understand its purpose, though. A bag flying in the wind, and just wanting us to look closer at the beauty that surrounds us. I being a huge fan of the cinema am not a huge fan of the film American Beauty. The material in this movie makes it stand out, and I understand that some teenagers set low standards in their life, but does Hollywood itself have to pick this for the Best film of the year? The Cider House Rules is very artsy, and The Green Mile is spectacular. So are the Insider and The Sixth Sense, but of the 5 nominees the way the world is going we act like we have no choice but to pick the nastiest. This film is very poor, its entire topic is about sex and immorality, cheating on your spouse, and so many other problems that America has now days so why joke about it in the movies. We need to start caring about what the children need and need not to be exposed to. I think this film has some good qualities in acting but come on, used to it was not dignified to even talk about things like that. And, now, our entire aspect to be living is to see how naughty we look like. What today needs more of is honest hardworking people who have other business to take care of, Hollywood here me through you know although this isn't your real lives you don't have to act it out knowing that you are the ones who influence the American people. Please set higher standards when Jesus comes back to claim all of the good souls that worshiped him and obeyed his word, don't you want to be one of those? Please lets get on the ball and quit polluting our mind with garbage. Thankyou for your time. - P.F., High School Student"
JackRJosie,"Sep 25, 2024",8/10,Ok so i was genuinely surprised about this film. I walked into it knowing it was a moral conundrum for me. Like really... the whole concept of this film is just an unjustifiable ethical nightmare. So much of this film is... but by the end of it I really came around. I grew to appreciate its theme and messaging about life. The last 30 minutes were masterful storytelling that pulled together some beautiful messages.I don't have a lot more to say... it was kinda creepy. But obviously very well done. Um... Kevin spacey is not a vibe. Uhhhh I watched it on an airplane I wish I didn't do that. For like a lot of reasons.
daoldiges,"Dec 12, 2022",7/10,"American Beauty made quite a splash during its original release but to many of its early admirers it has not aged all that well. I generally liked it as a flawed film initially and feel the same today. I think many of the characters are a little too broadly drawn for sure. I also think it feels rather uneven throughout. Despite these considerable flaws there is still quite a it to enjoy if you just give in and go with what it is offering. Not particularly original subjective wise, it still does take on and a lot of issues and topics most people can relate and take interest in and it does tell it in its own, flawed way. I think American Beauty os still worth checking out."
Professional_Reviewer,"Jun 5, 2021",9/10,"At first american beauty seems to be a little too simple for its own good, but Alan Ball with the help of Sam Mendes delivers a very thought provoking screenplay and gives the movie a soul like no other. Beauty truly lives everywhere and sometimes we are too shallow to see it. Thomas Newman once again proves why he is a staple in the music department of cinema with a truly mesmerizing soundtrack. All actors deliver a powerfull perfomance and accomplish a very accurate represention of many human's insecurities, elevating the quality of this movie even further."
DavidSaryan,"Jun 21, 2023",10/10,"Complex Characters: The film offers characters who are multi-dimensional and deeply flawed, allowing audiences to connect with them on a human level. The characters' struggles with their own dissatisfaction, their desires for something more, and their inner turmoils are effectively explored, making them relatable and compelling.Stellar Performances: Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening's performances are unforgettable. Spacey, who plays Lester Burnham, a man going through a mid-life crisis, delivers a nuanced performance that earned him an Academy Award. Bening's portrayal of Carolyn, Lester's wife, grappling with her own ambitions and disillusionments, is equally praiseworthy.Visual Storytelling: Mendes' use of symbolism and visual storytelling adds another layer of depth to the narrative. The iconic imagery of the plastic bag dancing in the wind has been widely discussed and interpreted. The film's cinematography is both beautiful and thought-provoking, presenting suburban life in a new and evocative light.Theme Exploration: ""American Beauty"" explores a range of themes, including the search for happiness, the existential crisis, the critique of materialism, and the façade of the perfect suburban life. These themes resonate with many viewers because they deal with universal human experiences.Provocative and Bold Storytelling: The film doesn't shy away from addressing controversial subjects such as infidelity, drug use, and the sexual awakening of teenagers. This bold storytelling style makes the film daring and distinct.Screenplay: Alan Ball's Oscar-winning screenplay is sharp, witty, and layered. It provides a delicate balance of drama, humor, and tragedy, presenting a well-rounded narrative that keeps audiences engaged from beginning to end.Original Score: The musical score by Thomas Newman is another highlight of the film. It complements the visuals perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes.In summary, ""American Beauty"" is a great film because of its rich, complex characters, its exploration of universal themes, its stunning visual storytelling, and its memorable performances. It continues to be studied and appreciated for its depth and sophistication, making it a classic in American cinema."
helagruszczynska,"Aug 1, 2022",10/10,"To be honest Jane and Ricky story made me feel like the movie was kinda going into obvious direction - a teenage movie about some rebels from the 90s. But the main plot completely blowed my mind. Perfect acting of Mena and Kevin. Perfect scenes of director and screenwriter. The senses, I felt that!And another tbh section: maybe I'm just not too mature for that but he didn't had to do it in his bed... It makes film little disgusting (now you can't watch it with parents without feeling awkward) and shows what doesn't really have to happen if someone is crazy in love."
dobbythefreeelf,"Aug 2, 2022",10/10,"Ngl this one is a straight up masterpiece, a kind on movie that makes you think days after you watch it with a pit in your stomach, a psychological drama about the mundane American lifestyle, it's slow-paced and calm until it stabs you in the anus and demands your attention."
xdisney,"Sep 25, 1999",N/A,"I am Lester Burnham. Well, I'm 42 and I've been married for 15 years. I don't think one has to see themselves in this film to appreciate it, but how can I know?One comment I'd like to make as a reader of books about writing--American Beauty is a model for how to take derivative concepts, or specific textbook instructions, and make a unique mix that is art for the ages. The film owes much to ""Sex, Lies and Videotape""; some to ""Ordinary People"" and ""The Ice Storm."" Others have pointed out that the ""from beyond the grave"" narration is not original. Every book on dramatic writing quotes Tolstoy: ""If there is a gun hanging on the wall in Act One, it had better be fired by the end of Act Two."" And yet this particular blending of these ideas is new. If you've ever tried to create a story or a song and you became frustrated that you were just borrowing ideas, perhaps you'll understand why American Beauty is such a role model for me.It's hard not to become more introspective and more honest with yourself after seeing this movie and I think that makes it great."

Although I wouldn't say it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, it left its marks on me.The story about an ordinary American family in an ordinary American suburb with ordinary American jobs, whose whole life turns upside down, when the father, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), falls in love with the beautiful friend (Mena Suvari) of his daughter Jane (Thora Birch), therefore recognizes his rotten life and tries to change it, plays with the idea of the American Dream and uncovers its unreality.When Lester masturbates in the shower (and the marital bed!), when his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) totally freaks out, because she's not able to sell a house (real estate!) and their daughter Janes only problem is how to get enough money for a boob job, everyone starts to think about the ""behind the scenes"" of every all-so-lovely, perfect, suburban family. This is probably what director Sam Mendes intention was, when he exaggerated both camera work and dialogs. Because when the neighbors's boy Ricky (Wes Bentley) starts to philosophise about the beauty of a plastic bag dancing with the wind, it's on the edge between craziness and truth. But by using this concept for the whole film Mendes created a worth seeing spectacle, fitting every film evening."
mattlx,"Jul 19, 2023",10/10,"The movie presents a scathing critique of American suburban life, delving into themes of beauty, dissatisfaction, and the search for meaning in a seemingly perfect but ultimately flawed society.Despite the controversy surrounding Kevin Spacey, his performance in ""American Beauty"" remains a shining example of his skill as an actor. He immerses himself fully in the character of Lester Burnham, leaving an indelible mark on the film and solidifying his place as one of the finest actors of his generation.The film's strength lies in its ability to expose the hidden darkness and emptiness lurking beneath the surface of suburban life. However, some plot developments may feel contrived or melodramatic, taking away from the overall impact of the story."
TheVivs-1,"Jul 23, 2025",7/10,"I loved the ending. It was great. I love how each of the stories tie up, but not in the way you'd exactly expect. HATED the soundtrack though. The repetitive 90s and early 2000s marimba sample has always annoyed me if I'm being completely honest. I loved the dialogue, but some of the line deliveries could have been somewhat better. Some of the line deliveries were absolutely amazing. Others felt like listening to a table read. Great movie!!"
evanston_dad,"Jun 28, 2010",3/10,"Sam Mendes' entire film career has consisted of woefully misguided attempts to dissect the many ills of American culture without remotely understanding them. Perhaps he should spend some time slinging his arrows at Britain's problems before jumping across the pond.""American Beauty"" is a movie about American suburban malaise set in a version of suburban America that simply doesn't exist. Its characters are either gross and grotesque caricatures or mere vessels for regurgitating Alan Ball's pretentious screenplay, forced to utter lines that never sound like things people would actually say. Kevin Spacey gives the consummate Spacey performance -- one-note snideness delivered in a sardonic monotone -- that he gives every time he's in front of a camera, while poor Annette Bening is unwatchable in a frenzied performance that I have to believe was forced on her by the director, since she's never again been as bad, either before or since. The worst of the film's dialogue is reserved for all of the angst-filled teenagers, and most conspicuously for Wes Bentley, a tortured and philosophic youth who reads a ridiculous soliloquy about the beauty to be found in a plastic bag as if he's reciting Shakespeare.The film has a weird preoccupation with homosexuality that doesn't really fit and makes itself most manifest in the character of Chris Cooper, a closeted ex-serviceman who, true to the film's form, is depicted as a goulish representative of conservative America.What is the point you ask of all this glib satire? Hell if I know.Grade: D"
Eskisehirlii,"Apr 30, 2023",9/10,The film is based on people using masks out at the real world in order to hide their true selves. Everybody being able to find something in each character from themselves creates excellence. All characters are thoughtfully written and magnificently played by the actresses and actors. The story represents the society so well that it gave me a thought that this story might have actually happened somewhere out in the World. The movie completes its mission on giving you various kinds of thoughts about how the society really works. You will most definitely find yourself questioning the society you live in after you have finished the movie. Angela Hayes <3.
arthur-47372,"Jul 30, 2023",10/10,"This is the best movie! I watched it when I was 17-18 years old, and I honestly didn't understand anything at that time. But now, at the age of 22, life somehow brought me back to this movie. During the second viewing, tears welled up in my eyes, and it has become my absolute favorite movie.Whenever I feel lonely or something is wrong, I always find solace in this masterpiece. The movie holds profound meaning for me. I cannot fully explain it, but it is incredibly beautiful and spiritual. It has genuinely changed my life.The characters feel so real that anyone can easily relate to them. I highly recommend it to everyone, regardless of whether it's considered a classic or not. Give this movie a chance; it's worth it!"
LarriMM,"Apr 26, 2021",10/10,"Just a mesmerizing movie! (It is not what to expect from the title alone!)The cinematography, pacing and character development is on point, as you follow regular urban families waking up from a tired routine of everyday life. It sets you in trance as the gentle pianos and ambient spheres lingers softly in your ear. Yet it wakes you up with conflict and character development to keep things interesting. It reminds you to appreciate the world for what the world is, both in its darkest and lightest moments.All and all, a philosophical yet comically relatable, movie about the beauty in life. If that sounds good to you, give this movie a go!"

jonestobias-08093,"Jul 17, 2018",N/A,"How good is American Beauty? Well, it depends on how emotionally you enjoy being drained. Also, I feel this movie is massively overrated because the whole disjointed dysfunctional family aspect is way overplayed. I could not take Spacey seriously as a character- why did he start smoking pot and working out, suddenly? Why is the wife unhappy and if they are unhappy than why not get a divorce? Despite 1999 being one of the best year for American Cinema I can't believe this one won all the awards and accolades. Regardless, you can judge for yourself but in my opinion American Beauty has not aged well at all."
charchuk,"Apr 26, 2007",6/10,"The story and characters have some issues, mostly to do with subplots and motivations, but the film is of such high quality that one is in awe while watching it. Pitch-perfect dialogue, superb acting, and outstanding technical aspects. The story's a bit abstract but I really liked it. Kevin Spacey gives perhaps his best performance and Annette Bening is just as good. The kids aren't the typical annoying teenagers - probably because the actors are twentysomethings, not teens - and feel completely natural in these roles. Superb direction from Mendes and some great cinematography. Very funny at times, and quite sad at the end. Definitely a worthy Best Picture winner, even though it's only about fourth best from the great movie year of 1999."
kindofblue-78221,"Jul 25, 2023",10/10,What's so disturbing about this film?Is it because of the film itself of is it because it accurately depicts the world we and the majority of people in countries like the USA and UK?Sadly the world is even more like this film now than it was then.I see so many of the characters seen in this film in the real world. They live inside insular worlds where money and status is God.Community is dead in this film.Just as it is in the real world.The production values of this film are of the highest standard.It's a masterpiece of direction and acting.Maybe It's disturbing because it shows the world as it is and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.Its disturbing for me because there's absolutely nothing I can do about the selfish world we live in.Sadly American Beauty isn't just a film.American beauty is our present. Heaven help us for the future.
itamarscomix,"Sep 23, 2011",7/10,"Re-watching American Beauty 11 years later, I must admit, I was somewhat underwhelmed. The impact it had on first viewing didn't quite last. The film was praised for its deconstruction of the American dream and portrayal of the dark undertones of suburban life, but the fact is that was done more powerfully in Todd Solondz's movies, and American Beauty just doesn't seem very shocking - maybe it was more so in the 90's, I'm not sure. As a drama, though, it's still very powerful, and the characters are compelling, lovable and despicable at once, and it does a very good job of making the viewers care about them - in complete contrast with Happiness, with deliberately keeps a wall of coldness and distance. The wonderful acting helps, especially from Thora Birch, who at that point had the potential to become one of the greatest actresses of the new millennium.At the time of its release American Beauty was hailed as a masterpiece - it doesn't quite seem like one now. Rather, it's a good drama with some fantastic directorial work and some truly great moments, and a very humble movie at that. The fact that I don't consider it one of the top films of the 90's doesn't change the fact that its Best Picture Oscar was one of the best and gutsiest choices the Academy made that decade."
michaelclamp,"Sep 12, 2020",1/10,It feels like everyone raves about this movie. Well I just don't like it. It's creepy and weird.
markmorris-68595,"Apr 25, 2023",10/10,"It's difficult to say anything about American Beauty. It's about life, but using the word life causes so many associations to take place in our heads. I'm talking about raw life - as in how nothing really matters, and at the same time, everything matters. I wish these stupid words could express how I feel. I feel silly about putting any of this into words.This movie should be watched with your soul. There shouldn't be any judgments of any of it. Your mind needs to be quiet.I first saw it when I was maybe 20, and of course, I loved it, and of course, I had so many ideas about it. I could have told you about the cultural and social themes. The judgments of each character I had but now I understand that we shouldn't be judging any of them. With one exception if you'll permit me. And that's the character named Ricky Fitts. The first time I watched it, I thought he was creepy and weird. Now I'm 32 and can see he is the only person in the film with any clarity. Much like at the end of Fight Club, when Tyler looks at Tyler and says, ""My eyes are open,"" and puts the gun in his mouth, Ricky is ""enlightened?"" He's living with his eyes open. I don't want to make this all about Ricky, but I'd like to be like him someday.This movie is on the very short list of perfect films. Each character is a caricature of so many of us of how we lose ourselves. We lose ourselves in the eyes of others and their expectations. We miss the beauty. The monolog at the end sums up all we should ever feel - grateful."
RenoirSoda,"May 25, 2020",8/10,"The film ""American Beauty"" expresses the meaning of life and the search for beauty through different problems faced by two generations.

kaaffilm,"Mar 28, 2023",10/10,"""American Beauty"" (1999) is a masterpiece that explores the complex nature of human relationships and the facade of suburban life. Directed by Sam Mendes, this film features Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man who is unhappy with his life and starts to rebel against societal norms. The film is filled with powerful performances, stunning cinematography, and a hauntingly beautiful score.The film's strength lies in its ability to delve deep into the psyche of each character, revealing their hidden desires and flaws. Lester's transformation is both captivating and relatable, as he learns to break free from the monotony of his life and embrace the beauty of the world around him. The supporting cast, including Annette Bening and Thora Birch, also deliver standout performances that add depth to the film's themes.The film's visuals are equally impressive, with stunning camera work that captures the essence of suburbia and its inhabitants. The use of color and lighting effectively enhances the mood of each scene, adding to the film's overall impact. The score by Thomas Newman is also a standout, with hauntingly beautiful melodies that perfectly capture the film's themes.""American Beauty"" is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. Its exploration of the human condition and the search for happiness and meaning in life is both poignant and thought-provoking. It is a true masterpiece of cinema that will continue to be celebrated for years to come."
lings-36674,"Jun 13, 2020",8/10,"When your life is clearly defined as narrow and low-level, under such a huge humiliation, I don't see compassion.

yaseminturkish,"Apr 17, 2002",7/10,"When I go to the movies and see a film from the American family genre I expect that it's going to give me a slice of the current reality of family values.  Nice try American Beauty but your shoes cannot fill the likes of Ordinary People.  The fact is that Ordinary People existed long before Terms of Endearment, The Ice Storm, and American Beauty and it got everything right.  It was real.  I can see how some families play favorites and suffer the ramifications of a child's death so much that they forget that they still have a son who is alive and well and dying for attention.  That said American Beauty exists as a trifle that achieves some level of greatness but is far too unrealistic to be considered 20 years from now.Consider how Lester Burnham is a pediophile who loves to get naked in his garage while he lifts his weights.  Consider how he gives a long and strange speech about oral sex to his boss to get severance pay and then winds up working at a fast food restaurant.  Does this remind you of your father?  Or for that matter how Annette Bening is a materialistic mother who would rather have her Italian sofa for all of her ""future guests"" to see than accept her husband's long awaited advances.  Huh?  Did I miss something? There is nothing American or human for that matter about these characters. They are lifeless and soulless and they exist only as cartoons.  Their actions make no sense.When you take the time to rent Ordinary People you see a slice of the reality of the American family.  Donald Sutherland is a tax attorney who allows his son to make mistakes along the way but never ever gives up on him.  Aren't the majority of baby-boomer fathers like that?  Mary Tyler Moore plays Beth Jarrett as one of the coldest and meanest mothers ever to grace cinema.  She plays favorites with her boys and leaves all of her love in the grave with her deceased son.  Don't a lot of parents who have lost children behave as though a part of them died as well?American Beauty achieves something unique but it's not something I'll be pondering 20 years down the road.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant with his role but you can truly tell that he was trying to make human a man who simply wasn't written as anything more than a caricature.  Annette Bening over-acts throughout the film and she simply doesn't know that we get it already, your a selfish and psychotic shrew!  The cinematography is excellent though I often ask myself how many roses died before this film was considered a wrap. Thora Birch proves here and later in Ghost World that she can act with the best of them.  American Beauty does entertain and there is never a dull moment.  Does it matter and is it memorable though in the long term?8/10"
SUNIL-A-DASWANEY,"Mar 16, 2022",8/10,"An excellent movie with everything great about it be it the direction,acting,screenplay or editing! This is one of Kevin Spacey's best performances/movies.8/10."
pjstudent,"Apr 15, 2002",7/10,"I think this movie tries to be more ambitious than it actually is.  ""Look closer?""  That's supposed to be the tagline.  Okay, well then what does the movie do to actually look closer.  It sets about portraying every cliche that's ever been done in movies before, and it can't even make the movie happy.  Or am I the one who is missing something.  It's not supposed to be happy because it's supposed to be like real life.  Well if this movie is anything like real life than I don't know what country I've been living in for the last eighteen years.The father realizes he hates his job and that it is getting him no where, so he quits and works at a fast food restaurant?  The mother can't sell a house, so she sleeps with the guy who can--that's never been done before. The daughter is recluse and attracted to the boy who is even more recluse--again, I can't think of movies like that.  The neighbor is homophobic and turns out to be homosexual--my God, what a coincidence!If there's anything this movie had to say about the American family it is that we've seen this family hundreds of times before.  Read a book, like Lie Down in Darkness.  It's essentially the same story but much more realistic.The best movie of 1999 was The Insider, far and away, no competition. There is no question as to which one is more important and relevant between the two."
dome_gallo,"Nov 6, 2020",10/10,"This movie has changed my life and the way I look the world around me. Every time I watch it I discover something new and I appreciate it more. It will never be enough.

SimonD1900,"Mar 22, 2021",8/10,"Great performance by Spacey, perhaps he's just playing himself in a way? Amazing performances all around really! Indeed. Cinematic masterpiece also. Great use of colors. The music is perfect as well.Everyday normal life, can look ""perfect"" on the surface. But be a living hell. For those people trapped in mondane unfulfilling lives. In a subtle but clear way, we see how the characters are victims to themselves. The characters live their life like they're inside invisible cages.It's so very depressing, even disturbing, like a sort of psychological horror. More so because it's also relatable to so many.All the characters starts on their own personal journey, to in their own way, break free from this ""prison."" They need different things and go about this change in different ways. But all these different characters-progression blend together beautifully and comes to a compelling and satisfying climax.I think this movie truly is beautiful but also scary. It's very depressing. A sort of cautionary tale of how you can die before you die, if you let your life become a routine and deny everything inside you that tells you what you truly want and need. It can happen to anyone. It's not uncommon at all.What brings the movie down a bit is that it's a bit boring and pretentious. But the message isn't wrong. Sure, we should appreciate the beauty of small things in life and be present to them in the moment, to be able to be aware of this beauty. It's just that, this message is a bit of a cliché by now."

Dan_W_Reviews,"Feb 14, 2023",9/10,"American Beauty tells the story of Lester Burnham played by Kevin Spacey, a man who is unhappy with his life and embarks on a journey of self-discovery and fulfillment. The film's powerful and incisive commentary on the American Dream, materialism, and the suburbs created an extremely intriguing and unforgettable experience for audiences.Spacey delivers an excellent performance as Lester, bringing great depth and humanity to his character. The film's supporting cast, including Bening and Birch, also deliver impressive performances. The cinematography and soundtrack also add to the impact the film makes, creating a visually stunning and emotionally compelling film.In my opinion I'd say American Beauty is one of the best dark comedies of all time. The powerful commentary this film provides and its great performances make it an instant classic which is why I would rate it a 9 out of 10."
wkvqdrg,"Feb 27, 2024",8/10,"This movie is one of the best film displays of ""The American Dream"" or ""A Suburban Life."" It communicates through the audience in a way that can be seen as both dramatic, comical, or creepy. Its displayed in such a way in which you get a different view of what the person is saying each and every time they say something. The storyline can occasionally be all over the place, but the slow suspense that is added that is yet so fast made me never want to even pause it. Its one of the movies that are one and done. And not because it is mediocre, but because the dark humor and message behind it leaves you left with a feeling that you never want again, in the best way possible. Kevin Spacey plays such an amazing character as well as everyone else. Oscar was well deserved."
grankieg,"Aug 13, 2003",N/A,"Without a doubt, American Beauty is the most overrated movie I have seen. For those of you who have read Joan Didion, this script smacks of Play It As It Lays.What happens when a ""typical"" suburban professional male realizes his dissatisfaction with his life? He reacts in an insubstantial and unconvincing way. My job stinks - quit my job. I have trouble communicating with my daughter - smoke dope. My wife is distant and cold - fantasize about another woman. And so on. Yes, it is Mar-eye-ah cracking a boiled egg on the steering wheel all over again (Didion reference).Here's the question I really wanted this movie to explore: if, at midlife, Lester really feels that his life is not what he expected, where does he want it to go, what will he do about it, and can he get away with it.Sorry, but get religion, join the French Foreign Legion, or start a home-based business. If you're life is a joke Lester, don't make it worse by becoming a cliche."
loseur,"Mar 1, 2000",6/10,"American Beauty follows a man and his family as he rediscovers his true self during a mid-life crisis.  Spacey's character develops a crush on his daughter's hot friend, smokes pot with the neighbor's kid, and quits his job.Beauty isn't much more than an interesting fantasy for the viewer, a ""what if I really did what I wanted?""  It falls short of any real social commentary or entertainment.  In addition to its general lackluster, the film contains a non sequitur sub plot about the neighbor's homophobia, which, having nothing to do whatsoever with the rest of the story, comes out of nowhere to play a pivotable role.If you found Beauty interesting, there's two other films I would strongly suggest.  If you liked the this-is-an-american-family-with-some-disturbing-problems aspect, watch Tod Solontz' ""Happiness;"" it's more disturbing and fits together better.  If you liked the I'm-a-corporate-employee-who's-discovering-who-I-really-am-and-loving-it aspect, watch ""Fight Club;"" it's a better film, and it's ""Take this job and shove it scene"" is infinitely more satisfying."

xiaoli7377,"Dec 18, 2022",10/10,"In spite of the controversy over leading actor Kevin Spacey in the decades that followed the movies release, and some rather uncomfortable parallels between plot points shown in the film with that of the real world, ""American Beauty"" still captivated me and wowed me with a deep introspection on perception, self-worth, and the nature of beauty. Each of the characters in this film are flawed in some way and are really interesting. I really loved Spacey in this one, Lester is a character that, although he has a pervy infatuation with his daughter Jane's (Thora Birch) best friend Angela (Mena Suvari), is awesome to root for. I love the moment that he just stopped caring and just through caution to the wind, it reminded me of another late 90s movie about a guy stuck in a dead end job with nowhere to go in life (""Office Space"").Really good cinematography, great sets that made it seem like I was watching a sitcom, it also felt like ""The Truman Show"" in a lot of areas. Something about these late 90s introspective movies that focus on a mundane boring life. I don't know it seems like that was in the cultural mist at that point in time and I'm not complaining because it still holds up today for me as a young person in 2022.I loved nearly every second of it, it is a quality piece of filmmaking that is really hilarious at times and really touching at others. Some dark and taboo subject matter that might not suit everyone's pallet, but I couldn't get enough of it. A great classic film."

Just watched it again and wow, much has changed in my perception of this movie. The characters are complex and real. I loved Annete Bening, she portrayed the unfulfilled woman outstandingly. Allison Janney, a small role, but intense. You can see the polished happy facade of a tipical family, struggling on the inside. The title is American beauty but it's an image of western style of life. Individualism, materialism, good looks. Shallow on the inside."

But certain images just stuck in my head.I saw it a second time and I really saw it for the first time, an amazing movie. I just watched it for a third time and it just grows and grows.The story is so simple and short. Yet it has the enjoyment, the journey of a major novel. I personally hate chick-flicks, am more the action-adventure type. But there isn't a boring moment in what is really casually paced.The cinematography and the acting is so well done as to become invisible, just captivating. One of the few films where I never thought of any of the actors being ""them"" playing a part. They are so real.A beautiful journey into a world so foreign, yet so familiar to our deepest thoughts."
ivantheeditor,"Sep 26, 2020",N/A,"This was really good! I don't care about Spacey's personal life so that didn't bother me. The movie is done extremely well - back in the 90's they were still putting effort into those things. Now movies are just a money making machine for Netflix so they're pumping them out like hot cakes and they don't care that they suck. This isn't the case with this one. True classic. Still very relevant even today. The only thing that bothered me a little was how strong the stereotypes were and at times it also felt like too many storylines going on at the same time but they do tie in nicely together at the end. Overall, a solid movie. Not sure it was worth Picture of the Year but I guess back then it was? Good for it!"
Pedro_H,"Oct 6, 2004",7/10,"A Suburban Joe enters a mid-life crisis which involves quitting his well-paid job and starting an affair with a teenage girl.We all know that real tragedy is usually some medieval king deciding if he should wage war or make peace on his neighbour. A million miles away from the safe American suburbs where nothing actually happens - or does it?While the acting here is first class and the story is a bit witty and a bit kinky, I think people are going a bit overboard about it. Best Picture Oscar? Well that shocked me more than the film itself!Mid life crisis is one thing, but Spacey takes it to a Spinal Tap like ""11"" and then some. This should be a slapstick comedy really, but it takes a dark turning for reasons that I don't fully understand. Maybe this is what makes it such a critical winner - give 'em enough murk and they can see anything. People that are well fed, safe and healthy can be tragedies too?I almost want to crib other people's reviews on this one. I enjoyed it, sure, but where is the depth? What are people really enjoying here? What are the key points being made?Is it - as I suspect - people having safe, but boring, lives and looking on this movie as what would happen if they cut lose and went a little crazy themselves. But are very unlikely to do so. Does this film contain some kind of hidden suburban fantasy that I don't share?Is this film anti-monogamy? Or am I seeing things in the shadows and mist? Being single I have often viewed marriage as being a little boring - and the thought of a sexless marriage sends shivers down my spine. A personal view only, for all you married folk!Yes - liked it, but its classic status has to be explained to me more clearly.

boozerira,"Mar 20, 2018",6/10,"Call me immature, but whenever I was looking through a list of top rated movies and saw one about Kevin Spacey wanting to bang a teenager, my interest was well caught. That is genuinely how I began watching this film, just to see how well it aged considering how Spacey's career has turned out. I have to say though, I'm absolutely shocked at how well this movie turned out and how memorable it was.Kevin Spacey; admittedly; is a very good actor. He absolutely shines it in this role as Lester, by far the star of the show, as Kevin Spacey does do good with sadistic roles. That isn't a joke. I mean, it literally says that on his very own IMDb page, check the Trade Mark section. ""Often plays cold-blooded and sadistic characters,"" last I checked, which was as I write this, it does indeed say that. For the sake of it, I'm going to ignore the controversy, although it has bothered me how not very many, if at all, new reviews I've seen for this movie that don't talk about the issue. I definitely think it's worth mentioning for the context of the film. It's like as time went on more and more inside jokes you could apply to this movie were created, which made it so much more funny. Enough of that, though.Like I said, the actual movie surprised me. A lot. I like to think of the movies I watch, and how good they are, partially based on how well I remember them after some time, along with their merit. I have to say, I've watched a few other movies after this one, but I still remember it very well. I don't even need to think about it.That being said, it has its fair share of issues which keeps it being higher than a seven. I know that a lot of the dialogue is supposed to be cringe, but there's a difference between bad dialogue and dialogue that is supposed to be bad. This might be unpopular, but in my opinion, the weakest link in the cast is Wes Bentley playing Ricky Fitts. I know who he is supposed to be as a person, and he looks the part and feels it, but I genuinely don't enjoy the way he delivers lines. It isn't good.Another issue I had with this movie were a few of the plot points. I don't want to spoil anything for this old movie, but Jesus, Colonel Fitts takes some huge jumps of logic to get to the conclusions he does get to. No normal person would think like that.I do believe this movie is worth seeing. It doesn't, by any means, contain the most gut wrenching things I've ever watched in a film, but it'll be good for a laugh and a few, ""What am I watching right now,"" moments."
mjw2305,"Jan 5, 2005",10/10,"At over 5 years old this movie has probably been seen by most people already. But just in case it did pass you by, for whatever reason, i suggest that you see it as soon as possible.The characterisation is sublime and has not to my knowledge been matched since, every stereotypical character is so realistically portrayed, by a combination of fine acting, great writing and excellent direction; that you feel a connection with everyone in the movie.I won't try and link this film with any particular genre, as i believe it stands out on its own, but i will say this. Whatever kind of film you usually go for, 99% of you will like this one, and most of you will love it.Look closer and you will find an absolute gem.10/10"
apparentlyblue,"Jan 19, 2005",9/10,"American Beauty is an exploration of midlife crisis and the illusion of a 'normal' family. Lester Burnham (Spacey), his highly strung wife Carolyn (Bening) and resentful daughter Jane (Birch) each struggle to find a sense of purpose to their lives as the facade of their happy home deteriorates. The story follows Lester on a journey to turn his life around after meeting his daughter's provocative friend Angela (Suvari). His lust for the teenage girl inspires a new lust for youth which he captures by discarding all of adult life's responsibilities in an attempt to re-live his youth. As he quits his respectable job, takes on a position flipping burgers in a fast food joint, and starts smoking pot he finally gets the object of his desire  but was it really what he was looking for? Kevin Spacey's performance as the world-weary and rebellious Burnham is magnificent. The honesty which Lester gives off while everything around him radiates artificiality is astonishingly powerful - aided in no small way by Sam Mendes' use of lighting and colour which is remarkable. Visually, every shot is a work of art, a portrait of discomfort. You can really feel the unease as the camera takes you on a journey through the Burnham household, furbished in blue-greys and white  not so much as a fork out of place - mixed with the stark contrast of red roses. In short, an absolutely breath-taking film, American Beauty is shocking yet humbling, sad yet tranquil and ultimately beautiful."
LinkinParkEnjoyer,"Nov 2, 2018",9/10,"Oh my gosh, I forgot how great this movie is. Kevin Spacey nailed his character with remarkable performance. Camera work is amazing and it shows everyday problems in marriage and society. Ending is perfect and the movie deserved all the praise and Oscar."
markfilmfan,"Dec 1, 2007",10/10,"Occasionally, Hollywood makes an independent film. This is my case in point. Saw it again last night and didn't realize how many subjects this film actually deals with. Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning are terrific as a middle class couple with the perfect life on the surface with the demons slowly poking through the bottom of their false exterior. Spacey's mid life crisis is sharp and believable as he attempts to change is life, quiting his job, buying a 70's Pontiac forebode and working out in his garage as his wife cheats on him with a local real estate tycoon. His daughter, played by the now grow up Thora Birch, is at similar odds as she deals with her creepy next door neighbor and her young but sexy friend played by Mira Suavi. American Beauty plays like a middle American nightmare, where change is always the best thing."
Sean26,"Sep 24, 1999",10/10,"My fiancee & I saw this movie at a sneak preview showing in her college. The big lab building was filled with mature college students, and there were those who still haven't grown up yet.  The lights dimmed and the movie started.  It started out with Lester Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey), in a short monologue with an overview of the city they live in.  From that moment until the ending credits rolled, I did not blink, I did not budge...except when I laughed...and BOY did I laugh.  The movie itself was a bit....shall I say..oh...weird.  My fiancee didn't like it too much, cuz it was too weird for her.I thought it was a very serious movie, but with most of the serious scenes, it contains lots of humor.  That's why I thought this movie was very good & original.  It's very very serious, but at the same time, it was hilarious and shocking.Please do NOT take your kids to this movie either (like I saw some parents do in American Pie), it's very BOLD & BRAVE.  It has Kevin Spacey nearly commits statutory rape, it has Spacey masturbating (it actually showed it!), and it had Annette Benning having sex with Peter Gallagher..<very rough hard sex>.In short, I think Spacey & Benning & Chris Cooper (the Neo-Nazi marine) all deserve oscars for this movie!   As for best picture, as of right now, there's no movie as bold, daring & very well acted like this movie is.  So, American Beauty, you have my votes!"
auuwws,"Apr 24, 2021",8/10,"A wonderful movie that presented the midlife crisis beautifully, the acting in the movie was great from all the actors, especially Kevin Spacey, who gave a great performance in the movie, but Brad Pitt deserved an Academy Award for his performance in Fight Club more than Kevin Spacey, the story of the film was fun and interesting I liked most of the characters in the movie, but I didn't like Jane. Nor did Carolyn, I recommend watching the movie."
dinhbeo,"Jun 2, 2021",7/10,"The storyline is quite simple and easy to follow it, although some detail need a bit thinking.

The film is not too excellent, but still a nice meaningful film!"
PoisonKeyblade,"Oct 14, 2007",10/10,"With some of the best writing, characters, and scenes ever put to film, American Beauty is simply a luscious and beautiful movie. It has so much substance in it that you could watch it thousands of times and never get bored.In all honesty, I wasn't exactly the biggest fan of Kevin Spacey before I saw this movie. My overall opinion on him was that he was a so-so actor that had his good movies and his bad movies. This film changed my mind all together. Spacey's performance is heartbreaking, perfect, and most importantly, realistic. The entire time he is on screen, he literally is just magnificent. Wes Bentley was also captivating to watch, and it's really a wonder that he's not a bigger movie star. His performance in this film was just flawless and incredible. He is quite the scene-stealer, and often outshines some of the other actors.Overall, American Beauty was a fantastically good film with some of the best writing around. The movie was moving, realistic, and though-provoking; could one really expect any less from the genius Alan Ball, who is also responsible for the amazingness that is Six Feet Under. Don't miss this film under any circumstances, as it is by far one of the most excellent films I have ever seen."
MovieDude1893,"Mar 5, 2005",7/10,"A beautiful piece of work by first time director Sam Mendes. Easily one of the most accomplished film debuts in the history of cinema. The story centers around a man named Lester Burnham (the wonderful Oscar winning Kevin Spacey) a man who has lost passion in his life. His wife Caroline (Annette Benning in an equally stunning performance) is a workaholic real estate agent. Both are frustrated with their marriage which is basically just for show. Sexually frustrated Lest lusts for one of his daughter's (Thora Birch) girlfriends,Anglea (Menna Suvari). This lust begins Lester's search for happiness in life, so he quits his job and begins to flip burgers just like when he was a kid. Caroline is very frustrated with the fact that she has to be the breadwinner of the family and has an affair. Meanwhile the boy next door,Ricky is videotaping the Burnhams the daughter Jane in particular. The two strike a chord with each other and begin a romantic relationship. Ricky's father, Frank is a homophobe who suspect Ricky is homosexual because he is spending some time with Lester, of course this is not true. All Ricky is doing is scoring Lester some drugs. As the story progresses Lester gets used to Angela, and Angela starts to warm up to Lester.This film is a must see for anyone who appreciates film!"
optimism_always,"Apr 24, 2005",10/10,"There had always been a tradition among the Americans themselves as well as the rest of the world, not without exceptions, of course, to believe in the unity and the firmness of the interrelationships within the typical American family. Before the sixties it had been the privilege of most families on U.S. soil to say that ""The bonds which hold our family units together make us the greatest nation on this planet."" Nevertheless we should not disparage the family values of the rest of the world for our country consists entirely of the indigenous populations of a multitude of states around the globe. We ought to be fair and unbiased when judging ourselves and everyone else, indeed. But as far as fairly judging ourselves is concerned we have come to the point when all our illusions can no longer shield us from the bitter truth. And that is when cinematic masterpieces like 'American Beauty' are born.The film catches us completely off guard and awakens a kind of nostalgia towards the past of our great country when parents were respected and teenagers' only income stemmed from respectable diligent part-time work and not from the sale of drugs. Back then a high school education was considerably more impressive and its quality was incomparably better than the relative knowledge of a few pages of Shakespeare and a few simple mathematical formulas we have today instead of a thorough and systematic academic programme which United Kingdom for instance has.As we watch 'American Beauty' we start to panic and think about our own families especially if our children are teenagers. On the screen in front of us we can see the disintegration of two middle-class families not much different from our own in most cases. Some of us begin to take preventive measures soon after leaving the cinema. And that is the way it should be. In fact it's the only way it should be. Therefore movies like 'American Beauty' are a blessing in disguise, even though the rest of the world may experience a feeling of triumph or scorn and even be encouraged to continue to tamper with our security, prosperity and well-being. Bravo. A 10/10."
cwbellor,"Oct 15, 2020",8/10,"Suburban life isn't all rose petals, jail bait cheerleaders and gay neo-nazis in the closet! Something much darker lies beneath the veneer and whatever it is, it's not only dark, it's beautiful. American Beauty is a mid-life crisis tale that's heavy on the men's lib message.
Spacey gives his I'm-so-bored drawl and every word he utters conveys the cynical sarcastic disdain he feels for the world. But his performance is not without levity. Watch him as he says, ""I rule."" It's fantastically subtle. Subtle in a look-at-how-funny-that-is way. When he finally begins to assert himself, it is remarkably poignant. Watch him throw asparagus against the wall. No, it's not a potential precursor to domestic violence. It's a declaration of independence whereupon you happily applaud Spacey's descent into me-me-me world. Meanwhile, his daughter Missy Miserable, played by Thora Birch is committed to the dead stare demeanor. Her only guide as she navigates the teenage wasteland is blonde bimbo Jenny Jailbait. Thora is a disillusioned youth in need of a more thoughtful peer. Enter the eccentric and creepy Ricky Fitts. As far as Ricky is concerned, Mena is a bland blonde and Thora is a glowing angel of tortured teendom.
Ricky is an immediately endearing character for the fact that he appears to have been born with a paralyzing birth defect - the inability to blink. Ricky's sole purpose in life is to mock the stuffy suburbanite pursuit of perfection. This is something he can do simply by standing in one place without blinking. Observe his psycho-killer stare as he balances sincerity with pretentious existential insights. The epic plastic bag dance is so stunning that wide-eyed Ricky feels like he might pass out from its beauty. For Ricky, a plastic bag is a bigger tearjerker than Lester's morning grip in the shower.As cinematic as this film is visually, you still get bits of that late 90s staple, digital hand-held technique. You see, the only way you can catch the raw truth of life is through the seemingly cold and impersonal lense of a digital camera. Yes, this came out the same year as Blair Witch. American Beauty is a cul de sac of tragedy and sickly stirring dreams where one's ambition and desire supersedes any responsibility to anyone else. Well, at least that's what it is if your name is Lester Burnham."
zombiji,"Oct 15, 2018",10/10,"Such a classic film with a poignant beginning, middle and ending. There's not a single dull moment and Spacey really shines in this amazing film."
b364001,"May 11, 2012",10/10,"This movie is fantastic. Sure this movie has fantastic acting and directing and music and all that jazz, but it also possesses unique qualities that typically are only found in Indies. This rare gem (not using the cliché lightly) combines the great standard aspects found in a blockbuster with the profound feelings found in a good independent film.It's quite philosophical. Mainstream movies tend to not rely on ""deep"" thinking like riskier movies do. I know people like to say ""If you enjoy philosophizing, you'll LOVE this movie!"" about their favorite films, but I believe in this case it's true. I left the movie with a deep sense of enlightenment. I admit I bought into it harder than I believe the average person would (I believe due to a great cynicism of society.) I wouldn't call American Beauty ground-breaking, but it did shake me somewhat.It drives home its main idea without being preachy, which is pretty hard to do. It starts subtle and keeps growing to the end.American Beauty also has some roots in forests Hollywood doesn't tend to grow it, another nice fruit. As liberal as I feel I am, I (embarrassingly) admit I felt a little uneasy about some elements of the movie. But I view that as a good thing.I think the main reason people might dislike this film is because of its corny aspects. American Beauty does have a couple cheesy elements, but most of them are purposely cheesy. But I admit American Beauty does fall victim to two too noticeable slapstick-like instances that seem out of place because the rest of the movie is so good. I was so enthralled by the movie that when these gimmicks happened I was pretty upset. It's not as though other popular movies wouldn't have these occurrence, it's that while watching this movie seems too good to have them. I got the feeling that, in one of the scenes, the director kept re-shooting the scene and telling Spacey to be MORE obvious. But I can't stress enough that I felt this way in literally two scenes.This is definitively a lasting film. I watched 13 years after it was released and loved it. Even though it's not totally exactly perfect, I gave it a 10/10 because of rounding errors.I highly recommend this movie."
Leonard_Washington,"Nov 15, 2007",10/10,"Seriously, this is a movie that changes your life. No really, watching this film makes you think so deeply and really captures what a ""film"" is supposed to do.I found myself relating to every single character, the way these characters are presented are unlike any I have seen in any movie. They nail everything you usually expect from a movie that you don't get. Every time you watch it you notice something, whether it be actions, scenes, or quotes, each thing you see represents something beautiful...I'm serious. I always find more beauty each time.The story is relate-able and not cliché'd in any way. It's about a man who's unnoticed, a man who's hardly there, but if you just look closer. Lester Burnham is this man, he is ignored by his controlling wife, and his rebellious daughter. The man who moved in next door, Ricky Fits, is about change everything. I don't want to expose all the beauty. But please watch this movie as many times as you can to capture it's deep, compelling story and message, you'll really be glad you did!"

Every Oscar well deserved, even though it should have more..."
lee_eisenberg,"Sep 23, 2005",10/10,"I think that it's appropriate that ""American Beauty"" came out in 1999. In that year, I was as old as my parents were in 1967, when ""The Graduate"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" both came out. Those were both movies that presented things differently than most movies previously had. Entertainment Weekly called 1999 something like ""the year that changed movies"", citing ""Election"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" as examples.Anyway, ""American Beauty"" is an indictment of the suburban lifestyle. Middle class Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) has a steady job and a typical family. His self-indulgent wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) seems absolutely bent on training their teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) to be ""perfect"". But then, when Lester catches sight of Jane's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a dance, the whole Burnham household begins to go through some massive changes. Changes which will irrevocably alter everything.This may be the perfect movie. I can't even begin to describe how good it is. With top-notch performances from its main players (plus outstanding performances from Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Allison Janney, Scott Bakula, Sam Robards and Peter Gallagher), an excellent script by Alan Ball, and A-one direction by Sam Mendes, you can see why it won Best Picture.Just an extra note. There is a scene that might make you giggle. I won't tell you what it is, but it involves ""choking the bishop""."
Last_Exile,"May 1, 2008",9/10,"American Beauty, released in 1999 and starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari, couldn't be ordinary if it tried. The movie is a deep, wonderful, and penetrating film that will leave the viewer not only questioning their life, but American society as a whole. The movie hits on many key points ranging from conformity in society to individual perception, and really hits home the concept of social disillusionment. The tag line of this movie is ""Look Closer"", which is exactly what American Beauty does with its portrayal of the Burnham and Fitz families. On the surface both families appear to be well-off and happy, but in reality they are struggling greatly with what they want and what they think will make them fit into society. For example, Colonel Fitz on the surface despises homosexuals because he believes that they are not conforming to society's view on marriage, however, in reality he is upset that he cannot break the bonds of social conformism and be gay himself. The truth is, the only happy people in the movie or those who are able to break from society's rules and live their lives according to their own perceptionsunfortunately for most, they reap the consequences society deals to those who are unwilling to bend. Ricky Fitz is sent to a mental institution and ostracized by society because he does not keep the society's view on beauty. And Lester Burnham, though finally able to embrace happiness after waking from his twenty year coma, is killed. American Beauty combines not only great acting and directing, but also includes the audience by asking many questions that will make them stop and evaluate their own lives."

MarkRWeaver,"Sep 30, 2022",10/10,"I was in college when this movie first came out and now I'm the age Kevin Spacey was in this film. I watched it again and read some negative reviews by people who can't even spell. If you weren't old enough to watch this movie in the time period it was made, you shouldn't be allowed to review it. This movie portrays the America I grew up in. It shows a couple stuck in their dull American corporate lives. This movie opened my eyes when I was coming of age that adults don't have it all together. They miss their youth and simple pleasures that made them feel alive. The mundane routine of a job you hate and a stale marriage makes you feel dead inside. This movie made me understand what a midlife crisis is. The nostalgia of a car that made you feel alive when you were young and the desperation to feel anything at all when your life has become a prison with no surprises or adventure left. Parents can grow to resent each other and become toxic, fighting over the most trivial things. The perverted fantasy and attention of a young pretty girl woke something he hadn't felt in years, and unfortunately sometimes fantasy gets confused with reality. It's supposed to be disturbing. All of it is. It's not glorifying it. It's a critique of society in America, and done in such an artistic and creative way. That's why it received the acclaim it did."

proto57,"Jan 17, 2006",N/A,"The general theme and concept of the screenplay closely parallel Hemingway's story, ""The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber"". Inner peace and strength, respect of one's self, and becoming a whole person independent of the actions and influences of others... might come late in life, but never too late. Burnham, like Macomber, ""finds himself""... although he does not live long to enjoy it. Nonetheless, this change means he still wins in the end.There are other similarities between the movie and the story. It is worth reading... one of Hemingway's best.Not casting aspersions on the screenwriter here, but in general, it's obvious some of the best literature gets ""farmed"" for new work. Rear Window was just about plagiarized from H.G. Wells' short story ""Through a Window"". There are countless examples."

One day he snaps, quits his job and decides to seduce Jane's teenage girlfriend Angela. Meanwhile, Jane is falling in love with the next door neighbor...""American Beauty"", winner of 5 Oscars and 3 Golden Globes, is a highly praised black satire on the American society ( it's currently no. 32 on the IMDb's top 250 films ) but for some reason I didn't like it. It reminded me too much of TV soap operas like ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""O. C. California"". Still, I can appreciate the clever script full of funny dialogs ( Carolyn introduces Lester to Buddy. Lester says to him that they met before. Buddy, not so convinced, nods with: ""Yeah, I remember you..."" Then Lester replies: ""It's all right, I wouldn't remember me either."" Then Carolyn says to him: ""Don't be so weird, honey!""- ""All right, I'll be what ever you want me to be."") and quirky characters ( the scene where Angela teases Jane that she wants to have ""10 000 babies"" with the outsider Ricky ).--------Actually, every ingredient for a great film is there, but for some reason they don't work as a whole. Mostly that's the fault of the awful music which should have just been scraped, the stiff directing and the irritating end. Also, the story could have been so much more elegant and light, instead of just so heavy and pretentious to death. It's an uneven mix of great and weak parts, and the ending result is only an good film. For some this could be interesting, despite the flaws.Grade: 6/10"

Spleen,"Jul 31, 2000",6/10,"I discussed this with a friend and she, too, didn't like the ending; her quarrels was quite different from mine, and I think we were both right.  I would advise you not to read on if you haven't seen the film.  Yes, I know it's announced right at the start that Lester will shortly be dead; that isn't what I'm about to reveal.MY problems were as follows.  The film tells us about Lester's imminent demise TWICE at the start.  It struck me at the time as unnecessary; I later found it was done so as to manipulate us into a silly game of guessing and second-guessing towards the end.  Which one of the suspects before us will commit the fatal act?  Will it be (a) the daughter, acting in concert with her lover?  Or (b), the daughter's lover, acting alone?  Or (c), the frustrated wife, smarting with shame?  Or (d), the fascist-minded neighbour? In fact, we start by thinking we know that the answer is (a), but this is a trick of presentation that amounts to simple cheating.  By presenting a not particularly crucial scene TWICE Mendes makes it seem important.  But in any case, what's the point of this cat-and-mouse game with the viewer?  Suddenly the picture becomes conventional and just a little stale.Well, as everyone still reading knows, the answer is (d), which brings me to my second problem.  The neighbour is driven to murder only because he's led to believe, falsely, that Lester is gay.  How does he come to believe this? Sheer, flimsy chance.  Had a window frame not conveniently occluded his view, had he not happened to watch a few ""incriminating"" minutes of videotape out of the hundreds of HOURS stored in his son's room, the tragedy would never have occurred.  It's almost an eighteenth-century farce.  Lester is not in any sense ""doomed to die"" at the start of the film; nor does he play with fire; his eventual death is as meaningless as, ""and then he was hit by a falling piano"", except that - and this is what makes it worse than the falling piano scenario - we are made to examine the fatal chain of events at ridiculous length.Here are my friend's concerns.  She thought a sudden death at the end was simply gratuitous; a tacked-on piece of pessimism to a story the logical conclusion of which would be happy.  The death is (my friend pointed out) a good deal unhappier than I'd noticed.  There's no indication that the neighbour will even be suspected of the murder; there's every indication that Jane and Ricky WILL be suspected.  The videotape we saw twice will also be seen by the police.  The two lovers cannot now flee to New York, both of them are likely to be imprisoned, and, to add insult to injury, Lester (like the film as a whole) ignores their fate entirely in his blissful ruminations on life that are meant to sum up the story.  It's one thing to concentrate primarily on Lester to the exclusion of everyone else.  It's quite another to tell us Jane's story as well, showing us incidents that don't concern him and which he will never even find out about - and then, in the end, leave his daughter in the lurch by simply forgetting about her.  If Mendes wants to bring Lester's daughter into the story at all he can jolly well treat her with respect.My long complaint may give a false impression.  As it happens a sour conclusion is not nearly enough to sour the film as a whole: it's just so GOOD throughout.  Simple, beautiful, moving scenes - the moment when Carolyn cries after degrading herself in front of potential customers, or the dinner-time argument after Lester quits work - are presented with an almost arrogant freshness; I was all the more disappointed with the conclusion because I had been lulled into believing that the film-makers were so skilled they couldn't possibly let me down.  (And - think what you will of me for saying this - the sight of Thora Birch undressing and standing there topless would be worth sitting through a bad movie to see, let alone this one.)  Taken all in all I'm very glad ""American Beauty"" was made."
jrw48,"Nov 3, 2000",1/10,This trivial movie is a stellar example of what the tasteless American movie going public demands. I guess that we get what we ask for.

LoneWolfAndCub,"Sep 9, 2005",10/10,"American Beauty is a modern masterpiece and rightly deserves it place in the top 250. The cinema has been producing a lot of terrible movies lately. This one stands with the great ones such as The Shawshank Redemtion, The Green Mile, Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, Se7en and the list goes on. There is nothing wrong with this movie. The acting, directing, score, mood, cinematography are all superb.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is suffering his mid-life crisis. His bitchy wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is annoying him. His moody daughter Jane (Thora Birch) isn't helping. Things start to change when he sees Jane's cheer leading friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a school function. He starts having fantasies of a naked Angela covered in red roses. His actions that follow change his family for the worst.Sam Mendes has created something that will stick with the viewers of this wonderful movie. We witness are family that looks perfect on the outside crumble into to something horrific. How one person's actions can effect everyone around him. Kevin Spacey is superb in his role as the unstable husband/father. He portrays him so well his character is disturbing and we kind of feel sorry for him but at the same time we don't. Annette Bening is great as the wife/mother who we really don't like but feel sorry for. Thora Birch is also great as the daughter who has developed a crush on her neighbour. The supporting cast is great.5/5."
sol-,"Apr 26, 2005",10/10,"'American Beauty' is a film about people and how they live. At times it is a biting satire with sharp wit and acute observations, at other times it is a deep drama about unhappy individuals in American suburbia, but all the time I found it an enjoyable film to view, both because of the things it has to say and the high cinematic quality of the production.The best part of the film would probably be Alan Ball's original screenplay. It is alternates from amusing and touching, perceptive and funny, and the characters are all very well developed and feel real. A common complaint I hear about the film is that the characters are thin, but they are just the opposite. We acquire an understanding of what makes each character tick and what each characters wants out of life. Some are motivated by the idea of success and luxuries, while other are prepared to settle for a simpler lifestyle. Some of the characters also have their own individual secrets that are revealed towards the end, and by watching the film again one can pick up their insecurities about their secrets.Another complaint I often hear is that the film is too literal and straightforward. This however is quite a subjective judgment, as where does one draw the line between a film being too complex and not complex enough? If a film is overly complex and too hard to extract meaning out of, sure some people would look deeper, but others will be put off. I feel that 'American Beauty' has quite a good balance between how much it blatantly states and how much you can extract by closer examination, and what is said out loud is not unnatural. It is in that way a film that can be enjoyed by almost all people: casual moviegoers and avid film buffs alike.There is not really much else that people tend to complain about, and really there is hardly anything at all to not like. The types of flaws that one might find in the film are what you expect to find if judging whether one of two films in an all time top 100 list is the better of the two. They are not the type of flaws that should affect one's viewing experience, unless of course one expected to find something more in the film than it offered. But that again is subjective.The technical aspects of the film are wonderful. Thomas Newman's score is very low-key and simple when needed, and more zapped when required. Conrad L. Hall has meticulously set up every single shot. His use of out-of-focus backgrounds and foregrounds, high and low camera angels, and swooping shot is perfect. The film all flows very well, and some jump cut editing is perfectly woven in. The set décor and art direction paint a colourful picture of suburbia but yet they also manage to bring out the monotony of all the individual places. Plus the use of the colour red in the film basically speaks for itself.To compliment the film's other virtues, the cast give it their best with good results. Each actor and actress perfectly suits their characters, and it a shame about the lack of acclaim given to many of the performances. Spacey and Bening do some brilliant stuff as a discontent couple who are learning individually to enjoy life but yet are still full of anger, and Birch is perfect as their insecure teenage daughter. But the often unmentioned great performances come from Chris Cooper as the army type new neighbour, Wes Bentley as his teenage son, and Alison Janney as his wife, who seems just a little too detached from life. Then of course there is Mena Suvari as Birch's school friend who values her looks above everything.This is a film that touches on many different human concerns. Beauty, as in the title, is a key theme, and ideas about different perceptions of beauty run throughout the film. Bentley films a number of sequences on his camcorder, and we are shown the digital pictures. There are also the windows that everyone uses to spy on one another. People see things in many different ways because we are all different, yet we are all striving for a common goal of contentment, and the film tries to show this. 'American Beauty' starts off as a mystery thriller because we know that Spacey has died and that Birch has asked someone to kill him, but the mystery is the end is how we all function and how we are able to find happiness in life."
paulclaassen,"Jan 14, 2022",9/10,"'American Beauty' is one of my all-time favorite movies for so many reasons. From the excellent cast to the beautiful photography and cinematography, this is a very special film and a motion picture masterpiece.'American Beauty' features interesting characters and fantastic character development. This film can be used as an example of character study, as every single character undergoes character development. It simply is sensational!Kevin Spacey stars as Lester, who is viewed by his family as a total loser. With a new outlook on life after meeting his daughter's girlfriend, Angela (very well played by Mena Suvari), he decides to change his life completely. These drastic measures affects everyone around him, including his neighbors. The blend of humor and drama is seamless, with the dry humor being very effective - and funny! Kevin Spacey steals the show, and gives an incredible performance. (And he is looking mighty fine, too!)'American Beauty' is a film that deserves numerous viewings, and needs to be watched alone at least once - to allow all your senses to open up to all the different elements, while you ponder about how relatable this is - possibly to your own life."
molinaseduardo,"Jun 2, 2019",10/10,"I think it's clear by now that the movie gets the majority of its credit for exactly that. What comes to mind when trying to best describe the plot, are ""intricate"", ""existential"" and ""intriguingly thought-out"", all three with good reason: the Lolita-esque and thereby sexually open narrative paves the way for incredibly fine character construction, with Kevin Spacey once again performing like none other."
zentropa,"Sep 7, 1999",10/10,"`American Beauty' is a film that comes along and says things like few films have ever done before. A film that is maddening brilliant in how it audaciously blends the absurd with the dramatic.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) wakes up one morning and announces in a voice-over that his life is miserable and that the highlight of his day will be his morning jerk-off session in the shower. He then proceeds to tell us about how, one year from now, a certain incident will occur. For the next two hours we are exposed to the incidents that lead to that moment.Lester and his wife Carolyn (Annette Benning) have no marriage. They hate each other and they do not relate to their daughter in any way. Jane (Thora Birch) has little respect for them, in return.Lester's life changes when he and his wife force themselves to go to a school basketball game, where Jane is performing on the cheerleading team. There, Lester becomes entranced by Jane's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari).This attraction seems rather frivolous at this point in the film, because it appears that the attraction is based solely on sexual desire. Angela is a beautiful, cocky young woman who's sole philosophy is to not be ordinary. She feels that because she is a stunner--a seductress--she is beyond everyone else. The ironic thing is that towards the end of the film, she is emotionally crippled when she has to admit that she is ordinary. The sad thin, in turn, and what lies at that heart of the movie, is that one does not need to be extraordinary to be ordinary--that beauty lies in everything, as long as such beauty is appreciated.Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is the mysterious new next door neighbor who becomes secretly obsessed with Jane--videotaping her at every turn. At first, this activity turns Jane off, until she becomes entranced by the reasoning behind this. His father, Wes, caught him doing pot one day and sent him to military school, where Ricky almost killed a boy--in turn, he was sent to a sanitarium. The family moves in next door and you are given a dose of true dysfunction.It is through Ricky's obsessive video collection--through which he videotapes the world--that we get to learn the theme of the movie. It is through Ricky that Jane begins to live and learns to love herself. Ricky, one of the saddest characters I have seen in film history, is a boy who learned to appreciate the beauty of life while trying to escape the horrors of his home. His father Wes is an evil man, haunted by demons that are later revealed, who is obsessed with discipline.I can't say much more about the movie simply because there is just too much to say about it, and also because I don't want to spoil the process the characters take to change their lives and how these lives end up--especially in the very `suspenseful' final minutes.All I can say is that there are scenes in this film that have hit me like few other scenes have hit me. Much is not seen of Barbara, Ricky's mom, in the film--but one scene, where she looks at her son's beaten faced is so shocking and tragic because of the line she tells him when she touches his face. The words are uttered by a woman who--as the audience can tell--has been emotionally paralyzed by her husband. The words are ironic in the context in which they are said--but the fear and motivation is perfectly understood.Annette Benning has given the performance of the year. May they give her the Oscar this very woman. This woman juggles drama with comedy like only a true master can. There is one particular scene, where she fails to sell a house, and she begins to cry. Just when you think she is being melodramatic, she begins to beat herself senseless--only to then contain herself. Ditto for Spacey and the bravura turn he gives as a man who basically decides to reclaim a lost life--and focus on what is truly important in his life. From anger to smugness--every expression is as three-dimensional as the next, showing us that he is one of our greatest actors.The film is completely adept in exploring the dysfunctional lives of characters coming to terms with the meaning of their lives. These are characters who are miserable in their present states. These are characters who decide to change. Some succeed and some fail--sometimes on their own or based on the actions of others. Others, after claiming happiness, only loose it and seek to punish the ones that took that momentary nirvana away from them. Alan Ball directed this complex gem with the finesse only a true master could posses.The theme of the movie centers around the concept of what is ordinary and what kind of beauty lies within the ordinary and you leave the theatre, after hearing the final voice-over, looking around you and truly observing the significance of everything and how the importance that you give to objects truly reflects the way you perceive yourself and your place in the world.The metaphors are explored beautifully (i.e. rose petals) as are characters motivations (i.e. the color of hedge clippers). A film so complex in meaning, it will take more than one viewing to fully digest. A film so important because, like few before, it truly makes a brave and relevant comment on our place in the world and how we relate to others. A film that, for me, blew away just about every other film I saw this year."
loriesjoost,"Feb 28, 2023",10/10,"The immediate storyline and message this film portrays might be somewhat ""cliché"". From the outside these middle-class suburban families appear to have the perfect lifes, but if you ""look closer"" (these are words that mark the movie's poster) not all is what it seems. However, this film completely transcends this narrative, not in the least by the mesmerizing soundtrack by Thomas Newman.The film questions the immutability of our selves and our personalities by exposing us to characters that are trying to come to terms with themselves. They are practically all becoming aware of a primordial denial of their indiviualistic self, but the film also blocks the idea that this results in an easy transition, and likeso confirms the overall complexity and the impenetrable nature of the human psyche.So even if we are true to ourselves, if we are so-called authentic, new questions and difficulties arise. This is shown by the next door teenager that does not care what people think of him, but he might even be the most troubled of all. Everyone is forever doomed to fail, because we can only know ourselves through the lens of the other, though we have a fundamental but impossible urge to escape this image. This is what makes the movie for me one the most beautifull representations of the tragedy of everyday life."
Ru-Dy,"Feb 20, 2023",6/10,"As great as this one is, I had trouble getting through the back and forth bickering and fighting between all of the characters, it was just too much! How can a film have such an all-star cast, with no likeable characters lol? It does cross some sensitive lines, and issues, which I could have done without as well. I would have done this one much differently. Not sure what the producer had in mind, and this movie did receive critical acclaim, but for my money, it was not quite as great as it could have been. I do watch it on occasion, but always have to take a break from the overall negativity of it. Hey, it's hard to argue with its success, there is no denying that, but this one is just too gloomy, downtrodden, and miserable to enjoy. 6 stars for the all-star cast, that's as much as I could give it. This one makes ""The War of the Roses"" look like a happy ending lol!"
Adrian-32,"Oct 10, 1999",10/10,"Watching ""American Beauty"" is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order. This is not your average social commentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand, this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly ""perfect"" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if everyone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand, ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow. ""American Beauty"" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of beauty fused with immorality, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the main thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new realms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch also showcase excellent performances. A truly remarkable film."
davidmvining,"Dec 31, 2023",7/10,"Wow, suburbia must just be the worst, huh? Well, that's not really the point, but it is the implication of Sam Mendes' feature film debut as director, working from a script by Alan Ball. The actual point is about living lies to the point of feeling numb and finding a way out of it. It's just that Ball and Mendes used the cultural perception, essentially working off of the foundation set by things like the novel Revolutionary Road (that Mendes would later adapt to film) or The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit about how the conformity of suburbia deadens the individual. I think it's easy to see how this appeals to so many people, but I feel a certain distance from it. I think the ending pulls all of its threads together really quite well, and it's impeccably made, but I get the feeling that there are too many strands running around at the same time.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) lives his life on autopilot as his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), a real estate agent under the competitive shadow Buddy ""The King"" Kane (Peter Gallagher), and their teenaged daughter Jane (Thora Birch). She has a best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), a sexpot of a young woman that Lester becomes infatuated with. Next door moves the Fitts family, headed by Colonel Frank (Chris Cooper) with his son Ricky (Wes Bentley) and his wife, the zoned out Barbara (Allison Janney). So sets the stage for Lester to come out of his middle-aged shell, using Ricky as inspiration because he doesn't follow the rules, selling weed to keep himself in video equipment that he uses to film everything around him while quitting jobs at will.I think what keeps me from really getting on the film's wavelength is the overall outlook on life. It's ultimately a materialist point of view about all we have is what is here, but the script also reaches for some kind of gauzy metaphysical meaning through Ricky's videos, in particular that central video of the plastic bag floating in the wind. I don't think the film makes a terribly good job at bridging the two competing ideas since it dramatically works as finding meaning within the self with Lester's ultimate completion of his emotional growth while the rhetoric around greater meaning from Ricky as he watches his videos with Jane feels almost like an afterthought.So, Lester takes Ricky's example and some knowledge he has about his company's management's financial misdeeds to get himself a year's salary and benefits as he quits, takes a job with no responsibility at a fast food burger joint, and focuses on working out in order to more appeal to the version of Angela in his dreams. Carolyn starts an affair with Buddy, and Jane and Ricky start their own little version of awkward dating, all while Angela is off to the side with Jane talking about how she thinks Lester is cute and describing all of the nasty sexual adventures she insists she's had in her nascent career as a model, none of which probably happened. All of this happens while Frank tries to keep a tight leash on Ricky considering his previous history of violence that sent him to a mental hospital, all while Frank takes every opportunity to rhetorically attack, behind their back, the gay couple living two doors down.The gay couple is the little rhetorical key to everything that Ball was trying to do with his script with Ricky providing the key phrase that they're shameless because they feel like they have nothing to be ashamed about. And this ends up where I feel like the film took on too much, because it's obvious that it's the central core of the film, and yet Lester's journey is all about how he wants to sleep with an underaged girl. The film tries to split the difference with Lester turning Angela down, perhaps discovering that all he wanted was to feel better about himself to the point where an underaged girl would want to sleep with him, but it represents the limits of this sort of materialist approach to looking at life. Why should Lester turn her down? What moral principle does the movie present that determines whether he should or not? Should he feel ashamed for wanting to do this?So, the moral center of the film is honestly a mess, this embrace of ""do what you want"" while sliding up to the idea that ""what you want"" could actually be bad without actually addressing what a limit could be, and it shows what refusing your inner self will lead to: the violence of Frank who ends the film with a shocking bit of murder. The implication being that he turned to murder because he denied who he was inside, making it the source of his general approach of beatings to his son.Honestly, the film is far more confused about its central point than anyone really seems to realize.And yet, I can't help but admiring it to a certain extent. Just because its morality is fudgy doesn't meant that it isn't worthwhile in its depiction. There's something compelling about Lester trying to find fulfillment, reaching out to Carolyn as he grows once more, getting rejected, and just finding confidence within himself. There's something interesting about the young people looking for some kind of greater meaning in the world beyond the thin veneer of consumerism that has come to define their parents lives. I appreciate all of that.And, on top of it all, Sam Mendes comes to the cinematic medium, employing Conrad Hall as his DP, and making an absolutely beautiful movie to look at from beginning to end. The delicate use of shadows from Hall are always a joy. Mendes brings the appropriate kind of theatricality to the production that recalls more Bob Fosse than Julie Taymor, especially in his show stopping moments like when Lester first notices Angela at the pep rally, quickly jumping into Lester's subjective view of the world, zeroing in on both characters artfully. And, Mendes is obviously great with actors, getting fantastic performances from everyone involved.So, I admire the film. I like to look at it. I appreciate all of the performances. I appreciate the moral groundwork while finding it incomplete dramatically, the film unwilling to really deal with the implications of its own moral code, choosing a way out without dealing with it instead of fully grasping with it. So, I end up slightly mixed, but the craft really is what pushed it over into something good and quality in my mind. It's certainly better than The English Patient, at least."
bsbulldogs,"Dec 15, 2014",10/10,"I am writing this review for American Beauty after the third time in three weeks that I have watched it and it grows on me each time I watch it. The first time I watched it, I thought maybe this movie is more of a comedy than a drama but after watching it today, I can say this is definitely a drama with some funny moments in it which is what I want from a drama rather than it taking itself too seriously. Kevin Spacey, who is simply brilliant stars as Lester Burnham , a sexually frustrated, average American husband/father who is undergoing a mid-life crisis as he hates his job and his relationships with his wife Carolyn (played superbly by Annette Bening) and daughter Jane (Thora Birch) are strained due to a number of reasons, one being that he becomes attracted to his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari). Add to that, the arrival of their new neighbours, the Fits, Frank (Chris Cooper), Ricky (Wes Bentley) and Barbara (Allison Janney) who seem to have problems of their own. All of these intertwining story lines, acting, music, directing and the script make this movie, in my opinion, an underrated classic of the 1990's which churned out some great movies and what a way to end the decade with a fantastic movie such as this. Hard for me to find a negative with this movie but positives from the movie are the storyline, the beautiful music and score of the movie, directing and of course, the cast of the movie which won the SAG Best Ensemble Award. With the cast, everyone knew their roles in the movie and played them accordingly, Kevin Spacey as the lovable loser, Annette Bening as the ambitious and materialistic wife, Thora Birch as the self esteem-less daughter and in one of her first big roles, Wes Bentley as Ricky, the likable next door neighbour who loves his camcorder and Jane's friend, Chris Cooper as Col Fits, a homophobic, strict disciplinarian father, Allison Janney as the silent wife, Mena Suvari as the egotistical best friend and even Peter Gallagher as Carolyn's real estate rival, Buddy Kane. This film deserved it's Oscar's for Best Picture, Best Director (Sam Mendes), Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography as well as the other nominations including Best Actress-Annette Bening but in saying that, I thought the acting standouts besides the two leads could have been nominated as well including Best Supporting Actress- Thora Birch or Best Supporting Actor- Chris Cooper who put in one of the performances of the year 1999 and has stuck with me ever since or Wes Bentley; either one, take your pick, they were both great."
damodara_and_radha,"Jun 1, 2022",10/10,"Notwithstanding Kevin Spacer's fall from grace, this is such a well written and well performed movie. Annette Benning, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley all deliver brilliantly. Definitely rewatchable. It unmasks suburban life beautifully - people suffering in dead end jobs and unhappy marriages, sexual fantasies, mental health issues.... It's all there."
AvionPrince16,"Aug 24, 2021",9/10,"I have a lot to say about this movie. It talk about life, the boring moments, sex, professionnal life, cheating, discover some freedom, new ability, the power to change the life. I enjoyed the fact that they show some nudity, not because im a voyeur but i found the movie very natural and dont pretend anything. I enjoyed also the crude words of the girls talking about boys(mention to big dick, sexual talk and appetite)the whole thing make the movie very believable. Also other theme (sexuality orientation, money). I found the movie very complete. And the naked scenes was so hot. I enjoyed their body. I wanted these girls like the father. It was a very sensual and play a lot with the red color (visually i mean). We can see also the dark side of each character (sexual need not satify) a husband who reject responsabilites and a woman who the need make her discover her body. A very believable movie with some good message in it. The discover of ourself and some some sexual tense."
johnmbale,"May 1, 2005",10/10,"In the footsteps of David Lynch, this film explores the nightmare underbelly of suburbia USA, when ordinary people try to be extraordinary. With dire results. Beautifully crafted, and with a definitive performance by Kevin Spacey, ably supported by a great cast, this is a standout film. A man in middle age crisis, feeling himself to be a loser in every respect, becomes infatuated with a young girl friend of his daughter. Revives his zest for living, but complications include a homophobic neighbor, with a weird son; his wife having a relationship with the Real Estate King, and his daughter becoming involved with the weirdo next door. An explosive and unexpected finish makes this a film to remember."

This movie is really funny at times and also very sad sometimes.So we most not think of this as a complete comedy,but instead as a drama movie that shows us a real side of life. This is a ""one of a kind movie"" and it is just excellent.Go see it. 8 out of 10."

kittysaysgo,"Mar 27, 2022",6/10,"An uncomfortable title revolving around exploitation of a high school student. This one just feels a little too on the nose with its abusive themes, and even though the main character (Kevin Spacey) has a redemptive arc it's not enough to overcome the indelible specter of a middle aged man trying to sleep with a seventeen-year-old.Mina Suvari and Wes Bentley are dually compelling and may ultimately be what carry this film, which is inherently watchable, and deserves accolades for its Chris Cooper carried surprises, but ultimately can't overcome its central thrust as anything other than shameless exploitation."
EW-3,"Jan 1, 2005",1/10,"I've got to hand it to the person who came up with the ""Look closer"" tag line. It was an absolutely brilliant move - one of the greatest scams perpetrated on a gullible public since the creation of the Ponzi Scheme.Why do I say this? Because the hubbub over this film very much reminds me of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", with multitudes saying how wonderful the new clothes look, but no one admitting to seeing nothing, for fear of being regarded as ""stupid"".And that's exactly what's going on with all the nonsensical critical acclaim for this film. Want proof? Just ""look closer"" at the comments in this board. Over and over again, people will heap praises on this film. But do you notice something? Their interpretations are never the same! They're all seeing something different. Just like the Emperor's invisible clothes, there are hundreds of reasons given as to why this is a wonderful film, but the only thing consistent about those who praise it is their conviction and attitude that anyone who doesn't see the ""beauty"" of this film is ""dumb"".Look closer? WHAT FOR? There's nothing to see! Gee, it feels great to be ignorant.(A note to all those who will be enraged by what I am saying here: Rather than attack me, I want you to tell me EXACTLY why this is such a good film. I will later post all of the many, many interpretations I receive, which will just further prove my point.)"
Fortune-2,"Jun 13, 1999",10/10,"I saw a sneak preview of American Beauty recently and all I can say is that I intend to see it again.  This is a WONDERFUL movie that is worth the money to see in the theaters (the only movie I've been to where half the audience broke into applause during the film).  Kevin Spacey plays Lester, a man who, while going through a mid-life crisis, begins to lust after a teenage friend of his daughter's.  Spacey is, of course, a fabulous actor and really shines in this role.  There are a few interwoven story lines involving Spacey's relationship with his control freak wife (Annette Bening, who is good if a little bit over the top in this role) and daughter, and the family next door, which includes a military general father, a mother who is apparently clinically depressed, and a very interesting son who is obsessed with filming beautiful things (including Lester's daughter Jane).  What is unusual about this movie is that the plot is not unusual or particularly unique--it's a couple of families in an anonymous American suburb and how they relate--but the filming of the movie is absolutely beautiful, and is done in a way that makes the film alternately hilarious, heartbreaking, and horrific.  It is definitely for mature audiences--there is some violence and a couple of frontal nudity scenes (both of which are essential and very tastefully done)--but older teens might enjoy it as well.  Be wary of how the media chooses to portray this movie--it may be called a ""black comedy,"" but, while sometimes hilarious, it is definitely a drama.  Go see it--I don't think you'll be sorry."
tower-5,"Sep 3, 1999",10/10,"I saw American Beauty last night and I can't stop thinking about it. It was one of the best movies I have seen in quite awhile. I don't want to give anything away so I'm  just going to give some tidbits. The acting was brilliant. Kevin Spacey was in his best form, I really think this is the perfect role for him. Annette Bening was great, and her hair was even better. I'm not real familiar with Wes Bentley, but his portrayal of Ricky Fitts was spectacular. The direction by Sam Mendes was beautiful. He created such a great feel and vision it's hard to not want to see it again just for the images. I think schools should consider showing this movie to film students to show them how to completely create a mood with such few gimmicks. The mood Mendes created made me laugh and feel uncomfortable at the same time. I guess it was a little bit like the way we all feel about life itself, which is what the movie is about anyway. You must see this movie if you are serious about film, and you should see this movie if you still like to be moved by a brilliant story."
nickmonsta21,"May 8, 2005",8/10,"The main focus that was taught about ""American Beauty"" was that it was ""Reality vs. Appearance"". I think that the entire movie was scene though a lens. It was obvious that Ricky taped everything and saw everything in his video camera; but the rest of the movie was seen and talked by a dead narrator. This is related to everyday life for some people and it showed a story through experience. I also strongly agree that Angela is a symbol in the movie, and she represents Lester's old wife, and the way his wife used to be. He fantasizes about Angela, and whenever he thinks about her there are always roses in the scene. Lester sees how Carolyn used to be through the representation of Angela. There is definitely a comparison of these two women throughout the film."
only_myschly,"May 3, 2005",10/10,"I don't know how to really describe it except that if you're not prude you WILL love this movie.The acting, perfect. The shooting, perfect. The music, perfect. The script, perfect.I don't know how much of help this has been, so all I have to say is 'Go watch this movie, but not with your kids if you have any'. You wont regret it, it's easily one of the best movies ever made, I usually don't like movies with lots of half-erotic scenes, since it sometimes gets boring, but this movie is an exception. The sorrows in the characters lives and their turning points makes you reflect on your life, and I must say that even though my life isn't like any of theirs I feel like I've learned a lot from this movie."
Stud-12,"Oct 10, 1999",10/10,"I saw this film on a whim and was more than pleasantly surprised. The story line is incredible, and rather realistic. Kevin Spacy's acting is wonderful, as it is all around. I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Spacy lives the suburban (as well as my own) nightmare. His character is so believable that I could swear he was me. A wonderful, yet darkly uplifting, movie."
sscross30,"Jul 31, 2011",N/A,"American Beauty is a 1999 drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. The film stars Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham and Annette Bening co-starring as Carolyn Burnham. The film also features Thora Birch as Jane, the daughter of Lester and Carolyn, Mena Suvari as Angela, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper and Allison Janney are also featured in the film.The film centers around Lester Burnham and his relationship with his wife, who is an over-achieving realtor who has drifted away from her husband, a non-existing relationship with his daughter, Jane, who he thinks hates him, and finally with Angela, his daughter's friend in which he is infatuated with. The film also delves into the relationship of the Burnham's new neighbors, Colonel Fits and his wife and son Ricky.The theme of the film is that people are not always what they appear to be. For example Angela was a beautiful girl, Lester sees her as this sex symbol, yet in the end finds out that she is indeed a virgin. Colonel Fits runs a tight ship at home and wants everyone to conform to the way he sees things. He beats his son Ricky after he falsely admits to being gay. In the end it is revealed that in fact Colonel Fits is gay.The film uses red rose petals as motifs several times throughout the film whenever Lester is thinking of Angela. The use of narration by Lester gives the audience an insight into what he was thinking and feeling. At the lowest point in Lester's life, his thoughts of Angela drove him to do things like buying and smoking marijuana, in efforts to relive portions of his childhood.Another theme in the film would be that youth and beauty equates happiness. When Lester did things like lust after a teenage girl and smoke marijuana, he seemed happy. Ricky sees beauty in everyday life, videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was ""an entire life behind things""; he feels that ""sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it ... and my heart is going to cave in."""
george-coufos1,"Jul 28, 2025",7/10,"It's too bad about Kevin Spacey's character flaws. Prior to all the trouble, like when this movie was released I really enjoyed watching him, and he always seemed to make excellent career choices - or maybe it was his versatility that made it seem that way.I can't imagine another actor in this particular role. But as good as Spacey is, Annette Bening is even better as the ambitious real estate agent climbing the ladder to success. She absolutely nails this role, creating a character that alternates between seeking status and accolades to desperately seeking acceptance while losing herself in her garden.Both Spacey and Bening are exceptional and through their relationship American Beauty shows us that the repression we thought was left being in the 1950s is still going strong at the turn of the century.Lots of laughs come with these revelations.In fact the entire cast is top notch and fit in perfectly. The only flaws in that regard is Spacey. As great as he is, he falls short incobeying hetero, mid-life crisis style infatuation. But he makes up for it in his own career struggles and ultimate surrender."
bird26,"Apr 27, 2005",10/10,"This is truly an excellent movie. However I can see why some people do not enjoy nor like this movie, this is by no means the kind of movie you grab some pop corn and drink then watch through it. This is a movie that requires you to concentrate on every scene, and think about the meanings behind them. That is what makes this movie great.Unlike most movies in nowdays, there is no hero, there is no running chasing blowing things up to give the audiences adrenaline rush. This is a drama that will make you re-evaluable your life with respect to your culture, every protocol we know in life versus our desire to seek happiness. It is a movie that in a very realistically subconscious way depict our modern lives.I will not go in much detail here to spoil the movie, if you have not seen this movie, see it. I cannot guarantee that you will like it, but I can assure that if you think about what the movie is trying to say, you will have a happier life :)"
Ruskington,"Apr 30, 2020",7/10,"While American Beauty has a novel and unique story, I'm not sure it is as edgy and profound as many people seem to think it is. The characters are basically all horrible and their behaviours are far too excessive to be believable.The scenes with the brooding teenage boy and his escape into photography are all a bit teen-angst melodrama, which is fairly indicative of the movie's pretentiousness. It is still highly entertaining and often hilarious but the one-dimensional characters prevent it from being a masterpiece."

manendra-lodhi,"Oct 21, 2012",8/10,"The film is the showcase of American people lifestyle. However I do believe that films do present things with a little exaggeration and that they are mostly not true (Unless of course based on true incident.). But considering that 40% of all is true I pitied while watching the movie, because of the sad lives of the American families. The story of the film is good and is told from the perspective of a Man named Lester. He is having trouble holding everything together and especially when his family doesn't show much respect to him. There are interesting things too when he gets attracted to one of a friend of his daughter and even fantasizes to have sex with her. While the film does not offer anything great in the story but there is a little feel of reality in that which might make you curious. I have always loved family dramas because they are the best source of information about the middle class people of that country. To be really true I felt like laughing after watching the film. Having watched a lot of dramas in various languages we have the portrayal of American family which is so sad.PROS:The film has emotional dramas mixed with a little humor at appropriate places. There are misunderstandings also. There is a hidden message present in the film. I feel happy to say that the director was able to portray a very important thing – ""Happiness"". When you will focus on the characters, you will found out that no one was happy in reality. All of them were hiding behind a sense of misjudgment. Sometimes even this is conveyed through dialogs when the characters say to each other's that you are just a sad old man. The movie wanted to convey that you have to really find happiness somewhere; otherwise ultimately you will get frustrated. Then this frustration ultimately leads to a lot of further problems.CONS:While everything including the story and the acting of the cast was perfect, I felt like some kind of energy was lacking in the film. It will give you instances to laugh or feel bad but all comes too slowly and have a dull demeanor.MESSAGE: ""Find Happiness.""VERDICT: ""A recommended watch."""
cinemapersonified,"Jun 13, 2023",10/10,"Rating: 9.5
Overall, an Incredible Movie that used the setting of a dying Suburban America to show the true beauty of America and finding self purpose when it may be too late, something that is effectively carried out in a career defining performance from Kevin Spacey and an Incredible Screenplay filled with many symbols.Great to Incredible Direction (Especially the ability to capture the symbols, illusions, and acting performances all at once), Great Acting (Brilliant from Kevin Spacey (Especially his ability to change moods very quickly and for him to display emotion through monotonous expressions (as if the character was written for Spacey to play, a true masterclass)), Incredible from Annette Bening (with her ability to capture dying beauty and someone who is trying to escape her mid-life crisis), Very Good from Mena Suvari (was able to convey someone who was trying so hard to escape from being ordinary by lying about who she really is), Good to Very Good from Wes Bentley, Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (in a modern retelling of Lolita), Incredible to Brilliant Screenplay (the dialogue was extremely conversational and used as a real tool to help convey emotions and the message, the symbols were omnipresent (especially the rose to display beauty and innocence) in helping convey the message), Good Score, Great Cinematography to show perspective, Great to Incredible Editing (helps separate reality from illusions), Great to Incredible Visual Effects (see Editing), Plot Structure was Great because you see how each character goes through development at each stage (especially Lester), Pacing was Very Good (no need to cut or add any scenes), Build to the climax was done very well because it is a gradual build throughout the entire movie; the climax itself was a carried out very well as you get to see Lester's real motivations in life and him being content for the first time in forever, Narration was a vital part (unlike its use in other movies) as it is used to drive the story forward (and not just tell it); the message of the movie (trying to fine beauty in a fractured suburban America) is effectively conveyed very well through the movie's themes and symbols (like the rose)"
