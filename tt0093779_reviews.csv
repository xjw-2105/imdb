SnoopyStyle,"Dec 26, 2013",9/10,"A boy (Fred Savage) is home sick, and to his dismay, his grandfather (Peter Falk) has come to read him a fairy tale. It's the story of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls for farmboy ""As you wish"" Westley (Cary Elwes). He goes off to make his fortune, but after news of his death, Buttercup is being married off to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). Then the princess bride gets kidnapped by three rogues (Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, André the Giant).This is possibly the best fairy tale reimagining ever. Peter Falk's feign indifference narration sets off the great adventure, and Fred Savage has just the best balance. Director Rob Reiner has put together all the fairy tale snippets and create something even better. The characters are memorable. And who could forget the fun that Wallace Shawn has choosing the poison drink. Mandy Patinkin is absolutely amazing as the swordsman seeking revenge from the six finger man. And there will never be another André the Giant."
TheLittleSongbird,"Mar 28, 2009",9/10,"Princess Bride is something that is really special. It is well designed, well directed and well acted. Rob Reiner is a very good director indeed, directing films like Stand By Me and all that. The film itself is beautiful, with lovely sets and costumes, matched with a funny and touching script, not to mention quotable. The story was simple, but very well-developed, with a few surprises here and there. As for the acting, it is superb. Cary Elwes is a very charismatic lead as Westley, and Robin Wright gives a very spirited performance as Princess Buttercup. Chris Sarandon is a little annoying, but he has some delicious throw-away lines, so you warm to him, especially when Westley insults him at the end. Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant and Christopher Guest(who bares a mere resemblance to Tim Curry's Cardinal Richelieu) were very good too, as is an unrecognisable Billy Crystal. And Mandy Patinkin is deliciously hammy as the man who wishes to avenge his father's death by killing his six-fingered murderer. But what impressed me most were the funny interruptions with the grandfather(played wonderfully by Colombo's Peter Falk)and his sick grandson(Fred Savage). All in all, an original and funny movie that is a must see. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox."
robbijean,"Dec 8, 1999",10/10,"This is one of those rare films that gets better each time you watch it. With something for everyone, The Princess Bride combines romance, action, adventure and parody to create the perfect movie.Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are beautiful to watch and the story of their love is a wonderful backdrop to the adventure and intrigue played out in this story. Mandy Patinkin is wonderful as Inigo and gets to deliver some of the best lines in the film. Chris Sarandon is perfect in his role as the bad guy prince.The plot is rich, with adult innuendos the kids will miss all together and levels of wit to entertain the whole family. The dialogue is full of very funny catch phrases-  many of which are still part of my repertoire more than a decade after I first saw the movie.   If you like dry humor and fast wit, The Princess Bride will make your day.I have owned this video since 1988 and still watch it regularly - it has become my 'sick day' movie because it is such a joy."
Little Raven,"Jan 10, 2001",10/10,"There's enough reviews here to show how enjoyable and entertaining this movie is, but I had to put my own word in...I simply love this movie. I watched it with my parents when I was very young, and have been watching it constantly ever since. It's a movie that I just can't seem to grow tired of. For one, I absolutely love the medieval fantasy genre, both in books and movies. From a small child I've loved knights, castles, dragons. the whole sort. This movie, quite simply, puts the viewer into an imaginative world where everything seems real. Second, the characters are so enjoyable to watch, you really begin to feel for them - all of them. Even humperdink, whose name does him justice, gets pity at the end. Lastly, the grandfather's list of the qualities of the book at the very beginning are all true... this story has everything. That is why it is such a classic, when everything comes down to it. From the moving love story between Wesly and Buttercup, to the dynamic and brilliantly scripted duel between the Man in Black and Indigo, to even the hilarious bickering from Vezinni to his lovable giant, Fezzik... This movie finds a place to include EVERYTHING one can imagine.  The story moves along at a great pace, and you feel as though the whole land has been covered when the book is closed. Furthermore, the whole conception of using the ""telling a story"" approach doesn't taken away from the realism of the story, but raises it even more by showing how mesmerized the boy is, listening to the tale - just as we are, in front of the screen.Maybe it was how I was captivated to the screen, watching it as a child... Maybe it was how I'd pop the movie in and turn a boring Sunday afternoon an exciting adventure as I grew up... Or maybe it's how I can sit down with friends and all enjoy the movie together, laughing at its funny parts, and cheering at it's exciting moments. The movie has a place in my heart, and that will never go away. A ""10"" on the scale, and even these words, can't begin to tell how much I love this movie."
Anonymous_Maxine,"Aug 6, 2002",10/10,"I'm not exactly sure what exactly it is that makes The Princess Bride such a spectacular film. Or, at the very least, I just can't pinpoint a single characteristic about it that really rises above all others as the main reason that no one should miss it. Indeed, it has a title that should prove to be remarkably uninteresting to the typical action adventure fan (okay, MALE action adventure fan), but even the most die-hard Die Hard fan would love this film. It is extremely important not to judge this film just because it has such a flowery and dangerously (at the risk of sounding shallow) girly name, because it is full of wonderful adventure and even some good killing and violence. Does this belong in this kind of romantic comedy? Absolutely! The cover box of the film looks like that of a cheesy romance novel, but the film is truly great from start to finish. And, indeed, the film is very aware of the superficial impression that it leaves, and it even presents it directly through Fred Savage's initial response to his grandfather reading him the story. But as the film goes on, we begin to have the same reaction that Fred has. We can't get enough.Cary Elwes delivers by far the most outstanding performance of his career as Westley, the love-struck servant to Buttercup, a beautiful blonde woman living in a misty romantic fantasy world. Sadly, Elwes' later career has been punctuated by roles that do not serve him well, especially after such a stunning performance in this role. Liar Liar and Twister come immediately to mind. Robin Wright also gives one of the best performances of her career in her film debut here as Princess Buttercup, but the real quality of the performances that makes the movie so great is the fact that they were able to pack the film full of comic relief (it was nearly nonstop from start to finish) without taking anything away from the tension or the overall respectability of the film. It is interesting to consider the polar opposite effect of the comic relief on the vast majority of the James Bond films. Wallace Shawn is absolutely hilarious as Vizzini, the bonehead villain who is completely convinced that he has the whole world figured out, Andre the Giant delivers a lumbering but highly impressive performance as Vizzini's enormous, idiot sidekick, and by far my favorite of all, Mandy Patinkin creates one of the most entertaining and likeable characters created in a film in the entire decade of the 1980s (`My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!').This is great stuff. Told as a story read from a book, just like The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride provides a magical mix of romance and fantasy and action and comedy to provide an enormously entertaining film for moviegoers of all ages. The Princess Bride is an absolutely wonderful film that is truly not to be missed."
estebangonzalez10,"Sep 11, 2015",7/10,"""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.""I know, I picked the most quotable line of this epic fairy tale (sorry for being such a cliché), but it was honestly the scene I enjoyed the most in this movie. Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride is one of his most revered films and it has become a cult favorite over time. I didn't fall in love with it however, but I can understand the appeal this romantic fantasy has on so many people considering it has it all: a tale of true love, adventures involving pirates, sword-fights, fantasy creatures, and a princess who is forced to marry against her will. The premise is no different from that of your typical damsel in distress fairy tale, but the way the film seems to be mocking and honoring those familiar elements at the same time are what makes it stand out. It has a unique innocent quality to it while remaining funny, charming, and sweet. Perhaps I would've benefited from watching this at a younger age, but having waited so long to experience it for the first time was a bit of an underwhelming experience. I wasn't swept away by its magical and fantastic elements and the love story didn't stand out from other romantic tales. There are several fun scenes and unexpected character interactions, but during most of the film I felt a bit bored. The satire works in parts and so does the fantasy, but it just felt too familiar to win me over entirely.The screenplay was adapted by William Goldman from his own novel of the same name. Although for this film he uses a grandfather (Peter Falk) to narrate the story as he is telling it to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). At first the grandson isn't too keen about having his grandpa read him a story, especially because it starts off with kissing, but once the adventure begins he's hooked. There are occasional interruptions that bring us back to the kid's room, but most of the film takes place in this fantasy land where we are introduced to a very beautiful woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls in love with her farm boy, Westley (Cary Elwes). The two have found true love, but having no money to marry he embarks on a trip and promises to return to her. Buttercup is shattered when she hears that Westley was killed by a fearful pirate named Roberts. With nothing more to look forward to, eventually she gets engaged with Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) of Florin who promises to turn her into a princess. On the eve of her wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped by a man named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) and his two hired henchmen, Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) a skilled swordsman who has promised to avenge his father's death, and the strong but gentle giant Fezzik (Andre the Giant) who really doesn't know no better. While holding Buttercup ransom and fleeing from the site, they discover that they are being followed by a mysterious man in a black mask. He catches up with them soon and the adventure begins as these men face off with one another and new revelations are made.Allowing for the story to take place through this narrative style was one of the better decisions because it gave the film its unique dreamy style and it wasn't necessary to deliver realistic visuals. It was all part of the fantasy, although I would've preferred less interruptions, but I guess they had to give Fred Savage and Peter Falk some more lines. The relationship between Elwes and Wright was believable, but it didn't stand out because it was too familiar. However, they were both the perfect casting choice for these roles. It was Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya who stole the movie for me. I absolutely loved his character and the sword fighting scene was the highlight of the movie for me. It included a brilliant homage to Douglas Fairbanks (which I'm sure gave someone the idea that Elwes would be the perfect choice to spoof his Robin Hood character in a later movie). Montoya was probably the inspiration for Antonio Banderas as well when he was cast to play the Zorro. This character has become an icon and he was the saving grace of the film for me. The rest of the characters were OK, but he stood out. The exception and I think I'm in the minority here was Vizzini. I found Wallace Shawn's portrayal of him rather irritating and I couldn't stand him. There is also a hilarious scene with Billy Crystal playing a miracle doctor, who you'd only recognize due to his voice because he is heavily covered in make up to look like an old man. The Princess Bride had its strong moments, but somehow I never managed to fall in love with the fantasy and wouldn't consider it one of Reiner's best films. It does prove however what a versatile director he is because the film is very different from his other works. I'm still a bit shocked that the film is so widely loved, but I can't argue it isn't a good movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
moviemind-53481,"Jan 19, 2020",10/10,"To call The Princess Bride a classic is to understate it's significance. The Princess Bride is not only a great movie, it is above all else, a GOOD movie. It unites us as a culture and reveals within our collective nature a longing for the simple times when heroes were righteous and pure, villains were dastardly and vile, redemption was always possible for the wayward soul, and true love could overcome any obstacle. I pray we can find those days again."
Sagitta86,"Mar 2, 2004",10/10,"""As you wish..."" ""Inconceivable!"" ""My name is Inigo Montoya...""I love this film so much.From its opening scenes of the young boy being read a story by his kindly Grandfather to the romance, action, adventure and fun of the fairy tale. The Princess bride tells the tale of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) and her true love Westley (Elwes)who become separated through the course of an unfortunate event involving some pirates. Westley's destiny is to rescue Buttercup from the clutches of an evil Prince so that they might be together again. Yet he's not bargained on some of the wonderful characters that he will meet (and befriend) along the way...This film is so deliciously acted, made and written that it is a treat to watch.I've lost count of how many times I've seen it now. But every time I still gain the same enormous amount of pleasure from watching it. A movie that is a delight for the young and just as much fun for everyone else.The actors are all superb in their roles ('perfect casting' does not come close to describing it!) A young Cary Elwes is suitably dashing as our cocky hero (check out the sword fighting!)and Robin Wright is good as the beautiful Buttercup. Mandy Patinkin is great as the vengeful Inigo Montoya who utters that famous ""you killed my father. prepare to die"" line. Everyone else gives there all, including Christoper Guest, Chris Sarandon (as the main villian), Wallace Shawn, the late Andre The Giant,Mel Smith, and Billy Crystal.Even though it is about 18 years old, the humour and sly jokes are still as sharp today as they were back in 1987.You know you are watching a great movie when you here Elwes' ""To the pain..."" speech near the end. You've probably seen The Princess Bride. If so...go and watch it again. Right now, and remind yourself how good it is! And if you haven't- what are you waiting for? Go and check it out now! It's worth it! Hands up who can quote this entire film off by heart! ;)Watch out for:The R.O.U.S's Elwes' and Patinkin's Sword/word fight The Miracle Max scene When our heroes storm the castle (Go Inigo! Go Inigo!) Elwes' ""To the pain..."" speech. (Superb. Shows what a great (and unfortunately underused) actor he is)"
jbrumundsmith,"Apr 24, 2023",4/10,"I saw this movie when I was very young (like 10) and did not remember much from it. I know it is a popular movie and see memes of it all over the place. So I figured I would give it an enthusiastic shot and watch it again as an adult (43 m).What am I missing? Why do people like this movie? Someone please explain it to me. Yes, seeing Andre the Giant is fun. Sure, the ""Inconceivable"" guy has a few good scenes. But other than that...what is there to be enjoyed here?Honestly, someone explain it to me. I asked my friends afterwards and they said, ""It's funny!"" Where?! Again, other than the characters I mentioned earlier, I do not see how any other characters are even attempting to be humorous.Why do people like this movie so much? Why is it considered a classic?!"
llltdesq,"Sep 28, 2003",9/10,"This film is an intelligent, sardonic send up of several genres that pokes fun (affectionately) at fairy tales, swashbucklers, love stories and basic conventions of film.  One of my favorite scenes is where Inigo Montoya first confronts his quarry after years of searching.  His adversary does the unexpected-and what most villains in real life WOULD do under the same circumstances, with hilarious results in the scene.  Basil Rathbone probably whirled in his grave!Not by any means Citizen Kane (we already have one of those, anyway) but a champ in its weight class, with a perfect score, a fine script and good performances.  Far more true to the flavor of the original fairy tales that it spoofs than even the best of Disney's takes.  I loved it the first time I saw it and love it more now.  Well worth watching.  Recommended."
vortex-4,"Oct 17, 1998",9/10,"The simplest pleasures in life are the best, and this film is one of them. Combining a rather basic storyline of love and adventure this movie transcends the usual weekend fair with wit and unmitigated charm.  Every character is a delight and you just want to see more of them.  ""The Princess Bride"" is based on the unsurpassed novel by William Goldman, who also penned the screenplay. While this is a movie review, I cannot recommend the book on which it is based more highly.  It is quite simply the most humorous, enthralling fable ever written and will fill in many details that were impossible to include on the screen.  The only other movie of this type that I can think of that is this much fun was Danny Kaye's ""The Court Jester,"" another costumed comedy/adventure/romance that I also highly recommend."
aerator,"Apr 19, 2004",N/A,"Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, and Robin Wright Penn star in this classic fairy tale entitled The Princess Bride. It is based on a novel by William Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay. Director Rob Reiner brings life to this story and effectively evokes the enchanting spirit of the witty 1973 novel.The movie opens with a sick boy (Fred Savage) who receives a visit from his grandfather (Peter Falk) who intends to read to him from his favorite book. The boy is not exactly pleased to be distracted from his world of video games. However, his mood quickly changes as he and the viewer are transported to a place out of time. We are taken to Florin, a kingdom in an imaginary land, complete with dashing heroes, cowardly princes, rhyming giants, rodents of unusual size, fancy swordfights, and yes . . . even some kissing.This fairy tale begins on a farm in the countryside. There lives a beautiful, young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) who learns that ""as you wish"" really means ""I love you"" when she falls for her farmhand Westley (Cary Elwes). While trying to seek his fortune, Westley disappears at sea and becomes an apparent victim of the Dread Pirate Roberts. A few years later, Buttercup, who is now engaged to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), is kidnapped by a trio of misfits, which includes brains--Vizzini (Wallace Shawn); brawn--Fezzik (André the Giant); and sword--Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin). As they sail away toward the Cliffs of Insanity, they notice the pursuit of a man in black. Now begins the adventure . . . .The central idea of The Princess Bride is that true love can conquer all. Throughout the movie, there are many hardships and trials that true love must endure. The movie keeps the viewer guessing until the very end whether or not there will be the classic fairy tale ending.This movie is appealing to me because of the classic fairy tale style combined with the witty humor, well choreographed action sequences, and intense instances of suspense. The characters are well developed and all the actors give an amazing performance which adds to the overall appeal of the movie. The Princess Bride is easily one of my all time favorite movies."
emeraldnum01,"Mar 12, 2001",10/10,"The Princess Bride is a wonderful family film about a maiden named Buttercup and her ""farmboy"" Wesley. When Wesley goes away to seek his fortune, he is reported to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Hearing this really gets Buttercup down, and it only gets worse when Prince Humperdink chooses her to be his bride.( Hence the title) To make a long story short and not give away the ending, Buttercup's kidnapped for suspicious reasons and rescued by someone familiar. She's in love and nothing can stop true love! A couple of deaths, a would be wedding, revenge fulfilled, and a couple reunited end this gala of a film. But this doesn't even sum it up, I promise! I love this film because it does not take itself too seriously and flows well across the screen. The main characters and their supporting cast are quirky and memorable. You will be repeating classic lines like, ""My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!"" over and over again. Through the adventures of Wesley and Buttercup you feel drawn to the characters and fall in love with their ability to amuse you. Do you want to be entertained with a light hearted fantasy/comedy? Then head on over to your local video store and pick up a copy. Ready to enjoy? ""As you wish."""
jenpcraft,"Jul 3, 2003",8/10,"I love this movie!  It's sweet, but with satirical humor. The dialogue is great and the adventure scenes are fun.  Rob Reiner shows an excellent touch once again with comedy and a childlike point of view.  It manages to be whimsical romantic while laughing at the conventions of the fairy tale genre. I would recommend it to just about anyone. I've seen it several times, and I'm always happy to see it again whenever I have a friend who hasn't seen it yet. I haven't watched it with any kids, but I think it has lots for them too. There are wonderful quotes throughout.  I think Mandy Patinkin absolutely steals the scenes he is in as the Spaniard Inigo Montoya, bent on avenging his father's death. I gave it 8 out of 10 mainly because it feels very light, but I may go back and change to 9 thinking of how happy this movie makes me and it's rewatchability."
cgf376,"Oct 23, 2011",7/10,"Despite the glaring flaws you will find in this movie. It remains one of my favorite ones to watch for a number of reasons.1) It has EVERYTHING! Action, comedy, drama, suspense, revenge, fairy- tales, heroes, villains, pirates, giants, miracle men, even rodents of unusual size. There is a reason it is always among the list of Best Movies, Funniest Movies, and Best Love Stories of All Time.2) The CAST. Hard to name a more fitting princess than the beautiful Robin Wright, Cary Elwes can sweep you off your feet as a farmboy or a masked man, Mandy Patinkin delivers the most memorable quote of his career, and the rest of the ensemble transport you into their magical world.3) It has ROBIN WRIGHT in it! Did I say that already?4) It brings out the KID in me and the nostalgia of those days. If only for two hours you can go to a distant land and be on an adventure and feel positive and young again.5) It has plenty of MEMORABLE LINES and scenes.SOME MISSES: - SPECIAL EFFECTS are pretty lame, even by 80's standards (the rodents could not have been more fake and some of the props are sub-standard) - STORY: Predictable and full of clichés - SCRIPT/DIALOGUE: While there are numerous memorable lines, they are repeated too frequently throughout the course of the movie. The script was simplistic. And to be objective, not too funny for most adults. - ACTING: There isn't much depth to any of the characters but the script didn't give the actors much to work with, for starters. Younger audiences may not notice it, but older ones may cringe in some scenes - CHEESE FACTOR: oh boy, it has plenty. It openly deals with ""True Love"" in a fantasy environment so it's pretty much set-up for sappy-ness.FOR: - People who still have their inner child intact somewhere - Family movie night - Slumber Party with the girls - Reminiscing with others who have seen this movie as a kidNOT FOR: - Kids who are too young (who might get scared by giant rats, some fighting, torture, talk of killing, and kissing scenes) - People who take themselves too seriously or are jaded cynics - Grown-ups who will be seeing this for the first time and have been misled by the high ratingsBOTTOM LINE: Cheesy Mac & Cheese with bacon bits. My favorite food ever since I was a kid. It was yummy then and still yummy now and I don't have to explain why I love it, I just do. If only for the fact that I've carried my love for this movie since childhood, my sentimental attachment to it would give it a 10/10.But then my Mac & Cheese, no matter how yummy, is never gonna get 3 Michelin stars next to a dish with fancy truffles. As a MOVIE, stripped of my nostalgia, this one is mediocre at best. There are more imaginative fantasy movies, funnier comedies, more romantic love stories, and more exciting adventures."
UniqueParticle,"Dec 4, 2020",10/10,"Such a lovely story that is charming, funny, beautiful, and highly entertaining! A beloved tale told by a grandfather to character of Fred Savage which is magnificently filled with sweet vibes flowing through it. The cast is perfection of awesomeness; I'm glad Rob Reiner created this! Still holds up as cult classic 34 years later. It's crazy too when I was younger some of it was scary to me."
alombardy,"Jun 2, 2014",6/10,"This movie is on the higher end of 'meh'. It's seen as something of a comedy classic today, and I can see how in 1987, it probably felt very fresh and as such received a very positive response. I'd have probably enjoyed it more if I'd seen it then. But I just don't think it holds up - it's not terrible by any means, but I don't think it's quite as good as people seem to remember it as being.So it's a fantasy-comedy-adventure that (obviously) doesn't take itself too seriously. As such the plot is fairly predictable and the characters largely played for laughs - which is fine - but I don't think it's actually done consistently well. There are definitely some funny moments, but I think I only laughed properly three times in this film. Partially I think it's because that, by now, we've seen this kind of comedy a lot (again, at the time, I'm sure it was a lot newer and fresher), and moved on from comedy based around the fact that apparently Spanish accents are funny (here's looking at you Fawlty Towers).It looks really cheap, and yes, I appreciate it's nearly 30 years old, but a lot of films made in the 80s (even in the 70s) had better effects and sets than this. There isn't really any ambition with the world it's set in - it's very dull and stereotypical and it doesn't really fit with the fact that this is supposed to be a kooky, original world.The guy who played the Spaniard aside, I just don't think it was acted very well either. The female lead especially is wooden, and there was absolutely nothing (even comedic) to her character or given in her performance.I couldn't really get into the 'story within a story' element either - the granddad telling the story to his grandchild is shown for about 10 minutes and there's nothing to it - I just kept asking myself why? Why did they choose this setup? It doesn't help the overall flow of the film in any way and just seemed like an odd choice.As I said, there were a few good laughs, but not enough for me to want to see this again any time soon. It has its fans but I think a lot of them need to remove the nostalgic veneer of their memory of this film and come back now and watch it. A warning: you may be disappointed. 6/10."

Xstal,"Sep 8, 2020",6/10,"I reckon you need to be in the mood when you get to a certain age (for many things, not just for this); several glasses of wine (doesn't always work) and maybe a seasonal occasion, where you can comfortably take it hook, line and sinker, without a care in the world. I fancy they had a great time making it and I wish I'd enjoyed it as much as most others seem to have, although it does feel a bit dated. Columbo and Billy Crystal always make me smile though."

God bless, and RIP."
CinemaClown,"Sep 20, 2014",N/A,"A romance, a comedy, an adventure & a fantasy, The Princess Bride is an amalgamation of all of these and is a fairy tale that has been passed from fathers to sons for generations and here is presented in the form of a novel that is being read by a grandfather to his grandson, thus making sure that the book's narrative style & structure is kept entirely preserved.The Princess Bride tells the story of Buttercup who falls in love with a farm guy but loses him and is at last engaged to the Prince of the region. One day, she is kidnapped & held against her will by three hired helpers; a Sicilian boss, a Spanish swordsman & a giant. But they soon find themselves being pursued by a mysterious masked man who's gaining on their trail.Rob Reiner has directed some well-known classics (A Few Good Men, Stand by Me & When Harry Met Sally...) but most people are still not familiar with his name because unlike other filmmakers, he has no unique style of shooting a film or possesses a trademark. And this is another one of his films that's pretty different in style & approach when compared to his other works. And Reiner does a good job at it.The screenplay is adapted from the book of the same name in a manner that preserves its narrative style, camera-work & editing nicely compliment each other, visuals effects never aims for a realistic portrayal of the world depicted in the story plus it benefits very much from its sweet, tender & pleasant performances from its cast, including Andre the Giant.On an overall scale, there isn't much wrong with The Princess Bride & carries out most of its elements the way it's meant to be. More entertaining than what I was expecting from it, definitely showing a lot of heart, warmth & charm and yet it didn't click enough with me for I'm not really a fan of fairy tales. But for those who've read the book or heard the story or even many newcomers, this will be a delightful experience."
Coxer99,"Mar 25, 1999",10/10,"One of those great treasures that you cannot dislike. No matter how many times you see, it takes you breath away, makes you laugh and gives you a taste of the old swashbuckler films of the 1930's. Rob Reiner directs this wonderful romance-comedy-adventure with passion and wit. A classic in a class of its own."

Not only is it a well-written screenplay and has been rated over 8/10 stars by most movie critiques but it has been nominated for five awards and has won five other awards, some including the ""People's Choice Award"" and the ""Saturn Award."" In addition, this movie also features a dynamic cast. The entire cast did a remarkable job in making this fairytale realistic (to an extent). One example is about how the combat (sword fights, flips, tricks, etc.) scenes were well done and rehearsed. They kept the viewers on the edge of their seats through every ""clink"" of a sword and ""swoosh"" from a flip. Another is how the make-up and costumes in the movie added a great effect to the cast of characters, especially to the older, more mystical characters featured, such as Miracle Max and his wife. The 1987 release of The Princess Bride shows viewers that this movie making process took time and consideration, along with an amazing cast, and a hard working crew, creating a story that's to be a great audience pleaser.Three evil villains, a cruel Prince, a beautiful bride, a hero, Cliffs of Insanity, a Pit of Despair, and so much more chaos and adventure—no one has ever had to fight this hard for true love."
CinemaSerf,"May 29, 2025",7/10,"Maybe not too surprisingly, a poorly young lad (Fred Savage) isn't so keen on lying in bed being read a slushy romance about a princess by his granddad (Peter Falk) but he knows this book has been passed down through generations of the family and so decides to indulge the well-meaning gent. It doesn't get any more scintillating for him when he is introduced to the lovelorn heroine ""Buttercup"" (Robin Wright) who has lost the love of her life ""Westley"" (Cary Elwes) and in return been saddled with the foppish ""Prince Humperdinck"" (Chris Sarendon). Fortunately for her, she is kidnapped by a rather un-intimidating band of felons led by ""Vizzini"" (Wallace Shawn) with the giant ""Fezzik"" (André René Roussimoff) and elegant swordsman ""Montoya"" (Mandy Patinkin) in tow, too. It turns out that they are all being pursued by the dastardly ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" who just happens to be the evil man who robbed her of her beloved ""Westley"". Of course, when the prince finds out his betrothed has been abducted, he determines to fetch her back and so he employs the services of ""Rugen"" (Christopher Guest) to join this tale of pin the tail on the princess. The thing is, as we quite quickly discover - there has been quite a bit of misinformation spreading over the years and the young woman is in for quite a shock as her travels become less travails and more a triumph. Can she still manage to avoid becoming the princess bride though? I enjoyed this theatrically presented and colourful romp as it manages to mix elements of Gilbert and Sullivan with lots of swash and buckle, some genuinely entertaining pantomime-style villainy, loads of acrobatics and yes, even a slight soupçon of romance that could make the young reader (and us, too) cringe a little. Elwes and Wright work really quite well together, and with Roussimoff and Patinkin helping it to keep it's magical tongue in it's mystical cheek, the whole film is a rollicking good series of escapades and antics that just goes to show what can be done with some creative and imaginative production design, a lively and mischievous score and some talent in front and behind the camera who all seemed to be having a great time. Time has been kind to this, and those of us brought up on ""Zorro"" and C. S. Lewis with a bit of Errol Flynn thrown in too, ought to enjoy this. I did."
ma-cortes,"Nov 11, 2018",7/10,"An outlandish, offbeat satire of the genre, being a modern retelling of the essential fairy tale plenty with attractive scenes, all of them make this one an amusing an entertaining story as children as adults. A contemporary rendition upon the basic fairy tale jammed with all the cliches, outright satirical humor , sense of style, Error Flynn adventure and Pythonesque shafts of humor . It deals with an irreverent love story between a gorgeous maiden, Buttercup: Robin Wright Penn, and her young swan lover , Gary Elwes, this one helped by a duo of brave warriors : the assertive Mandy Patinkin and the huge Andre the Giant, both of whom battle the wicked evils of the mythical kingdom of Florin to be reunited with one another. When Buttercup is destined as consort to the wicked prince, Chris Sarandon, she is kidnapped, then our starring has to save her through a series of life-threatening exploits. Meanwhile, a grandfather , Peter Falk, tells his grandson, Fred Savage, the marvelous tale.This adventurously enjoyable romance movie centers around a wonderful adventure crammed with traditional fantasy, including great dueling scenes, damsel in distress, dashing protagonist and evil villains. It exudes a certain innocence, sense of wonder and upright enthusiasm into the proceedings. The main interest lies in attempting to recognise the well known cast, many of them beneath mounds of makeup. Gary Elwes and Robin Wright give charming interpretations. Mandy Patinkin injects any real enthusiasm to his undaunted revengeful role . Support cast is frankly excellent. As Christopher Guest as a James Mason-like villain, as well as the sympathetic Wallace Shawn . Peter Falk as the old storyteller does a Granpa Columbo. And some miscast comic cameos such as Peter Cook, Mel Smith, Billy Crystal and Carol Kane .It displays a colorful and glimmering cinematography by Adrian Biddle. As well as a sensitive and unforgettable musical score by Mark Knofler from Dire Streets. Based on William Goldman's cult book being well updated and compellingly directed by Rob Reiner(This is a Spinal Tap, Alex and Emma). A better than average fantasy that kids will probably love it. Rating :7.5/10 essential and indispensable watching."

I've seen it several times on recommendation of my friends and I have tried very hard to find the humor in the story, but I just don't understand it.  I think this movie is very boring, unoriginal, and completely unfunny.  I wish I could only understand why everyone thinks this movie is so comical."
stefire-99080,"Jan 18, 2020",10/10,"This movie is still one of my all time favorites, after all these years! Just a couple days ago, my 28 year old daughter and I were watching, and talking about Andre the Giant. Still watching, still talking, and still learning about the great stuff this movie has brought."
wkforeman,"May 28, 2018",10/10,"Maybe a spoiler at the end....maybe. It is 2018 and this movie is now 31 years old. I am pushing 70 and have watched several thousand movies. For clean family-viewable entertainment, this has to be in almost everyone's all time top ten. Or five. Mandy Patinkin, a very fine actor, was never better than as Inigo Montoya, the Spanish swordsman. Robin Wright, barely 21, was exquisite as Buttercup. Cary Elwes has never, IMO, been quite as good as he was as Westley...but then, he was superlative as Westley, setting the bar very, very high. All of the acting ranges from good to great. The inclusion of Andre as Fezzik was random ""geniusness""....it just worked, and worked oh so incredibly well. I have watched this movie many times and I still love it. The outer wrap of grandfather Peter Falk reading the story to his grandson Fred Savage takes the ""Family Friendliness"" rating to a fifty on a 1-10 scale. There are many, many characters to enjoy in this fanciful tale; my personal favorite has always been Inigo Montoya. The sword fight scene remains, for me, one of the finest pieces of dramatic comedy I've ever seen, no matter who was the victor."
fern_parsons,"Oct 24, 2014",10/10,"I very rarely like to put 10/10 for a rating of something as I feel nothing is perfect. However, this movie i feel is so close to that 10/10 it would be wrong not to award it this. Although it may not be the greatest movie ever made, it is brilliant in its own right. The characters are humorous, the dialogue is witty and the cast is brilliant. It contains so many different elements which also make it a really good family film. Action, adventure, sword-fighting, pirates, romance, comedy and fantasy. It captures all the elements I could Whilst I still stand by the fact that the book is better, this is still my favourite film."
TxMike,"Sep 16, 2001",N/A,"By virtue of the ""under 29"" female vote, ""Princess Bride"" is somewhat overrated on the IMDB, but still is a good, fun movie.  I rate it ""8"" of 10.The recently-released special edition DVD is the one to view. The colors are nicely saturated in most scenes, it has 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, and there are lots of extras, including one of the better ""making of"" specials. One of my favorite actors is Mandy Patinkin, and here he is great as the Spanish swordsman seeking revenge for his father's death at the hand of the six-fingered swordsman played by Christopher Guess. This was Robin Wright's first film, as a 19-year-old, playing Buttercup. Cary Elwes is also perfect as her love interest. Andre the Giant, who died in 1993 at age 45, was so fitting in his role as the giant. Overall a fine cast and a fine, entertaining, funny film. A ""comic fairy tale in a strange land"" as read to a child.The moral of the film, ""True love conquers everything.""  How could anyone dislike such a story??"
Red-Barracuda,"May 12, 2014",6/10,"I hadn't even heard of The Princess Bride until very recently. But evidently it has something of a good reputation and I am guessing that it may have been a sleeper hit that gained its reputation over a number of years as opposed to a film that hit the mark on initial release. Having seen it I'm still not entirely sure why this one has gained the reputation it has, as it didn't really seem all that remarkable to be perfectly honest.Its story takes the form of a sweet natured traditional adventure narrative. It's set in a fantasy land but unusually is told from the perspective of the present day with scenes of a grandfather reading the title book to his ill grandson. It has a strong romantic subplot and has very clear morals, with no grey areas. Consequently its simplicity makes it very well suited to children. But it can appeal quite well to adults too because it does have a lot of humour. It's helped in this area quite a bit by having a very good cast. There are too many to mention but my favourite character was the evil hunchback played by Wallace Shawn. The scene where he has a battle of wits with the hero over a poisoned drink is the funniest and best moment in the film for me. So all-in-all, it's certainly a likable enough movie but one probably, in fairness, not aimed at me. However, I cannot avoid not commenting on its weakest aspect because it was so, so terrible I couldn't believe it. The music. Oh, deary me, the music. For a film with some evident production values on screen it was completely bizarre that the soundtrack was so horribly tinny, like it had been composed and performed on a Casio keyboard!"
Lilyb-49,"Dec 13, 2025",10/10,It is sooooo good and this movie is the definition of love. It is the perfect movie to watch when you feel down it is so funny and cute I loved it!!! This is the perfect movie of all time. They really don't make movies like this anymore. I watched this for the first time and I was already smiling so much by the third scene!!
Steffi_P,"Apr 2, 2011",7/10,"The 1980s were the golden age of the fantasy movie – Excalibur (1981), The Dark Crystal (1982), Legend (1985), Willow (1988) and many others, sword-and-sorcery sagas for the blockbuster generation. But what those aforementioned pictures also had in common were high-production values and emphasis on aesthetics and stylisation. In some cases this was to hide the lack of a decent story. The Princess Bride by comparison is a decidedly minimalist affair, devoid of special effects (bar a bit of puppetry and prosthetics), atmospherics and big fight scenes. This is a fantasy movie which must rely on other things for its appeal to the viewer.The Princess Bride, adapted by William Goldman from his own novel, is really quite a light and simple story, more of a fairy tale than a work of what is normally called fantasy. Its world is too cosy and its baddies are not really evil enough to give it a sense of danger. It also contains a fair few plot holes along the way. It is however saved by two cunning devices. First is the framing narrative whereby Peter Falk is reading the story to his cynical grandson. The grandson's attitude pre-empts criticism, allowing the story to acknowledge the weakness of its own opening and challenge the nay-sayers to keep watching. Secondly there is the constantly humorous angle, a wit in the words that is often self-deprecating, and more irreverent than outright hysterical. The humour is all within character, so not enough to classify The Princess Bride as a spoof or even really a full-blown comedy, but it prevents the viewer from laughing at the corniness of the movie, because it gives the impression that all along the movie is chuckling at itself.Conveniently enough, director Rob Reiner had a background in comedy, and part of his skill in this area was selecting good comedy actors. The Princess Bride provides great opportunities because it has a lot of minor characters that aren't necessarily comical on paper but can be made funny in the way an actor plays them. Because these parts could be interpreted in a number of ways Reiner is more or less free as to who he casts in which role, and he actually seems to have stacked them so they get better and better as the movie progresses. First up is Wallace Shawn, great at doing indignant pomposity. Then there's Mel Smith, rarely seen in films but a fine character player from his days in TV sketch shows. Then we come to Billy Crystal, whose act is a masterwork of timing, working brilliantly in tandem with a lively Carol Kane. And finally there is the brief cameo by Peter Cook, a model of decorum and propriety until he opens his mouth. Wonderful stuff.While we have the cream of the crop in the small parts, it seems this production could not afford big stars for the leads, and we get too relative unknowns as the heroic Westley and his eponymous princess. Someone may have had the idea that Cary Elwes would shape up to be a modern-day Errol Flynn. He certainly has the looks and can pull off a swashbuckling swagger, but he just doesn't have the necessary presence or charisma, and it's no wonder he was picked mostly for supporting roles after this. Robin Wright is similarly bland, although to be fair despite being the movie's namesake her character does not really have a lot to do here. Better things can be said of Mandy Patinkin who brings the right blend of cheekiness and earnestness to his part (Inigo was my favourite character when I saw this as a child). An honourable mention must also go to Andre the Giant who is surprisingly good considering he's a wrestler hired for his bulk. He struggles with the language but it's clear he was an intelligent and sensitive man.It is essentially all the little touches that make The Princess Bride what it is – the wit, the quirkiness, the set-pieces. And yet, it being a fantasy picture I do find myself wishing it had a little more of the glamour and spectacle with which its contemporaries were filled. It may win out in the comedy stakes but it lacks the wonder and enchantment of Labyrinth, Legend or The Dark Crystal, and thus it falls short of brilliance. This is a little picture that works well on its own terms, and belongs solidly in the category of good plain fun."
PCC0921,"Apr 19, 2022",9/10,"The Princess Bride (1987), is a great film. Not because I like romantic love stories. Not because I follow wrestling. Not because I need to know the meaning of true love. The film is just a good film. A veteran in Hollywood, Rob Reiner, does his best work here, as he directs this comedy, in the grand tradition of Mel Brooks and crafts a fairy tale, that the adults can love too. Much like Ron Howard, Reiner grew out of television as an actor and eventually went into directing some really great movies. Both directors, would reach this point after they left the TV shows that made them famous. Reiner had moved his range to encompass many genres in his resume, but it was good, that he returned to comedy at times and that was good for the success of this film.Told in a storybook way, with a grandfather (Peter Falk), reading the story to his grandson (Fred Savage), we are transported back to a land where knights, fire swamps, witch doctors and hungry ROUSes (rodents of unusual size), exist. The beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright), has been kidnapped for ransom and its up to her one true love, Westley (Cary Elwes), to come rescue her. Along the way, they meet all kinds of colorful, creative, humorous characters, that play a part in the success of the two lovers' future endeavors. One of those characters was Fezzik (wrestler Andre the Giant), who's huge stature made for a perfect lovable giant, who eventually befriends Westley and Buttercup. It is nice to see that Andre became tied to such a revered, respected film, because if you read-up on his life or watch a documentary on him, the years of being a wrestler and the state of his gigantism, by this time in his life, had taken its toll. He was in a lot of pain, during the filming of this movie and it is nice to see that his sacrifice paid off.This film is a perfect example of a huge Hollywood, cinematic success. Other great performances in this film, also are some of the best cameos too. Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, Billy Crystal as Miracle Max, Carol Kane as Valerie and Peter Cook as the Impressive Clergyman, are just some I'll mention. However, the most rememberable character, is the one who was quoted the most, in this highly quotable film. That would be Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya. The entire cast in this film is fantastic. The comedy is dead on perfect. The scenarios, situations and tribulations, that the characters get involved in, which are chronicled in the story, carry you to the very end. It's one of those films, no matter who you are, that makes you feel warm inside by the time you reach the end.9.1 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."
Vucko130,"Sep 4, 2023",7/10,"""The Princess Bride"" is a cinematic gem that has stood the test of time, weaving together elements of romance, comedy, and swashbuckling adventure in a way that continues to captivate audiences of all ages.At its heart, ""The Princess Bride"" is a story about true love transcending all obstacles. The chemistry between Cary Elwes' dashing Westley and Robin Wright's enchanting Buttercup is nothing short of magical. Their on-screen romance is a delightful mix of wit, charm, and genuine emotion that effortlessly draws you into their world.But it's not just the central love story that makes this film so special. ""The Princess Bride"" boasts a cast of supporting characters that are equally lovable and quirky. From Inigo Montoya's quest for revenge, played with heartfelt determination by Mandy Patinkin, to Vizzini's hilariously overconfident intellect, portrayed by the incomparable Wallace Shawn, each character brings something unique and memorable to the table.What truly sets this film apart is its masterful blend of genres. One moment you're chuckling at the witty banter between characters, and the next, you're on the edge of your seat during a thrilling sword fight. The humor is sharp, the action is exhilarating, and the romance is genuinely touching. It's a movie that appeals to the young and the young at heart.The writing, penned by William Goldman, is a testament to his storytelling prowess. His screenplay not only creates a richly detailed world but also subverts classic fairy tale tropes in clever and unexpected ways. The result is a narrative that remains fresh and relevant, even decades after its release.Inconceivably quotable, visually enchanting, and emotionally resonant, ""The Princess Bride"" is a timeless classic that continues to win over new generations of fans. It's a film that proves that true love, humor, and adventure are indeed timeless, and it's deserving of a permanent place in the annals of cinematic history. Whether you're watching it for the first time or the hundredth, ""The Princess Bride"" never fails to deliver a heartwarming and unforgettable experience."
gtyj1990,"Sep 14, 2008",2/10,"This has to be one of the most overrated movies of all time. I don't know what it is, but it may have to do with how old you were when you first saw it. I'm guessing that when the movie was first released, a lot of guys took their dates to see it  women typically love romantic themes, even when done badly  and got laid that night or something, hence they remember it fondly. Or it's possible that even younger audiences were fans of TV's ""The Wonder Years"" and loved Fred Savage or something. But for anyone who wasn't younger than 25 at the time of its release, this movie's popularity is an enigma: As a comedy, it's not very funny. As a fantasy, it's just bad. It has some qualities as an action adventure, though it comes off as a cheap imitation of a cross between the Robin Hood story and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (a silly movie that works, at least for most guys, in a way that the Three Stooges do not); shame on Peter Cook. Overall, the story is childish, the dialog is juvenile (""She is alive, or was an hour ago. If she is otherwise when I find her I shall be very put out"". Come on!) and repetitive, the sets are pathetic, the acting is abysmal (Andre the Giant and that annoying little dweeb, please), and the special effects (rodents of unusual size)  ugh!"
Valkonian,"Jun 12, 2022",9/10,It's a shame I waited so long to see this movie. Tonight I finally watched it in glorious 4K. I won't comment on the film as many others have done a fantastic job. Since my review is newer I will say ignore the bad reviews. Watch the movie for yourself. It's not just the love story in the book the movie is about its also the bond of the grandfather and grandson. It's subtle but it's relevant. It's meant to show you love transcends everything. Go watch it!
peter_nilsson88,"Aug 13, 2019",10/10,An hilarious movie that knows exactly what it is. The actors takes their roles seriously and delivers perfectly. It's nice to see young rising stars in an early role which is the case for Robin Wright and most certainly for Cary Elwes.I had a good feeling and a big smile on my lips throughout the movie. Well worth a watch more than 30 years after release.
Java_Joe,"Sep 9, 2019",9/10,"I will say this right now that I love this movie. It's got everything you want. It's got action, adventure, cool sword play, romance and it is endlessly quotable.When I first heard of it, I dismissed it as being kids stuff and some sappy romance. Can you blame me? Just look at the title! But after hearing from friends how good it was I had to take a look and it's become one of my favorites.The story is in itself a play within a play. The main story is actually a story told by a grandfather to his grandson who's home sick. It's a story of the young Buttercup, the eponymous Princess Bride, and her true love Westley. Westley goes off to seek his fortune but is captured and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Or has he? Along the way we meet a Spaniard who's a marvel with the blade, a gentle giant with great strength and a Sicillian with more brains than smarts. They all play a role in leading Westley back to his true love.The story is great. The actors are all top notch including Andre the Giant who plays the giant. He's nigh incomprehensible at times but he plays the role well. Mandy Patinkin as the Spaniard delivers one of cinema's classic lines that just about everybody knows. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright shine as the young lovers. And of course Billy Crystal and Carol Kane steal the show as a pair of humorous healers.Some scenes lag a bit and there are times it's played a little too broadly but all in all it's a wonderful movie that should be seen by everybody. I can't recommend this movie enough."
sabre130,"Nov 19, 2001",N/A,"This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. I mean, somehow an entire fairy tale was pulled off without being campy or sugar coated. It works on so many levels, from adults with its humor to kids with its magical story. And Westley! Why can't there be more guys like that in the world?"
brchthethird,"Nov 14, 2014",7/10,"THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those movies that is revered by Gen-X-ers and 80's babies, along with THE GOONIES and other children's films that have a certain adventurousness and whimsy to them. I, however, was born at the tail end of the decade, and missed out on a lot of these cinematic treasures as a child. Finally, I have rectified that by watching this film, which is firmly ingrained in the pop culture consciousness. Does it live up to the hype? Yes and no. From a filmic perspective, the narrative is a bit formulaic and cliché, like the storybook tales that this movie takes its inspiration from. On the other hand, there are plenty of moments of pure genius that make it stand out from the rest. Fortunately, the latter outweighs the former and overall it was a perfectly enjoyable viewing experience.The story, although about the titular Princess Bride, is actually framed by a grandfather reading a book to his sick grandson. I think that this part is essential to making the film work because it gives the audience a way to understand the story and how it works on more than just a surface level. Fred Savage's character is the audience stand-in and his questions and commentary can represent the questions of all little boys who have been told fantastical stories by their own relatives. The grandfather can represent the director, or any family member who has served a storytelling role, and guides the audience through this familiar, yet not too familiar tale. The story of the Princess Bride itself is reminiscent of many a fairy tale, and like many before it tells how true love overcomes great obstacles. There is a great cast of characters, many serving up some choice and memorable dialogue that has gone down in the pantheon of great quotes. My personal favorites were from Vizzini, Inigo Montoya and the Impressive Clergyman.In terms of quality, Rob Reiner did a great job directing his actors, who all give great performances. Even Robin Wright does an impressive job for her first big-screen role which, aside from Jenny in FORREST GUMP, is the role she is best known for playing. The filming aspect was also quite well done, with most of it being done on well-constructed and detailed studio sets. The cinematography, while not particularly memorable or flashy, was competent in workmanlike kind of way. The real weakness here is the script which, while serving up plenty of individual moments worthy of praise, didn't always flow naturally, and not because of the framing story either. There is also a long stretch of the movie where Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and Fezzik (Andre the Giant) disappear, which just seemed odd to me. In my opinion, the story could have been fleshed out a little more in some respects. Still, what is there works for the most part, and I can't really fault it for trying to mix things up a bit.Overall, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a perfectly enjoyable movie, even if it doesn't live up to the enormous praise heaped upon it. The movie does have some flaws, but those are mild in comparison to the great storytelling on display and great dialogue, which enhance its replay value. Highly recommended, especially if you haven't seen it yet."
doktorg-13665,"Sep 18, 2019",9/10,I read that they were thinking of rebooting the Princess Bride. This is one of the greatest films with so many classic lines that are delivered perfectly. It also has perhaps the the most enjoyable fight scenes I have seen. A remake or reboot would be a complete disaster.
TheNabOwnzz,"May 17, 2018",7/10,"A lot of people and critics believe 'The Princess Bride' is a masterpiece and some even believe it is one of the greatest films ever made. However, objectively speaking the movie is not a masterpiece but primarily a highly entertaining escapism flick which still far outweighs its negative sides.Not entirely sure why the film was told out of a book straight from another modern day story, because the modern scenes really seem to have little significance and it also eventually ends up going nowhere. Fortunately, most scenes take place in the historical fantasy setting, which is obviously far and away the most entertaining one. The cinematography is beautiful, with a lot of stunning shots of the beautiful british landscapes where it was filmed on. Also the area where Inigo and the Man in Black face off is worthy of mention as a beautiful piece of cinematography. While being covered in comic aspects, the said scene with the sword fight between Inigo and Man in Black is actually also a masterpiece of choreography and incredible moves, resulting in possibly the greatest single duel swordfight one can ever see in film.The acting was mostly good, especially by leads Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin & Robin Wright. They manage to make their characters likeable due to their natural charm and witty line delivery. A lot of other characters were ridiculously overacted, such as Wallace Shawn's Vizzini. The screenplay is a bit wobbly as a lot of the dialogue is extremely witty and original yet Patinkin's constant uttering of 'Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.' grows tiresome after a while. Some things are really predictable such as who the Man in Black really is but other things such as Count Rugen's response to the first time Patinkin says the you killed by father line are quite original and somewhat hilarious.It is quite the cliché to say if this movie was serious we might take Elwes & Wright's romance and struggles emotionally serious, but there is still truth to it as it is not the kind of film that leaves you with feelings or thought long after it is finished. It was generally just made as the type of feel good escapism flick and if you limit your expectations of true cinema it can still be considered as a worthy piece of entertaining art. However, anything transcendent or thought provoking it is obviously not therefore it should not be judged like actual masterpieces."
lertad-1,"Sep 28, 2019",8/10,"""I've heard so much about this movie with references in pop culture and more than one mentions of how it was the best screenplay ever made, and while it is never good to go into a movie overhyped, it definitely delivered.This movie contained everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, plot twists, deceit, and most of all, true love.Overall, it is just a beautiful movie.It is a shame I was not old enough to see this movie when it came out to realize that the pacing and style was intentional. I thought it was simply a relic of the times. Now that I know I can appreciate the added layer of parody and the genius of the balance between parody and tribute.The whimsical fairy tale mood takes us along on a heartwarming journey that has us root for the heroes while smirking at the quips. Every character is lovable, every line is quotable, and every layer is clever and witty. The script itself will definitely be worth further scrutiny.The cultural effect this has had is well deserved. It is slightly surreal to recognize modern tropes, characters, and stories in this script and realize that I am watching what has inspired them.Dread Pirate Roberts. Vizzini. Inigo Montoya. Count Rugen. The Grandfather. I will revisit these characters and story again in the future.Not to do so would be inconceivable."""
EileenZ19,"Jun 14, 2025",7/10,"This movie was recommended to me by a friend years ago, and I know it's something of a classic, but I've resisted watching it until now. The reason is that I don't like romance movies, and I was afraid this would be that. After having watched it, I thought it was funny that my opinion of the movie both before and after watching was exactly the same as the young grandson in the movie, who was dubious about his grandfather reading him the book because of the possibility of too much kissing. And then the boy ended up being pleasantly surprised. I was also pleasantly surprised. To viewers out there who aren't romance fans, there is romance, but it is primarily a fairytale adventure with enough action to please even a young boy, as depicted in the film. The premise is that a peasant girl is chosen to marry a prince she doesn't want to marry and then is kidnapped. Both her anonymous rescuer and the prince race to get her back before the other one does. They face a number of trials involving a battle of wits, sword fighting, and strange creatures. This wasn't one of my top favorite movies, but I definitely enjoyed it. I think it would be a worthwhile watch for people of all ages - both kids and adults - who like a good story."
redshift27,"Oct 17, 2005",4/10,"I was disappointed by the quality of this movie, having been encouraged to rent it out by its high IMDb rating. It felt like a B movie: pretty much everything was weak. The plot was unexciting, the timing of the ""gags"" was awful, the set was ludicrous, the editing was substandard, the lighting was quaint, the lead actress lacked appeal, the lead actor - what's with that little moustache?, and the comedians weren't (with one honourable exception) funny. The honourable exception was the clergyman as played by Peter Cook. We miss you, Peter. But what on earth were you doing in this morass of mediocrity?!For the first twenty minutes I kept thinking that it would get better to justify its rating. Not a chance. So how did it get into the IMDb top 250? Come on guys, let me into the secret here. It can't be a ""cult"" thing, you could go to any bad movie and laugh at how bad it is. So is everyone marking it based on some hazy recollection from childhood? Have you actually WATCHED it recently? If this movie came out today, it would tank at the box office and struggle to get above 5.0 on IMDb."
Talentlings,"Mar 15, 2020",10/10,Incredible film that continues to prove its worth with every subsequent watch. A classic to defy the ages!
calebjcrosby-62-788272,"Apr 5, 2019",10/10,"I have seen this film so many times, I don't even remember how old I was when I first watched it. I firmly believe that this is one of, if not the best film ever made. It may not seem like everyone's cup of tea on the surface, but I think there is something for everyone in this movie.The characters are expertly played by all the actors, the dialogue is never dry, every joke lands perfectly, and the story is the perfect blend of familiar and fresh."
jared-25331,"Sep 5, 2025",10/10,"The Princess Bride (1987) is a fantasy adventure comedy movie written and adapted by William Goldman from his novel of the same name and it was directed by Rob Reiner. This was the movie that introduced me to Rob Reiner as a filmmaker when I watched this movie back when I was in high school and I loved it. I just got done rewatching the movie for this review and it is still awesome.Positives for The Princess Bride (1987):
This movie has everything that will appeal to all the demographics and it will please all of them. I like that the story is told to us with the framing device of a grandfather reading the book to his grandson as a bedtime story and it makes the movie stand out from other book adaptations that I've seen. I like how smart Rob Reiner is with his directing in this movie and it makes the movie even more fun to watch. There are multiple scenes where we see the grandfather stops reading and he talks with his grandson about stuff in the book with my favorite being where he forgets which page he's supposed to be reading and the grandson has to tell him that and it was really funny. You also have a fantastic ensemble cast of actors that includes Cary Elwes as Westley, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, Chris Sarandon as Prince Humperdinck, Christopher Guest as Count Tyrone Rugen, Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, Andre the Giant as Fezzik, Fred Savage as the grandson, Robin Wright as Buttercup and Peter Falk as the grandfather. I really enjoyed all of these characters as I found them to be so fun to watch even the ones you're supposed to hate on. You get a lot of awesome action sequences and comedic moments sprinkled throughout that will put a big smile on your face. And finally, there are also a lot of dialogue that is very quotable and people are still quoting them to this day with my personal favorite being ""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die"".Overall, The Princess Bride (1987) is one of the most entertaining and smartly-directed movies that I've seen in a very long time and it is my favorite movie in Rob Reiner's filmography. If you love action, romance, adventure, fantasy and comedy, then you absolutely need to watch this movie."
TheFilmCasual,"Jul 2, 2025",9/10,"This film has been a cult classic for a long time now, and it isn't hard to see why. The film follows a grandfather reading the story of The Princess Bride to his sick grandson. The book was about the love between a farm boy named Westley and the Princess Bride called Buttercup. Soon, Westley left her to earn money, and Buttercup got engaged unwillingly to the local Prince Humperdinck. Throughout the movie, we see how Westley tries to rescue Buttercup with plenty of challenges. I really like how it follows through the ""Hero's structure"". The plot may be predictable, but it was nonetheless entertaining and executed so well. One thing I find silly, though, is how Buttercup tumbles after the masked man. They could have shown her walking and accidentally tumbling instead of intentionally doing so. I also do wish the ending had more to it. I wanted a small epilogue to Westley and Buttercup's story, maybe a marriage scene. This is, of course, before the grandpa's final words, which hit home.One of the film's biggest strengths was how it made you care about the characters in such a short time. The characters are mostly what we call archetypes. Westley is the noble poor boy. Buttercup is the lover and the damsel in distress. I do like that it isn't the usual damsel in distress, as the film shows Buttercup's strength and bravery through her love for Westley. The Prince was the usual villain. Then we got three really good archetypes in Inigo, Fezzik, and Vizzini. Each was a challenge to the masked man in black, representing skill, strength, and wit, respectively. Having a small backstory for Inigo and having Fezzik portray kindness were really good. I did want more screentime for Vizzini. The Miracle Max character was also one of the best in here. For about 5 minutes of screentime, he made such a funny and memorable character.The performances were all outstanding. Particular standouts were Wallace Shawn as Vizzini and Billy Crystal as Miracle Max, both of whom had limited screentime but offered very memorable performances.The Princess Bride is a fun, romantic, and adventurous film. While it may seem too silly for some scenes, its jokes mostly hit. It's a wholesome story that follows the ""Hero's journey"" structure with plenty of familiar tropes but is still entertaining nonetheless. With a fun plot, good performances, and a great structure, it rightfully deserves all the praise and is definitely one of the best fantasy romantic comedies of all time, as it shows that love, while sometimes inconceivable, can truly be as you wish."
eudaemon7,"Jan 15, 2015",6/10,"How did this mundane film possibly garner an 8.2 rating?! Because it introduced Robin Wright to us? Because it has an interesting cast? Because of a dashing young Mandy Patinkin, a personal favorite of mine? Or because of IMDb.com's biggest weakness: predilections of voters.... I'll chalk it up to all of the above. Nothing very original, no standout chemistry. All in all, a children's film, which is fine. Most original thing about it is the ensemble cast. Not much to compare it to, with Peter Falk, Andre the Giant, a pre-Wonder Years Fred Savage, Wallace (the buffoon) Shawn, Christopher Guest, Peter Cook... quite the cross-section! Watch it with the kids."
roland-spindler,"Jan 4, 2012",6/10,"As I'm writing this, The Princess Bride is ranked 194 in the IMDb Top 250 list with an average rating of 8.1. Considering the rating and the fact that I love fantasy, I had high expectations. Long story short - I was very disappointed.It's not that The Princess Bride is bad. It has its moments and a unique kind of humor. But the overall impression is lackluster at best. The plot is thin, the acting is sub-par, the main characters nothing but clichés and the special effects are barely worth a laugh. Just look at those guys it rat costumes. Is that supposed to be frightening or hilarious?To mention a few good points, the minor characters of Inigo Montoya and Fezzik are very good. Also the cuts between the plot and the frame narrative about a grandfather and his grandson are pleasantly surprising. On the other hand, the frame narrative itself is unnecessary and only exists to provide the beginning and the ending that the plot is missing.Why do one third of the viewers rate this 10? According to my wife, she loved the movie as a kid, but was disappointed too when she saw it recently. I guess it just did not mature well."
funkyfry,"Feb 15, 2003",10/10,"A gloriously witty fantasy film with its heart and soul in the right place -- on its sleeve.  All the performances are good (although Chrystal is too showy for my taste) but Patinkin's is exceptional.  Also features an endearing performance by wrestling star Andre ""The Giant"".  Special note should go to writer William Goldman, who does an almost perfect adaption of his wonderful novel.  Reiner acquits himself well, particularly through the wit and style of the performances (some of them from actors who have not done work so good in the rest of their careers), but relies on close-ups a bit too much.  Reiner should be credited, though, with letting the material speak for itself for the most part, providing fairly straightforward camera movement and positioning.  Best scene for me -- Elwes and Patinkin's classic duel atop the cliffs of death (or whatever they're called)."
brianlion,"Nov 18, 2002",7/10,"We were pleasantly surprised with ""The Princess Bride"". This is a very cleverly written movie. Also, it is obvious that the direction and acting had to be cleverly and skillfully done. The actors do not ""try"" to be funny. They trust the script. Actors who try to ham it up, even with a funny script (Milton Berle, for example), water down the humor of the scene. I found myself chuckling at many lines and situations. The casting is wonderful, and the cast and direction of Rob Reiner make the time period work. This production took some risks, but the gutsy move pays off with a definite sleeper hit."

john-ryan-chambers,"Apr 28, 2020",9/10,"Picture this, you are at home your girlfriend tells you to pick a movie. You don't want to watch a chick flick, and you know she won't want to watch an action movie. Comedy is hit or miss so what do you do? Watch The Princess Bride! It has elements of romance, comedy, action, some magic, fantastic fight scenes, and several incredible plot twists that drive you deeper into the movie. All in all a very good movie and worthy of the following it has gathered over the years. The biggest downside to the movie, in my humble opinion, the narration and the inclusion of the boy and his grandfather break up the story enough for younger children to watch. These breaks happen mostly during kissing or scary scenes so children are saved from that, but as an adult it can make the film seem a bit disjointed and misleading."
estreet-eva,"Dec 6, 2011",8/10,"""This is Spinal Tap"", ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""The Princess Bride"" give director Rob Reiner a trio of timeless classics. ""Princess Bride"" takes the classic boy-meets-girl setup and adds ""Wizard of Oz""-level lines such as ""life is pain, anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something"" and ""you keep saying that word (inconceivable)-I do not think it means what you think it means."" He also adds a flawless cast including the under-appreciated Mandy Patinkin, a shockingly menacing portrayal from the normally silly Christopher Guest and the previously unusable Andre' the Giant who is somehow made to deliver an understandable and winning performance. By the turns the movie is funny, frightening, dramatic, comedic, suspenseful and whimsical. The framing device with Peter Falk and Fred Savage allows Reiner to step out when things become too intense and makes this watchable even for the younger set. In short, add this to your must see list especially if you have children."
dsutto,"Aug 13, 2021",10/10,"This has everything a film needs for everyone to love.! Really, by now if you haven't seen this 5 times, you have no idea what you're missing. For your own good, watch this amazing movie."

jerodwitwicki,"Jan 3, 2019",10/10,"This movie works on so many levels. It is a great action movie, fantasy movie and an impeccable romance. But above all else, it is a perfect comedy. There isn't a scene in this movie without a joke or gag. Also, the film is ingeniously the typical hero saves damsel from bad guy story, but it doesn't stick to the cliches that come with this type of story making it both original and timeless."
simbiat,"Feb 21, 2025",6/10,"I think it's a bit overrated. I've heard a lot of praise for this movie, how outstanding it is, almost ahead of its time, and perhaps it would have been better, if I did not hear any of that.It's not a bad movie, that's for sure, the story as a whole is good, even though most pieces, if looked at alone, would end up being quite silly. On the other hand that ""silliness"" plays into the ""fairy tale""-like vibe of the movie. I certainly appreciated care to some minor details and certain ""practical"" things, that I do miss in most of modern movies.But is it a movie of a lifetime? No. Maybe it looked much better at the time of release, maybe it was more ""contextual"" then, but right now - not really. I also think that it's quite underdeveloped in terms of its characters, but possibly because of time constraints. While watching I was reminded of ""The 10th Kingdom"", which was a definite ""fairy tale"" and it was amazing, but it was shot much later (2000), and it was a TV series, so it's obviously not a fair comparison.""The Princess Bride"" felt was fine for 1 evening for me, but it did not find a place in my heart. Perhaps, if I saw it as a kid, things would have been different."
constantinep-13781,"Mar 30, 2021",10/10,No other movie that I have seen in my 63 years is more enjoyable than The Princess Bride. I have watched it perhaps a dozen times over the years and still enjoy it every time. I still tear up at Peter Falks final line of the movie.
TheConsigliere,"Jan 12, 2004",1/10,"Look, I rented this film because I knew it was rated 94 on the IMDb Top 250. I guess the fact I had such high expectations removed any chance of me liking this film. I felt it was utter trash. There was very little I could say was even mildly amusing here...Much of Andre's (The Giant) lines were about as effective as he would have been if he'd tried to play a slim, short, well-spoken Englishman. Cary Elwes was a pathetic hero - I felt no affinity towards him whatsoever. The short, bald guy managed to do only one thing - annoy the crap out of me. Overall, the story was boring, the writing was lame, the main characters of Cary Elwes and Robin Wright were one-dimensional and I fail to understand how anyone could warm to them. The only scenes I found interesting and even enjoyable were those involving Fred Savage. In short, a major disappointment and yet another example of a film that in my view has no business being on the IMDb Top 250 list.This film ranked No. 94 of all time? INCONCEIVABLE !!!!"
chadwick-86955,"Jun 6, 2022",10/10,"This is one of my favorite movies.The whole story-telling start is adorable ... Peter Falk telling his sick grandson (Fred Savage) a story, the grandson objecting to the ""kissing scenes"".The plot is adorable/comical/intelligent. Great actors, great writers."
NicoleT-709,"Dec 4, 2025",10/10,Not many adventurous movies are very funny at the same time. This movie pulls it off in possibly the best way possible. There are big laughs throughout the whole movie. Even characters with one scene cameo appearances (such as Miracle Max) bring such good humor to the movie. It's a fun movie for the whole family. 10 stars.
Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Sep 18, 2021",10/10,"The Princess Bride is a swashbuckling, romantic and fantastical love letter to everything that makes high-fantasy (and swordplay) so memorable and timeless. Even though the film is clearly a parody of swashbucklers of old, it manages to become one of the most sincere homages in all of cinema: where the characters give the movie an impeccable glow to their personalities and they don't succumb to overly indulgent cliches at all (unlike other parodies out there).As far as 80s cinema is concerned, The Princess Bride is vibrant fun that paved the way for films like Shrek and even pressured Disney films to become more self-aware in regards to their own princes and princesses. And what a legacy this film has left.What else can I say about this film? I don't know. I believe everyone's spoken for it over the years; and I'm okay with being lost in that crowd. They're all in love with a true classic.The Princess Bride gets 5/5 stars."
noahk-58259,"Nov 18, 2018",7/10,"I went into this movie thinking this would be a freakin masterpiece because that's what everyone said it was. I mean, everybody who talks about this movie always says how funny and wonderful the movie is. Alas, I did not find it so. Not even close!Firstly, the humor in the movie, which I understood to be its best part before viewing, is just not that great! It's a shame because Don Rickles is an incredibly funny actor, but he is firstly underused and secondly given horrible jokes! Billy Crystal is another one where a fantastic comedian has a garbage take in the movie. And really nobody else had any good moments.As for the other characters, Indigo Montoya (I honestly have no clue how it's spelt) is fine, but he like everyone else is a one dimensional character. Nobody has any depth to them, anything beyond a basic motivation. Montoya wants to avenge his fathers death, The Princess and Wesley want to be together, the prince wants to marry her to start a war, Andre the Giant, well, is just sort of there.And the plot is nothing special, it's just a damsel in distress story with a couple other storylines to stretch it out. I've never read the book, so maybe it does better, but the movie? Nope.From a cinematography standpoint, it just feels very fake. The music is not good, the camerawork is bland, the sets look like they're fake. I can't tell if it's supposed to be ironic in this sense, but if it is, it's not done well enough to be ironically funny. It just feels cheap.This sort of feels like one of those movies that people saw as a kid and fell in love with and weren't old enough to see its flaws, and now that they're adults they have too much nostalgia surrounding the movie and remember it as they did as a child; perfect. To summarize, the movie is VERY overrated. Not worth the hype or the viewing."
erinleighmccall,"Dec 16, 2025",8/10,"I'm embarrassed to say that this is the first time that I watched the movie in its entirety. I tried watching it years ago, but it was so slow, I fell asleep. In honor of Rob Reiner, who directed some of my favorites, I wanted to give it another try. Although I did nod off a bit, I enjoyed the movie. It was fun, whimsical, and it was great seeing these young actors before their careers really took off. I had forgotten about André the giant. He's such a lovable character. May he also rest in peace."
Bunuel1976,"Mar 13, 2006",6/10,"I knew of this film's reputation as a cult item before going in but, for the life of me, despite a few amusing scenes scattered throughout, I just can't fathom why this is so! Pleasant though it is, it's patchy at best and it was never laugh-out-loud funny either. This is especially disappointing considering that the film was written by Oscar winner William Goldman (of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID [1969] fame) and directed by Rob Reiner, who had earlier given us the uproarious THIS IS SPINAL TAP (1984)!The admittedly eccentric cast struggles to evoke the fairy-tale quality inherent in the premise - with Wallace Shawn, Christopher Guest and Billy Crystal being the most successful at it - but, if the film was meant as a spoof, I'm sorry to say that it doesn't have much of a bite...especially since I can hardly remember anything about it a mere two days later!!"
TakeTwoReviews,"May 8, 2020",9/10,"Confession. I don't usually like fantasy films. I didn't mind them as a kid and I think I quite liked this, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. I'd put it in the same category as Labyrinth. To be fair, they're both films that have garnered cult status. I've not watched Labyrinth in 30 years (nor do I feel the need to), but I'm guessing that this has aged better. I'd forgetten all about the story-telling narration aspect, Peter Falk reading 'The Princess Bride' to Fred Savage in his all- American bedroom, what a bizarre premise that seems, but it's ridiculously charming and effective. The opening scenes are pure schmaltzy over blown medieval romance and would be pretty unbearable without Fred's voice over, rolling its eyes. It's silly, but never really farcical, deftly balancing it's comedic wit with what feels like a genuine love for its characters. Ah the characters, if you're not smiling within 10 minutes, check your pulse, they're all wonderful! I'm hooked... and so is Fred. Let's not beat around the bush. It takes me no time at all to fall in love, it's 100 times better than I recall. Do you like perfectly choreographed swashbuckling sword fights? This has you covered, with added academic commentary from the combatants. Too flashy? How about ""You put down your rock, I'll put down my sword, we'll try kill each other like civilised people"". I'd also forgotten how quotable this is. ""Life is pain (heiress), anyone who says differently is selling something"" and of course ""Hello my name is Inigo Montoya, prepare to die."" The dialogue really is bloody flawless, littered with fun quips and even the haughty grandising from Prince Humperdink is fun. He is the weak link here though if there is one. Cary Elwes is absolutely marvellous, his lovely exposition explaining his becoming the Dread Pirate Roberts whilst dodging death in the fire swamp is so simple and effective, it's quite disarming and if you didn't already root for our hero, you do now. Then bang, bloody quicksand! (aka Lightning Sand) and 'Rodents of Unusual Size' cementing it's 80s calibre. If someone made this now (please say the rumours aren't true) they'd ruin it with CGI. You really can't beat a bloke in a giant rat suit. You also can't beat Mel Smith in dodgy make-up or Billy Crystal layered in tons of it. It's around this time too that I realise that Prince Humperdink's right hand man is no other than Nigel ""This one goes to up to 11"" Tufnel!! and he's still obsessed with numbers as he cranks up The Machine in The Pit of Dispair. It's all quite simple, the lower class good guys verses the villainous royalty, both chasing the prize that is Princess Buttercup. As we get toward the finale, the threatened wedding of Humperdink & Buttercup, I nearly fall off my chair as Peter Cook announces ""Mawwage is what bwings us together today"". It limps a little as the final minutes draw in, but Andre the Giant keeps the tone light as Buttercup is inevitably rescued, Inigo avenges his father and the as the fairytale ends, I'm left with a warm smile. To think I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this, ""Inconceivable!"""
hoxjennifer,"Apr 2, 2014",6/10,"Before actually sitting down and watching this movie, I had heard that the film was a classic, must-see. I had also heard that the film had some sort of following since it was so well appraised. That being said, I had high hopes for something cute, cliché, and funny.This movie was definitely cute. This movie was definitely cliché. But funny is a bit of a stretch for me. Maybe it's because I'm not an 80's child, but I just didn't get any of the humour that was in this movie. I felt that what was obviously supposed to be comic relief just turned out to be awkward.And perhaps the directors might have intended this, but the first twenty minutes of the movie I wanted to just quit. The actors were so half-hearted, the whole plot line was just a little bit ridiculous and I shared the same feeling as the little boy being read the story: ""Why am I here? Why am I watching this movie?"" And so, right then and there, I would've given it a 5 star rating had I simply stopped the movie.But as the story went on, the characters developed a bit more and whether you want to or not, you feel yourself rooting for the hero to get the girl and for the Spanish swordsman to get revenge for his father and of course for the no good Humperdinck to be locked away. And for this, I upped the rating. At the end of the day, it really is a cute story.However, don't be expecting stellar acting performances, particularly clever plot twists nor great special effects (i.e. the blood in this movie literally looks like ketchup). Don't expect any major exploration of deep themes, and for feminists don't expect a strong female lead. But if you're feeling like a classic, damsel in distress short and sweet film, this may be for you."
MooWoolf1,"Nov 8, 2018",5/10,"Well first of all I've seen like 95% of the top 250.So I just watched this movie and it was an easy one. I just turned off my brain. I just had to watch it. Otherwise it was silly in a positive way and fun, but to be honest this movie had nothing in it. It was basicly weak in every aspect.The story was nothing. The only special thing was that it was told as a tale.It was really nothing.. I had no idea why is this movie rated 8.1 currently. Why is it a top250 ""member"".Then I checked the reviews and I still didn't understand what the hell are these people talking about.Then I check 5 of them that gave 10 stars!When I saw that they gave movies like Casablanca, The Godfather, Metropolis, M, Rear Window, The LOTR movies, The Notebook, Rebecca and the list goes on.. So they gave these movies 3, 4 and 5 stars..
I just realized it is not me. Something is seriously wrong about them.
Someone who can give 4 stars for those movies above should not be allowed to vote. They are not reliable at all.I tend to hate movies about drug addiction as I can't understand the motivation behind it. ( With a few exception ). But I do not rate it with 3 stars just because of that.But seriously.. How can you rate The Godfather and Casablanca to 3 or 4 and give this movie a 10.. Incredible.."
The_Film_Auditor,"Jul 17, 2018",8/10,"The Princess Bride has been a film that I've always wanted to watch but never got the opportunity until now (Thank you Goodwill!). After finishing the film, I can see why it's close to so many people's hearts. Throughout the film, I caught myself smiling at moments and bursting with laughter at others. It is a very easy watch. The story's pace is great, making the viewer captivated and invested in the characters throughout the entire film. This is done with the help of some fantastically choreographed sword fighting, hilarious jokes, and an array of diverse characters.Even though I enjoyed this film, there are some things I can nitpick. I noticed many continuity errors while watching the film; not that it really matters, but it was sometimes distracting me from the story. I also felt as though there were times where the plot was too convenient or over the top. This could have been intentional since most child bedtime stories are outlandish, but there were scenes such as when they break into the castle that had me scratching my head and saying what the??? There were also parts of the film where I felt as though characters knew things or had things that they probably wouldn't, like when Fizzik pulls out a random black robe from his sleeve. That was confusing, but again, I might just be missing the humor behind those parts.Even though I had some tiny issues with the film, I still had fun with this movie. There were many moments that reminded me of when my dad used to read stories of knights and pirates to me as I fell asleep. This childhood sentimentality mixed with the feelings of whimsy and familiarity while watching the film is why I think that this film was such a fun experience. I would definitely recommend this film, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think most will find something fun about this story of silliness, revenge, and true love.The GoodActingHilarious/comedic timingCaptivating storyThe BadContinuity errorsPlot holesThe grandpa/grandson story sometimes getting in the way"
thesar-2,"Nov 12, 2009",10/10,"This is going to date me, but when I was a kid, my sister loved the soap opera 'Santa Barbara,' and because of Robin Wright, she wanted to see 'The Princess Bride.' It became one of her favorites, getting me to watch it. After watching and only being a kid, I just ""liked"" it. Since then, I must have seen this 20+ times. It is truly a timeless classic, made with pure heart, adventure, comedy, excitement, romance, etc – in other words, all of the needed elements of a masterpiece. (I do use the word ""timeless"" if you forgive the He-Man guys behind the all-but two-year-old Fred Savage and the high-tech ""video game"" he is playing. Other than that, it can be viewed in any decade.) We have Grandfather that reads the said-title to his ill grandson and so the story unfolds, beautifully. Westley and Buttercup are the central characters in this fairy-tale land, but all of the actors/characters have such depth and realism, it's almost never-ending in excitement when one appears, leaves and/or returns. You will see hilarious comedy, exciting sword-fighting or mind-games and true love. This movie is also perfect for the whole family. You might see people die, but it's as graphic as people simply falling off screen. Little blood, no nudity, no language, no sexI love the fact when they set out to make this, they didn't need to add any of that in and now have an all-time-classic. I'd hate to ruin any of the surprises, or the people the characters meet along the way or the near-death experiences they take with strides, so I would just highly recommend this all ages, to all audiences. If you've already experienced one of the best movies of all time, enjoy it again; see how movies should be made."

I really enjoyed the pace of the story and it had all the makings of a classic fairytale story. I was really pleased with the actors, the characters, and the family friendliness of the movie. It makes me really sad that I resisted seeing this movie for so long because I could've enjoyed it a lot over the last 30 years!"

But I have two that strike me as perfectly entertaining stories. This is one.Oh, the other values of filmmaking are fine here, but what makes this stand out is excellence in the simple art of storytelling. Also as I enjoy self-reference, I like the frame of the grandfather telling the story to a sick child."
chubarova,"May 14, 2020",7/10,"It's suitable for family evening. Firstly, the plot is interesting, you have 2 different lines: grandpa and the boy, who become closer during the tale, and the story about beautiful princess and hero who must save the princess. The plot is quite predictable but it can also advantage, it's veru warm and old-fashioned. Secondly, the cast is good, especially supporting actors they are very memorable.
So, it's good family movie for all ages."

The person who insisted on showing this to me described it as ""the most quotable film ever"", and I can't help but feel that those are the people who enjoy this film - the kind of people who are obsessed with quoting things.I've always found those people so annoying.There's a clear storyline and some typecast characters and moments that feel vaguely feminist in a way that makes Feminist Guys feel good about themselves. (The entire film, of course, revolves around men.) Visually the whole thing is beautiful in the way things used to be beautiful in the 80s, before overly fast-paced editing and the constant grittiness of everything.I feel like such an old crank for giving a low rating to a film so well loved. Oh well, ""my name is indigo montana, I'm here to destroy your childhood, something something whatever""."
aquaalexhart,"Nov 19, 2015",10/10,"Cary Elwes and Robyn Wright in a fantasy story of epic proportions, how can you improve on that? Even with Peter Falk as the Narrator being interrupted by his grandson Fred Savage just seem to fit and rather than distract from an epic movie it just enhances the viewers experience.The Princess Bride is a fantasy romantic adventure movie with just the right blend of comedy, action, adventure and romance to suit everyone's taste.I love Andre the Giant as the Brute, Fezzik. Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya will forever be to me the perfect model of a Spanish duelist.His line from the move is almost as famous as the movie itself. ""My name is Inigo Montoya! You killed my father! Prepare to die!""And the fight scene between Inigo Montoya and the Man in Black is truly epic while still being tongue in the cheek.This is a movie nobody should ever try to remake, just watch the original and fall in love with it as you do the characters."
aheaven2005,"Oct 3, 2021",10/10,"Everything in The Princess Bride is perfect and makes it one of the greatest cult classics of all time. Great acting by everyone, tremendous writing and a charming story. Add to this the marvelous Andre The Giant and you get a gem what is really timeless."
adriannafiss,"Aug 23, 2007",10/10,"My favorite movie of all time, hands down. I watched it for the first time in the theatre. As it ended, the audience sat motionless and quiet for several beats, then burst into loud applause as the ending credits rolled. I'm not always so prophetic, but I was incredibly moved. I said to my husband, ""We've just seen the Academy Award winner."" If I had no other basis for recommendation, I would say the breathtaking cinematography and transporting musical score would make a viewing worthwhile . But these are merely the window dressings. The screenplay is enchanting. Also, without an understanding of the historical times, it would be too easy to say simplistically that this is a woman trying to live within the terms of a marriage of convenience and then compensating with pursuit of a doomed passion. What was crafted out of a mishmash of a more-or-less factual account is still a beautiful love and adventure story."
ThePiousPatriot,"May 6, 2016",9/10,"I put off seeing this movie simply because of the title. I figured that this was just another chick flick. It's not...I have been told by many that I have to watch this film. I hear people throw out words like, ""great"", ""classic"", and ""must see"". Even my wife said to me, ""You're a collector, and never seen the 'Princess Bride'?"" So, I gave it a shot, and I loved it. I can't put my finger on the reason why though. I must say though, that there's something about this movie, it grows on you, and I do love it now. Let me tell you a bit about it:Hard to talk about without giving away spoilers, so forgive me if there isn't much info here, but I hope this helps you. Let me start by saying that this is a great movie to watch whether you're alone, with your friends, or even with your girlfriend. There's action, though not intense like say, Bloodsport. There's A TON of comedy. There's a love story. A fantastic cast. Sword fights, monsters, poison, dungeons, castle sieges. What more could you ask for? Despite all of these things, this is not a very serious film. Which some people like. For me, it depends on my mood. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a serious medieval period piece like ""Kingdom of Heaven"", sometimes I'm in the mood for the opposite, like ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" I would say that, in terms of seriousness vs spoof, this film is sandwiched exactly between ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""Men in Tights"". Not too spoofy, but not one that stays with you and keeps you thinking all night either."

medusa47,"Oct 22, 2005",10/10,"The Princess Bride is an amazing movie for people of all ages. It has so many elements to it that it can be classified under multiple genres, and the acting is excellent. Having read the book, I can assure you that the script is very accurate for those of you that detest books that are made into movies poorly. (Here it must be pointed out that William Goldman, the author of the novel version of The Princess Bride, was the screenwriter for the movie version.) The Princess Bride is an endearing movie with all the ingredients needed to produce a ""feel good"" experience. It is highly recommended by this ""critic."" (And ladies, it is a great movie to watch with gentlemen because it has a lovely romantic side amidst all of the sword fighting and action. Plus, the wit and humor that penetrates the entire film is highly appreciated by both genders.)"
sbricau1,"Dec 24, 2007",5/10,"I am one of the few people I know who truly does not like this movie- and I usually love fantasy. Although the movie had some great (very quotable) lines and several strong characters, it seemed very two-dimensional to me.The main problem I had with this movie: (some minor spoilers) - Buttercup is a complete ditz. She has absolutely no redeeming qualities, and her bravest act is to contemplate suicide when she believes her ""true love"" to be dead. Even the earliest Disney princesses had more personality than her. I thought we were past movies in which the fair maiden does nothing but let the handsome guy come rescue her, but apparently we aren't.All in all, I felt that this movie had some good parts, but I simply could not get past Buttercup's character enough to enjoy the rest of the movie. Therefore, I give it a 5.0 out of 10 for being fun and original, but anti-feminist."
MihaiSorinToma,"Apr 24, 2017",10/10,"A young boy is told the story of two peasants who've swore eternal love and devotion. Seeking a better future for his beloved, the young one goes out into the world, only to be declared dead a while after. While she is to be married with a king she does not love, a mysterious figure appears out of nowhere to find her, going through many perils along the way.It's a fantastic story which is pleasant to watch, regardless of age and creates a superb atmosphere in which you enter and don't want to get out. It's unexpectedly funny throughout many scenes, while introducing diverse and complex characters, each with its own unique sense of humor. Although providing a somewhat predictable plot and finale like many fairy tales, it still manages to keep you interested, amused and above all, entertained. It's a must see, no matter how you look at it."
manumfernandes,"May 11, 2020",8/10,"It's goofy, preposterous and downright ridiculous and that's why it is amazing. It's a curious effect the way that we unreluctantly accept all the impossible things when dealing with the fantastic and in this film we simply transport ourselves to this world. It's comedic takes are hilarious and even outside the book's story, when we go to the boy and the grandfather, we just feel the love inherent to the family bond. Rob Reiner really hit a high with this one."
Redbird382,"Dec 12, 2019",10/10,"As a kid I took the movie very seriously. I loved it, but I didn't get all of the humor. Instead, I loved the sword fights and the attack of the ROUS. I took the story at face value, and it was great. It inspired me to read fantasy literature and to learn fencing. It made me love adventure and question whether or not a pirate and thief could be honorable. It was a great movie at this level.As I got older I began to appreciate the comedy. I laughed at Miracle Max. I laughed at the wedding scene. I laughed at the Sicilian and Fezzik's rhyming. I began to appreciate how the fencing was not just well done, but given a humorous tone. It works even better like this, and was like an entirely new movie.Even in the last few years, I have gained a new appreciation for the movie. I have noticed the different archetypes, and I understand that the movie and the book are of great literary value as well. The story takes some fairly simple characters and situations, like the honorable thief and the battle of wits, and creates an interesting and wonderful story. Each time I watch it I begin thinking about all of the different allusions that appear.All in all, this is a wonderful film. I have watched it over and over again, and I will watch it with my high school students every year."
TheJudge-2,"Oct 18, 2001",9/10,"Having just recently sat through Dungeons and Dragons (*shudder*) with my daughter, I decided that I should show her that there is indeed good in the world, blew the dust off my VHS copy of The Princess Bride, and settled down to watch it with her.I'm not going to draw a comparison, though. It'd be so unfair, for this film remains one of the very best I've ever seen. It's beautifully photographed and directed, it's extremely funny, and succeeds captivatingly at poking fun at itself too, and it's totally engaging throughout. There's not a weak piece of acting in there - okay, admittedly we're talking about fairy tale stereotypes almost throughout, but even so every performance meshes just perfectly. Cary Elwes (and what *has* happened to his career?) is just ideal in his slightly self-mocking role as boyscout meets Errol Flynn, and Robin Wright just shines as the Princess - she's possibly the most beautiful woman I've ever sen on film, giving Grace Kelly a real run for her money. Chris Sarandon makes an excellent scheming evil prince, and the comic vignettes from the likes of Billy Crystal, Wallace Shawn and Mel Smith are a sheer delight.Fred Savage, who I am no particular fan of, gives a very creditable performance as the grandson, capturing the truculence of a 9 year old without once becoming annoying, and his relationship with the accomplished Peter Falk as his grandfather is touchingly and accurately observed.But the whole show is entirely stolen by Mandy Potemkin as Inigo, the bandit with a mission. His role is both a comic tour de force, and poignant too. I'm sure that even in 30 years' time, if I hear the words ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die"", I'll start smiling and chuckling at the evoked memory of a movie that is in its genre simply beyond compare.Oh and my daughter sat simply spellbound through every frame. What more could you want?"
bergchr1,"May 31, 2006",N/A,"Let me just start out by saying to the legions of fans that I just did not find this movie to be that good. Now, don't get me wrong...I love a lot of 80s movies, AND Monty Python, AND I have a pretty good sense of humor. All the rabid fans of ""The Princess Bride"" seem to use those as guidelines for who likes this movie, but I'm not buying it. This just did not do ANYTHING for me.My college roommate was shocked and appalled freshman year that I had never seen, or even heard of, ""The Princess Bride."" So, she had me set aside some time to watch it with her. Let's just say it was like this: have you ever been watching something, and thought ""when does this get good?"" That was exactly what I was thinking by about 20 minutes in. I gave it a fair shake: I'd never heard of it except for the glowing reviews of my roommate, and we also have pretty similar tastes in movies for the most part, so I was expecting it to be at least fairly good if she liked it THAT much. Ah, geez, was I wrong. It was all I could do to sit through this. I won't go summarizing the entire movie, but these are my main points:1. Cary Elwes is pretty good as Westley. But then again, I like him. I didn't really like any of the other characters at all, especially not Buttercup. I didn't even really want Westley to end up with her.2. This whole ""quotability factor"" is blown way out of proportion. Especially this ""inconceivable!"" line that everyone thinks is so great...only mildly amusing at best.3. The sheer repetitiveness of all the ""Prepare to die"" and ""Inconceivable"" stuff is ridiculous and tiresome (it gets that way VERY quickly). Even the oddly endearing ""As you wish""...you just get tired of hearing it. All the ""un-funniness"" really just takes away from the few amusing parts.4. When it comes down to it, I was just bored. The story is so up-and-down, all over the place...I don't know how a child could sit through this, when I was waiting for it to end before the midpoint.Just my opinion...this movie is WAY over-rated."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jan 30, 2007",6/10,"Here's another movie I just loved the first time I saw it, but it went downhill with subsequent viewing. That's not knocking the film overall, because it is entertaining. The dialog is funny throughout most of it and the scenery is beautiful. It's a nice-looking disc which enhances the interesting visuals.The Spaniard, played by Mandy Patinkin, was the most interesting character, I thought, along with Wallace Shawn (the short, bald-headed guy). However, ""Inigo Montoya's"" (Patinkin) whole life was centered on revenge, a poor message to give all the kids who watched this film. Robin Wright made her film debut and looked extremely pretty.Speaking of poor messages, I didn't think the cheap shot given the clergy-figure, dressed up like the Pope, was appropriate. Of course, being a Rob Reiner film, it's no surprise the extreme left-winger would put that in the film. At the ending credits, the reverend is sarcastically labeled ""The Impressive Clergyman."" Also, hearing young Fred Savage utter the Lord's name in vain was not necessary, even if it was in the book."

wizardowlgenius-14237,"May 4, 2019",6/10,"I had expected this movie to be good after I heard much praise for it, but after watching it, I find it to be not worthy of its place in the top 250 movies list.
Comparing it to other movies based on fairy tales, such as Big Fish (2003) or Edward Scissorhands (1990), this story is dull and lack of imagination. I can sort of guess what would happen to the characters from the beginning, so there isn't any excitement or surprise as the plot develops. Even as a movie based on a fairy tale, this film feels too farcical in a lot of places to be taken seriously as a film that can establish an emotional connection with its audience. None of the challenges appear to pose a genuine danger. Each obstacle is overcome with great ease in ways that are not convincing."
grantss,"Jan 12, 2014",10/10,"Wonderful, heart-warming story. Basically a fairy tale, but with some 20th century sensibilities and witticisms. Very funny at times. Some great, and quotable, lines.Rob Reiner's direction is spot-on. Never a dull moment - the movie just motors along and you hardly feel the time pass.Good performances all round. Cary Elwes, Robin Wright and Mandy Patinkin don't put a foot wrong. Hard to single out any, but Mandy Patinkin's, as Inigo Montoya, is probably the pick of the lot.It's not just the main characters who deserve our attention. Some big names in minor roles, and they all deliver in spades - Peter Falk, Fred Savage, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, Peter Cook, Mel Smith.A modern classic and ideal for all ages."
tikidoll,"Jun 17, 2006",6/10,"I first saw this movie in 1993 as the film study part of our 10th grade English course. I liked it at the time, but not overly so. But movies have something taken out of them when you have to watch it with the means of studying it.I know it is spoke highly of, so I decided to rent it to watch it again since I love fairy tales and satire and am much more of a movie buff than I was at 15.I have to say, while I was entertained throughout, I still feel, after 13 years, much the same as I did then. Often my opinions change after so much time, but not in this case. It had its funny moments, but I just felt like it wasn't quite there. There were funny parts about it, but it wasn't consistent. Buttercup had no humorous aspect whatsoever which made the mood confusing. It isn't as though I can't appreciate subtlety, but I felt that after some comical scenes with Westly and Inigo, the characters didn't remain funny. It seemed indecisive with humour in spurts so that otherwise serious people would occasionally make funny remarks.I think my overall feeling is that I don't feel pulled towards having watched a comedy or a magical fairy tale. I feel a little lost. I think it's not as funny as it was supposed to be. It wasn't full of jokes that didn't work. The ones they had were good. There just weren't that many jokes to begin with. If Buttercup had been more of an airhead as she was supposed to be in the book, it might have opened the door for more humour.I still enjoyed the film, but I feel it fell short of what it was intended to be."
markwilson,"Feb 26, 2001",1/10,"I lump this film right up there with Titanic as the most overrated film of all times. You put a cheesy romantic love story in the middle of a medieval forest and stick a few funny one-liners in there, and suddenly you've got a classic? I don't buy it. I don't think this movie is terrible like I thought Titanic was, but I don't think it was all that great either. I actually found it rather boring, the special effects lame, and the love story unbelievable. But as usual, people buy into this kind of thing, especially teenage girls. I'm just thankful that there are people around with sense who don't buy into every bit of syrupy sappy love stories Hollywood serves up. I give the movie about a 6 out of 10. I might have given it a seven, but the fact that it is in the top 100 of all times made me feel otherwise. Watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail for some great comedy, but only watch this if you are drawn in by sappy syrupy love stories."

Kingslaay,"May 30, 2017",6/10,The Princess Bride felt like it was told by 12 year old's for 12 year old's. I do not find this film all that good and it certainly doesn't fly with me. Its silly linear story telling and predictability is quite unnerving. This would be a great movie for fans of Sesame Street and I think they forgot to include the Muppets in this tale. But as for a movie to cater to adults it is very mediocre. The cast felt too protected and it was silly childish fun. I cannot emphasize enough the predictability and lack of substance this film has. I know I'm the minority to just sees this film for what it is but it was a waste of time. It is good news for high school or college students studying theater because the next time they produce a lackluster play at the theater there is a chance it will be praised to the heavens.

I've read the book, which was equally incredible, and I just love the entire concept of this story. All of the characters are just so lovable and the story simply captured my heart in the beginning and didn't let go until the end. Some may find it a bit corny, but I truly appreciated every aspect of the film. It was exciting. It was romantic. It was funny.William Goldman is an exceptional writer, Rob Reiner is an incredible director, and the entire cast of this film were amazing. Cary Elwes captured the character of Westley. Mandy Patinkin was an incredible Inigo Montoya. Andre the Giant was the most lovable Fezzik imaginable. Everything about this film was spectacular. I love this movie."
drqshadow-reviews,"Sep 18, 2018",10/10,"Charming, witty and beautiful, a short saga which wears its fairy tale inspirations on one sleeve and fantasy inspirations on the other. And, if there were a third sleeve, there we'd see the trace of a swashbuckling influence, too. This one hits all the right notes, from the gently-plucked musical score (provided by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits) to the familiar-yet-surprising twists and turns of the plot to the positively irreplaceable casting decisions.That last one really stuck with me on this viewing, the realization that every last role was occupied by the perfect actor. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright as the smitten, star-crossed lovers; Mandy Patinkin in a vigorously youthful revenge role, complete with a spectacularly great catchphrase; Andre the Giant as the good natured, softly-spoken mountain of a man; Wallace Shawn as a smooth-talking Sicilian who might be too smart for his own good; Billy Crystal and Carol Kane effortlessly lightening the mood; Christopher Guest as a cowardly enforcer; Peter Falk and Fred Savage as the story's connection to the modern world. Take away any one of those players and the film suffers.Rob Reiner, working from novelist William Goldman's screenplay, brings an inherently literary tale to life in ways that must have seemed impossible at the onset. Together, they deliver just the right mix of levity and romance, dramatic tension and comic timing. A few seams show here and there, particularly when scenes aren't shot on-location or monsters threaten the key players, but somehow that just adds to the bemusing magic of it all. Tough to think of a better love letter to the not-so-innocent myths of old, or a more timeless rendition of their common themes."

RECB3,"Feb 23, 2024",6/10,This is an alright film for everyone to watch. The crew did a fine enough job in creating this film. The storyline of this film was a bit weak and needed a bit more strength. The storyline got lost during some parts throughout the film. The cast selection was good enough. They did not fully commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. The chemistry that was displayed between the cast members was weak and could have been stronger. This film reveals to viewers that it is fine to do the right thing even if everyone else disagrees with it. I have tried to do the right thing during my lifetime and everyone else disagrees with it every time. This is a fine film for everyone to watch.

Leofwine_draca,"Jun 5, 2015",6/10,"THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those well-loved 1980s classics that I'd never seen before, so I thought I'd better get around to watching it as everybody else has, it seems. It turns out to be a slight but lively swashbuckler in which various heroic characters team up to battle a dastardly prince and his allies in a quasi-historical world.The film had a budget of 16 million dollars and yet it looks rather cheap in places, but I guess that's part of the fun. Although the narrative is set in some kind of unspecified historical past, the script is replete with modern-day gags which work nicely somehow. It's the humour that makes this so entertaining, and without these gags I think it would have been rather ho hum.Cast-wise, we're saddled with the weak and weedy Cary Elwes as the erstwhile hero and Robin Wright as the uninteresting damsel-in-distress, but the best actor by far is Mandy Patinkin who excels as the master Spanish swordsman. Patinkin has natural wit and flair, plus plenty of charisma that really comes across. Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon are the pantomime villains, there are cameos for comedians like Billy Crystal, Mel Smith, and Peter Cook, and a nice supporting role for lovable wrestler Andre the Giant. In fact this is an all-star thing with a wraparound story involving Fred Savage and Peter Falk. THE PRINCESS BRIDE was shot mainly in the Peak District here in the UK, which looks fantastic, and contains a lovely fencing bout that brings to mind the likes of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn. Watch how the last half hour was extensively ripped off for ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES."
markb80,"Sep 25, 2011",1/10,"I don't normally write reviews, but felt compelled to after watching this. I watched this with my g/f last night. I'm working my way through most of top films at the moment and was looking forward to it after its 8.1 rating from over 100,000 people. I'm also a big fan of the fantasy genre.Well, all I can say is this was just abysmal. Not a patch on films such as Neverending story or Willow. As others have suggested I can only imagine the high rating due to kids have fond memories of this from their child hood.Not remotely funny, at least not intentionally. The only part that had me and my g/f laughing was the part where they encounter the rats. They looked so bad it was amusing. The best part was when one leaped at the main character. It looked like someone in the studio had simply picked up the rat and thrown it at him(can't even remember his name).Luckily I fell asleep about 50 mins and my g/f had the decency not to wake me up. She assured me I didn't miss anything.If you're over 15 and watching this for the 1st time expect to be disappointed. The film hasn't aged at all well, the effects are really terrible, the small villain has to be one of the most annoying characters I've ever witnessed. Looks like they had a budget of £20.Even Army of Darkness was marginally better than this and I thought that was terrible and not at all funny either.Receives a 2, rather than a 1 thanks to the rat scene making us both laugh hard for 30 seconds or so."
hamflett23,"Dec 31, 2018",10/10,This is my 1st review for any film. This is my favourite film and gets better every time I watch it. A true love story. I drive my family mad by quoting 'Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die' I have lost count of the number of times i have said it. This film makes me smile every time I watch it. I would recommend it to anyone who loves an adventure story and who believes that true loves never dies.
costafic,"Mar 29, 2020",9/10,"The iconic dialogue and fun, lively plot represent ideal artistic filmmaking. It is a rare example of filmographical expression valued more than box office numbers, even if they did end up being successful, it felt deserved! Highly recommended."
squire85,"Feb 10, 2019",10/10,"This movie has all the right things for anyone, young or old to enjoy it. Fencing duels, fierce battles, practical effects, torture, revenge plots, friendly giants, fierce creatures, exciting chases, daring escapes, true love, miracles and truly unforgettable cast.I was just a baby, when this film first came out in theaters. So, I missed the ball to see it there. Cut to 20 years later and after watching a 30 second parody of the movie from...ironically enough, 30 Second Bunnies; I was anxious to see it. Then, I received the DVD for Christmas and put it in my player to watch it for the first time.From beginning to end, I was thoroughly hooked!The comedy, the chemistry between characters (especially Westley and Buttercup,) the sword fights, Fezzik's rhyming...everything about this movie was just awesome. I've watched it several dozen times on DVD and it never loses its splendor. If you haven't seen it for yourselves, I HIGHLY recommend you do.This film is just too good to pass up.Two thumbs up, five stars and 10 out of 10"

It's a delightful family movie that balances satire and sincerity, making it a timeless cinematic experience for audiences of all ages.Enjoy."
slug-12,"Aug 10, 1999",N/A,"Brilliant from star to finish, Rob Reiner's ""The Princess Bride"" is the ultimate in screen fantasy.  Featuring some absolutely mesmerizing performances, especially from Mandy Patinkin and Cary Elwes and with some wonderful comedy thrown in (Billy Crystal and Carol Kane are the most hilarious screen couple in years!), Reiner has created a masterpiece of adventure, camraderie, and true love.  Grade: A+"
daddysarm,"Jun 15, 2021",6/10,"The entire cast was chosen very well. There are a bunch of good to even-better 1-liners. Plenty of little satirical moments well done. It makes you smile.Otherwise, I don't get it. It gets cloying. How can people call it a masterpiece & how is it overall rated so highly? Is it nostalgia for people who saw it as a kid or nostalgia for a grandfather?My favorite scene is when they ride away on four horses & Andre is no bigger then the rest of them."
Bmore-Hero,"Dec 24, 2024",7/10,"The Princess Bride is a whimsical mix of fantasy, romance, and comedy that has earned a cult following over the years. While it's easy to see why the film has such enduring appeal, it didn't quite hit the mark for me in the same way it has for many others.The story, framed as a fairy tale read by a grandfather to his grandson, is filled with memorable characters and quotable lines. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright give charming performances as the leads, and supporting characters like Inigo Montoya and Vizzini add a lot of personality to the film. However, the humor, while clever at times, didn't always land for me, and the pacing felt uneven in spots.The mix of genres is unique, and the film certainly doesn't take itself too seriously, which is part of its charm. But the lighthearted tone sometimes undermines the emotional stakes, making it hard to fully invest in the characters or their journey.That said, The Princess Bride does have undeniable charm, and I can appreciate its wit and creativity. It's a fun, family-friendly movie, but it didn't leave a lasting impression on me the way it seems to for so many others. Fans of quirky, nostalgic storytelling will likely enjoy it more than I did."
nathanchamberland,"Sep 8, 2020",10/10,"From start to finish, this film is a masterpiece. It has everything-adventure, romance, comedy, thrills, and much more.It has the feel of a stage production with the contrived sets and over-the-top performances, but masterfully executed.The script is perfect. I cannot imagine anything that would have made every single word spoken any better. It also feels like the entire cast were all best friends. One can sense the camaraderie.This is the perfect film. I was a fan in 1987, and I am an even bigger fan now in 2020-especially since the cast are coming together once again for the most noblest of causes.This film is timeless and perfect in every way.Bravo!"
mentalcritic,"Jun 29, 2005",7/10,"Before you jump on my head about the title of my comment, please hear me out. I definitely do not think The Princess Bride is a bad film, per se. I have heard it called all sorts of things, from a timeless classic to a great fantasy romp for all ages. Neither of those things are quite true. The film is as dated as most of the Nightmare On Elm Street episodes (especially the Clown Freddy ones). It also falls into the trap of trying to appeal to everyone, and as a result limiting its audience more than it otherwise would. But what it lacks in classic status, it (almost) makes up for in some other areas. On one hand, I can see why I was so reluctant to see the film when it was recommended to me around ten years ago. It was, after all, released in the same year as the holy chunk of awesome that is RoboCop. On the other hand, I can see why it was recommended to me on two occasions that span over a decade apart. I won't put this in my list of favourite films, but I admire it for its uniqueness among the fodder that was made in the same year.I will get the negatives out of the way, since they are the smaller part of this comment. The extraneous storyline involving Peter Falk playing a grandfather who reads this tale to his grandson, played with impeccable irritation by a very young Fred Savage, was utterly unnecessary. They get in the way of the story rather than enhancing it, especially when the action is interrupted to make some comment or to beat us over the head with how universal the story supposedly is. The characters are about as deep as a puddle, and we get no sense of why Westley loves Buttercup (or vice versa) so dearly. None of what passes for motivation or character development here is shown to us, it is all told. Some of the locations shown in the film have names so daft it will make your eye muscles twitch. Yes, there were names with a daft factor in adventure films like The Goonies (a far better children's adventure film in spite of what the IMDb would have you believe), but The Goonies succeeded in making the audience not notice (or care).Now that the problems are out of the way, let's concentrate for a moment of the film's strengths. Mandy Patinkin would have been a far better choice for the focal point of the story, as he runs with the campiness of the story at a speed that would impress Olympic champions. Christopher Guest portrays Patinkin's nemesis with a grace and, dare I say it, subtlety that could have worked wonders if it had transferred to the rest of the film. Robin Wright does the best she can with a very unidimensional role. She is mainly there to tell off the villain or beg for the hero's aid. The real jewel of the cast here is André the Giant, one of showbusiness' true well... gentle giants. As he is making comedy based around his knowledge of how big he is, the softer side of him that realises he is not in the best of health even for a forty-one year old shines through every time he delivers a line. Granted, one can only understand half of what he says at best. But of all the performers in the film, André is the one that will be remembered long after the rest have been forgotten.Some of the trick shots or effects sequences are lousy. The shrieking eels sequence was obviously meant to induce tension in the target audience, but even in five year olds, if the manner in which it is set up doesn't induce laughs or groans, the eels themselves surely will. Others, however, are very well-realised, and work well enough to make the film watchable. When André the Giant carries his castmates up the face of a cliff, one does not see whether it is just trick photography or a set, but it suspends disbelief enough to leave one in awe of the character. I don't know why the IMDb lists the stunt rider of André in the final ride-away scene as being obvious. Maybe I am not as cynical or jaded as I would like to believe, but this shot sold itself well enough that I could feel sorry for the horse. This, friends and neighbours, is a sign of a well-made film.In summation, The Princess Bride is a lot better than I thought it would be, but it is nowhere near as good as many make out. For fantasy adventures, I am far more inclined to recommend The Goonies, which is far more realistic in the sense of being less normalistic than is the case here. Nonetheless, if you have already seen The Goonies, then The Princess Bride is worth a look. I gave it a seven out of ten. Of the hundreds of DVDs I have around me, it is far from the last I would watch."
alemieux954,"Mar 13, 2010",1/10,"This is just an absolutely terrible movie. It dragged for the most part. Dialogue was juvenile. Jokes weren't funny at all. Acting was very bad. Rating is probably as high as it is as kids remember it fondly. Can't understand how anyone who is 25 years or older could possible have liked this movie. For me I always liked Andre the Giant and was happy to see him in this film but the rest of the characters were not believable and it actually looked like they were acting. It was as if they were auditioning for a part but weren't. The only part I liked was the line ""You killed my father, prepare to die. Overall it wasn't very entertaining at all."
craighoots,"Aug 27, 2022",10/10,"Undoubtedly my most rewarched and favorite movie.It's now become a tradition to watch it every time I get sick. So I currently got COVID for th first time after avoiding it for the first time in 2.5 years so time for a rewatch.This movie has something for everyone and was done beautifully well especially considering it's 1987 release. It's hard way more effect on popular culture than the highest grossing movie of all time Avatar that goes sure!The cast, the set design, costuming, plot all of it were done amazingly well and it's stands the rest of time.Why do these have to be 600 characters too?"
a_chinn,"Aug 24, 2020",9/10,"Another quarantine film appreciation class with my kids was a hit (""Labyrinth"" also got a thumbs-up. ""E.T."" got a Meh). From writer William Goldman (""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" ""All the Presidents Men"" ""Misery"") and director Rob Reiner (""This is Spinal Tap"" ""Stand by Me"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and also ""Misery"") comes a very subversive fairy tale send-up. It's charming and wimiscal enough that the kids will love it and it's witty and subversive that adults will love it even more so. What makes this parody film unique is that while Goldman and Reiner are certainly poking fun at fairy tale tropes, they also tell a fairy tale with genuine charm and sweetness. Compared to other parody films like ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Airplane"" which are entirely mocking and ridicule, ""The Princess Bride"" is at its heart is still a fairy tale love story. I won't bother summarizing the story, since I'm assuming everyone has already watched this film, but ""The Princess Bride"" boasts a stellar cast, led by then unknown Cary Elwes (""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" ""Glory"" ""Days of Thunder"" ""Stranger Things"") and Robin Wright (""Forrest Gump"" ""Moneyball"" ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" ""House of Cards""). The scene stealing supporting cast has SO many iconic moments! Wallace Shawn shouting ""Inconceivable!"" and the battle of wits face-off. Peter Cook's speech impaired clergyman. Mel Smith's throat clogged Albino. Carol Kane and Billy Crystal as the bickering Valerie and Miracle Max. Mandy Patinkin's Inigo Montoya is the main standout in the cast, who's performance still gave me chills when he has his final confrontation with Christopher Guest's six-fingered Count Rugen. Patinkin brings a level of emotion to the film that brings unexpected depth and heart. Then there's the enormous André the Giant, who pretty much steals every scene he's in. I also usually dislike wraparound or story bookends, but Fred Savage and Peter Falk are wonderful as a grandfather and grandson reading the story together, which affords lots of opportunities for commentary on the story and to even skip over the boring parts. The film's Once-Upon-A-Time feel is greatly aided is a lush score by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits and beautiful photography by Adrian Biddle (""Aliens"" ""Thelma & Louise"" ""V for Vendetta"") that gives the film a timeless feel. On the downside, the film's villains seem underdeveloped and not all that interesting. Also, the film does have some pacing issues where the story drags a bit at times. Still, those are minor quibbles for a film that really does deserve its status as a classic film that both kids and adults (for different reasons) will enjoy. FUN FACT: André the Giant called almost everybody on set (be they director, producers, co-stars or crew) ""boss"", a technique he employed to defer to people he liked and go some way towards counteracting the way he would tower over them."
yancyscott1,"Apr 18, 2007",10/10,"This movie has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I have seen it countless times, with my family, with friends, or by myself when I've needed something funny and comforting. It is the princess story that all kids love, but without the corny and dumb aspects that usually keep princess stories from appealing to humans over the age of 10. The Fred Savage character is a clever way to make fun of the genre while still indulging in it. The whole fantasy world that serves as the backdrop is beautifully done, certainly much more basic than today's movies (Lord of the Rings, for example), but it is no less magical, and I don't think kids today would have any trouble getting pulled into the world of rodents of unusual size, fire pits, and albinos."
jodie barnett,"May 29, 2002",N/A,"A childhood favourite, this is one movie that I NEVER get tired of seeing. It's a very tongue-in-cheek fairytale story, with fantastic cameos by Billy Crystal and Mel Smith (Peter Cook as a priest who cannot prounouce his Rs is hilarious) and fresh direction by Rob Reiner.   Filled with dashing heroes, giants, sword-fights, true love, evil princes, fencing, it is a true fairytale at heart, but don't let that put you off. The sheer excitement of it will impress it into your heart when young, and the great one-liners will have you chuckling as an adult. It is obvious that the cast had great fun making this movie, and it stars the beloved Cary Elwes, who apart from 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' and a few bit-parts, hasn't done much at all. Watch this movie and you'll have a great hour and a half."
dr_mario_rules,"Jan 16, 2008",6/10,"Peter Falk gives my favorite performance of his as the Grandfather who reads to his sick grandson, (played by Fred Savage, who gives an on and off cheesy performance) a book about a farm boy Westley (played by Carl Elwes, in his best performance,) who falls in love with a beautiful girl named Buttercup. To find his fortune over sea and his killed by pirates. Buttercup must now marry prince Humperdink (played by Chris Sarandon in my least favorite performance,) but days before the wedding she is captured by three me and later is saved by a man in black who turns out to be Westley.OK, I didn't like this movie, for one I am a huge Chris Sarandon fan, I loved him in Child's Play, Nightmare Before Christmas, even in Bordello of Blood, but his role in this never really had me going. Another performance was Fred Savage, although a minor role, it too didn't have me going either. The final thing, which really got me, was for being a Rob Reiner movie, some shots looked very cheap and very amateur. I am not going to deny it, I loved the scene with Billy Crystal, and it is the best film with a wrestler in it."

tea93,"Jul 12, 2019",7/10,You know a movie that is bad but in a sarcastic and intentional way so you are approving the existence of it? That is how I feel about it. Every scene is a meme treasure and the movie is so bad that is actually good.
tg_maverick_f14,"May 15, 2009",7/10,"I first saw this film in fifth grade and thought it was fantastic. I mean, come on, it had action, fantasy, romance, and comedy all in one! And even watching the movie now, the only thing that doesn't hold up as well are the special effects in the film, notably the R.O.U.S., the fires in the fire swamp, and the obvious body doubles here and there.But as for the rest of the film:The acting isn't Oscar-worthy, but it definitely isn't unmemorable. The characters are well-beloved (my favorites being Miracle Max and Valerie, the bishop, and Fezzik), and the actors were well-cast in their roles and also performed quite well.If you haven't read the book (by William Goldman) that this was adapted from, then read it. The movie is very similar to the book. In fact a lot of quotes in the movie are direct (or similar) to quite a few quotes in the book. Although there are very few differences, the book is just as exciting and witty as the movie.The costumes, makeup, and hairstyling were pretty good for a 1987 film. Props for Carol Kane and Billy Crystal's makeup and Buttercup's beautiful wedding dress.And props for Mark Knopler's music score as well. Aside from the action music, most of the score is sweet, poignant, and beautiful, especially the main theme. I'm glad that ""Storybook Love"" was up for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song because I would have selected it as one of the best that year as well.Overall, I know millions of people have seen this film (which makes it kind of a ""cult film""), but if you haven't seen it, you definitely should. Great casting, memorable characters, a wonderful storyline, great music, and lots of comedy, fantasy, action, and romance all in one. Who could ask for more? I can easily see why so many people adore this movie. It really is a treasure.My Personal Oscar Picks for this movie:Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Song (""Storybook Love""), and possibly Best Original Score"
brianfab,"Jun 1, 2001",4/10,"I finally watched the movie because someone mentioned to me that it was her favorite movie of all time....Umm...You got to be kidding (especially for the reviewer, ""Mike,"" who watches this movie every 3 weeks!??....)....Okay, Robin Wright is beautiful (and respectable as an actress as seen from her performance in ""Forrest Gump"") and the movie has some funny one-liners here and there (nothing profoundly funny here though), but what's the fascination?The movie is basically a farce with a ridiculously simple plot, poor acting (I think the acting was supposed to add to the humor....okay wow), cheap senseless humor, and unbelievable special effects (uh, remember when the ""Zorro"" fights the ""giant rats"" that look exactly like short guys in a cheap rat suit?)....I guess that's supposed to be funny too....It is truly incredible to have people comment that this movie is one of the best movies ever made or that it's a great film...because it simply isn't. I can enjoy light comedies or fantasy movies from time to time, but it's not a good one even in that genre/category.  It is not an awful movie to watch and it might be enjoyable, I guess, for (up to) lower elementary kids, but it no where near lives up to its hype or the majority of the reviews seen here.  It is indeed a great insult to have a movie of this quality (I gave it a generous 4 out of 10) to have it ranked anywhere near movies such as ""The Matrix,"" ""The Gladiator,"" ""Se7en,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""American History X,"" ""Glory,"" and etc., etc., and etc.  Not worth a rental if you ask me (unless you're renting it for the kids), and definitely does not deserve to be in the Top 250!."

So many parts of it are so great, not the least of which is the fencing that Rob Reiner insisted that they practice over and over. I once read that Mr. Reiner kept telling the actors - throw the lines away - this isn't theater. They're funny, so keep going! And it shows in the movie. We would all swear that Mandy Patinkin was a world-class fencer. Just a great actor, I'm afraid.So many of the lines are so memorable, like ""inconceivable!"" With the follow-up line of ""you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think means"".And of course the part with Billy Chrystal and Carol Kane and Peter Falk.

MichaelMRamey,"Apr 21, 2018",10/10,"If you're a film fan and you don't at least enjoy this film the tiniest bit, I have to question your taste. The Princess Bride is an amazing fantasy story told through a Grandfather and Grandson in a way that can't be duplicated. The movie is in a league of its own with a memorable cast and quotable dialogue that is still used today. This is the perfect sick day film in that it truly makes you feel like a kid again."
ricsim78,"Jun 29, 2016",7/10,"I loved this movie as a kid, it has a little of everything (action, romance, adventure, humor, supernatural, fantasy, to name most). But now as an adult, sadly I do not think this movie held up over time (at least for myself). I actually found it boring and rather childish, but I still rate this highly because I am sure a lot of people will like watching this.Definitely a classic movie and worth a watch, just no longer up there with my favorites. The acting is great, characters are classic, and it has a lot to like. I just wish it held up better for me, but I still recommend it (if that makes sense). Cary Elwes proves yet again that he is a great and very under-rated actor, as he carries this movie and plays the part naturally. He was pretty young in this as well, the rest of the cast is spot on in their respective parts. For kids, this movie could not be more highly recommended."
Billy_Crash,"Feb 8, 2009",2/10,"This film is one of the true wonders of cinema: Why is it so loved?I'm all for fantasy movies, and I have no problems with comedy and romance, but ""The Princess Bride"" is slow, cumbersome and tedious. Loaded with long-winded scenes, I found myself laughing in only two spots (the old woman and ""the wine"" scene). Otherwise, the laughs were non-existent.Worst still, there were no surprises and the conflict lacked intensity.The movie put me to sleep and I had to rewatch the disappointing ending.This could have a great film, but it was slow and lackluster.My only question is why didn't Elwes truly make it as a leading man? He's intelligent, handsome and can act in any genre, but just like Peter Weller, things didn't pan out as they should have."
jmerlino,"Mar 19, 2021",10/10,"This is about as close to a perfect traditional Hollywood movie as has been made post 1960 or so. It's pure escapist entertainment, and as such, it succeeds as well as any movie possibly could.It is by turns funny, exciting, uplifting, sentimental, and endlessly entertaining. The hero is dashing and (mostly) pure. The heroine is pretty and chaste. The companions are, in every situation, unfailingly true to themselves. The villains are threatening enough to provide dramatic tension, but sufficiently comic that they're never too scary for kids.Speaking of kids - this is a great movie for them. It has all the elements of a great story, but it never gets too scary, violent or otherwise unwholesome. It extolls true love throughout but there's not a hint of sex beyond the ""perfect kiss"" at the end. But it's entertaining and well made enough that adults will find plenty to love.One aspect of this movie that might fly under the radar is the fantastic score by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits fame. Knopfler's film soundtracks are terrific and nearly as good as his albums.Anyway, to paraphrase David Letterman: If you haven't seen this movie, there's something WRONG with you."

g-bodyl,"Apr 22, 2015",9/10,"The Princess Bride has long been seen as a cinema classic and it has often been voted as one of the top films of the 80's, a sentiment that I would have a hard time disagreeing with. As a fan of the fantasy genre, this film falls in my wheelhouse. Despite me probably liking this film no matter what, there is no denying the talent behind the film. The story is simple, but sweet and written very well. The film is expertly directed and well-acted. The visuals even do a good job standing the test of time. In all, this was a very entertaining fantasy romp about the quest for true love.Rob Reiner's film is about a poor farm girl named Buttercup who is forced to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck, but her childhood love named Westley comes back as the Dreaded Pirate Roberts to rescue her from the clutches of the prince.The film may not have the most exotic cast in the world, but there is no denying how good they were and how much fun they seemed to have. I liked Cary Elwes as Westley as well as Robin Wright as Buttercup. Andre the Giant was actually very good as Fezzik, and likewise Christopher Guest as Count Rugen and Chris Sarandon as the Prince.Overall, The Princess Bride is the film for all ages. It is the kind of film that shall be passed down from generation to generation. As a fantasy lover, it has all the elements you can ask for as you expect from such a film. I loved the theme about true love as it's a theme that will always be relevant. It's such a gorgeous film and one that is also funny.My Grade: A"

It's probably the only movie I like, besides Star Wars, that would be age appropriate for younger viewers.  The story, which is typical faery tale stuff, is helped by an all-star cast.  If I had kids this is the only movie I could watch with them without wanting to hang myself halfway through it.  7/10"

This fun adventure film features swashbuckling heroes, cowardly villains, a magician who sounds like a Jewish stand-up comic, and Rodents of Unsual Size. Wright is lovely if rather wooden in the title role. Elwes is appropriately dashing as the hero. The best performance is given by Patinkin as a vengeful man bent on finding the six-fingered man who killed his father. It's all a story told by Falk to grandson Savage and their scenes are quite amusing. It is a very simple and silly story that is enjoyable to watch but hardly the neo-classic some have made it out to be."

aurora777,"Nov 20, 2003",7/10,"I like this movie, but I'm going to point out it's weakest point first:  the Princess Bride herself.  As the heroine of this tongue in cheek fairy tale, Robin Wright is lovely, but sorta wooden and unemotive.  I don't think she cracks a smile once.  Other than that, this is one of those fun movies that anyone could watch and find something to enjoy.Though Inigo Montoya is probably the most quoted character, I thought Wallace Shawn's character was the most fun.  The versatile Christopher Guest is also a hoot.  This is one of those films like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" or ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" that will continue to be watched for years to come."
thespeos,"Mar 17, 2022",9/10,"I saw first saw this film when my kids were little, and have watched it maybe a dozen times since. Never gets old.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
There are other stories (film) this can be compared to, but no one film matches its expanse, variety, tension, levity, and fun.The primary issue here is the quality of the storytelling, which is rare. Yes, the key facets below were equally important in
actually delivering the story par excellence, but the story itself is brilliantly woven.I would say that unless your heart is cold and you're immune to good story, then you'll love this film and its story.ACTING:
The cast ... wow ... so much to write, not enough time or space.1. Perfect casting. I've seen lots for bad, mediocre, and good casting. This. Individually and collectively. Was superb.2. Everyone stands out !!! Rarely can I say that about another film, from Wallace Shawn to Andre the Giant.One could argue that ""Lord of the Rings"" casting was also excellent, and I would agree ... but it wasn't exceptional, like this.It's the blending and rapport among the cast you can feel here. Note: Funny thing is Elwes (Westley) was flat in Mel Brooks'
""Robinhood - Men in Tights"" --- but it was the film that was actually the horror there. So Good actors in bad films still make for bad film.PS - It's bewildering to see Andre's hands cup fully grown adult heads. Truly, he was a modern giant.TEMPO:
The ebb and flow of this film runs largely without a hitch.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
Quite beautifulDIRECTING / WRITING:
From ""Meathead"" on the show ""All in the Family"" to directing this and ""When Harry met Sally"" ... Reiner demonstrated
unusual skill as actor, writer, and director. Most of his other films just never appealed to me, but this is one-of-a-kind.The writer (Goldman) has done other work I liked, e.g. ""All the Presidents Men,"" but like with Reiner, I didn't care for most.My guess is this was just serendipity, where together with Reiner they executed near perfect storytelling through film.Is it a very good film? Yes, absolutelyShould you watch this once? No. Watch it at least three (3) times during your lifetimeRating: 9+"
jeremycrimsonfox,"Oct 27, 2021",9/10,"The Princess Bride is a grand movie. A sick boy (played by Fred Savage is told a story by his grandfather (played by Peter Falk) about a farmboy named Wesley (played by. Cary Elwes), who became a pirate after his ship is attacked, as he goes on a quest to reunite with his childhood love, Princess Buttercup (played by Robin Wright).This is one of the greatest films of the 1980's. The story is a great fantasy tale told by a grandfather, and has some memorable characters, like Inigo Montoya (played by Mandy Patrikin) and Fezzik (played by professional wrestling legend Andre The Giant). This is a cult classic that must be seen."
psmaak2,"Jan 5, 2022",10/10,"There's a shortage of perfect movies in the world. 'Twould be a pity if you missed this one.If you haven't seen it, stop reading reviews and watch it now. It is inconceivable that one should live a life without seeing this movie."
boydmatta,"May 5, 2018",10/10,"A film with perfect casting, dialogue, acting and narrative. A perfect blend of a variety of genres, with elements of romance, comedy, (thriller/horror-like darker segments; ROUS and the pit of despair), all under the fantasy banner that holds it all together. There's something here for everyone. To anyone that hasn't seen it, it's inconcievable how good it is"
Special-K88,"May 6, 2002",N/A,"An ill, bed-ridden little boy is paid a visit by his eccentric grandfather. The grandfather reads him a bedtime story, and the result is an enchanting, adventurous fairy tale about a young princess named Buttercup (Wright) who's kidnapped by an evil prince and separated from her one true love Westley (Elwes). With the help of a crafty swordsman and a gentle giant, Westley battles thieves, bandits, and fearsome monsters in order to try and reclaim the woman he loves. Classic story from director Rob Reiner isn't always on target, but it's skillfully woven together with rich performances, engaging swordplay, spry humor, and beautiful set design. The cast is inconceivably perfect in this memorable and warmhearted adventure that you can enjoy again and again. ***"
RavenGlamDVDCollector,"Dec 22, 2016",7/10,"This is gonna be a long story. It is not meant as a serious review. So skip it if you are in a bad mood.***DORKY TALE ALERT***Back in 1986, armed with my Philips VCR, I stumbled across the TV show SANTA BARBARA while monitoring for music videos and glam/fashion inserts. It had this pretty girl in it, who looked like a teen model, I eventually learned she was in a minor yet regular part (Jade Perkins), but as soap operas with their slow, daily unwinding story arcs go, there was also this other wonderfully beautiful very very cool chick playing the part of Kelly Capwell. I watched regularly, for those two. The other girl gradually disappeared, but Kelly became {like wow, man!}...When I learned about THE PRINCESS BRIDE, I of course pursued it. It wasn't drive-in theater material (I live in a small town, no cinema) but I got it at a video-rent store, VHS, the good old days with the weak systems. My friend was about to copy* it for me. Now, this happened decades ago, and I cannot quite remember how it came to pass that I sneaked a peek, but to cut a long story short, I learned that it was kind of a Peter Falk show, was really miffed about the old man taking up such valuable time in the movie, what a waste of tape, hell, can't I do something about it? I then got the idea to record only an edited version, eliminating Peter Falk. I had several beauty competitions on tape, and was always exasperated by the ubiquitous 'vultures' taking up screen time, lounge lizard singers strutting their stuff, coming out of the woodwork, hogging the spotlight... So I was used to editing out glut. But I had my doubts about how my edit of THE PRINCESS BRIDE would appear. My objective was to do it in such a way that it wouldn't look silly, it still had to make sense.Dear people, to this day I remember that I was quite satisfied with my effort. I had thought it would look like a mess, but it ran fairly smoothly, as far as I can remember.Years later, watching on DVD, I was kinda skeptical about me ever having done that. I don't know what I would have said about my effort today. Back then I thought my version was better.But I maintain that Peter Falk was nothing more than excess baggage. A sweet charm? No, wholly unnecessary, the whole fairy-tale from GrandPa to the kid, holding back the story, give me extra footage of Princess Buttercup!Despite my view of THE PRINCESS BRIDE as weighed down by a dorky addition, it was still one of my early DVD purchases when I started collecting, not only was it considered a classic by the mail order company, it is a charming movie with a cute fairy-tale romance and a darling heroine. It's Robin Wright's best movie. (Forget about THE PLAYBOYS, that one's a bummer!) She should have been a major star!*yeah, yeah, copyright violator. Back in those days, years before DVD, that was the only way to hang on to a movie. I was a collector, and my friend did it for the challenge pf the technological aspect, we were both nuts about girls on film, no monetary gain was ever involved. And by the way, as a collector of original disks in mint condition, I have since paid my dues to Hollywood, have I ever!!"
s_rucska,"Jan 3, 2020",9/10,"A fun movie for the whole family that's wholesome and doesn't take itself to seriously. Unlike some of the critics on here....
One recommendation: Read the book if you can. It helps flush out some of the characters a bit that you don't get to see during the movie."
rachel-l-ashton,"Sep 11, 2013",2/10,"I really did not see the appeal in this film - maybe it's because I first watched at the age of 19 rather than a lot younger. I didn't think there was much of a plot, and there seemed to be no relationship ever forming between the two lovers. I literally could not believe I'd wasted an hour and a half watching this alongside two friends who had grown up with it and adored it. Honestly I think I would probably have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd seen it when younger and grown up with it. Seeing it as a young adult just made me hate the whole thing and want to criticise every aspect of the film. I don't plan on ever watching it again and if you are also a first-time watcher at a later age I can't imagine you'd see what the hype about it is either."
rogerpogge,"Jun 17, 2020",9/10,Our family has watched and re-watched this many times. My kids can (and do) repeat many of the lines as part of their vocabulary. Great acting and the storyline is a action packed and very funny fantasy. Recommend this for children and adults of all ages.
damianphelps,"Aug 30, 2020",10/10,"This is magical storytelling at its best.The movie cascades through the story without coming across as condescending or with overt sentimentality (a challenging thing to do in this kind of story). Its sweet without being sickly, funny, endearing and incredibly warm.I have never spoken to a person who failed to enjoy this all time classic.Watch this movie or 'prepare to die'!"
lindsnix,"Apr 16, 2012",10/10,"The arclight was showing several retro movies, and when I found out this movie was one of them, I immediately bought tickets. Just got back from watching The Princess Bride at the Arclight where Cary Elwes did a question and answering segment after the film. He was so nice. He stayed until everyone that wanted a pix took one with him, and he would ask your name and shake your hand too. What a class act. And the best Westley that could've ever been cast. Swoon... ;) The princess Bride was always my favorite movie as a kid. I love everything about it. The wit, the physical comedy, the love story, the action, And all of the cast is perfection. If you haven't seen this movie, run out immediately and rent it. You will never regret it!"

Granpa: ""Are you kidding?

ClayManBob,"Aug 20, 2020",6/10,"Finally got around to watching this. Expected great things based on its cult status. Avoided many times just because I dislike Patinkin. Still dislike, unfortunately. It became available for free, so finally decided to try it. I probably would have liked it more when it came out. It seems a too familiar type now, a bit stale because it's now been redone and better. Just not my cup of tea, I guess."
JohnniN,"Nov 21, 2021",9/10,"Every time I see this movie, I fall in love with it all over again. It's such a good film, and it's just very sweet and funny. Has a lot of heart. It really is inconceivable how good of a film this is."
monkey-man,"Jul 11, 2005",6/10,"I thought this movie would be bad but it turned out to be really good and the movies about a boy who is sick and his grandfather comes over and reads him a book about a man and woman in love and then he disappears for 5 years and she is going to marry a prince but he comes back and thats when the fun begins.The film has an all star cast with actors and actress like Cary Elwes,Mandy Patinkin,Chris Sarandon,Christopher Guest (I),Ardre The Giant,Robin Wright Penn and Billy Crystal.Cary Elwes from the good film saw does a great job at acting in this movie and the huge 7 foot tall Ardre The Giant is not a very good actor but he does a good job.Over all this film was good with some flaws and my rating is 6 and a half out of 10."

cricketbat,"Jul 20, 2020",10/10,"They don't make movies like The Princess Bride anymore. In fact, I don't think they made films like it before, either. This film is one of a kind. It's an original, engaging story with clever dialogue and a host of engaging characters. The humor is subtle and plentiful, and it's sweetly heart-warming without ever getting too sappy. This is a fantastic tale of fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles and everybody should see it. Oh, and if you haven't read the book, you should do that, too."
theriptide,"Nov 15, 2017",10/10,"This movie is one of my most favorite movies. It's cunning plot and dialogue makes it a excellent movie to re watch. I enjoyed the characters, their introductions, and their motivations, giving me knowledge on what their drive was, and made me on the edge of my seat, even when rewatching it."
Mr Toad,"Mar 9, 2002",N/A,"The real question we must ask ourselves here is, what rock have you been hiding under that you still haven't seen this movie? I don't think there is a more played rainy-day recess video at elementary schools nationwide. And that is really a commentary on how wonderful the movie is, because it is accessible to children and adults alike.Do yourself a favor and actually LISTEN to all of the dialogue. The level of wit is beyond so many films that are strictly comedies, and yet we also have a delightful romance and fantasy/action/adventure.Now, seriously, why haven't you seen this movie yet?"
perky_,"Jun 25, 2025",6/10,This movie was something I always heard about being held I high regard supposedly one of the greats and I mean it's a solid movie but i don't think I see it as iconic as it's been described to me. It's a solid movie but idk it wasn't anything special after it being hyped up for so long I'm glad I watched it but I don't see it being something I revisit or see as anything special. It's kinda like modern Shakespeare like it has those Shakespearen vibes without the old lingo always used and something you can enjoy without have to worry about studying. I honestly don't have much to say about this movie but it's a solid watch.
rickh57,"Jul 18, 2018",10/10,"I've watched this wonderful movie so many times, that I practically have it memorized.

zm-zaidmansur,"Apr 12, 2013",6/10,"How this made it to the top 250 I do not know. If the movie was made in the 70s I would consider giving it a better rating. Im well aware that the main-focus of the movie is the story-telling and therefore it's made a bit sloppy on purpose - I hope. The movie could've been done a lot better and still maintain the good storytelling. I also think that the director could've done a better job in making the viewer feel more with the characters - make the passion more passionate, the hate and lust for revenge more hateful and lusting.The only things convincing in the movie were: The main soundtrack, a sound that gave me buttterflies during the first commence of the two main characters, and thrills in the end. Truly deserving of the Oscar that year.The character of Miracle-MAX - hilarious, his sarcasm is a warm welcome.""...and while you're at it why don't you go ahead and give a nice papercut and pour some lemonjuice on it"" - best quote of the movie and made me laugh out loudAnd the first 6-7 minutes of the movie - brilliant!"
hou-3,"Jul 11, 2020",6/10,This fantasy comedy has its moments but loses its appeal after an hour or so. Compared with The Life of Brian or the Holy Grail it is pretty thin stuff. Most of the over the top reviews here must be based on nostalgia.
The-Seeker,"Mar 1, 2014",2/10,"I last saw The Princess Bride around 20+ years ago. I can't recall what I thought of it then but I have always been aware that it has a great following. Having just re-watched it I am utterly dismayed that a film this poorly written, so poorly acted and with such a jarring almost absurdly bad musical score has such devotion. I can only guess that it's nostalgia that's clouding the minds of its fans. It's not even remotely funny and this coming from the guy that gave us This Is Spinal Tap? The sets look worse than the cheapest TV shows. It even makes reference to Australia being full if convicts yet has a Medieval period setting, hundreds of years before Autralia's convict influx. Did nobody vet the script? Where's the alleged humour? Please give me a funny line that I may have missed. This is woefully amateurish stuff."
truemythmedia,"Jun 27, 2019",10/10,"I honestly have nothing bad to say about this film. It's one of the few movies that I could throw on at any time and be happy. Though the film is just now thirty years old, I wouldn't be surprised if it goes down in history as one of the most beloved films from the 20th century. It's funny, exhilarating, romantic, and endlessly entertaining. I'd be hard pressed to find a film better suited for an entire family.

acedj,"May 5, 2020",9/10,"Here we have what is perhaps the perfect family film. It is the story of pirates, giants, killer eels, wars, fencing, revenge and true love. This movie is an absolute masterpiece, with characters and story telling that are both nearly infallible. Every time I watch this, I return to my childhood and the fond memories of watching this in awe. I have shared this with all of my kids, and they too love this movie, because how can one not?"
snoozejonc,"Mar 13, 2023",9/10,"A grandfather reads a fantasy story to his grandson.This is a strong comedy adventure with great humour and performances.One of the major strengths of 'The Princess Bride' is its potential to be enjoyed by everyone in the household. Younger children may not get all the humour but should love the story and parents should enjoy the tongue in cheek writing and banter.This strength comes in the writing and performances of various characters. Everyone looks and acts the part, from the swashbuckling heroes, to sneering villains, and unusual characters, well placed in a fantasy movie. Robin Wright is perfectly cast in the title role and also functions nicely as a straight-man to the humour. Billy Crystal and Carol Kane also stand out in a hilarious cameo.The humour quite absurd and self deprecating. I love how it keeps a generally serious tone as certain characters spout dialogue that makes fun of the genre.Visually it works very well, particularly the location shots in various well-chosen landscapes in the Britain and Ireland. There is also some good practical effects used to bring certain creatures to life.Peter Falk and Fred Savage are very entertaining in the narrator and audience roles. These scenes add another level to the humour and make the story quite distinctive from other stories within the genre."
nat7no,"Apr 13, 2025",9/10,"The Princess Bride is one of those rare cinematic gems that manages to be many things at once-a fairy tale, a parody, an adventure, a love story, and a comedy-without ever losing its sense of identity. It's as if the filmmakers tossed a dozen genres into a blender, added a generous dash of wit, and served up something entirely unique and oddly perfect. I found it undeniably quirky, but in the most delightful, endearing way possible.At its heart, the story is simple: a grandfather reads a fairytale to his sick grandson, and the narrative unfolds into the swashbuckling tale of Westley, a farm boy turned Dread Pirate Roberts, who must rescue his beloved Buttercup from the clutches of the evil Prince Humperdinck. But simplicity is deceiving-this film is anything but ordinary. Every character feels like a punchline with a backstory, and every line of dialogue dances on the edge of satire and sincerity.Cary Elwes as Westley perfectly embodies the charming, heroic archetype-but he does it with a wink. His dry delivery and confident swagger sell every line, from the now-iconic ""As you wish"" to the endlessly quotable ""Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something."" Robin Wright's Buttercup is more than a damsel; she's sharp and self-aware, even when placed in absurdly fairy tale-like circumstances. Together, they have a chemistry that's sweet and timeless, grounding the film's more fantastical elements in real emotion.But it's the supporting cast that elevates The Princess Bride from memorable to legendary. Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya delivers one of the most heartfelt performances in comedic cinema. His famous revenge monologue-""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.""-manages to be both hilarious and deeply moving. Andre the Giant as Fezzik adds warmth and innocence to a physically intimidating role, while Wallace Shawn's Vizzini is a chaotic whirlwind of ego and overconfidence. (""Inconceivable!"")Director Rob Reiner strikes a miraculous tone that balances parody with genuine homage. The film pokes fun at the tropes of fantasy and romance, but never ridicules them. Instead, it celebrates the storytelling tradition in all its melodramatic, swashbuckling glory. William Goldman's script-based on his own novel-is whip-smart and packed with jokes that land as hard now as they did in 1987. It's a film that knows it's being watched, yet never breaks the illusion. The framing device of the grandfather (Peter Falk) and grandson (Fred Savage) brings in a modern voice that cleverly comments on the absurdity, while also emphasizing the timeless joy of hearing a great story.Visually, the film is charmingly old-school. The sets are clearly handmade, the effects practical, and the fight choreography theatrical-but all of that works in its favor. It feels like the kind of tale you'd imagine as a child: exaggerated, magical, and a little rough around the edges. Mark Knopfler's score, too, is understated and whimsical, adding an extra layer of personality to the whole experience.If you haven't seen The Princess Bride, you're missing out on one of the most uniquely enjoyable films ever made. It's quirky, heartfelt, endlessly quotable, and layered enough to entertain kids and adults alike. Whether you're in it for the sword fights, the love story, the clever dialogue, or just a bit of feel-good nostalgia, there's truly something here for everyone. It's not just a movie-it's a cult classic that deserves every bit of its reputation.10/10 - As you wish."
SilentJerry,"Sep 28, 2002",N/A,"But it's pretty close on my scale.In general, this movie has overrated syndrome. A Christmas Story has the same disease. I first saw this movie during my Junior year in high school at the end of a semester long class and we had nothing else to do for 2 or 3 days. I was horribly bored by the whole thing. Found it to be overly cheesy and I guess it just tries to hard. After the class was over with, I put the movie in the back of my mind as one to never watch again. That was 1997.So I hadn't watched it until a few days ago when my roommate took it out of the DVD selection as something to watch. So I watched it again, well, some of it. At one point I got up and went to my room. I have better things to do with my time. It's attempt to be witty and fun just came off as horribly staged to me. It was a just another cheesy Hollywood piece of junk. Someone mentioned on here that this was the Shrek of the 80's. I disagree, Shrek was much more fun than this dull thing."
kbuckley,"Sep 27, 2009",9/10,"I realise that I must have been in my early twenties when I first saw this film, and I will still stop and eat up every line, as I hit 40. A gem. For every film I see that wishes to be a romantic comedy, or swords and swashbuckling, or just plain funny, I wish they could take a look at this one, which manages to combine the three, without effort, it seems.Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are both gorgeous and dead-pan, Mandy Patinkin is a hero of the best kind; ""You killed my father, prepare to die"" is a theme and a catch-phrase solely down to his presence. Every actor was the best I've ever seen them, which says much about the director. Drop.Your.Sword. And enjoy."
hunter-friesen,"Oct 22, 2017",6/10,"The Princess Bride is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary this year and is still considered a timeless classic. Its mix of fairy tale adventure and comedy makes it a perfect film that both kids and adults can enjoy. However, all that nostalgic glitter can't hide a mix of subpar acting, characters, and directing choices.The characters of The Princess Bride are the usual fairy tale characters you grew up on as a kid. There's the swashbuckling hero Westley and his damsel in distress Buttercup (still one of the worst character names in film), a gallery of rogues, and the dastardly king. We are immediately attached to these characters because of their specific traits that help them stand out. However, each character only has one trait that they exhibit, making them very one dimensional and predictable.The plot of the film is just as familiar as the characters. It's predictable, which isn't a bad thing here since we're all accustomed to classic fairy tales about true love. Buttercup and Westley fall in love, but Westley must go away to work. He is soon presumed dead and Buttercup goes into a deep depression. The king takes an interest in her and makes her his queen even though there is no love between them. Soon she is kidnapped by rogues in a plot to plunge two rival kingdoms into war.The one thing that stands out in this film from others is that it takes place entirely inside of the book The Princess Bride (the same one the film is based on). In the real world, a young boy is sick in bed and his grandfather comes over to read him the story. He immediately exclaims his dislike of fairy tales, but his attitude slowly changes as the story continues. We as the audience are like the kid, immediately pessimistic about another fairytale movie, but then come around to appreciate the film for its charm and wit.It's not hard to tell that the theme of here is that true love will conquer all. It's heavily present and is the only thing that keeps the story going, but what else do you expect from a fantasy film with an evil king who has taken someone's love hostage.I feel that both parents and kids can enjoy this film, especially parents today that grew up watching it as a child. There are a few jokes that are purely aimed at adults that will go over kids heads, but most are family friendly and offer some genuine laughs.Director Rob Reiner makes a fantasy film that ages well compared to other films in the same genre and timeframe. The jokes are still pretty fresh thirty years later and the practical effects aren't embarrassing. While Reiner perfected the preservation of this film, he did not effectively create a story free of plot holes. Some events in the film happen with little to no explanation and some details are glossed over for the sake of keeping the plot going. I'm starting to think I am nitpicking since this is lighthearted family movie, but it's hard to not pay attention to such prominent issues.The acting throughout the film is either hit or miss. Cary Elwes as Westley is a highlight as he uses his natural charisma and good looks to create a dashing hero for the audience to root for. Robin Wright as Buttercup is the exact opposite of Elwes. She doesn't make a very good character and becomes a burden to watch. While Westley is the main character, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya is the clear fan favorite as he strives to get revenge on the man who killed his father. His famous line ""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" is said close to ten times, but gets better each time he gets closer to completing his mission. André the Giant shines as the gentle giant (practically portraying himself in real life). Wallace Shawn is also good as the annoying ""Inconceivable!"" guy but can be over the top and too annoying by the end of his screen time.The Princess Bride is a family film that will live on for generations as parents pass it down to their kids. Even though flaws are present, not many films have this great a legacy and can deliver on the overplayed fairytale genre."

eronavbj,"Dec 13, 2004",5/10,"OK, the movie is cute, with some clever lines, but, among the top 120 movies of all time? Please... you haven't seen enough movies! I personally got a little bored with all the witty diatribe, sort of the way I felt after watching three episodes of Moonlighting with Bruce Willis's eternal cuteness. Too much of anything is not very good. This is a good movie with which to pass a pleasant rainy afternoon or even to watch with a first date, but it only masquerades as a classic and only then with the teen (or thereabouts) set. I liked the Inigo character, and Andre even did an acceptable job as an actor. But I felt no compassion for Robin Wright as the bride. And isn't that what the whole story was about?"
Thunderbuck,"Dec 10, 2011",10/10,"In '86 I was lucky to find an old paperback copy of William Goldman's ""The Princess Bride"" at a yard sale. I had already read some of his novels, and while I hadn't heard of this particular one, I quickly consumed it, enjoying it tremendously. It was a very clever, but ultimately affectionate, parody of fairy-tale conventions with an equally clever and complicated narrative. It was a fun, memorable book, and when I heard not long after about a film adaptation, I wondered how much of the book's clever tone would translate to the screen.Quite a bit, as it turned out. Rob Reiner's movie version is an outstanding movie, and one that I was pleased to see holds up incredibly well, even a quarter-century later.The brilliance to this movie is in its tone. As I said, it's a parody of fairy-tale conventions. Goldman's characters start out as cardboard-cutout stereotypes, and the events of the story itself are outlandishly improbable (up to and including resurrection), but even as the story gently mocks those conventions, it ultimately still depends on them in the end.The characters are marvelous. Vizzini and his outbursts of ""Inconceivable!!"", kind-hearted Fezzik with his rhyming, and Inigo Montoya, with his graciousness, honor, and drive for revenge. Carey Elwes' Wesley is a great balance of clever humor and chivalry, and Robin Wright's Buttercup is a smart, strong fairytale princess. All the performances are note-perfect.And the script is brilliant (as well it should be, with Goldman adapting his own novel). The dialogue sparkles, with enough memorable lines to fill a book. We get to love these characters, and care what happens to them (when Inigo finally gets the chance to avenge his father's death, it's surprisingly dramatic and emotional).The story in the film is simpler than that of the book. Among other things, the book goes WAY further into Vizzini's, Fezzik's, and Inigo's backstories, and it's absolutely a worthwhile read, but there was no way it could have all been translated to the screen. As I say, it's an unusually good adaptation.I enjoyed it even more than I did on its original release. That's an easy definition of ""classic""."

The Princess Bride is an epic story full of brilliantly conceived characters.I saw this movie after I found out it was an INFP movie, and yes, it definitely was. The fantastical aspects really dominate this extraordinary movie. I really liked that it is a story told by a grandfather to his little grandson. The story is cleverly written and has a different kind of humor. Each of the characters has their own unique style and they pursue their goals. The locations remind me of Star Wars. The costumes and scenery are beautiful for the time. You can find friendship, epic battles and love in this wonderful movie."
carmelolia,"Apr 1, 2025",10/10,"Truth be told, when I had first watched 'The Princess Bride' when I was a young boy in the early 2000s, I was not as impressed with it as I am now. This is because I started to appreciate the charm and beauty of this film more and more over time, something which more modern fantasy films lack for all their special effects and CGI, some of which are totally unconvincing.'The Princess Bride' was one of the best fantasy films before the new Millennium and it still is as impressive and as charming to this day. However, even if the special effects and production values of more recent fantasy films have surpassed those of 'The Princess Bride', few have managed to match its charm."
palaste,"Apr 26, 2003",N/A,"I have only seen a part of this film, up to the part where Inigo Montoya and Fezzik revive the Man In Black and team up with him. But it is enough to form some kind of opinion about it.I fail to see what is so great about this film. Why has it achieved such a cult status in the USA? In my opinion, this film is just an enjoyable comical fantasy, nothing more. There aren't any particularly innovative characters, scenes or jokes. The plot is interesting enough, and some of the scenes (such as the sword fight between Inigo Montoya and the Man In Black, or the torture scene with the machine) are particularly amusing, but I still don't think they are enough to make this film such a huge classic.This film reminds me a great deal of Monty Python's ""Holy Grail"". Now THAT is a classic film worthy of a cult status. Sure, there are funny characters, scenes and jokes in this movie too, but in ""Holy Grail"", they are much, much funnier."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Jun 21, 2018",6/10,"'The Princess Bride (1987)' revolves around a bizarre framing device that does little other than lessen the impact of the main narrative's events, since it is clear they are only part of a story and 'never really happened' even within the wider fictional product. The movie's overall tone isn't as solid as you might expect, either, bouncing from slightly satirical to straight-up silly quite clumsily and often to distracting effect. Still, there's some fun to be had and the breezy pace pushes past some of the more contrived aspects, which are also covered by the picture's knowingly tongue-in-cheek outlook, so that the most entertaining of scenes, including a pretty fantastic - if slightly 'dinner-show' - swashbuckling sword fight, and chuckle-worthy of moments can be enjoyed without too much hesitation. 6/10"
KUAlum26,"May 8, 2005",10/10,"This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time! THe thing is,I saw this in the theater almost eighteen years ago and at the time,while I enjoyed it a lot,I didn't realize what kind of special movie it was until I'd watch it again years later.To me,what marks this film as special is the fact that it dares to make the simple method of storytelling as the crux to the film. Even though the movie is,on face value,a tale of the love between Princes Butercup(Robin Wright,now Penn)and her servant boy Westley(Cary Elwes,whose career since seems to be underusing his talents),it's also many things:a caper,a comedy,a uniquely created characters,a drama,a morality tale and a love story that isn't as clichéd as it might appear. It's unapologetically anachronistic and yet still seemingly true to the sword-and-sorcerer fairy tale genre.It's also the underlying tale of the ability for the bond between a grandfather(the always solid Peter Falk) and grandson(Fred Savage,pre-""Wonder Years"")to supercede a contemporary kid's need for all the comforts and instant gratification kids tend to expect anymore.BAsically,this is a well crafted weaving of two stories to fit one movie. Very strong supporting roles from Billy Crystal,Andre the Giant,Mandy Patinkin,Christopher Guest,CArol Kane,Wallace Shawn and Chris Sarandon also flesh this story out effectively.It makes me sad that Rob Reiner doesn't seem to think he needs to direct anything even remotely like this film anymore.Mark KNopfler's score is absolutely beautiful,too.I could try to say more to tell you why I think this is such a great film,but you'll just have to see this yourself to get the idea."
LW-08854,"Dec 27, 2023",6/10,"A Strange film, it's a kind of medieval fantasy but not remotely realistic or believable nor trying to be. It's American and strangely modern. Some of the comedic performances are quite good and like we've seen some of the films that have come out in the past are ripe for satire. The film is shot quite naturally with clear bold colours and the outdoor scenes look good, I don't know where it was shot but I do gather that a lot of it was filmed in England. The film might annoy some people but I think it was quite good, especially as a kids movie, but nothing more really. In some ways the film anticipates Sherk which came a bit later on."
ben-snooker,"Jul 25, 2020",6/10,There's a couple of amusing one liners. I drifted between being interested and bored while watching this. The story isn't bad but not great. It's a fairly simple story and the film only goes for 1.5 hours so not too long to really lose interest. If it was any longer I might have turned it off. This films feels like a Mel Brooks film such as Spaceballs. It's kind of a spoof fantasy film. It would have been better with some better music and if it was a bit more realistic. The fights were a bit boring and not very dramatic. The female lead was pretty one dimensional. Andre the giant is very hard to understand and I had to turn on subtitles. Billy crystal was a nice surprise.
lecajun,"Nov 30, 2019",2/10,"My girlfriend got me to watch this film for the first time. And I can honestly say I do not get why people consider it one of the best ever made.The acting was good, I will give it that. But the script was horrendous. It's obviously written by soneone who had little to no experience in writing a screenplay. Pacing was mediocre at best. With times where the story just seems to stop completely for pointless dialogue filled scenes.As a fellow actor, I have the utmost respect for Cary Elwss and Mandy Patankin and their work. But i think there are a dozen over films in this genre that are a whole lot better than this mess."
Melvin-4,"Mar 25, 1999",9/10,"The fantasy genre is poorly represented, but Princess Bride makes up for a lot of it.

Spleen,"Jul 27, 1999",9/10,"A dazzling tale of a princess, a peasant, swordplay, revenge, good and evil - so why does William Goldman feel it needs a frame story?  The frame story he uses in the novel is intrusive and, to be frank, pungently offensive; here he uses the more conventional device of having an old man tell the story to his grandson, which may be hackneyed but is nonetheless a distinct improvement.  At any rate it helps me understand why the frame story is there.  It's Goldman's way of announcing that he has a real corker of a story to tell - a story so superb that it's simply impossible not to be enthralled by it.  Goldman is daring us to find fault.  `My main story is SO GOOD,' he says, `that I can afford to encumber it with this irritating framing device, and it will STILL make your heart pound.  I can dare you to be indifferent and you'll STILL care.'And he's right.So are you ready for it?  Can you handle what Goldman is presenting as the Ultimate Story?  Then proceed - and I'd advise you to proceed with the film, rather than the book."

I wish I didn't. I managed to put up with it for a little over an hour, and now I want that hour of my life that I wasted on it BACK! Even if one is willing to excuse the awful, cheap props, costumes and special effects due to the movie being shot in the 80s and on a small budget, nothing, absolutely NOTHING excuses to awful writing and even worse delivery. It's been toted to me as some paragon of witty, hilarious dialogue, but frankly, with one single exception (the ""In which cup is the poison"" scene) the rest was just painful to sit through. I saw nothing particularly funny or witty about the dialogue, and even if there was some flash of brilliance here and there it was torn apart, set on fire and then stomped on by the wooden delivery of the actors. I have never seen people who lack comic timing so badly. They sounded like they were reading a phonebook, rather than delivering funny dialogue.Though it's obvious from the rest of the review, I am severely disappointed."

dee.reid,"Jun 16, 2006",10/10,"Let me say that ""The Princess Bride"" is probably the best fairy tale presented on screen since John Boorman's ""Excalibur"" (1981). Of course there's been plenty of other's I've left out, but this all just squarely my opinion. William Goldman seemed to really have a ball writing the book the film is based off, as well as the screenplay. Rob Reiner directs, much in the same league as ""Stand By Me"" the previous year, with some pretty hard laughs. But what gets me loving this picture so much is the portrayal of true love. Let me explain: I've never had a girlfriend, which allows me to relate to the main character and his experiences in a number of ways: Westley (Cary Elwes) is the ""farm boy"" for the lovely Buttercup (Robin Wright), who takes nearly every opportunity to insult him and realizes one day, out of the blue, she loves him. But Westley journeys across the ocean to collect a fortune and is attacked by pirates and presumed killed in the fray. Buttercup sinks to the lowest level of grief, and finds companionship with arrogant Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), who forces her into an unwilling marriage. But a mysterious figure known only as the Dread Pirate Roberts (could it be Westley in disguise?) appears on the scene and along with two others including the vengeance-driven Spanish fencer Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and the towering Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant), they seek to rescue Buttercup. ""The Princess Bride"" is pure fun from start to finish, and the cast (what a cast - many of whom are American - faking their best European accents) seems to be having a ball. But love is what is at the center, and that's what I find the most impressive. Every classic fairy tale has such qualities and ""The Princess Bride"" satirizes each trait and then some more. A classic, lovely story, ""The Princess Bride.""10/10"
LegendaryFang56,"Oct 8, 2022",7/10,"This film must be one of the highest-rated films of all time. At least in the top twenties or thirties, maybe a little further than that; absolute praise and love towards it everywhere. It certainly has to be one of the most beloved. Yes, you've likely guessed where I'm heading with this. I didn't love it as much as pretty much everyone did/has.Now, a big part to play was, without a doubt, the fact that I wasn't 100% paying attention to it because as I was watching it, stuff was happening in the room I was in, and my laptop sucks, so I didn't want to pause it, as it would've taken minutes to start playing again; I know, I need a new laptop. I've been using it for close to a decade, I think. And I don't use headphones/earbuds/AirPods, so I had to lower the volume to where I couldn't hear what was said.However, I watch every film three times, so not following along fully and not getting some of the humor won't be an issue with the next and final viewing. But more importantly, I know I didn't love this film as much as most people do. I know that sounds premature, as I missed some things on my first viewing, but I'm pretty sure I'll still ""feel"" the same toward it with my subsequent viewings.(This is subsequent-viewings-me chiming in: I was correct.)The primary impression I'm getting out of this film is that, somehow, it's like it has a consciousness, in a sense, although that might not be the correct word. I don't know what I just said. It seems to me that this film will be better and better with each viewing, something to always come back to (but I suppose that's more to do with the individual watching it, not the film itself), and as a bonus, it'll never get old, unlike Monty Python and the Holy Grail. My God, that film wasn't that good. And Hot Fuzz? Ugh. I'm about to throw up. British comedy, hit-or-miss, more misses instead of hits; you love to see it.On a broader scale, as this film marinates in a person's consciousness with time continuously passing, I think one's feelings and outlook toward it will improve and evolve. I can't explain it or why that came to mind. I feel that, regardless of initial feelings from first viewing it, this film will continue increasing in enjoyment. It's lighthearted and fun. It has enjoyable characters/performances, a bit of (well-choreographed) action, cheesy but witty dialogue tightly written, and comedy; it has something for everyone, all of which have a good balance and utilization.I know most of what I said may seem negative. But I was vibing quite well with the film. That is, until after the MOST iconic and best scene that has ever (been seen) scene-d, in cinema history, the fight sequence between Westley and Inigo Montoya: everything about it was peak-anything-you'll-ever-see (Can we get much higher? So high), the witty dialogue, both characters/performances, the choreography. I don't know which character the majority like more. While I like Cary Elwes and the deadpan line delivery, including the emotionless/blank or smug facial expressions that he does so well, Inigo's my man. My King.After that, I felt like the film declined a bit, although the end catches you by surprise with the feels, making it seem like, maybe, everything after that fight sequence didn't dip or as much as you thought or that the fight sequence was so good that everything else paled in comparison. And that end-credits song? Man, that was the final nail in the coffin. It had a similar effect as the end-credits song in Robin Hood: Men in Tights.All-in-all, plenty of goofiness and silliness is present in this film, which adds to a particular not-quite-explainable charm; that much is undeniable. It has ""everything"" and more. This film is undoubtedly a classic, especially regarding every component. I doubt there are many films (or TV shows) like that. I think once it's in your consciousness, it's likely to improve in your eyes whenever you inevitably view it again and again and again. That's to say: it's, more or less, a ""perfect"" film.Even if you didn't like it as much as most people did on your first viewing, or if you may have disliked it, you signed yourself up for a continuously evolving experience by entering this film into your consciousness. As a result, your negative feelings may eventually become the opposite, or your already positive feelings will exponentially become more positive.Additional thoughts: Robin Wright was hot as hell in this film, but dare I say, she's even hotter now, like Antiope in the Wonder Woman films, which is astronomically hot; you love to see it. And Peter Cook, as the Impressive Clergyman, looked alarmingly like Sun Wukong."

Vartiainen,"Jun 11, 2013",9/10,"One of the most well-known and respected fantasy films and for a good reason. The Princess Bride is a genre-defining film that has endured the test of time beautifully and still stands as one of the best adventure films and the one film you should see if you're interested in swashbuckler films.What I like the most about this film is its unpredictability. Sure, it's an adventure film aimed for all audiences, so the good guys are going to win and all that, but the way they go about accomplishing that task is what makes this film enjoyable. You're never sure what's going to happen next, the characters are very creative and there are a lot of them, the plot twists come right out of nowhere and the humorous tongue-in-cheek tone ties it all together. There is drama and high stages, yes, but it's still an adventure film and meant to be enjoyed with a smile on your face.The story develops rather erratically, going from one scene to another with very few tie-ins, but in this case it works, because the whole film is told more like a fairy tale than a typical story. So it's more of a preference of style than a flaw.If I were to nitpick, I'd say that the frame story involving a grandfather reading his grandson a book while he lies sick in bed is not as interesting as the actual story and sometimes the kid's interruptions in the story come at the worst possible times. This is only a nitpick, however, because the banter between these two is actually quite humorous, which keeps it from becoming an annoyance. It'd be interesting to see just how well the actual adventure would flow without the frame story, just for comparison.I like this film, I like a lot. It has a strong story, it's fun and charming without being immature, its characters are great, it has a lot of memorable dialogues and as a whole it's just bursting with imagination. One of the best adventure films I've ever seen and well worth your time, whoever you happen to be."
I_Ailurophile,"Dec 17, 2025",10/10,"If one wished to scrutinize and reach for dents in the picture's armor, one might argue that small smidgens of dialogue have, strictly speaking, not aged well, or that at select junctures a character might demonstrate poor judgment, or reflect inconsistent intelligence. After all, modern audiences are very accustomed to asking, for example, ""why is she not questioning this,"" or pointing out any indication of real-life norms and values that have shifted over time. I freely admit I've often been one such viewer. Yet it's also true, as some have suggested, that many people are too obsessed with plot and look for every conceivable fault rather than just enjoy a story as it presents. Even more to the point, I think any such concerns in this instance can be waved off with the plain recognition that the saga here is a fairy tale, a genre that declines hard-boiled world-building and intricate detail in favor of uncomplicated, earnest themes and fanciful narrative. And if someone gets so bogged down in potential flaws that they can no longer enjoy the show, then I would suggest they've missed the point.Mandy Patinkin once recalled sitting for this film with his wife after after it opened in theaters, and finding himself crying in appreciation because it's such a perfect film. He's right. It's not a thrilling tour de force, or a searing revelation, or a transcendant masterpiece. It doesn't need to be, and it doesn't try to be. It is simply perfect: a flawless, fabulously human tale of love, friendship, determination, and courage, wrapped up in a resplendent cornucopia of adventure, action, romance, and fantasy. From incredibly clever humor to dramatic notes of all variety sharp enough to pierce the heart, 'The Princess Bride' boasts tremendous intelligence, warmth, light, and heart that countless titles across all of cinema could never dream of touching. For all the great things that its contributors have done in their careers and lives, this is surely one of their finest achievements, and many years from now it will continue to stand tall as a rich, vibrant exemplar.Every line as written, and every delivery of those lines. Every small expression, every performance at large, and the casting. The immaculately detailed and gorgeous sets, the stunning art direction, and the shrewd and beautiful filming locations, and the equally immense consideration and hard work in the costume design, and in the hair and makeup. All the stunt work, all the practical effects, and the fine-tuned choreography in the action sequences. William Goldman's screenplay adapting his own novel, a joyous celebration of all the best qualities of humanity with a dynamic and raptly absorbing story, impeccably bright and colorful dialogue, smart and grabbing scene writing, and interesting, compelling characters. The marvelously deft and nuanced direction of the late great Rob Reiner, bringing every slightest iota to bear with an emotional punch that further elevates the humor, enriches the captivating drama, innervates the more suspenseful or action-oriented sequences, and renders with a truly artistic eye every sequence such that even the premier fencing scene, carefully and lovingly crafted as it is in all regards, brings tears for how much skill and passion went into it. The original music of composer Mark Knopfler, unerringly complementing every passing moment with themes that speak to both the earnestness of the narrative and the overall lighthearted, whimsical tone of the feature. All of this, among still more, embodies the pristine craftsmanship that enables 'The Princess Bride' to succeed on such a grand, enduring level - to say nothing of the heartwarming framing that adds another little layer to the viewing experience while directly feeding from and into all that the central tale is so fantastically woven around.There is never a bad time to watch such an essential classic, though it's certainly the case that with the intermittent passing of each person who had such foremost involvement, it feels all the more important to revisit it and bask once more in the empathy and life-affirming vitality that it capitalizes upon so naturally and gracefully. There are films I regard still more highly, and others that I rewatch more frequently, but I'm hard-pressed to name other films that lift my spirits so much with each viewing, or which only seem over time to get better and better. While falling on the gentler side of the storytelling spectrum it represents everything that one might want out of fiction, and out of cinema, and everyone who had a hand in its creation should be endlessly proud of what they accomplished. Whether you're watching for the first time or coming back for more, it cannot be overstated how terrific 'The Princess Bride' is, and this is an utmost treasure everyone needs to see at least once, and preferably again and again."

bob the moo,"Mar 16, 2002",N/A,"When a man visits his sick Grandson, he keeps him amused with a fairy tale. We find that the beautiful Buttercup has lost her true love and years later has agreed to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck.  She is kidnapped by three mercenaries but is later rescued by a mysterious masked man.  When she discovers the identity of the man she faces a dilemma between returning to her intended or staying with true love.  When the decision is made for her Wesley must fight (with a little help) to win her back.There is something about this film that requires you to be in the right mood to watch it.  The story is pitched as a standard fairy tale and it feels like a B-movie, if it was played straight.  Happily Reiner adds spoof and comedy to the mix that allows the fairy tale to follow the traditional routes while poking fun at itself.  The story is still nice, but really it's the knowing comedy that makes it.The comedy is generally consistent  gentle rather than cruel.  The film uses unlikely fairy tale mechanisms (like having the ideal thing to hand when needed or the idea of honour etc) with a knowing wink to the audience to let us know it's not serious.  It also uses comedy cameos by the bucket  some work well (Billy Crystal, Wallace Shaw) and some work less well (Peter Jones and Mel Smith are unused).  And the rest of it is full of absurd humour.  Most of it hits the mark  but if you're not in the mood of this type of silly affectionate humour then you'll probably dislike it.Elwes is good  he looks like a handsome B-movie actor and plays it like such, while also spoofing himself.  That's why he was so good in Hot Shots too.  A young Robin Wright does the wide-eyed damsel in distress so-so, but she doesn't get the same comedy as the others and feels a little dull. Mandy Patinkin is really good in a hammy role and has a good character. Shaw is hilarious in a small role and even Andre the Giant is good  if a little hard to understand at times.  The villains are well played by Guest and Sarandon  indeed they have the best characters as they don't play it for laughs as much as the others.Overall this is an enjoyable little film from Reiner  it doesn't have the development or the sharpness of much of his other, funnier work but as a gently affectionate spoof it works just fine if you're in the mood)."

Quinoa1984,"Jul 1, 2007",10/10,"Rob Reiner was on a streak in the mid 80s, and though it could be argued he his his peak at the start with Spinal Tap, this and Stand by Me can be considered two other important works in his decidedly since mixed career as a director. Princess Bride is as self-conscious as comedies get, but it's also a lot of fun for the whole family, and it's not just a typical aside to say so. On the contrary, as an adult now I find it funnier seeing it for the first time then I might have if I had seen it as a kid. This isn't to say that it doesn't have some special quality about it, that it's almost like a sprightly live-action cartoon. But there's a generous wink and nod behind most of the good jokes in the film, like how dialog between many of the characters point out some of the loops medieval fantasies take, in small things like climbing up a rocky cliff or in drinking a poisoned drink or going through a nasty swamp or in the convoluted mechanics of a ""Machine"", or even how to revive one from the dead with a, uh, whatever it is that's given to Cary Elwes.It's the tale as simple as can be: girl and boy fall in love, girl loses boy, girl gets engaged to bad man, girl gets kidnapped by dastardly (and inept) figures, girl gets re-captured by a man in a mask that turns out to be the boy again, boy loses girl again, boy comes back from dead, boy and girl go back together again. OK, a bit complicated, but the fun in William Goldman's script is seeing how the questioning of the archetypes goes hand-in-hand with telling a conventionally satisfying story. There's not a whole lot of dimension to most of them- certainly not to the bride- but that's part of the excitement is to see how the characters meet their fates (particularly Patikin's character, who will stop at nothing to kill the six-fingered man who killed his father, as he says about ten times while in the big climactic sword-fight). And why should there be, as the story itself is being read to a precocious child (Fred Savage) by a mustached Peter Falk.Actually, the script probably isn't even the best part, and neither is Reiner's often wonderful direction (though it helps, minus the score by Knopfler which is way too cheesy even for the material here). What makes this so watchable a comedy are the actors, who are all at the top of their games. Wallace Shawn (inconceivable!), Andre the Giant, Billy Crystal (65? can't do it for that), Patinkin, Christopher Guest in his most deadpan character yet, and Elwes and Robin Wright Penn in such straight roles, are equally enthralling and hilarious in how they dance around such good material, giving it the proper edge when needed and light touches of pure irony as well. Being more aware of what some of these character actors and stars have done now it makes for it to be hilarious, but what makes it work for kids too is that the actors never stray from being true to the goofy levels to their roles. This isn't quite Monty Python being dealt with here, but more family-friendly satire, and it's a success through and through."
utgard14,"Jun 21, 2016",10/10,"One of my favorite movies. Probably in my top five all-time favorites. Funny, quotable, with many memorable characters and one perfect scene after another. Just absolutely charming. Solid direction from Rob Reiner. Perhaps not as flashy as some would prefer but straightforward and not distracting like it probably would be if made today. William Goldman wrote the screenplay, as well as the original book. I've read the book and I recommend you go check it out after seeing the film. There are a lot of little funny bits that didn't make it to the screen. The cast is excellent, from perhaps the prettiest couple in movie history (Cary Elwes and Robin Wright) to one of the funniest supporting casts ever (including Chris Sarandon, Mandy Patinkin, Billy Crystal, Wallace Shawn, Christopher Guest, Peter Falk, Peter Cook, Carol Kane, and a wonderful turn from pro wrestling legend Andre the Giant). It's a classic for young and old alike and I can't say enough good things about it. Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles... it's got everything."
SAMTHEBESTEST,"Jul 10, 2020",6/10,"The Princess Bride (1987) :Not just your basic, ho-hum fairy tale. Childish but anyhow Funny. This film is a joke. Wait, i don't mean to disclass it, what i meant was yes this film is a Joke which will make laugh. Are you up for some slapstick jokes which will certainly bring laughters. Are you ready to keep your brain and critic mind aside for 98 Minutes? If yes then welcome to the fantasy world of 'The Princess Bride'. It's a film about a farmboy-turned-pirate who encounters numerous obstacles, enemies and allies in his quest to be reunited with his true love who is gonna marry a prince. You know it's predictable and quite normal thing to see but guess what? The narrator himself says so. He says something which you already know is not gonna happen and which you already know is gonna happen. Call it predictable but this humour in narration is a different thing altogether. I have problem with some inconceivable errors in the writing and i am not gonna show any mercy for those faults in my final rating. I have expectations of high quality product when i am watching a film from the list of IMDb Top Rated 250 Films and then if such errors are gonna cross my way, i am not gonna spare the users. I mean this doesn't deserved to be here. Anyways, the writing sparkles despite dead conflicts and mostly because of satirical humour. Acting by Cary Elwes, Mandy Patikin was impressive whereas Robin Wright looked gorgeous. Supporting cast was okay. Rob Reiner is a good director, I recently watched 'Stand By Me' which was a dignified Classic therefore it took me a few moments to believe that he has made this childish film. I mean i expected some matured stuff from him and The Princess Bride wasn't anywhere close. Overall, this is Fun with childish Flavor but Fun after all so, you might enjoy it.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest"
Bigideas_Baggins,"Jul 27, 2022",2/10,"Now, I know boring is a subjective term to describe a movie, but here it's almost not. Why? Because the pacing is so slow that I cannot understand how one would not get bored. Without much connection, we move from scene to scene, which all seem to be thought up around one single ""joke"" or supposedly funny setting, but had to be dragged out gor a few minutes to pad the movie's running time. As noted in other reviews, nostalgia must be at work here to produce high ratings, because watching it for my first time in my forties, I just cannot understand it, and no, I will not honor the movie by using that one word to describe it.I tracked down this movie because it was supposed to be similar to Stardust (2007), a movie I like a lot; whilst it certainly has flaws, it actually executes the ""fantasy comedy"" genre quite well. This movie, as far as I am concerned, is far less funny (I kept waiting for the first joke to happen) and is to clunky and cheaply made (even for the time) to work as a fantasy. Another trigger to watch it were the Inigo Montoya lines which I had seen quoted every now and then. Well, that character was indeed the best part in the movie, but far from able to save it.My suggestion then - if you watched this movie when you were young, leave the memory be and don't watch it again, if you are tempted to watch the movie now (as an adult), just don't, because there is really nothing here."

nikldbh,"Oct 8, 2023",10/10,"The writing. The story. The casting. One of the best movies of all time. No movie is as quotable. The cinematography is fantastic and the music is perfect. Every actor was perfectly cast and their acting amazing.And many stories from the cast about times during filming are hilarious. Like Cary Elwes talking about Andre riding around on his 3 wheeler - ""Hey boss. You like my toy? You want to ride it? You know you waaaant to!""Or talking about casting Princess Buttercup
""I will never forget this for as long as I live,"" Jenkins said. ""The doorbell rang. Rob went to the door, and literally, as he opened the door, Wright was standing there in this little white summer dress, with her long blonde hair, and she had a halo from the sun. She was backlit by God. And Bill Goldman looked across the room at her, and he said, 'Well, that's what I wrote.' It was the most perfect thing."""

Aaron1375,"Jul 20, 2003",8/10,"This movie has a grandfather reading to his grandson, and we get to see the story he is reading unfold before our eyes.  Rather good movie that entertains in so many ways.  The cast is excellent, even Andre the Giant is very good in this one.  Turns out he is the only wrestler that can act.  The story is fast moving and has some nice twists and surprises along the way, they surprised me the first time I saw this one (I won't give anything away though).  What made this film good for me though was that it contained quite a lot of humor and it really worked well.  I loved Cary Elwes delivery and Patinkin was also very good in his role too.  Billy Crystal and Carol Kane also make memorable appearances in this one.  Though one of my favorite scenes has to be when Cary's character has a battle of wits with the one guy.  One of the funnier scenes I found in this one.  There are also nice set designs like in the fire swamp.  The periodic interruptions also work, as they never let you forget that it is a simple story being read by a grandfather.  Good movie all around and fun to watch."
eklavya-cwk,"Jun 25, 2014",7/10,"Right from the beginning the movie is captive. The kid and his grandfather both are cute and the firm base of the story. Each and everything is non-sense but it is a children-story and hence it must be the way it is.Characters were good and enjoyable, love story was cute as we wish and set design was apt. The best point in the movie is that it doesn't work too much to make it look realistic and the usual-ness present in the princess bride made it appreciable. The movie is must watch for anyone who wants some entertainment. But among all, the best thing the director did is to take out appropriate acting out of the kid who is listening to the story. It is sweet cute and fresh movie with few could have done better but ignoring them, its fun."

ShmooBoo,"Nov 27, 2001",10/10,"The Princess Bride is one of the most brilliant romantic comedies of all time. It is carefully constructed to fill so many film genres, including: romance, fairy tale, satire, comedy, and adventure. This film features an all star cast, who collaborated on every aspect of the film. The actors brought so much to their characters, creating well rounded personalities from even the most grotesque caricatures.The tale is based on a satirical novel by William Goldman. The film begins with a grandfather reading the story to his sick grandson, and as Goldman said: the grandfather is only retelling the ""good parts"" of the supposed historical tale. If you haven't read the book, but love the movie, I seriously recommend you sit down to read as soon as possible.This film is perfect for all people who enjoy a good laugh, and an even better romance. I have been watching The Princess Bride since I was 6 years old, and every time I watch it I learn something new about the story, the characters, or even the technical aspects involved. It is truly a story that will stand the test of time."

vithiet,"Nov 20, 2024",4/10,"I hate to diss a beloved classic and I'm probably going to get hate for it but I really don't get it. I've never seen it as a kid so nostalgia is not helping. Since this is such a classic among my fellow nerds, highly praised and often quoted I thought it was time I watched it. But honestly I was bored halfway through and almost stopped right there and then. I could see the youngest kids maybe liking it (I could see not liking it when I was a kid, the same way I never really liked The Goonies). But a lot of kid movies these days have enough to keep adults interested as well. This just feels old, campy without the charm, clumsy, not really funny, and overall just ridiculous."

Klaatu-18,"Apr 18, 2003",10/10,"I read ""The Princess Bride"" for the first time when the paperback first came out. By the time the movie version was due to come out I read it again. I no longer had my old copy, so I bought a new one (The cover had been attached upside down, which I thought was cool).There are very few books that I have read twice, let alone bought twice. I loved this book. It's a great fantasy love story, told with style and wit. And, like all great fantasies, the characters are bigger than life -- and sometimes, just a bit corny.It's just enjoyable, first to last. Part romance, part adventure, part revenge story (""My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die"") and all fun."
thomas_asbaek,"Aug 9, 2005",10/10,"sorry for my clumsy English, but here it goes.this is perfect. it was a great inspiration back in the 1987. in the name of true love, we could invade ""girls only"" slumber parties, with nothing but a dagger of the mind and a quick quote: as you wish, this is true love..., (or if going for dramatic sympathy) hallo, my name is... Those were the good old days.Now you have to pay drinks and play straight just to get attention. But no matter how bummed you feel about adulthood (or any other hood for that matter), The Princess Bride will still take you back... or move you on. depending on if you are in or out of love.do you thing this happens every day?"

It makes you feel good from head to toe once viewed.The casting and acting is spot on.  Nobody was ever going to win an oscar, but the acting is camp enough with out going to far.  The humour runs all the way through the film to make this a real belter of a film.We can even forgive the director for book-ending the film with Peter Falk reading the story of the ""Princess Bride"" to his sick Grandson.If you are looking for a film for the kids, forget Toy Story or Pokemon the movie.  This IS the ultimate film for Kids from 5 to 95......"
itspatagain,"Mar 5, 2006",10/10,"This one could easily become your all-time favorite movie. A film certain to lift your spirits and make you smile, if not outright laugh out loud. Not 'into the kissing stuff'? Neither is the ailing youngster (Fred Savage) who is being read this story by his grandfather (Peter Falk). However, you are certain to be captivated and charmed by the love story that causes exciting adventure after adventure. The casting and acting are perfection personified, with more stars than a summer sky, and with tongue in cheek wit twined throughout, this is a movie you can recommend to young, old and all in between. Very likely the best sword fight ever filmed is in this picture, one you are sure to mesmerized by time after time. Want a movie to just simply enjoy? This is the one!"
briancham1994,"Apr 3, 2021",7/10,"This film reminds me of the improvised stories and games that we used to play out during school drama class. It's silly, we knew it, and we just rolled with it. The fantasy/fairytale setting is a malleable backdrop used for playful pastiche rather than any kind of satirical critique. The characters all have very distinct personalities and motivations, bolstered by repetitive jokes and catchphrases. The plot (if you can call it that) is full of memorable and witty moments fuelled by rather exaggerated character emotions. My main gripe is the modern framing story which serves only as a distraction and an excuse to skip over parts of the plot without using traditional transitions."
Mr. Pulse,"May 6, 2000",7/10,"""The Princess Bride"" is a well-written and acted genre picture. Unfortunately, it's hampered by some significant production problems that keep it from becoming a truly great movie.  Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable flick, but I had some small problems that really could have been fixed.First off, the princess' name is Buttercup.  Who names their daughter Buttercup?  I kept thinking they were talking about a horse when they mention her name.  I suppose that if the other names were as bizarre it might have worked, but her love is named Wesley.  Wesley and Buttercup?  I don't think so.Second, the wonderful fight scene between Inigo and Wesley is done on a very cheap looking set, complete with fake boulders, gym mats and parallel bars. Almost every other scene is done outside in gorgeous fields, or in far more believable sets.  The most exciting scene in the film is on the ugliest set. Very distracting.Third, the music for this movie is absolutely dreadful.  Loud, obnoxious, full of fake synthesized instruments instead of the real thing, it sounds more fitting for a ""Naked Gun"" retread of the Princess Bride than the actual film itself.  A new score would help the film immensley.I know I sound negative, but this is really only disappointment speaking. The film is charming, filled with wonderful dialogue, delivered with flair by stars Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin.  I recommend it, but I can't help think this movie could have been perfect.  Oh well, close but not quite the whole cigar."
schmimic,"Apr 23, 2005",10/10,"Starring: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant I felt it would be wrong to make a hobby of writing movie reviews if I didn't start with my favorite movie of all time.So, the movie was made in the late 80s. The reason I mention this is because if you haven't seen it, prepare for a smattering of cheesy acting and low budget glory. However, this does not detract from the overall appeal of the film. If anything, it adds. For the 80s, this is an exceptional movie. For any time period, this is an exceptional movie.It all takes place in the imaginary kingdom of Florin, ruled by the charismatic and devious Prince Humperdink (imagine what elementary school was like for THAT guy). Technically, he is not yet the king, but in the same way that Cardinal Richeleau ruled France in The Three Muskateers, so does Prince Humperdink rule Florin.The heart of the movie opens on a small farm, where Buttercup, allegedly the most beautiful girl in the kingdom, is living her life. She commands Westley, the farm boy, around for pleasure. Eventually she realizes that Westley loves her, sparks fly, and we are hit with one of the movie's most infamous lines: ""Hold it, hold it! Grandpa, what is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports? (pause) Is this a kissing book?"" Westley has no money for marriage, so he sets out in seek of fame and fortune. In a matter of weeks, news comes back to Buttercup that Westley has been murdered by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Five years later the Prince decides that he is going to take Buttercup as his wife, and the movie sets into action. A mysterious Man in Black (like we don't know who it is) comes to get Buttercup, and faces impossible odds to get her, fighting master swordsmen, giants, and of course, Vizzini, in the classic Battle of Wits.The movie is a fairy tale, and as such, we know right from the beginning it is going to have a cheesy happy ending. Does that really matter? Of course not. First off, it's just entertainment. Second, the point of the movie is that true love conquers all. A nice little romanticized thought, even if evidence of this fact often fails to be seen in the real world.For the most part, the acting is solid. Cary Elwes does a knockout job as Westley, Robin Wright as the naïve but charming Princess Buttercup, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, the master swordsman seeking revenge for his father, Andre the Giant as Vizzini, the big hearted yet small brained giant, Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, the criminal mastermind with a large IQ and yet no real intelligence, Billy Crystal in a strange turn as Miracle Max, and Peter Falk as the grandfather telling the story to his sick grandson. The acting is not flawless, but for the type of movie that this is, it is spot on.This is the must see movie of the century. It has action, romance, comedy, adventure, and suspense. If you haven't seen it, you must.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (a must see)"
jeb-10,"Apr 2, 1999",10/10,"I've seen a lot of movies in my day and this one still ranks at the top of my list, even after a decade.  I am ashamed to admit that I did not see this ""sleeper"" hit at the theater.  It was not until my father rented it and forced me to watch this ""kid's"" movie that I was able to appreciate this movie.  I have now seen it so many times that I can practically recite the entire movie verbatim! Yes, this is a silly movie, a tongue-in-cheek theme is rampant throughout the film, but it's smart and dare I say, ""sassy.""  All of the characters are wonderful, even though some are a bit more tame in the movie than in the book (by that I mainly refer to Humperdink who was much more straightlaced and militant in the book than in the movie where he was portrayed as more of a bumbling idiot!).  Princess Bride pokes fun at traditional romantic movies by exploiting the melodramatic child in all of us.  All in all, this movie has a little bit of something for everyone: ""fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles.""  This is a must see for all ages!"

It's a staple in our family that I'm joyously sharing with my children now; although they're too young to appreciate it, they're not too young to be entertained by it. If you love adventure, drama, comedy, romance, or storytelling, this is a movie you should see at least twice before you die. Fencing, fighting, escapes, revenge, torture, true love...

GWMJedi,"Jul 22, 2000",9/10,"Just got the new DVD version this week, and watched it... memories of college years, watching it over and over on VHS, came flooding back... What to say about this film... no, the acting isn't the best; no, the special effects aren't from George Lucas; no, it's not a perfect film... but, there is *something* about this film... it takes your run-of-the-mill archetypal fairy tale structure, turns it sideways in a really fun way, and manages to capture the heart and haunt you.Sure, the story is simplistic, but this film truly does get more powerful with repeated viewings. Recommendation: watch it a few times, then go away from it for a while. When you come back to it, it'll get you in the heart even more strongly. Or at least, it did to me... friends of mine from college even used the closing theme, ""Storybook Love"", as their first dance on their wedding day.One final word about Cary Elwes... the boy is quite the looker...

no-skyline,"Jul 20, 2005",9/10,"Superb, sublime, imaginative family entertainment from Rob Reiner. Tongue in cheek fairy tale/adventure that hits the ground running with a breathless first 25mins of fantastic set pieces that includes one of the best sword fights in cinema as well as some great characters. Vezzini, Fezzick and Inigo are characters that stayed with me all through my childhood but until a recent watching of this film I hadn't realised just how good this was for adults & children. It hasn't dated at all in the intervening years and compares well with modern fantasy films mainly due to a tone that wouldn't benefit from expensive CG.All the cast are memorable, Chris Sarandon as the pompous prince and Christopher Guest's Basil Rathbone style duke are great villains but Wallace Shawn as Vezzini steals best baddie honours. For the good guys Cary Elewes is superb as the Errol Flynn style hero swashbuckling and joking his way through duels, torture, chases and more with support from Innigo (the always superb Mandy Patinken) with Andre the Giant the ideal person to play Fezzick the good natured giant. Memorable cameos include Peter Cooke, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane and Mel Smith. As the Princess of the title Robin Wright really fits the bill looking like she just stepped out of the pages of a fairy tale but never letting her performance slip into the sappy, mushiness it could have become.It's magic spell never loses grip through chases, romance, duels and brawls its a treat my one complaint I wish it was longer so there was even more to enjoy. 9/10"
Thanos_Alfie,"Feb 24, 2015",7/10,"""The Princess Bride"" is a family movie in which we watch a grandfather reading a story to his grandson. And we are transfered from the words of the grandfather inside the story and we watch a story which combines romance and love with fights and much of adventure.First of all I have to admit that I did not expect to like so much this movie. I liked this movie because it was a nice surprise for me and also because of the nice direction which made by Rob Reiner. The most important thing that I liked in this movie was the whole story which showed us that true love always finds the way to win and from whatever happen to it, it will always win. This movie also shows us what is the definition or even better the meaning of true love and what a man and a woman who are in love have to do in order to be together. I also believe that the interpretation of Cary Elwes who played as Westley has to be mentioned because it was really good and equally good was the interpretation of the beautiful Robin Wright who played as The Princess Bride.Lastly I have to say that ""The Princess Bride"" is not just a nice fairy tail as my title says but is something bigger and better. This movie shows us what difficulties has true love to surpass in order to win and finally to have a happy ending. One other thing that I really loved in this movie was the combination of some comedy moments with some romance moments. ""The Princess Bride"" is a family movie and I strongly recommend it because I am sure that if you watch it you will have a great time."

I know movies seldom deserve a rating of 10, and that if i were to pick this movie apart as i do with others i'd find a reason to rate it otherwise, but i just can't. This movie is perfect to me. I think it's the same uncanny feeling of enchantment i experienced the first time i saw it (as is the story with most people) that keeps me loving it with every new viewing. I have most definitely seen the Princess Bride more than any other movie (and it even came out a year before i was born..) and yet still i can sit down and simply marvel at it, as i did less than an hour ago. The sword fight remains my favourite choreography in any movie (challenged only by the duel between Hector and Achilles in Troy) and i will always love the witty dialogue. And of course, love is blind, so i can even forgive the corny fanfare whenever you see the man in black. Some of the lines are so beautiful they still astound me. Buttercup is so pure and Westley is so beautiful. The movie was perfectly cast.I recently read the Author's note in the novel by William Goldman, where he talks about getting the movie organized. I highly recommend reading it to any fan, it is very interesting and you will truly feel as though you were part of its creation.This quote says it all: ""Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles...

And when it finishes you will find yourself with a little smile on your face ;-)I first saw it when I was a child and it completely marked my childhood in some respects. What girl has never wanted to be a princess and live all these adventures??Just enjoy it !"
cassydea,"Sep 28, 2005",10/10,"The Princess Bride is a great family film with ""fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles..."" When Buttercup's true love, Westley, is said to have been killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts, she vows that she will never love again. When Prince Humperdink decides that he wants her hand in marriage, she accepts, but with no love in her heart for him. She is kidnapped one day on her daily horseback ride and is brought across the sea to Guilder, the sworn enemy of Prince Humperdink's country. A masked man in black follows Buttercup's kidnappers and defeats an expert swordsman, a giant and an all-knowing Sicilian. Buttercup finds out that the man in black is actually her beloved Westley and they hide in the fire swamp to get away from Prince Humperdink, who is trying to win back his fiancé. Chaos, torture, death, miracles, revenge and true love ensue. This movie has all the makings of an action-adventure film with sword fights, wrestling matches, torture devices, chases and escapes. What makes this movie special is its witty remarks and the perfect comedic timing by the superb cast."
uniqueblacklady,"Jun 6, 2006",10/10,"I don't care how many times I see this movie I will laugh till I'm falling out of my chair. True when I first got the movie I thought I was getting a sweet little princess story for my young girls. Man was I surprised. My daughters still didn't get it till they got much older. Now it's one of their favorite movies. The Princess Bride is not what you would think a fairy tale is, yet it's every bit a fairy tale with the happy ending. This is a must see movie for all ages. It's just not what you might think. Andre the giant is sweet as he can be. It broke my heart when he died. But in this movie I can live on knowing he did what he liked doing which was making people laugh."
Jacci-1,"Sep 19, 2003",N/A,".. This film.. Turned out great! It's an awesome movie. It's very unrealistic and a complete fantasy but it's really cute. If you like fantasies.. well that are funny and so stupid then this is a movie you should check out. With a couple scenes that could be frightening for younger children it has a wonderful plot and the actors/actresses did a great job.. I guess I would say that this is a funny family film for those with children over ten. Check it out, It will make you laugh!"
JaneBingley,"Aug 21, 2024",7/10,"""The Princess Bride"" (1987) is a romantic comedy that has achieved cult status over the years. Directed by Rob Reiner and based on William Goldman's novel, the film is a delightful blend of fairy tale fantasy, romance, and witty humor.The story is framed as a bedtime tale read by a grandfather (Peter Falk) to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). The tale centers on the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) and her true love, Westley (Cary Elwes), who must rescue her from an evil prince (Chris Sarandon). Along the way, they encounter a memorable cast of characters, including a skilled swordsman (Mandy Patinkin) and a comical giant (Andre the Giant).The charm of ""The Princess Bride"" lies in its clever script, filled with memorable lines and playful banter. The film's dialogue is both funny and endearing, with lines like ""As you wish"" becoming iconic. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright deliver performances that are both charming and heartfelt, capturing the essence of their fairy tale romance with a perfect blend of sincerity and humor.The film's supporting cast also shines, particularly Mandy Patinkin as the vengeful Inigo Montoya and Wallace Shawn as the scheming Vizzini. Their performances add depth and color to the story, creating a film that is as entertaining as it is whimsical.Rob Reiner's direction balances fantasy with humor, creating a story that appeals to both children and adults. The film's fairy tale elements are handled with a light touch, allowing for both magical moments and laugh-out-loud scenes.While ""The Princess Bride"" may not have been a major box office hit upon its release, it has since garnered a devoted following and remains a beloved classic. Its unique mix of romance, adventure, and comedy ensures its place as a timeless and charming film that continues to delight audiences."
barhydt,"Feb 25, 2001",9/10,"This is a real sleeper movie that was supposedly for children.  It has wonderful humor and a ""zanieness"" that is not over the top, it actually works and is funny.  It has lots of ""ensemble"" acting from people like Carol Kane and Billy Crystal that is superb.  Here is the comedy that is good hearted and pleasurable.  You can watch this movie many times."
Groverdox,"Mar 24, 2019",7/10,"There's not much to say about ""The Princess Bride"" that hasn't already been said. It's one of the most beloved cult classics ever made for a reason. The characters are memorable, lines of dialogue stay with you, and it is even laugh-out-loud funny at times. The framing story of Colombo reading to Kevin Arnold makes the experience more than just a classic fairy tale, but a tribute to fairy tales and the imagination itself.It's not perfect, though. The ending is kind of disappointing, a bit anticlimactic, if you ask me, and the movie seems to run out of steam toward the end in general. I wonder if the producers knew that going in, as Billy Crystal is such a welcome face - even if his face is covered with make-up and rubber prosthetics."
Faisal_Flamingo,"Nov 4, 2006",8/10,"I have nothing against family movies but is this a joke or what !! .. this movie is on top 250 movie at the IMDb list and it is very high rated .. I'm not saying that it is awful but it is not that good. It is just an OK family movie that I'd give it 5 out of 10 .. I don't know why so many people voted highly for it. I found boring in some parts and less amusing than I ever thought. The acting is terrible, I believe. I admit that there are good meanings in the movie but that's not enough to make a very good movie. Save your money and if you want to watch a good family movie .. just go and see ""It's Wonderful Life"" or ""The Wizard of Oz""."
paudie,"Jan 12, 2012",7/10,"I had been meaning to watch ""The Princess Bride"" in full for ages and finally got around to it. I enjoyed it but was slightly disappointed.The movie opens with a sick young boy being visited by his grandfather, who offers to read him a story. The boy isn't very enthusiastic at first but he gradually realises that this fairy story is slightly different to those he has heard before.The script (by Hollywood royalty William Goldman)is full of comic one-liners that are mostly aimed at adults, while the basic framework stays within the fairy tale genre with a beautiful princess, a handsome hero and a nasty villain determined to get his way.While it is very watchable, I thought the film wasn't consistently funny enough for adults, though kids will probably be happy enough with the fight and chase scenes The performances are excellent, particularly Peter Falk as the grandfather, Robin Wright as Princess Buttercup and Carey Elwes as the hero. The supporting cast are also very good."
splints,"Feb 24, 2002",5/10,"This movie was highly hyped and quite frankly I found it to be incredibly boring. The humor was slow, there was little wit involved, the sets were less than amazing, the actress playing Princess Buttercup was just painful to watch. Boring, boring."
gavin6942,"Nov 29, 2008",10/10,"Buttercup is madly in love with the farmboy Westley, but soon after her love blossoms he is captured and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Picked by the prince to be her bride, she is rescued from ruffians by the pirate who killed her love. Will true love prevail in this tale of romance, action, adventure and more? Like many films, ""The Princess Bride"" isn't one i really have to praise. If you don't already love it, you have a friend who will swear up and down that it's one of the most amazing films ever. So you don't need me to convince you. In fact, you've probably already seen it and I'm surprised if you haven't. (Although, the reason for this review is that I was able to recently show my girlfriend the film for the first time, so some of you may have missed out.) As my introduction says, this is a film of romance, action and adventure. I left out comedy. The film has a lot of great one-liners and quotable jokes you'll treasure for a lifetime. Author William Goldman is incredible -- read the novel and you'll see the humor jump off the page -- and the director, Rob Reiner, perfected it for the screen. Of course, if you've seen ""This is Spinal Tap"", you already knew how great Reiner was with comedy.Cary Elwes, one of my favorite actors, is great in the leading role (very similar to his role in ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights""). Robin Wright does an adequate job as Buttercup. And then the supporting cast is just some of the best in the business: Fred Savage, Peter Falk, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, Wallace Shawn, Chris Sarandon (who came off as sort of a jerk in person, but is a solid actor). I could do without Billy Crystal, but someone probably appreciated him.Again, you've probably seen this or have someone you know pushing it. I, too, would push it. I don't know why you're reading reviews for this film. If you're looking for people's thoughts, I'm sure they're overwhelmingly positive. I won't deviate from those people. From the six-fingered man, to the albino, to ROUSes... I love this film."
sbadams,"Oct 4, 2000",10/10,"How can anyone not like this movie?  It has a little bit of everything; comedy, romance, violence, suspense, mystery, fantasy and so forth.  Wesley and Buttercup live the life that everyone yearns for.  This movie truly gets better every time you watch it."
helpneeder,"Jun 22, 2002",10/10,"This movie was one that I first saw on TV and I absolutely loved it!  Two days later I went to the mall and bought it along with another movie.  I watched the Princess Bride first.  All you people who don't have it, go and get it!"
notperfect_justloved,"Jul 28, 2005",10/10,"It definitely starts out as a cheesy, girly fairytale... It's so sappy, it makes you laugh! But then it has an actual plot, which is exciting and unpredictable! This is one movie that I could watch time and time again and never become bored with it! I can nearly quote every line of the movie, and I still enjoy each viewing just as much as the last! I can't say there are any great values presented - although there's nothing questionable, really - but it's just a fun movie to sit down and laugh at. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good laugh at some REALLY funny stuff - not just the ordinary, cookie cutter jokes that most other movies provide. I also loved the storyline - it was cute and touching, and while the outcome was obvious from the beginning (as all fairy tales are), the path on which the characters would take to produce such an outcome was very interesting. It is a great movie! I strongly recommend it!"
nicholls_katy,"Jan 16, 2001",N/A,"I first saw this as a little kid, and must have seen it at least 20 times. It got to be a family joke. I hadn't seen it for ages and one day when I was sick my Mum asked me if I wanted a movie out of the video store. I said ""The Princess Bride"". They had it! Watching it again for the first time in about 10 years made me realise what a great movie this is, and how many jokes I missed as a kid! This is not just a perfect love story, it's funny too! And I also realised just how cute Cary Elwes looks in a mask! This is the only movie I would say ""favourite"" about. Even my 11 year old brother thought it was OK!Definetely 10/10"
Videoman-4,"Jan 22, 1999",10/10,"If you want a movie that's entertaining for the whole family - you will not find one better than The Princess Bride.  It's heart-warming AND entertaining.  It spans all genres.  There's plenty of comedy, drama, action, and even a little horror in the Fire-Swamp.  All age groups love this movie.  We own Video Stop (a chain of video stores in Fort Wayne) and it's nearly impossible to find someone who hasn't seen this movie.  It's nearly as rare to find someone who hasn't thoroughly enjoyed it. A definite 10"
mickeythechamp,"Aug 13, 2023",7/10,"A very fun revisitI 100% understand the love for this movie. It´s been a while since I could lean back and just watch a fun fantasy movie. I love when they come around again because it is a gerne that lends itself to whimsy and wonder as well as seriousness. The Princess Bride is delightful in it´s presentation and humour every step of the way, giving away to a fun experience. It feels short and too the point, but I would love to have just a few more minutes added to tie every plot thread and character together just that much stronger.After a commoner girl falls in love with a farmhand, he is killed off by a pirate and she is married to the king, unhappy. She is kidnapped by people wanting to start a war, but a mysterious stranger is pursuing them. All of this is a story, told to a sick kid.What really elevates this story is it´s incredible characters. Every single actor is memorable in their role and the tone really works here. It´s a children's story so instead of a lot of seriousness, the story is full of happiness, respect, and just nice people. Even people fighting to the death respects each other and complements each other during fights. But every actor needs a shoutout if they could. Cary Elwes as Westly is charming and fun, Mandy Patinkin a Inigo is incredible. Wallace Shawn as Vizzini is oh so funny and Andre Roussimoff is charming and wonderful. They all carry this movie with tiher charm, wits and incredibly memorable and quotable lines.The humour in this movie really lands with me. It´s so nice and charming and at the same time so deadpan and over the top. I genuinely laugh at this movie, it really understands it´s own humour to a T, making everything land that much more.I love the way this movie is told from a storybook perspective. It excuses a lot of things and makes everything feel so much more wonderful. The characters are cute because it can´t be too scary. The sets work because it´s a kid imagining the story. More movies should really use this tone more to be cuter with fantasy instead of brooding darkness all the time.This is a rather basic fantasy story though and it feels done with quickly. A bit too quickly for me but I think that´s a me thing. I love when a movie get´s to spread it´s leaves a bit more and start to really impact you, but this is a quickly done deal. Maybe we need more movies that doesn't need the long screentime, but I feel like this movie needed it. I loved the universe, characters and tiher motivations so much, I really feel like we needed more to elevate this to a perfect romantic, fantasy comedy.But I will watch this again and love what it´s doing great again. I don't think it will ever elevate itself to me, but it will forever be a good movie I can return to."
geddyneilalex28,"Mar 31, 2001",10/10,I love this movie! Anyone who doesn't like it is not right in the head. All my friends and I watch it about every 3 weeks. We cant get enough of it. Watch out for the R.O.U.S.'s They do exist and can come after you at any moment! Robin Wright is beautiful as the princess. I would chase after her anywhere.
NestorTheGreat,"May 22, 2022",7/10,"Starts just like The Never-ending Story: with a character reading a story out loud until we're transported to said tall tale. The little banter between the grandfather and child gets old real quick, in my opinion, interrupting the illusion of the rescued princess tale.With a name like Buttercup, you better hope they play that song from There's Something About Mary! The story takes us on a windy road full of weird occurrences, like the moment a henchman stays back to fight a masked swordsman on their tail, conversing like workmates all the while!A very unconventional rescued princess love story but Andre the Giant always makes me smile! Playing an evil henchman is not his forte, though!"
jglillis-1,"Feb 14, 2010",2/10,"Let's face it. Rob Reiner is not Mel Brooks. (Perhaps both of them are glad of that...) I watched this film on the recommendation of several people whose intelligence I had hitherto respected, but was, alas, disappointed. My first reaction to the whole thing as ""this film is unremittingly silly!"" Andre the Giant is no Alex Karras/Mongo. ""Max the Miracle Man"" who brings people back from the dead? A woman who thinks she's been married without having agreed to it by saying ""I do""? A hero who has to be dragged to climactic action because he's ""mostly dead""? This film gives new definition to the term ""willing suspension of disbelief."" My biggest worry now is that friends who have become fans of this thing will trot it out and force me to watch it again. I will not be saying ""As you wish."""
subman,"Feb 10, 1999",10/10,"Once when I was in the Navy, I was on an extended deployment where we spent over 70 days at sea.  About 8 of us would watch a movie every evening--since we had over 200 titles on board we had an unofficial rule that we would never watch the same movie twice in a given 70 day patrol.  We also were 8 guys with several distinctly different tastes in movies so we took turns either picking the movie or enduring another's choice.  The night we first watched PRINCESS BRIDE, it was remarkable how each and every one of us had really loved that movie.  It was the ONLY movie that ever violated the once per patrol rule--we saw it once a week and enjoyed it more each time we saw it."
kellynickell,"Nov 15, 2001",10/10,"The writing is comedic genius, the cast is perfect.  I rarely buy videos, but I bought this one because I got tired of renting it.  It's funny everytime I watch it!  Rob Reiner's direction reminds me of some of Mel Brook's work--that's a good thing."
stefaffi,"Feb 20, 2001",9/10,"This movie is exactly what is promised at the beginning of the movie - Action, Adventure, Sword fighting, true love, Giants....While the acting isn't all that great, and the special effects are kind of cheesy, the plot, storyline, and even the characters allow for that, and use it to make a funny, romantic, good movie."
gaelynwrites,"Sep 28, 2010",10/10,"I can easily say that this is my favorite movie of all time. Back in elementary and middle school I would watch this movie at least twice a month. I knew all the lines by heart before I entered high school and I still know them now that I am in college.If you haven't seen this movie then shame on you. Best movie of its time and of its genre. The wit and humor is timeless and fun to use in every day life. It does happen, I assure you. My whole family loves this movie, including all the guys. I think they like it for the Fire Swamp and Pit of Dispare scenes. You'll get no spoilers from me, just go see it for yourself. I guarantee that you'll love it."
VonPookie,"Sep 30, 1998",N/A,"I have always loved anything having to deal with the middle ages, swords and sorcery, and dragons.  If this had a dragon in it, I don't think I would ever watch anything else.  This is just the perfect movie for everyone.  It is definitely hard to dislike this movie.  My mother took me to see this in the theater when it was first released, I saw it with my boyfriend on one of our first ""dates"" (great movie for that, too), and I can't seem to pass up a chance to watch it when it is shown on t.v., even though I have it on tape.That's just my opinion though...watch it for yourself and see what you think:)"
sethmlanders,"Mar 8, 2015",9/10,"This is the kind of movie that can appeal to anyone of all ages. It has romance, adventure, drama, comedy, and somehow, it succeeds at every aspect. Rob Reiner is a talented actor's director who cares a lot about the story and his characters.The story is about a boy who is sick and his grandpa reads him a book. It transitions from what we visually see as Peter Falk narrates. Wesley is a charming yet poor farm-boy who falls in love with a woman who is engaged to the wrong man. The girl, Buttercup, is engaged to a egotistical royalty prince (Humperdink). Along the way, we run into some quirky characters that somehow win our affection from the beginning. A giant and a Spanyard, Inigo Montoya, who eventually work with Wesley to stop Buttercup's wedding from happening.Overall, a very magical experience that still holds up to this day. I loved it as a kid and I love it even more in my young adult years. This is one film that you can show your date or family. Watch this movie as you wish!"
Lil'Girl,"Jun 21, 2000",10/10,This is most certainly one of my favourite films. The witty dialogue and plot twists continues to charm and amuse even after multiple viewings. It is certainly one of the most quotable films... absolutely hilarious. The sword fights and bantering are the highlights of this intelligent and satirical film. A real gem. One of few films that deserve all the accolades it has received.
