artoffilmorg,"Apr 18, 2018",9/10,"Hitchcock at his sharpest. Art and commerce in a delicious salad with all the right ingredients. A brisk screenplay by Ernest Lehman a Cary Grant that is just pure delight, Eva Marie Saint fresh out of her Oscar from ""On the Waterfront"" is an icy blonde with a brain. James Mason, the ultimate foreign sinister not to mention Jessie Royce Landis and Hitchcock brings Bernard Herrmann to wrap it all up in one of the most infectious scores imaginable. A real treat."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 9, 2009",9/10,"My favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock has directed many classics like Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo, and I will say that this deserves to be up there among his best. I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock's direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people's heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10. Bethany Cox"
Ben_Cheshire,"Jul 24, 2004",8/10,"Its Hitch's most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else's crime.I've finally come to realise just how great North by Northwest is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront.  Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. North by Northwest is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!If you said to Hitchcock ""as if he'd keep driving"" or ""as if she'd do that"" - he would just laugh at you and say you've missed the point. This is 100% movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you'll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone's been stabbed.It flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.A succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann's essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.10/10"
barnabyrudge,"Jan 15, 2003",N/A,"North by Northwest will need no introduction to most movie-goers. It's a classic, greatly admired by audiences and critics alike. The story about a befuddled ad-executive fleeing from spies and the police (the spies want him dead because he knows of their plot, the police want him captured because they think he's behind a murder) is done at a breakneck pace and deals with Hitchcock's most frequently used theme: an innocent man on the run.Cary Grant is urbane and smooth as the hero. James Mason oozes silky menace as the principal villain (Martin Landau also plays a villain, giving his character a seriously nasty toughness). Eva Marie Saint is simply fabulous as the woman whose loyalties seems torn between good and bad.The set pieces are rightly considered to be moments of cinematic genius. Grant's escape from a crop-duster; the fight atop Mount Rushmore; the auction house bluff; the drunken car journey; the murder at the UN building.... each scene is brilliantly devised by script writer Ernest Lehmann and just as brilliantly filmed by director Hitchcock. Everyone should see this movie... it's a masterpiece."
ags123,"Apr 23, 2008",10/10,"This is Hitchcock's best film  quite an accomplishment, considering how many great films he created. And after half a century, ""North By Northwest"" holds up beautifully. This film has it all: suspense, glamour, humor, and images that capture the imagination and remain etched in memory. The legendary crop-dusting sequence alone is a master class in the art of pure cinema. Like the rest of the film, it's brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed. All the elements come together to produce the finest form of entertainment. Bernard Herrmann's frantic fandango captures the complexity and pace of the action. Ernest Lehman's script is full of sophisticated dialogue. Performances are spot on. Has Cary Grant ever been more engaging? Is James Mason the ultimate in charming villains? And Eva Marie Saint's allure is multi-faceted. Movies just don't get better than this."
jotix100,"Oct 30, 2005",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is one of the best films in his long and distinguished career. Part of the success of the movie lies in the screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era. Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard Hermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the above mentioned qualities, ""North by Northwest"" was photographed by Robert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did outstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired Alfred Hitchcock.The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This has to be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock because of the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the repartee between her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romance that aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be really happening.Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, so we shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time it turns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others of the same period have. The highlights of the film are the sequences involving the crop duster, the train ride to Chicago where Eve and Roger first meet, the auction, and the Mount Rushmore climax.This is one of the best contributions by Cary Grant to any of his work with the director. Roger Thornhill is one of the best roles Mr. Grant played, during his long career. His chemistry with Eva Marie Saint is perfect. This young actress added class and elegance to the picture. James Mason and Martin Landau played villains convincingly. Jesse Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll, and the rest of the supporting cast is excellent.""North by Northwest"" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best crafted films thanks to the brilliant people that came together to work in it."
movieman9,"Dec 25, 2000",10/10,"For Christmas this year, I received my first to-own DVD: Hitchcock's classic, NORTH BY NORTHWEST. After over 40 years, this rip-racing adventure-thriller still packs a punch and looks great on widescreen. This movie came along during a renaissance period for the Old Master, between masterpieces like VERTIGO and PSYCHO, but this excursion into the world of suspense is so different from anything else Hitchcock had created up to that point. Never did he challenge our endurance to keep still in our seats for such a long period of time, and yet the film's 135 minutes go by so fast it could only be explained by movie magic itself.Cary Grant is one of those actors that a filmgoer either falls in love with or deeply envies. His debonair manner is displayed to the full in this film, even though the peril that his character goes through would cause any normal dude to break into a maddening sweat.  The dialogue Roger Thornhill delivers alongside Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) in this film is sometimes too hilarious to be true, but wouldn't any woman fall for it? (I'm merely guessing here)  Ernest Lehman's screenplay is so lighthearted and yet very ominous. With all the traps and pitfalls Grant goes through in this film, you would have to find comedy in it. Grant does and to great appeal. I absolutely love the sequence at the auction when Roger tries to get himself arrested by yelling out flaky bids and accusing the auctioneer of selling junk worth no more than $8.  I also admire the scenes with Saint on the train to Chicago; I was tempted to jot down some of his pick-up lines, but then I realized it's just a movie (or is it?)Hitchcock was famous throughout his career of setting up death-defying sequences with major landmarks as backdrops. Here, Mount Rushmore will never be looked at the same again afterwards. We may never enter the United Nations again without peering behind our backs for a notorious knife-thrower. And, I dare say, I will never walk alongside a highway where a cropduster could swoop at any minute. I love the line during the Rushmore incident when Grant says his two ex-wives left him because he lived too dull a life. Go figure!It has been said that Hitchcock's many films each contain a personal side of the director inside them. The archetypes of the Master of Suspense are here amid the chasing and running across the U.S. The mysterious blonde, played to a tee by Eva Marie Saint, is a common fixture of many Hitchcock jaunts. Saint joins Grace Kelly and Tippi Hedren in this feature. The protagonist is again awkward when faced with  the opposite sex, but unusually casual when wrapped up in danger. The hero has an attachment to his mother, continually under his nurturing wing. And of course, the macguffin has fun with us again (government secrets my foot!)Whenever I see action-packed epics today like ""The Fugitive"" or the James Bond series, they all seem to quiver in comparison to this film. It amazes me that Hitchcock is able to hold the audience in the palm of his hand throughout the whole length of the journey. We become Grant as he runs away from the police and the secret agents who have chosen him as their dupe. But throughout the squabble, we sense that Grant is getting off on the whole jaunt, just as we want the chase to continue, not looking at our watches for a minute. However, it's fascinating to note that Roger Thornhill is not a born adventurer, nor is he an archeologist with a flair for escaping impossible situations. We are experiencing the Cary Grant in all of us, running away from an enemy we do not know they are or what they want. Is this symbolism of some kind? I say who cares; just watch the film and have fun!"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 24, 2022",9/10,"A case of mistaken identity for Roger Thornhill, sees him picked up by a dangerous, powerful villain, and later falsely accused of murder.Some films and shows age badly, for all sorts of reasons, plot, acting, production values, not far of seventy years old, Hitchcock's masterpiece North by Northwest holds up as a true classic.It will looks remarkably stylish, features a superb central acting performance, and boasts a plot most writers only dream of creating. Full of twists and turns, Hitchcock spins a terrific web.It's not serious the whole way through, indeed there are a few lighter moments, I particularly loved the scene in the auction room, the look on the auctioneer's face throughout, brilliant.Cary Grant is simply oozing with charisma, loaded with style, he offers real Hollywood Star quality, James Mason and Eva Marie Saint are equally brilliant.A tremendous watch, 9/10."
bsmith5552,"Oct 20, 2001",9/10,"""North By Northwest"" is another of Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers where an ordinary man is put into an extraordinary situation. As in most of these movies, the hero has to quickly adapt to his situation or perish.This time it is Cary Grant who is thrust into a world of international intrigue when is mistaken by villain James Mason for an American operative named George Kaplan (the film's ""McGuffan"" by the way). Along the way he is seduced by Mason's mistress (Eva Marie Saint) while being pursued by Mason and his cronies from New York to Chicago to South Dakota and ultimately to Mount Rushmore for the film's climax.""North By Northwest"" is full of classic Hitchcock moments. First,there is Grant's frustration and fear as he tries to explain to Mason that he is not the person they are seeking. Next, the scene in the cornfield where Grant is isolated and attacked by a plane is pure Hitchcock. Then we have the art auction where he cleverly escapes Mason's henchmen and finally, the finale at Mount Rushmore in a scene reminiscent of a similar one in ""Sabotage"" (1942) (which took place at the top of the Statue of Liberty).The cast, as in most Hitchcock films is excellent. Grant is understandably confused and frightened as the the hero, Eva Marie Saint has never been sexier as the femme fatale, James Mason is suave and sinister as the villain and Martin Landau in an early role, is good as Mason's chief henchman. Hitchcock regular Leo G. Carroll is cold heartedly sinister as the ""professor"". Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother (she was about Grant's real age) is wasted and unnecessary to the plot.The only problem that I have with this and other Hitchcock films is his over reliance on back projection and soundstage ""exteriors"". Other than that. ""North By Northwest"" has to be considered as one of Hitchcock's best. Watch for Hitchcock's hilarious cameo appearance at the end of the opening credits."
ccthemovieman-1,"Apr 9, 2006",6/10,"When I started collecting videos in earnest (by the thousands), I was excited to get this film. I had such fond remembrances of seeing it on the big screen when I was young teen. I remember being terrified when Cary Grant was being chased by the crop duster and then awed at the end with the climactic scene on Mount Rushmore. I saw it maybe a decade or so later on television and enjoyed it again.Well, seeing the film again five years ago on DVD as a 50-something-year-old turned out to be a major disappointment, mainly because the first hour was so boring. The beginning had scenes that looked too dated and worse, were drawn out too long, such as Grant's drunk scene and the romance between he and Eva Marie Saint.Once Grant goes on the run, the story improves noticeably and mixing in some comedy with the drama was a good move. From that point, it's still the fun film I had remembered but, overall, didn't have the suspense anymore and, to this day, I believe is an overrated Alfred Hitchcock film. The more I see of Hitch's old films, the more disappointed I am, with the exception of Psycho and Rear Window."
JSanicki,"Mar 3, 2003",N/A,"I saw this film for the first time when I was a freshman in college as part of an english class I took entitled ""writing and the movies"".  Little did I realize that I would be seeing a film that would stay with me to this day and in essence become one of my all time favorites.  Then, a few years ago, I caught it on the big screen at the Fine Arts theater in downtown Chicago. I remember that it was a rainy, cold October day.  Perfect weather for a Hitchcock film I thought to myself.For me, half of the fun of North by Northwest is its incredible story.  This film has something for everyone within it: a little comedy, a little romance, great snappy dialogue and more action than any Bruce Willis Die Hard film combined.  Hitchcock was a master at this and in North by Northwest he lets his genius shine through totally.  It seems to me that whenever I watch it, everyone who made this film from Cary Grant on down had nothing but sheer fun making it.  Perhaps my two favorite scenes are the infamous ""crop-duster"" sequence and the last twenty minutes or so at Mount Rushmore.I must give special mention to Ernest Lehman who yet again managed to write a screenplay that totally knocks your socks off.  How he came up with the idea, I've not a clue, but what an idea it is.  The screenplay itself was nominated for an Academy Award that year, but lost to Pillow Talk.  North by Northwest was also nominated for Best Set Decoration and Best Film Editing, but lost to Ben-Hur in both categories.All in all, what a film. If you haven't seein it, do so ASAP. North by Northwest just reinforces my belief that Alfred Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors of all time. Period.My rating: 4 stars"
Nazi_Fighter_David,"Jan 12, 2009",8/10,"Cary Grant handles the twisted expressions of his face, his astonished look, his impulsive smile with professional self-assurance and charm while taking us right in the middle of confusion on a breathless 2000-mile cross-country chase which has its gripping showdown across the giant faces of the presidents sculptured on Mount Rushmore high above Rapid City, South DakotaGrant plays Roger Thornhill, a stylish publicist, mistaken for a fictitious Federal agent, plunged into a world of crime and intrigue, hunted down by villains who want to eliminate him because he seems to be on their dishonest dealingsWhen questioned by bland Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), Thornhill is unable to convince him that he is a victim of a mistaken identity His three thugs fill him with bourbon, and place him in a stolen car expecting him to have a drunken accident After narrowly escaping death, no one believes his story including, obviously, his skeptical mother (Jessie Royce Landis).In an effort to discover the agent he is being confused with, and using the clues he collected, Thornhill returns to the United Nations Headquarter looking for George Kaplan There, somebody falls into his arms and unthinkingly, Thornhill draws the blade out of the victim's back and is photographed holding the weapon in mid-air And thus became a fugitive from justice, pursued by the cops and had to skip by boarding a train to ChicagoWhile on the run, he is caught by a provocative platinum blonde (Eva Marie Saint), who comes out as a glamorous woman and a delightful charmerJames Mason, a polished mastermind spy showed too well to be threatening...

dtb,"Feb 7, 2004",10/10,"Many feel this is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest American movie, and I agree! NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the Hitchcock film to end all Hitch films, with all his pet themes covered with maximum wit, panache, and suspense, as well as a romance between Cary Grant and a soignée Eva Marie Saint that's as tender as it is sexy. Grant has never been more engaging and dashing (literally and figuratively :-), though the smoothly villainous James Mason nearly out-suaves him. My husband and I have joked that if Mason had played Thornhill, the film would have been over in mere moments. With all due respect to Grant, if the imperious, unshakably confident Mason asked the Glen Cove police, ""Do you honestly believe that this happened the way you think it did?"" they would immediately reply, ""No, sir, you must be right, you're free to go, sorry we bothered you."" :-) Also boasts a great early performance by a reptilian young Martin Landau as Mason's possessive henchman, as well as one of Oscar nominee Ernest Lehman's best screenplays (in fact, he borrowed liberally from it for his script for the film version of THE PRIZE starring Paul Newman) and one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores. Anybody who wants to write or direct a chase thriller should watch NORTH BY NORTHWEST first to see how it's done!"
frankwiener,"Jan 1, 2018",9/10,"Wedged between the making of two very serious, psychological suspense films, ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"", director Alfred Hitchcock created a very different kind of thriller, one consisting largely of comedy, both subtle and obvious, thanks in part to the talent of scriptwriter, Ernest Lehman. Hitchcock and Lehman started with three seemingly unrelated ideas, (1) a mistaken identity, (2) a chase scene through the United Nations, and (3) a spectacular finale at Mount Rushmore. They then wove these three events into one cohesive story, a fascinating creative process by itself.As to the acting, I have seen Cary Grant in many movies, including a number of mediocre items and even worse than that, but he provides the perfect Roger Thornhill with his dry, natural wit and suave, elegant appearance. Whenever I am faced with life's adversities, I only need to recall how Roger would approach the situation with his coolness and muted sense of humor. The fact that Grant did not understand Lehman's script only authenticates his genuine state of confusion as he is pursued from New York City to Rapid City, South Dakota by way of Chicago and some very dry Indiana cornfields. As the mysterious Eve Kendall, Eva Marie Saint is a very different woman indeed from her Oscar winning performance as Edie Doyle in ""On the Waterfront"", and she never ceases to intrigue us as a woman who is far more independent and sexually assertive than we would normally expect in 1959. And who could deliver those caustic, cynical lines as well as James Mason in the part of the deceptively ""respectable"" villain, Philip van Damm? Grant and Mason are an outstanding match, and they bring this film to a high level (no pun intended when you consider the ending) that it may not have achieved without their dynamic interaction.Throughout the film, subtle undercurrents flow beneath the surface, including Thornhill's curious relationship with his undermining mother (Jesse Royce Landis), which may by itself explain his previous two divorces. Then there is the quirky jealousy of van Damm's assistant thug, Leonard (Martin Landau). When I first viewed this film at the innocent age of ten, I didn't appreciate the symbolism of the speeding train through the tunnel at the end, but I was nevertheless very impressed by the overall visual power created by Hitchcock, not only here but in many of his other productions as well.There were many memorable cinematic moments in this film, including an extraordinary aerial shot of Thornhill escaping from the United Nations building, a sudden showdown involving a man, a speeding oil tanker, and a menacing crop duster, and several, breathtaking shots from atop Mount Rushmore, both real and manufactured. As was the case with the Statue of Liberty in ""Saboteur"", the power of the monument is enhanced even more by the director's dramatic camera angles as it stands as an invincible symbol of the freedom that the evil elements in the film want to destroy.The success of ""North By Northwest"" is shaped by a combination of winning attributes, including a very gifted director, a sharp, snappy screenplay by Lehman, superb cinematography by Robert Burks, an effectively moody musical score by Bernard Hermann, and some first-rate acting."
SendiTolver,"Sep 12, 2018",10/10,"One can argue about is 'North by Northwest' the best movie in the long list of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, but it is definitely his most entertaining one. Escapist and unrealistic, sure, but all the characters, their motivations, actions and events depicted on the screen are believable in their own universe that Hitchcock directed based on Ernest Lehman's screenplay. The dialogue is witty and filled with amusing innuendos, and although it might seem that it is all game for the characters, the imminent threat is always present, and doesn't give the viewer (or the characters) too much time to rest from head spinning action. One aspect that is truly amazing (especially for a film like this) is that none of the characters were irritating, especially those who were totally ignorant for the obvious - the police officers and main character's mother (Jessie Royce Landis - what a wonderful performance), who didn't take seriously one single word that Roger Thornhill said about his situation.Cary Grant, who mostly played himself in his later movies (he did that wonderfully, I might add), gives one of his best performances as Roger Thornhill, a man who is mistaken as government agent and later falsely accused of crime he didn't commit. Eva Marie Saint equally shines as Eve Kendall, a woman whose intentions are unclear. Chemistry between the two leads make the screen sizzle (take that implication how you want) and it is pure enjoyment to watch these two playfully overcome all threats and obstacles. James Mason is perfectly intelligent as the lead villain and Martin Landau as his cruel and cold right hand.Not many movies can be so easy going and edge on your seat entertainment at the same time, and with such perfection. Timeless classic that has aged graciously without any wrinkles."
randalgraves-26599,"Dec 10, 2020",10/10,One of the impressive movies ever made. This film is years ahead in hits film making.
trickynicky72,"Jun 6, 2001",5/10,"As it is clearly demonstrated even in this forum, many, many people love this movie. I just finished viewing it myself for the first time, and frankly, I can't say that I agree. Am I nuts? Maybe. All I know is I'd like to put my two cents in, for what it's worth.For an espionage tale like this, I would have preferred an approach  more based on grim realism. Instead, the narrative seemed a bit too convenient and contrived, as if Old Hitch was trying to make the ends meet at the last minute. Somehow, I never felt the `taut' tension of his other films that I've immensely enjoyed (Dial M for Murder, Rear Window, Psycho, The Wrong Man, Vertigo, to name but a few). It certainly doesn't help that the film contains too many scenes that verge on the `fantastical' level. For example, there's a scene in which a gun goes off in the living room of a house. Eva Marie Saint comes out of her room and asks, `What was that noise,' to which James Mason replies, `We were just wondering about that.' Martin Landau just gives a little shrug and all is forgotten. I mean, come on! I'd say it's pretty hard to mistake a gunshot for, say, somebody dropping a glass on the floor. As I mentioned, there are many more scenes like this during the course of the movie, and every single one of them acts as a decelerator' of the narrative. Also, the overall performance of the cast struck me as rather underwhelming, especially when we're talking about some of the finest actors ever to grace the silver screen. James Mason, in particular, sleepwalks his way through, though I can't blame him, given the fact that his character was so painfully underwritten. The bit when Cary Grant acts like he's drunk was pretty difficult to sit through. Humor is fine when it works on, again, a believable level.I like the idea of having a normal Joe get tangled up in a case of mistaken identity/international espionage. Also, it does feature some memorable scenes, especially the famous crop field/airplane sequence (it really does deserve all the praise it has received) But again, it just proves to me that even a seemingly sure-fire combo like Ernest Lehman-Alfred Hitchcock can still come up short on the goods.The second 007 adventure, `From Russia with Love', received some hounding because people thought it was basically a rip-off of this movie (there are some obvious similarities), but in this madman's humble opinion, `From Russia with Love' is the one that achieves a better telling of a spy story."
DrLenera,"Sep 30, 2004",N/A,"North By Northwest is not an artistic masterpiece like Rear Window and Vertigo, but it is probably the most purely entertaining picture Hitchcock ever made. It's essentially a rehash of many of his earlier films, with a plot partially derived from The Thirty Nine Steps and the very similar Saboteur, while there are borrowings from Foreign Correspondent and Notorious, among others. However, it is all done with such style and confidence that it doesn't matter if it's essentially just a greatest hits package.Very few other films of this kind attain the near perfect tone of this one, precariously balanced between seriousness and silliness. Sometimes this film manages the very difficult trick of being both suspenseful and comical at the same time, as in the auction house scene, or the wonderful scene in the lift when the hero's mother turns to two heavies in a lift looking menacingly at the hero and says ""you gentlemen are not REALLY trying to kill my son, are you?"".Of course the famous crop dusting plane scene and the Mount Rushmore chase are terrific. The former is really more notable for the amount of time taken to build up to the action than the action itself, while the technical work on the latter still looks pretty good. In a totally different vein is the astonishingly frank seduction sequence on the train. Hitchcock takes his time here as with many of the other scenes, but the film is so crammed with memorable passages that one hardly notices it's 136 mins long.Ernest Lehman's script is full of wonderful lines, many of them delivered so well by chief villain James Mason that at times we almost want to root for him. ""Has any one ever told you tend to overplay your various roles Mr Kaplan....it seems to me you fellows could stand a little less training from the FBI and a little more from the Actor's Studio"". Cary Grant is so smooth one almost forgets he's over 50, and of course there's also Bernard Herrmann's vibrant score.Endlessly enjoyable even with repeated viewings. How many of today's thrillers will be such fun in 25 years time?"
Gmanol01,"Nov 14, 2001",10/10,"When you thought that he's all out of ideas and last minute rescues, Hitchcock comes back with more eye candy and great action. North by Northwest is sometimes called Hitchcock's last great film. Carey Grant and Eva Marie Saint have very good chemistry and the inclusion of not one, not two, not three, but severa plot twists makes this film one of Hitchcock's best.One thing not focused on in this film is the use of camera angles. When Roger is taken to make the telegram, the camera slides from a foreground view of Roger's lunch buddies, to the two standing men in a background view. Also, when Roger awaits George Kaplan in the field, there is a great establishing shot of Roger where there is total silence and calm until the eerie plane is spotted. One last camera technique that Hitchcock perfected was when, in the final moments of the Mount Rushmore chase, Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendall were saved by the sniper. The body of the person shot was shown and then a tilt up to the sniper showed the detectives. Little snipets like these were just a few things Hitchcock did well.Overall, this movie was one of the best I've seen ever. For a 1950s movie, it is ahead of it's time and paved the way for future films to imitate many of the innovations that the flick brought to the screen. Go out and see this movie!"
joshuafagan-64214,"Sep 26, 2015",10/10,"If anyone has doubts about the power of mistaken identity and its place in fiction, look no further than this film. The many hokey takes on it through the years have diminished its very real power as a storytelling device. As a comedy trick, it is cheap and dull. But as a dramatic trick... there is real force behind it. Everyone dreads being alone in the time of a crisis and not having anyone believe them and feeling like they are sinking further and further into a pit that's growing ever deeper and deeper. A good filmmaker can use the idea of mistaken identity in a tense situation to tackle these fears. And Hitchcock most certainly is a few steps above a good filmmaker.In fact, he is at his best here. Vertigo may be his best shot film from an artistic point of view. Rear Window (which I would have done a review of for this series of critical takes if I had seen it in time and is quite excellent) is his most interestingly shot movie perspective-wise. But this is Hitchcock showing his truest colors. All the tropes of his directorial style are on full display and are in fine shape. I often joke to myself (I'm alone a lot) about Hitchcock's love of his use of his specific style dashboard cam no matter the situation, but it can be an effective cinematic tool to increase tension, make the area feel more claustrophobic, and increase focus on the characters.To give a one-sentence synopsis: An advertising executive is mistaken for a secret agent from the authorities and must go on the run. What follows is a wild yet deft 136 minutes of what I believe to be Hitchcock's most obviously entertaining film. Pulses pound as the characters move like chess pieces around a well-written, twisting and turning storyline that causes many iconic scenes, the most famous of which being when Thornhill (The protagonist) runs from a crop duster craft. It is everything an action scenes should be, and the isolation kicks every element up a few notches. It is the favorite scene of many, including me.Every element, from the action to the mystery, is well-executed. The dialogue is interesting, as it is in many Hitchcock movies. In fact, one of Hitchcock's most underrated talents is writing-dialogue. He may not be a Sorkin or a Woody Allen, but he knows that dialogue is the key to making interesting characters that are more than just pieces in a puzzle. He may have believed that actors are cattle, but one can tell from watching his films that he knows the importance of characters. His dialogue is natural yet profound, and while depicting catch phrases and fads from that era would make the movies seem dated, the intelligent, understated way he talks about the issues of his time here and there make the movies seem like they are proudly representing their time. The difference is the difference between decay and grandeur, between the many ephemeral leaders of Rome and the never-fading Roman culture.The acting is more than fine. Cary Grant, one of the legends, puts on a believable and thorough performance. In some of the quieter scenes, it is what makes the film work. Eva Marie Saint, another legend (and a blonde, as most women are in Hitchcock movies) adds spice and edge to a role that would have been ordinary had it been performed by a less actress.On a side note, I don't think I'm the only one who finds it just a bit creepy to watch someone act on the screen when they're now dead, like Grant, and even more bizarre when they're still alive but have aged quite a bit since their role, like Ms. Saint, who is alive and in her nineties at the time of this review.Hitchcock is known as the Mater of Suspense and this film shows you why; it takes all sorts of twists and turns. One of the trademarks of Hitchcock films is their ability to appear like they're one type of film before seamlessly yet starkly transitioning to another. The Birds went from a screwball Pythonesque comedy to a horror film, Psycho from a heist film to a dark twisted thriller. I have seen no other director that can pull off this trick so well. In this film, we go from a more mysterious psychological movie to more of an espionage adventure tale; it's not as jarring of a shift, but it is a shift nonetheless.The score represents Hitchcock's best on that front. Scores like this are the reason why an unscored movie like The Birds or a softly scored flick like Rear Window come as such a shock. This score is big and booming and dynamic. Yes, the fifties were riddled with over the top scores (it's actually one of the best ways to identify a film as being from that decade) but Hitchcock knows how to use it in a way that cuts the through the inherent cheesiness of the idea (though I still can't stifle a chuckle every time it gets real intense) and turn it into an impressive cinematic tool the underscore the many important moments of the film. Give the soundtrack a listen; it is perhaps even more impressive when give a listen away from the film.If I was given one word and only one word to describe this movie, I would choose iconic. This is the sort of movie that deserves to be watched, to be passed down from generation to generation and held up as one of the hallmarks of great cinema. Watch and take in what has been honored for generations and has, like landmarks of many other sorts, affected the lives of many, including me, during that time."

Hey_Sweden,"Jul 14, 2020",9/10,"Top entertainment from the Master of Suspense, ""North by Northwest"" is one of Hitchs' finest thrillers. Cary Grant, in his final collaboration with Hitch, is aces as a Madison Avenue adman who, by sheer chance, is mistaken as a spy by nefarious types including a debonair James Mason and a creepy Martin Landau. He's also framed for murder, and therefore pursued by the cops, while trying to locate the elusive ""George Kaplan"" who can supposedly help extricate him from the mess. Grant also finds the time to fall in love with a classic elegant blonde Hitchcock leading lady in the form of Eva Marie Saint.Hitch was truly firing on all cylinders here. Assisted by another great score by Bernard Herrmann, his picture begins with typically stylish Saul Bass opening credits. The enticing script is by Ernest Lehman, and for once, it's the kind of scenario where things add up by the time the story finishes. Hitch wastes no time getting the story underway, with a standard little cameo by himself after the opening credits have concluded.Even at two hours and 17 minutes, ""North by Northwest"" never feels as long as it is, due to masterful filmmaking and that twist-laden story. It has the appeal of a scenario wherein an ordinary type of guy ends up way over his head in intrigue. Grant is often scrambling for his life, whether he's pursued by a plane ""crop dusting"", or hanging on by his fingernails from the faces of Mount Rushmore (two very iconic sequences).The cast is wonderful all the way down the line: Mason, Landau, Jessie Royce Landis (playing Grants' mother, despite being just a few years older than him), Leo G. Carroll, Adam Williams, Robert Ellenstein, Edward Platt, Edward Binns, etc. That great English character actor Carroll is a delight as the savvy ""Professor"" who will ultimately have to give Grant some pretty potent exposition. Grant is lots of fun, and Lehman gives him some pretty funny dialogue to savour. Grant also has fine chemistry with Saint, who does come off as aloof at first, but whose stiff-lipped exterior slowly eases.""North by Northwest"" is a tremendous diversion that continues to hold up well, 61 years later. It caps off the great run that Hitch had during the 1950s, with The Master choosing to follow it with one of his most enduring experiments, the legendary ""Psycho"".Nine out of 10."
FilmOtaku,"Aug 25, 2004",7/10,"`North by Northwest', written by Ernest Lehman and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, stars Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who finds himself embroiled in a particularly nasty case of mistaken identity. He finds himself being mistaken for a gentleman who is wrapped up in some dirty dealings with Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), his henchman Leonard (Martin Landau) and various other unsavory thugs under Vandamm's employ.  He also meets up with Hitchcock's requisite blonde femme fatale, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and surrounded by this cast of characters makes a cross-country adventure where his life is threatened several times; all the while with Thornhill having to depend on his wits to keep him alive.While `North by Northwest' is a good film, I don't consider it to be one of his best, which, at least in my small circle of rabid film friends/relatives, is fairly sacrilegious.  I enjoy the vibrancy of the script and the lush cinematography, but there are a couple of things that cause the film to fall short of excellence on my personal Hitchcock scale. Mainly, there's the matter of James Mason as the villain.  Mason is a great actor, and has been in some really good films, so his talents were wasted as the tepid Vandamm.  There simply really wasn't a part for him in the film; rather, most of the relatively `juicy' bits were relegated to Martin Landau. It seemed that the concentration was solely on Grant's character, which in most cases is adequate, but in a suspense film, I personally like to see the villain have a more pervasive presence.Of course, there are some masterful elements to this film.  The infamous cornfield scene is truly masterful.  It isn't even the shot of the crop duster chasing down Grant  the image that gets me every time is the very quick shot of Grant standing across the dusty road from the gentleman waiting for the bus.  As he is sizing him up, trying to figure out if he is the man that he has traveled a long distance to see, Hitchcock frames the shot much like a classic western.  There are many shots like this that, if frozen, would make a compelling photograph.  I can also acknowledge, while I am not as much a fan of Hitchcock's comedic moments as I am of the more dark or horrifying ones, that the comic timing with which Grant delivers his lines is excellent.  His charisma certainly adds a spark to the film, and there are times when he is so smooth that even if something was completely unbelievable I had to laugh and say, `Hey, it's Cary Grant  what do you expect?'`North by Northwest' was made in 1959 and is more akin to the whimsical and much-eschewed `The Trouble with Harry' than his more story-driven films of the 1940's and his horrifying masterpiece a year later, 1960's, `Psycho'. While I acknowledge that `North by Northwest' is a good film, it doesn't even make my personal `Hitchcock Top Ten' on which his darker films dwell. However, it's kind of the way I feel about the Coen Brothers  even a simply `good' film of theirs is usually much better than the average film, so a slightly above-average Hitchcock film like `North by Northwest' garners at least three stars from me.--Shelly"
scarlettmines,"Jul 27, 2005",9/10,"Masterpiece. Excellent. Brilliant. Film-making at its finest.None of these statements do 'North by Northwest' justice. It truly is indescribable. If anyone has ever doubted Alfred Hitchcock's ability then this is the film that should surely overshadow any of those opinions.Cary Grant plays the average man. But when he is mistaken for a spy his life spirals into an adventure that leads him to Mount Rushmore, crop fields and a beautiful woman (played ever so greatly by Eva Marie Saint).The story is captivating, exciting and is everything a great film should be. It has scenes and lines that have become classics in the world of film and the combination of Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock is unmissable.Ernest Lehmann has done an excellent job in writing the screenplay and this is by far one of his greatest achievements.Overall, this film is a must see for everyone. Even if thrillers are not your favourite, it still provides great entertainment for all. It is by no means overrated and it hasn't been surpassed by any films since it's release."
breezybrisbane,"Feb 18, 2006",6/10,"I've frankly come to expect better of the famous suspense director. After being told my whole life that this was a really good movie and it was so good and so on and so forth, it was a real disappointment. I would hardly call it a suspense movie, but maybe it was never supposed to be suspense. There is a lot more romance and talking than chasing bad guys.Like most films, however, its not without it's good points. Cary Grant is , as usual, quite dashing in the lead role, even though he is obviously aging by this point in time. It was fun to watch the crop duster sequence and Mount Rushmore scenes, which were every bit as exciting as I had hoped.So while this movie is not quite what I would call Hitchcock class, it is quite satisfactory as a Friday night Fun Flick, or to watch with older kids."
Himadri,"Jun 9, 1999",5/10,"The opening sequences are superb, but, for me, it all goes wrong after the scene in the UN lobby. Just when Hitch should have been tightening the screw, he inserts a scene where a committee of FBI agents reveal to us that they know our hero (Cary Grant) to be innocent. This robs much of what follows of any real tension. Just when the pace should be hotting up, Hitchcock slows things down with that long sequence on the train, which, surprisingly, lacks any sense of danger. As so often with Hitchcock in the 50s, he seemed more interested in glamour than with anything else. And glamour doesn't mix very easily with menace.The famous scene where Cary Grant is attacked by a plane is fine, but it isn't integrated with the rest of the plot. (If someone wanted to kill Cary Grant, why didn't they just hire a gunman instead of a plane?) The plotline is perfunctory: Cary Grant makes his way into the villain's house, and instantly discovers what one of the best FBI agents has failed to uncover in years. The scene at the auction and the final chase on Mount Rushmore are, once again, memorable. But overall, this film appears to confirm my view that while Hitchcock was superb with individual set pieces, he never gave much thought to the overall structure or pacing. Even at his best (e.g. ""The 39 Steps"" or ""Rear Window"") Hitchcock doesn't give an impression of having an artistic vision to impart, which makes his reputation as a great director rather puzzling. No doubt his admirers see more than I do."
bob the moo,"Jul 27, 2002",N/A,"Roger Thornhill is an advertising man.  However when he is kidnapped it is clear that he has been mistaken for someone else.  When he tries to find out what's going he is framed for murder and sets out on a cross country run to survive.  Along the way he meets danger, adventure and beauty in the shape of the mysterious Eve Kendall.  However when he finds the truth he is drawn towards a final showdown with the dangerous Vandamm.Rightly regarded as a classic and can more than compete with today's thrillers that too often rely on special effects to make up for the lack of genuine suspense.  Here the plot requires a great deal of faith, but it is brought off with such style and energy that it is totally absorbing.  The action is great and the several main scenes have become part of popular culture and are regularly spoofed on TV etc.  The romance works as well and Thornhill and Kendall exchange plenty of good scenes.The dialogue is great and the direction is faultless from Hitchcock.  Many thrillers run over 2 hours - but only the good ones can stand up to repeated viewings.  Northwest can take back to back viewings it is so good.  The plot may have been put together as shooting went (as was the case with at leastone key scene) but it all stands together well.  The acting is also perfect, Grant's rebirth as a thriller man is brilliant and is one of Hitchcock's best everyman characters.  Marie-Saint is yet another dangerous blonde but is very good. James `The Voice' Mason is excellent, while Landau adds great homosexual subtext to his character.  The ever present Leo G Carroll IS Mr Waverly but is still enjoyable and even support roles like Landis as Thornhill's mother is perfection!Over 40 years on this film has barely dated. Hearing the music is enough to make me want to see it again, while the direction, set pieces, dialogue and performances are all pitch perfect.  A wonderful thriller for young and old - no sex, no swearing, all thrills."
johnny-08,"May 30, 2008",8/10,"Today, when technology is getting advanced by every new day, movie scenes like the one on Mount Rushmore in ""North by Northwest"" looks very funny, but I must admit that this movie is great even from todays perception. One of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies has his favorite actor Cary Grant in it, blonde girl Eva Marie Saint and excellent actors like James Mason & Martin Landau. So to say long story short; I enjoyed in this movie and I'm 'only' 19 years old (this movie was made almost 50 years ago!!!). Why? Because of great scenes coming from genius Alfred Hitchcock, brilliant script that makes this movie a great thriller, with twists, good performances and some comedic parts (coming from Cary Grant and Jessie Royce Landis). So if you have opportunity, watch this movie cause it's a classic."
ryangilmer007,"May 18, 2000",8/10,"North By Northwest is classic Hitchcock and is a moive not to be missed.There are only a few minor mishaps--> I rank the movie a little lower than perhaps it deserves because the video version has some faded colors.  This may be fixed if re-released in a remastered version.  However, it may also be due to film deterioration (as color movies shot on one real of Kodak) rather than 3, fade over time).The other minor goofs are caused my the time period of the 1959 and the recent jumps is special effects technology.  The actors over blue screens are very obvious in parts.This mistakes cause this not to be a perfect movie, but it is still a classic.  There is great acting and a great story.  You should be engaged and intrigued, and always surprised and what will occur next.  It is also very non-predictable as nobody is safe at anytime, so basically anything can occur in the story.At the same time, the story flows easilly and logically from place to place. (unlike Hitchcock's earlier ""Secret Agent"" were locations are not fully explained, North by Northwest fully utilizes the locations and uses them to add to the story).Other little idosyncronsies further add to the story as art, airlines, the UN, Mt. Rushmore (plus the fact that 100 pines were planted on an MGM sound-lot to make it look like the surrounding ""Rushmore"" woods), and a reference to Shakespeare (the title) all add to the story.Originally known as ""The Man in Lincoln's Nose"", North By Northwest will not disappoint.However, don't miss the bus as Hitchcock makes his appearance before the appearance of Grant, whom the role was written for and whom shows valid reasons for why the James Bond producers wanting him for the James Bond role. (he did not get that role because he would only do 2 or 3 bond movies)Rating: 8Viewed: on tape"
chiragrathod09,"Jul 17, 2024",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is a masterclass in suspense and adventure, released in 1959. With its clever script, iconic performances, and thrilling visuals, the film has become a defining example of the espionage genre.The story follows Roger Thornhill, played by the charming Cary Grant, an advertising executive who becomes embroiled in a case of mistaken identity. After being pursued by ruthless agents, Thornhill finds himself on an escalating journey filled with danger and intrigue, traversing across some of America's most breathtaking landscapes.Hitchcock's direction is nothing short of brilliant, expertly balancing tension and humor throughout the film. The pacing is relentless, drawing audiences in and keeping them on the edge of their seats. The action sequences are expertly crafted, with the famous crop duster scene and the climactic confrontation on Mount Rushmore being standout moments that showcase Hitchcock's prowess as a filmmaker.The screenplay, written by Ernest Lehman, is sharp and wittily captures the paranoia and absurdity of Thornhill's situation.

Cluey,"Oct 24, 2008",10/10,"I bought this on a whim, after someone made a joke about a drawing I'd done (of a man running away from something in a field) striking of Hitchcocks famous scene. After watching it, I am ashamed that I didn't see this instant classic sooner.The film starts off and instantly you are hooked, the snappy dialogue (the brilliant Taxi skit), the comedy (pretty much any scene with Mrs Thornhill Sr) and the thrilling ambiguity and intrigue. The answers come in just the right places, so you're never wondering longer than is reasonable, apart from the scenes where Hitchcock has dragged it out to an amazing edge-of-seat effect.Another thing I loved, apart from the great writing, story and direction, were the characters, a compound of the above three. All the actors do a brilliant job of filling the characters shoes, and Cary Grant is nothing short of irresistibly charming and brash as the troubled hero. Most film-makers nowadays would portray the characters as psychological train wrecks given their circumstance, but they exhibit the cool and likable persona's (even Mr Van Damme is a charming villain) that are sadly missed in most modern films.In fact, a lot of things in this film are sadly missed from modern thrillers, the charm is irresistibly and I've no qualms about giving it a 10 and saying it's one of the coolest films I've ever seen."
jasanderson9090,"Oct 8, 2020",10/10,"North by Northwest is about an ordinary guy who is mistaken for an American spy. Cary Grant excels as Roger Thornhill and Eva Marie Saint is ravishing as the romantic interest. Originally written with Grace Kelly in mind, Alfred Hitchcock is at the top of his game from planting a McGuffin (a device in a movie to serve as the catalyst for the plot) to the side winding twists and turns that keeps the audience guessing and on the edge of their seat.
The visuals are equally as impressive from the crop dusting plane chasing Grant or the ending leading us on top of Mount Rushmore. James Mason and Martin Landau are fantastic as the villains and Hitchcock makes them very successful villains from the get go making them a steep task for the advertising Thornhill to overcome."
C22Man,"Jul 14, 2016",7/10,"North by Northwest is a personal favourite of mine. It is Hitchcock's most light and purely entertaining film, a smart change of pace after the darkly psychological 'Vertigo'. It takes his signature wrong man storyline and simply sees how much fun it can have with the idea. It makes the characters as charming as possible, the action grander than ever before, the locations exotic and the situations as exciting as you could want them to be. It's a film that succeeds in its aim magnificently, give the audience a thrilling adventure.It revolves around suave advertising executive Roger Thornhill who is kidnapped after being mistaken for 'George Kaplan' and interrogated before almost being killed by the shady Vandamm. Nobody believes Thornhill's story so he sets out to find Kaplan himself. However he has to go on the run when he's framed for murder, which draws him into a world of deceit, spies and simply trying to stay alive. This story is not only brilliantly entertaining, but it twists and turns all the time. You don't know who Thornhill can trust or what's waiting around the corner for him, making him a vulnerable hero. A good example being when he meets Eve Kendell, we don't know whether she's a kind stranger, a spy herself or working with the enemy. It is great at keeping you guessing like that.What always impresses me about the film is how it blends genres so easily. It is a thrilling adventure at heart of course. Yet there are smatterings of mystery, action, romance and comedy throughout. It leaps between all of these without any feeling out of place and without losing sight of the plot. Most of the characters actions drive the narrative forward in that sense, what we initially think is only loosely connected may end having a larger bearing. Almost everything that happens on screen has leads to something else. In fact the humour in the film is something that really stands out. The situations are dangerous yet they can also be wonderfully absurd and the film finds genuine laughs with the idea of a normal person being forced to risk his life in such a way.The performances are great all round. Cary Grant is delivers one of the most stylish performances of all time as Thornhill. He makes the character so debonair and charming, seemingly unfazed by the deadly situations he finds himself in, with a sharp wit and wisecracks at the ready. He's clearly enjoying himself and is a magnetic screen presence. Eva Marie Saint is effortlessly appealing as Kendell, probably the most humane of Hitchcock's icy blondes. James Mason is just wonderful as Vandamm. He's the perfect villain. Subtle, mysterious, cunning, strangely charismatic, all with a smooth voice and expressive features. The notable supporting performances come from Martin Landau as creepy heavy Leonard and Jessie Royce Landis as Thornhill's sardonic mother.The film is filled with memorable sequences and imagery. The romantic playfulness of the scenes aboard the train. The brilliant scene where Thornhill deliberately sabotages an auction. The truly spectacular climax that takes place atop Mount Rushmore. One of my favourite sequences in all of film is when Thornhill waits for 'Kaplan' on a stretch of road in the middle of nowhere. The way Hitchcock manages to build a sense of tension and isolation is simply masterfully. It also leads to the noteworthy crop duster sequence. This is how you do action. It might not seem like much, but we really do feel as if Thornhill's life is at risk and that gives it so much more impact than any fancy effects or choreography could.Hitchcock's direction is as good as ever. The camera-work is very fluid here, it moves gently around the screen at times, almost as if it's surveying the area. His staging of the action sequences and moments of important dialogue help immensely in giving the scenes the weight they need. This is also a handsome looking film. Everything from The hotel interiors to the train carriages to the UN building looks fantastic and is lit well. Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay and it is a brilliant one, full of witty dialogue that roles off the tongue exquisitely. Apparently he was attempting to write the ultimate Hitchcock thriller, I think it's fair to say that he succeeded in doing so. Bernard Herrmann's dynamic score, and its wonderful main theme, is just the icing on the cake.In many ways North by Northwest is like the prototype Bond film, except it's unrestrained by any formula and contains Hitchcock's trademark thrills. We have a dashing main character, the beautiful female for him to latch on to, a diabolical but charming villain, a surging plot and visually interesting locations. Of course the difference maker is Hitchcock himself. He has a plot and script that allow him to do what he does best to the most unrestricted level he's ever done. The thrills, the suspense, the action, the excitement, not to mention the subtle comedy and romance. It's all here and it's even grander than before. This is Hitchcock's exercise in escapist fun. It gives us pure thrills without any pretensions and I wouldn't change a thing about it."
larryssa-68-866888,"Jan 15, 2013",9/10,"Why can't we do that kind of movie anymore? ... a lot of tension, many humor, a little violence and great but simple story, a recipe we seem to have lost!There is a lot of Vertigo tension and some idea of the futur humoristic ton he will use in Marnie, but there is especially one great couple of actors. One of the best acting part for Cary Grant and the villain played by James Manson is actually a nicer guy than the introducing Thornhill. There both majestic and the little blond in the middle is both a woman and a girl, adjusting the tone perfectly. The characters are full of surprises and mysteries, they all played some double game ...in a game for freedom!The idea is basic -some twisted identities- but the shots and the tense music are still amazing! You can recognize Hithcock work everywhere: he spends as much work on the form and the background of his movie and this is a true lesson of Cinema.We still enjoy his movies at this point and this is quite a collection of master pieces!"
alan-467,"Dec 2, 2021",6/10,"Cary Grant plays his usual role as a suave, cheerful charmer, James Mason plays his usual role as suave but slightly menacing, Martin Landau plays his usual role of first lieutenant to the hero/villain (compare with his role as Rufio in Cleopatra), and Leo Carroll plays his usual role as spymaster, so don't come to this movie expecting to see much new, though this was the first time I had noticed Eva Marie Saint in a movie, and I was quite impressed (I did see Exodus, but don't remember her part in it).Without thinking about it, I can come up with at least 10 major plot holes, so it shouldn't be taken seriously - nevertheless, I found it to be constantly entertaining and the over two hours runtime seemed to flash by. Not a masterpiece, but, if you have a couple of hours to spare, you could do worse than watch this. 6.5 out of 10."
Zooha-47207,"Aug 16, 2025",10/10,"Now this is cinema. North by Northwest is, in my eyes, Hitchcock's masterpiece. The suspense, the twists, the sense of danger-it all works flawlessly. Cary Grant is charismatic and suave, the set pieces (like the crop-duster scene and Mount Rushmore climax) are unforgettable, and the pacing never lets up.It's a film that keeps you glued to your seat while also delivering incredible style. I'd even go as far as to say it's better than Dr. No, which says a lot. Truly one of the greatest movies I've ever seen."
Sethtro,"Jul 18, 2020",8/10,"Personal Rating: 7.5/10This movie is a fantastic good movie. Will it leave you thinking about it days on end, no. But my goodness will you enjoy the time your butt is in your seat watching this film.If Hitchcock can be used as an adjective I'd describe North by Northwest as one of the most Hitchcocky films he made. The imagination and talent behind each shot is suburb. This movie was shot during the wild west of movie making and Hitchcock used the camera in many outstanding and creative ways during this film.Cary Grant, my goodness, I couldn't tell if I was watching acting or if that was just him. Grant truly embodied his character and had fun with it, pulling the audience further into the compelling plot.Talking about the plot, this movie tells a story where if I was to describe any bit of it, it would spoil everything. So I'll just say that it felt fresh, new, and exciting. Even 60 years after this movie was released.Now my beef. The female protagonist isn't introduced until almost an hour into the movie. It felt as if this film had been holding in all the romantic commentary and substance-less conversation and just exploded as soon as the female character was introduced. Though a lot of it plays into the plot, boy was much unnecessary and dragged on for an eternity. Adding to the already too long run time of 136 minutes.Overall, a fantastic movie that keeps you quite engaged throughout the run-time. Cary Grant and Eva Saint playing their characters very nicely, and Alfred Hitchcock pulling out all the stops."
aqua_swing,"Mar 26, 2005",9/10,"Cary Grant never ceases to amaze me. Though I haven't seen a whole list of his movies (Only two: This and Charade), his wit and cool demeanor makes me realize that if I was a movie go-er in his time I'd pick him as the person I'd want to be like when I grew up. The movie's only downfall was that it seemed kind of on the long side, and once or twice I caught myself closing my eyes about 15 minutes from the end, but Grant's ability to keep me interested in this movie surpasses the idea that this was even a Hitchcock film. By the middle I'd completely forgotten, because the style seemed so different from all of Hitchcock's previous films I've seen (Psycho, Rope, Vertigo, et-al), and I was happy with the end result. A must see for fans of Bond movies, because this is the completely implausible way of telling the same kind of story."
claudio_carvalho,"Sep 4, 2004",10/10,"In a business lunch in a hotel in New York, the advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is wrongly identified as being the American spy George Kaplan by the foreigners' agents Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) and his right arm Leonard (Martin Landau). Roger is kidnapped and Vandamm's men try to simulate an accident for killing him. Roger escapes, but soon is accused of murdering a diplomat in the UN building. With the police and the foreigners' spies chasing him, Roger meets and has a crush on Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Later, he will be advised that George Kaplan indeed does not exist, and he agrees to act like a bait to rescue Eve from Phillip and his men.This movie is another masterpiece by Alfred Hitchcock. The story, full of comedy, action, thriller and romance, is delightful. Cary Grant is amazing in the role of Roger Thornhill and Eva Marie Saint is extremely beautiful and sexy.

jasonsurety,"May 3, 2004",8/10,"North by Northwest is a highly touted Alfred Hitchcock film.  Ranked among his classics such as Vertigo, Rear Window, and Notorious, N.b.N. is generally thought of as one of the suspense master's all-time greats.  It is an overall appealing film but is not on the same level as the aforementioned flicks.  There are terrific moments, but the film doesn't come together as well as these other Hitchcock thrillers.  The ending is not quite up to par, either.The movie deals with Roger Thornhill(Cary Grant) as a cool, witty advertising executive in Manhattan.  He is wrongly identified as an agent for the government by a crime organization.  He is setup and narrowly escapes his first brush with danger.  The police do not believe his story, and everyone, including Thornhill's own mother, thinks he is out of his mind.  From here, Grant goes on a wild ride to clear his name and find out what the hell is going on.This ride involves planes, trains and automobiles and he meets up with Eve Kendall(Eva Marie Saint) who is very forward with him, and we can tell right away that she's up to something.  Their conversation reminded me of a conversation Frank Sinatra has with Janet Leigh in The Manchurian Candidate. Unlike the latter, which can be seen as having several different meanings and subliminal messages, Grant and Saint have chemistry in their teasing, but it stays rather one dimensional and more formulaic.Scenes like the one where Grant intentionally gets arrested at an auction to escape a couple henchmen are comical and clever.  Even now with computers and high-tech special affect the cropduster and Mt. Rushmore scenes are exhilarating, to say the least.  The cinematography is wonderful throughout the picture, and except for the 50's automobiles and attire, looks remarkably fresh and modern.While Vertigo's ending was one of the most shocking, Rear Window's the most suspenseful, and Notorious' perfectly fitting, N.b.N.'s didn't thrill me quite the same.  Perhaps I am being overly critical because of my expectations.  The three Hitchcock movies I've compared to North by Northwest are all 10's in my book, while this one gets an 8.  I enjoyed watching it and recommend it to anyone, especially suspense/thriller or Hitchcock fans."
richardchatten,"Sep 1, 2022",10/10,"After a couple of financial disappointments Hitchcock triumphantly bounced back with which if not his greatest film film is certainly the most entertaining, and marks the apogee of a series of chase thrillers dating back at least to 'The 39 Steps', and also marks the culmination of The Master's journey from Britain to the United States and from black & white to Vistavision and Technicolor. That it didn't collect a single Oscar the year 'Ben-Her' won thirteen is yet another reason it's impossible to take the Oscars seriously.In an immaculate cast James Mason shines in what is effectively the first of his later career dominating the supporting cast, while Leo G. Carroll (who in his fifth film for Hitchcock, which makes it a record) effectively plays Mr Waverley in 'The Man from U. N. C. L. E.'"

Horror-yo,"Jun 28, 2016",6/10,"The main criticism one could have for this film is that in the midst of such action and secretive James Bond like intrigues, the viewer may very well at some point feel like the protagonist is just too naive and his adventures seem a bit too unlikely in that particular succession of events. The point of the film was obviously non-stop action, a genuine sense of entertainment throughout, and for the time very impressive visuals, as the ending scene is an absolute token of; and while the dialog is very good and in parts superb, and there is enough to keep the viewer's attention with the various characters, the stakes, the mystery, the action and very good performances given by Grant, Mason, Saint... the film still feels a bit 'far-fetched', like it really wants to go somewhere and stops at nothing to, even if it may've benefited from strengthening the 'how' to get there. Overall the plot is quite clever, and again it's very well executed and a fun ride, but it's fairly long and perhaps counts on the candor of its protagonist a bit too much, and slightly on the overcomplicated side of the action-crime spectrum."
adsmradford,"Jun 30, 2024",10/10,"A dazzling, glamorous thriller where Grants character is mistaken for a secret agent by a foreign power. Who then spend the rest of the film trying to eliminate him.The female interest is Yves Marie Saint, who never looked lovelier. But is she good or bad?James Mason plays the baddy with a great deal of sublety and underplayed malevolence.But what is so memorable about this film is the sophisticated direction and wonderful photography.The set pieces are cinematic history and it works so very well as a dark comedy thriller. Audiences must have been dazzled by this film in 1959.Grant is at his suave best and this must be one of his Top 5 films.Another Hitchcock triumph that is as fun to watch in now as it was in the late 1950s."
Boba_Fett1138,"Feb 4, 2005",10/10,"Just like ""Citizen Kane"", it's not exactly THE best movie ever made but still a very revolutionary and important one and above all, a real classic!I think that ""North by Northwest"" can be compared to an early James Bond movie and can be regarded as one of the most early 'modern' action movie. Some sequences are really spectacular and are shot and edited in the same way as most action movies are these days. Of course the crop duster sequence is a classic but I like the spectacular finale on Mt. Rushmore even better.The music by Bernard Hermann, is just as Hitchcock's directing ahead of its time. There also is some lovely cinematography by yet again Robert Burks.The story is really exciting and it has all the elements that makes a movie a spectacular adventure to watch. Is there anything wrong with this movie? In my opinion not. The movie certainly isn't the most exciting or thrilling Hitchcock movie but it might very well be the most entertaining one also thanks to some well scripted humor.Also look out for a young Martin Landau as the henchman Leonard.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
PaulusLoZebra,"Jul 3, 2023",10/10,"I don't think that Hitchcock's North by Northwest is the best film ever made; even among those I've ranked 10 there is a hierarchy. But it is the film I have watched most often in my life. I love this movie, and every time I watch I feel happy. Why ? Is it Cary Grant's playful, commanding performance ? The intricate, preposterous plot ? The geometry and precison of its many memorable distance shots? The great musical score ? The fact that Hitch makes us complicit with the hero right from the start, so that we are rooting for him unconditionally ? The sexual innuendos ? The mixture of advenhture, action, comedy, and romance ? Even Hitch's repeated use of process shots, like in most of his films, does not diminish my engagement with this movie. But I do not know why I love it so much."
BeoBaxter91,"Jun 21, 2022",9/10,"I always say Hitchcock mostly made two different kinds of films. Hitchcock had masterpieces of horror and suspense (Psycho, Rear Window, etc.), but he also had a run of more conventional thrillers with less artistic suspense and ""big swings"" in unique directions. Torn Curtain, The Man Who Knew Too Much, etc. Of these, I believe North by Northwest is the best of the bunch.While a more conventionally told, presented, and depicted story -- linear, conventional love interest, conventional twists and turns in just the right places, big location shifts, and tentpole scenes, etc. -- this is just a cracking thriller up there with the best of the breed in any era. It's marvelously cast and acted, and a truly fun watch. There's a reason it's so beloved, and it's all on display here, as is the obvious influence it had on later films, similarly beloved.I like the lightness in the film, most of all. It adds something tonally you don't always get (even in similar Hitchcock films like The Man Who Knew Too Much). For this I credit Cary Grant, who brings all of his charm and then some, and knows exactly how to deploy it for this story.Martin Landau and Hitchcock's decision to play that character as gay and in love with his partner has very little effect on story, but adds another layer that is just exceptional in the film, that makes the world feel real. Kudos for that decision, as well."
Seraphion,"Jun 30, 2014",6/10,"The story's basic premise is quite nice, especially for the era of the 1960s. It has since seen many other movie productions using the similar basic premise of ordinary people being mistaken as spies. The screenplay development isn't really that good, though, considering there's too much talk compared to significant spies work or fugitive hunting or avoiding capture, which what the movie is perceived to be offering. The technical things rather annoy me, like there is a strange and imbalanced lighting all over the movie, and the user of too much backdrop for background video. Yes those are maybe tolerable for those era, but for the later times like such as now, they seem quite stupid. The acting is quite nice, the actors try their best not too overact the scenes, yet they still do in a greater part of the movie."
eva3si0n,"Apr 28, 2022",9/10,"North by Northwest is one of the first spy thrillers. North by Northwest is the protector of the genre, appeared before the first part about agent 007. The whole film is built on nervous suspense, which is difficult to see in modern films of the genre. The disadvantages include only a long chronometer, due to which the dynamics of the narrative in the second half of the film subsides and the fact that the film was shot mainly in pavilions, and not in wildlife."
SecretaryBabe,"Sep 24, 2004",6/10,"North By Northwest -On watching this movie as a sixteen year old, I was thrilled at the scope of the chase unfolding before my eyes. When I watch it again last night, I wasn't as impressed due to paying more attention to the corny exchanges between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. The crop duster episode still seemed the most enthralling sequence of the film; not only as a result of masterful suspense, but also because there's no opportunity for cringeworthy innuendo.A few films from the 1950s, such as this one and Anatomy of a Murder, had daring scripts, but now seem too forced. If a man used Thornhill's lines on a night out in this day and age, he'd be shunned and laughed at no matter how handsome he is.SB"
jmcgarmott,"May 20, 2003",3/10,"I simply don't. Perhaps someone will explain to me how did this film get to #20 in the top 250 films list, because I can't see why. I'm not complaining that the film is dated (1959 ... nope, no problems with that) or that the film is full of plotholes (only a newspaper film critic will complain about that), but I can't see how the film is interesting. I take it that Cary Grant is playing an unrealistic character, someone who's ordinary but thrown into extraordinary situations, but still doesn't flinch when a crop-duster comes after him or when he's escorted out by strangers with guns. Fine - but where's the charm? Where's the suaveness? Where's the style? I don't feel it. In fact, it came across as VERY fake. I don't see Roger Thornhill - all I see is Cary Grant. I can't understand why the cropduster scene is so memorable - is it because it's the first time there was a movie with a man being chased by a plane in it? I take it that the Mt Rushmore scene is memorable because it's the first time it's been done and no other film has really gone to do it again, but didn't think that was outrageously original (not saying it's not a creative idea, just don't get the hype). Eva Marie Saint is pretty and plays the complicated Eve subtly well. But I don't see Hitchcock's 'master' direction - I can't see what's so unique ... or ... or incredible about it. Can somebody point the way, cause I don't think age has anything to do with this (I'm an 18 year-old movie geek)."
funkyfry,"Oct 28, 2002",8/10,"Somewhat overblown suspense thriller has exciting plot twists and Cary Grant's unique screen presence to recommend it.  Well directed, tells the story of an advertising man mistaken for a decoy created by the CIA, who is hunted across the nation and ends up falling for the CIA's undercover agent -- Marie-Saint.  The ""Open paranoia"" scene in the cropdusting field is a great sequence.  Here Hitchcock succeeds often in not being obvious, remaining playful, and pleasing the audience a lot.I must respond to the comments I read on here by user ""tedg"" -- I did not find them illuminating.  On the contrary, they seem to be the products of a confused mind, and someone who has not paid much attention to what he's saying before putting it in print.  First of all, as to his complaint about the quality of the sets, they are not as he claims ""junk"" but actually well-made sets.  I'd like to see him, or anybody, given a lot of money create a duplication of the monument in question that would look better -- it just can't be done, because the monument itself is made of stone and took decades and millions of dollars to make.Also, ""tedg"" comments on the character played by Marie-Saint (hardly my favorite actress) -- he notes that she plays a ""prostitute"" who is turned patriotic, but he doesn't seem to have been paying enough attention to the film to notice that in the end it is revealed that she is an undercover CIA agent, and not a prostitute at all.Users like this should definately not turn off their vcrs before the end of a movie if they're going to try to post thoughtful comments on it."
Stampsfightclub,"Oct 29, 2008",9/10,"Roger Thornhill (Grant) is mistaken for another man by a group of foreign spies and after a few unfortunate events, finds himself on the run.North by Northwest is recognized as one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest films and with the adrenaline soaked narrative and a great central performance it is easy to see why.Cary Grant (Charade) delivers a sensational portrayal of advertising executive Roger Thornhill, a simple man who is mistaken for someone else. Thornhill is wonderfully sarcastic, very charismatic and plaudits must go to Grant who has created an original hero, an ordinary man who turns himself into an action hero within a short space of time in Alfred Hitchcock's wonderfully realistic world.Hitchcock's action styled direction is picture perfect for this fast moving thriller. The British director cements the realism down to the ground with his cutting edge close shots and the fast sweeping direction, most noticeable in the landmark plane scene in the fields.It is easy to overdo action in modern day films and Hitchcock has expertly managed to balance the action alongside the everyday events of the protagonists.This film is close to resembling a Bond styled genre, though obviously was made before Bond films were. The cocky yet sophisticated Thornhill is well directed by Hitchcock to create the ultimate action hero in a sharply written narrative that is more realistic and entertaining than the Bond spy genre.The reason this 1959 thriller works is down to all the genres it covers. Through Hitchcock's action and realistic direction, viewers are thrust into action sequences, romantic moments and crime sequences to, providing viewers with the ultimate adventure. Covering different genres is not a stroll in the park as recent films show and can be appreciated here with Hitchcock's wonderful balance.The balance of the action and romantic genres works well with the whole mystery concept of what is happening to the central character.The settings are well executed and further add to the intensity of the plot, particularly the field and the climax on Mount Rushmore.North by Northwest is a top notch action thriller, made so by Hitchcock's direction, great writing and a fine central character."
gab-14712,"Oct 6, 2018",9/10,"Over the course of his career, Alfred Hitchcock has made many highly-regarded works and every film of his was treated like an event. After a very successful decade of the 1950's which includes famed works such as Rear Window and Vertigo, Hitchcock closes out the decade with perhaps his greatest work, 1959's North by Northwest. After the dark erotic film that was Vertigo, Hitchcock decided to make something more fun, action/adventure-oriented, and something light-hearted in general. This film is essentially the first James Bond film, even though the first James Bond film would be produced several years later. This is an incredibly tense and suspenseful spy thriller that boasts two of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history-the crop duster scene and the dramatic rescue upon the rocks of Mount Rushmore. This film has lots of incredible talent working on camera and behind the scenes. In addition to Hitchcock, we have great acting from the likes of Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. The film was written by one of the greatest screenwriters of the era, Ernest Lehman. The film has a distinctive look because of Robert Burks's camerawork and texture is given to the sound of the movie because of the eerie score of Bernard Hermann's.This movie is a tense spy thriller, a screwball romantic comedy, and a tale about the Cold War/paranoia/government spying all in one movie. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a successful Manhattan advertising agent who is abducted by two strange men at the Plaza Hotel. Thornhill is taken to the mansion of a foreign spy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) where he is believed to be an undercover federal agent named George Kaplan. Thornhill denies it, and he is forced to drink bourbon and to ride in a car down a twisted, winding road. He escapes the planned execution, and the police refuses to believe his story. He eventually gets framed for murder and now is on the run. He takes a cross-country train to make his escape where he runs into the mysterious, cold femme fatale, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). It is unclear at first why she wants to aid him, but we later learn she may be more than meets the eye. From the train, we then head to those famous scenes involving the murderous crop duster airplane in the cornfields of Illinois and the harrowing escape from Mt. Rushmore.The acting is very good, but that really should not be a surprise given the names of the cast. To this point, Cary Grant had a very long career. This might be his best performance. The contributions he added to the film is wonderful. Eva Marie Saint, who made an impression acting opposite of Marlon Brando in 1954's On the Waterfront, adds elegance and class to the role of Eve Kendall. James Mason plays a convincing villain and he does seem like the prototypical James Bond villain. His henchman, Leonard is played by the wonderful Martin Landau. Landau would go on to have a wonderful late-age career, but let's not forget that he was in an Alfred Hitchcock film.There are so many Alfred Hitchcock films to choose from when it comes to naming his best film, but I can say without a doubt that North by Northwest is his most entertaining film. In addition to making the spy genre more accessible to the audience, Hitchcock and Lehman added a little bit of everything. We have quirky and funny dialogue, great action/chase scenes, and some lovely romance. Also, I really need to discuss the crop duster scene. That scene was made so well, and my heart wanted to explode because of how tense that scene was. I felt scared for Cary Grant's character. I am quite amazed at the technical achievement that went to making that scene, and even by today's standards. Are there themes/motifs behind the film? Both Hitchcock and Lehman said no. However, given the time of the film's release, there are some central ideas regarding Cold War paranoia and government spying. If you like James Bond films, you have this movie to thank. Come for the (multiple) twists, stay to see an entertaining spy thriller.My Grade: A"
deleyshaun,"Oct 30, 2024",6/10,"North by Northwest blends a spy thriller ( with his trademark wrong identity) with romance, comedy and adventure. This film was important as it proved that Hitchcock was not only a master of suspense but a master full stop. We also need to remember that this film was prior to James Bond. Where it doesn't reach the heights of his best is I didn't feel an intensity/ fear for the protagonist unlike in say Notorious or Rear Window. It's lighter here- which is fine but I think Hitchcock was at his best when there was a darker/ sinister tone. Having said that there are some great iconic scenes and it is pretty enjoyable and well directed. All the players are great here- Grant , Marie- Saint ( who is lovely and is still alive) , Mason and Landau. A good time for sure but not in the top 15 Hitchcock arsenal."
pastorjury,"Jul 16, 2022",10/10,"Anyone interested in being a part of the film industry should begin by watching North by Northwest. From the cinematography to the acting to the directing, every part of this movie is what film should be. I recommend this movie to all my friends and family."
tomfarrell2004,"Feb 26, 2022",6/10,"The whole premise for this movie is pretty ridiculous. The actions of Cary Grant's character are in inane. If this Mr. Thornhill was a high ranking executive with a top advertising firm, they must have had some really stupid employees in the rest of the company. He comes off as a bumbling, sarcastic fool. This movie should have rated as a comedy."
Snow Leopard,"Sep 21, 2001",N/A,"With everything you expect from Hitchcock and more, ""North By Northwest"" is terrific entertainment from the master.  There are interesting characters, an exciting story with intrigue and suspense, lots of fine photography, and some of Hitchcock's best-known set pieces.  It's capped off by a fine Bernard Herrmann score that is almost as good as the one he wrote later for ""Psycho"".Cary Grant may be the ideal Hitchcock actor, and he is a big part of making this such great fun.  As one of the man-on-the-run characters that Hitchcock loved to make movies about, Grant is entertaining and believable, maintaining good humor even as he tries to work his way out of a series of desperate situations.  The other stars, James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, also are very good, and the supporting roles are all filled by good character actors.The story is one of Hitchcock's most exciting.  It's slightly longer than usual, and it occasionally stretches credibility, but it all goes by quickly because there is always something interesting going on, and there is also plenty to look at.  Whether using the famous landmarks or using more everyday settings, there is always lots of good detail, and the settings complement the story nicely.  At times the plot becomes somewhat fanciful, but probably deliberately so, for it only emphasizes Hitchcock's mastery of technique that he can have his characters do almost anything and make you believe it at the time.With everything that characterizes Hitchcock at his very best, this fully deserves its reputation as one of the finest films by him or any other director.  You can watch it several times and still find it just as entertaining."
bkoganbing,"Sep 1, 2006",10/10,"Following up on his two previous masterpieces, The Thirty Nine Steps and Saboteur; Alfred Hitchcock put together his ultimate chase film with elements of both coming into Ernest Lehman's screenplay. I've seen figures that show in terms of box office and later video sales and rentals, North By Northwest was Hitchcock's most successful film financially.At this point Alfred Hitchcock's name over the title could sell a movie, but I'm sure he didn't mind having Cary Grant in it to draw the movie going public. This was Cary's fourth and final appearance in a Hitchcock film and I think it is his best performance in one.Like in the two films I cited, Cary is innocently caught up in a web of intrigue and he got there by just answering a telephone page at a hotel dining room. He took a call right after someone paged a George Kaplan and the bad guys think he's Kaplan. And he gets grabbed.It's a devilishly difficult situation for him because there ain't no George Kaplan. He's a fictitious guy who was invented by one of our spy agencies (that's never identified in the story)to take the heat off an agent very close to masterspy James Mason. Mason tries to murder Grant by getting him drunk and putting him behind the wheel of a car. Later on Grant gets framed for murder while trying to find out what's going on and he's on the run from New York to Chicago to Rapid City and the Mount Rushmore monument.James Mason plays the cultured villain Philip Van Dam. Mr. Mason who had some of the most precise diction heard this side of Ronald Colman on screen, could play villain and hero and a lot in between equally well. Among other things he's a bi-sexual and his henchman/boyfriend Martin Landau is jealous of his involvement with Eva Marie Saint. With the Code still firmly in place, it was quite daring for Mason to refer to Landau's suspicions as his 'woman's intuition.Eva Marie Saint joins the list of cool and fiery blonds Hitchcock was so partial to for his films. I'm surprised he never used Eva Marie again, she seemed the perfect successor for Grace Kelly who if she hadn't become a princess would have been playing this part for sure.Bernard Herrman who wrote the acclaimed score for Hitchcock's Vertigo followed that up with an equally good score. Especially during the moments of Grant's tangle with a crop duster plane and the chase across the Mount Rushmore Monument, Herrman made great use of music to help the audience feel the tension. It's a great instrumental piece, violins that seem to pound with a drum counterpoint. The best kind of film music.And why wouldn't it be because North By Northwest is some of the best kind of film making."
preppy-3,"Apr 2, 2005",10/10,"Businessman Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistakenly thought to be a Federal agent. He is kidnapped by an evil man (James Mason). They soon realize they've captured the wrong man and try to have him killed. But it doesn't work and Thornhill finds himself a hunted man...OK--this is not perfect. There's some lousy back projection (but all Hitchcock films have that) and I was never really sure WHAT the bad guys were doing (something to do with microfilm). Also I've never believed Grant's actions when someone is killed in front of him (WHY did he grab the knife?). But the film is so incredibly entertaining no one has ever cared. This has some of Hitchcock's most famous scenes--the infamous ""crop dusting"" sequence and the climax on top of Mount Rushmore--but the whole film is just as good. There's a tense auction sequence and Grant's harrowing car ride down a treacherous road while dead drunk.There are some amusing parts in the film: Grant's mother appears to be a few years YOUNGER than him; the main villains last name is Vandamm; the romantic sparring between Grant and Eva Marie Saint is full of sexual innuendo; Martin Landau (one of Vandamm's henchman) is gay (he says he has a woman's intuition and has slightly exaggerated mannerisms--but it's not offensively done) and get a load of Vandamms mountain house at the end! Grant appears a bit old for this but he pulls it off; Eva Marie Saint is incredibly beautiful and pretty good as the love interest (sort of); Martin Landau is so young and handsome with blazing blue eyes and James Mason is just perfect as the evil Vandamm--his lines seem to come so effortlessly and he's so suave...but you also see the cruelty hiding underneath. Probably one of the best Hitchcock villains ever.So--excellent script with incredible dialogue; rich, bright Technicolor; shot in VistaVision (a wide screen process); great score and Hitchcock's always great direction with several astounding camera shots. Never boring--even at 136 minutes. A true classic. Don't miss this one! I give it a 10.""That's funny. That plane is dusting crops where there ain't no crops."""
AuroraLaude,"Jun 23, 2021",10/10,"This classic Hollywood thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat and only gets more intense as the story builds to its climax. One of Hitchcock's best films, produced from an outstanding screenplay written by Ernest Lehman, with a great cast, including outstanding performances by Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant. Saint is particularly brilliant paired against villains well-played by James Mason and Martin Landau. You will need to pay attention, as this film is not for the distracted viewer and doesn't beat you over the head with today's on-the-nose dialogue to keep the viewer abreast of the story."
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"May 3, 2008",9/10,"There's something so timeless about ""North by Northwest"" and it's not necessarily that it will echo with any generation. Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill, for example, feels a little foreign among today's thriller protagonists (accent aside) as a 50-year-old everyday man thrown into a mess of a government situation. The action is certainly not big- budget like modern films either with the exception of one explosion. The ""it"" that ""Northwest"" has is something more unique and a lot of it stems from great thriller writing and of course the direction of Sir Alfred Hitchcock.""Northwest"" follows the story of how Thornhill is taken against his will and accused of being a man named George Kaplan. These men try and kill Thornhill and have concocted elaborate cover-ups, to the point that Thornhill has no choice but to do whatever he must to prove his innocence, which actually leads him deeper into the mystery of George Kaplan. The writing of Ernest Lehman is absolutely terrific and it seems a shame that Hitchcock never collaborated with him again. The dialogue is not only very pointed and helpful to the plot, but also the plot movement with its twists and turns and clever way of revealing information to the viewer is simply classic Cold War spy thriller stuff, the skeletal structure that would later become synonymous with someone by the name of James Bond, despite ""North by Northwest"" predating Bond by three years.Although Roger Thornhill has nothing on James Bond, ""North by Northwest"" gets to boast Hitchcock's signature directing. No one seems to choose better moments to employ certain shot techniques than Hitchcock. He knows how to turn the best parts of the film into highly memorable and often times unforgettable scenes. The crop-duster attack is easily one of the greatest scenes in thriller movie history, specifically the shot where he's running as the plane gets larger and closer in the background. The difference between Hitchcock and the rest when it comes to a cross-country thriller like this is largely editing and length of takes. Hitchcock creates intensity by letting things build, like lengthy takes of the cars driving down the highway or the plane circling around to make another pass.From Thornhill's drunken escape to the cropduster sequence to a finale on Mount Rushmore, so much of ""North by Northwest"" remains unique, even to this day, even after all the Bond movies modeled after it and despite archetypes like Eva Marie Saint's femme fatale character. It has a certain inventiveness (and a certain director) that will always allow it to stand out.~Steven CThanks for reading!

steiner-sam,"Jun 1, 2021",6/10,"""North by Northwest"" involves mistaken identity, foreign agents, a shadowy USA intelligence agency, and some famous iconic scenes.The plot is convoluted, and the viewer must suspend logical beliefs at a number of places.The main characters: Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), and Philip Vandamm (James Mason) play their roles in the manner of a James Bond movie, with a wink and a nod at times.The two most iconic scenes are first, Cary Grant being chased by a crop-duster plane in the flat plains of Illinois, and secondly, at the end Grant and Saint being chased by the bad guys around and through the Mount Rushmore presidential monuments.""North by Northwest"" is called a thriller, but like a James Bond film, you know it's going to turn out right, and the boy will get the girl by the conclusion.Entertaining but not thought-provoking."
Kysugo,"Mar 18, 2024",9/10,"North by Northwest is a funny, compelling and enjoyable ride definitely worth taking. Hitchcock always knows how to reel in an audience with his intros. The bombastic symphonic soundtrack mixed with the graphics and the shots of hustling bustling New York get you ready. Another beautifully filmed film by Hitchcock. Again Hitchcock uses some fantastic filming locations. Some of which are interiors that feel quite cozy. That was cool how they filmed on location at Mount Rushmore. The architecture and design of that big house by the monument was gorgeous. The dialogue is compelling, clever and funny - very well written material right here. I would even say it's what drives the movie forward. The performances as well, especially by Grant, also propel the movie forward.Cary Grant talking to his mother on the phone at the police station while drunk was pretty damn funny. ""No they didn't give me a chaser!"", was a good one. The delivery of lines from Cary in this movie is just perfection. The line ""Naughty, wicked, up to no good, you ever kill anyone?"" got me, I laughed way too hard. Cary's on his A-game in this movie. Both hilarious and charming. There's a lot of quotable and memorable lines in this movie. The blonde girl, Eve, is something else. She has an alluring seductive charm to her as all Hitchcock female leads do. Hitchcock has this incredible way of filming romantic kissing scenes that always come off steamy and sensual. The chemistry between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint (Eve Kendall) is fantastic.I thought this movie was going to be a bit more on the serious side but I was pleasantly surprised with how comedic and lighthearted it took itself. I actually really enjoyed it. The build up to the crop field chase scene was done so well. The use of wide shots to show the arid lifeless Indiana fields. I always love how Hitchcock can subvert expectations. Like I wasn't expecting the airplane to collide into the tanker, that was crazy. I was laughing because it was so out nowhere. The idea popped into my head for a brief second but I didn't think it would actually happen. Hitchcock has a very cheeky sense of humor too and you see it in the way he makes a brief cameo in his movies. I love Hitchcock.It's quite the interesting and clever case of mistaken identity. It's quite amazing how he gets roped into something that's way bigger than him unintentionally and by accident and goes on this grand espionage/man on the run journey. It's almost like this is Hitchcock's way of fulfilling his fantasy of becoming a spy in real life and it plays out sort of like a daydream that someone has at work. I wonder if 'Richie Rich' got the idea of climbing down the monument from this movie. The sexual innuendos in this movie are great. Namely the ending with Thornhill pulling Eve up to the bed and then the camera cutting to the train going high speed into the tunnel lol. Overall, fantastic film. Another great addition to Hitchcock's collection. I highly highly recommend watching it."
namashi_1,"Nov 9, 2013",7/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's Much-Loved Classic 'North by Northwest' is An Exciting Spy-Thriller that holds tremendous appeal even after decades since its release. Hitchcock's Marvelous Direction, coupled with A Tight Screenplay & Impressive Performances, make this flick worth watching.'North by Northwest' Synopsis: A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies, and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive.The only glitch in an other-wise super film, is its lethargic pacing in the latter-hour. While the first-hour keeps you at the edge of your seat, the second-hour gets slow & slightly dull. The climax is well-done, but a sharper & faster second-hour was needed.Ernest Lehman's Screenplay is suspenseful & exciting. Hitchcock's Marvelous Treatment makes 'North by Northwest' so memorable. Cinematography & Art Design are good. Editing isn't sharp enough. Background Score is enchanting.Performance-Wise: Cary Grant is exceptional. He plays the man on the run with a sense of paranoia, which makes his performance unforgettable in many ways. Eva Marie Saint is highly efficient. James Mason is hatable all through. Jessie Royce Landis adds humor & grace to the proceedings with her flawless performance. Leo G. Carroll is effective, while Martin Landau is subtle but evil.On the whole, 'North by Northwest' isn't flawless, but worth watching nevertheless."
WritnGuy-2,"Jun 25, 2000",N/A,"I am a huge Hitchcock fan, and compared to some of his others including the mind-numblingly dull ""Suspicion"" or the messy ""Rebecca,"" this one shines, along with ""Psycho"" as one of his best films.Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, a New York businessman who is suddenly thrust into a conspiracy that plots him as a killer. With no one to trust, and no one who believes him, he goes on the run, fleeing deeper and deeper into the mystery and the peril. On a train to Chicago one night, he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a steely blonde who he becomes involved with both romantically and in this plot against him. The lives of the two intertwine continuously through the rest of the chase, where the characters and plot twist like a winding mountain road, which is a perfect analogy for this movie, which climaxes on Mt. Rushmore, in one of the most gripping, suspenseful climaxes Hitch has ever directed.This truly is a great movie, in all ways. The music is appropriate and extremely well-fitting, and is in second to the theme of ""Psycho"" as the best music in a Hitchcock film. The acting is totally on par, especially by the two stars. The chemistry between the two of them on the train is perfect, and adds to the list of memorable pieces of this movie, along with the famous cropduster scene (which had me cringing in fear) and that gripping, edge-of-your-seat, breathtaking climax on Mt. Rushmore. Hitchcock has never directed a climax as good as that. This is his best, second being the gasp-inducing climax to ""Psycho."" I loved the way the character of Eve Kendall changed so many times, and twisted and turned. At first she appears to just be that girl that will end up by Thornhill's side the whole movie, then she becomes the double-crossing spy, but then she double-crosses the enemies, and we realize so much more about her, that she becomes the most versatile character in the film, played to honest perfection by Eva Marie Saint. And also to mention was the very creepy-looking Martin Landau in a smaller role as one of the spies. Just the look in his eye made him a great antagonist.This really is a great movie, and as I said, one of Hitchcock's best. Hitch really came a long way from his minimal British productions, all of which seemed to look and feel the same. This is definitely one of the best chase movies around, and has remained as powerful as it was when it first came out."
FlickJunkie-2,"Apr 21, 2001",9/10,"This is acclaimed by many as one of Hitchcock's best films, but it is also known as one of his biggest blunders.  It is generally agreed that `The Master of Suspense' stumbled badly by revealing the identity of George Kaplan early in the film, in the scene where the CIA members discuss what to do about Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant).Thornhill is a heady advertising executive who is abducted at gunpoint and taken to a man named Vandamm (James Mason) who asks him cryptic questions and keeps calling him George Kaplan.  Thornhill responds that he doesn't know George Kaplan and that they are confusing him with someone else. Through this entire sequence, we are never sure whether he is Thornhill or Kaplan.  The film would have been far more intriguing if this were left a mystery until the end, rather than having it cleared up twenty minutes into the plot.It is thought that Hitchcock believed that the introduction of Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) would replace one mystery with an even better one. However, Eve's motivations are too transparent and even of the dullest of viewers can discern that their meeting on the train is no chance encounter. Eve is far too forward and obvious, especially for the 1950's.  It is hard to believe there is anyone who wouldn't be a tad suspicious at her behavior. Though we are left with more than a few questions about Eve after the love scene, imagine how wonderfully confused we would have been if Kaplan's identity weren't revealed so early in the film.  We would know only what Thornhill knew about why he was being pursued and seduced, which is next to nothing.Despite these flaws, the film is still intriguing, with a number of unpredictable twists.  The second half of the film is much tighter, and the chase scene on the face of Mount Rushmore is one the classic suspense scenes in the history of film.  Hitchcock tried to get permission to shoot the scene on the real Rushmore, but he was refused.  Not to be deterred, he had his own Mount Rushmore set built that was indistinguishable from the original earning an Oscar nomination for set decoration.The acting is excellent.  Cary Grant is at his debonair best as the acerbic ad executive who is beguiled by Eve's beauty and charm.  Eva Marie Saint is best known for her movie debut as Edie in `On The Waterfront', but she is every bit as good in this film.  Hers is a very complex character, duplicitous and devious, yet vulnerable and torn, and she handles it with facility.  James Mason is enigmatic and elusive as VanDamm and a youthful Martin Landau does a nice job as VanDamm's tough lieutenant.I enjoyed this film, but I don't believe it attains the level of excellence of Hitchcock's other renowned films (`Psycho', `Vertigo' and `Rear Window'). I rated it 9/10 with a point deducted for blowing the Kaplan question. Even so, a bad day for Hitchcock is like the best day for most directors."
diogo-34856,"Jan 13, 2024",10/10,"It had to be Alfred Hitchcook, one of the best directors of all time. I simply loved this film, I think it was all very well constructed and the story is very good. The chase scenes are very good, considering the year the film was released (1959) and the suspense scenes too, it's no wonder that people call Hitchcook the ""Master of Suspense"". The soundtrack is also very good and is a good accompaniment, as are the performances, which I think are some of the best of their time. I wanted to highlight Alfred's genius, because not just anyone can make a film like this, and also because of the uncertainty that the film transmits to the viewer, who never knows what will happen next. The conclusion I can draw is that I loved this film and that it is without a doubt one of the best ever, and, in my opinion, Alfred Hitchcook's best film."
utgard14,"Jul 14, 2015",10/10,"Allow me to add my voice to the overwhelming praise for this classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller; one of the legendary director's best. Cary Grant stars (in the last of four collaborations with Hitchcock) as an advertising executive mistaken for a spy and chased cross-country by foreign agents, as well as the police. What follows is one classic scene after another, including the famous scene where Grant is chased by a crop duster. James Mason and Martin Landau make excellent villains. Eva Marie Saint is the sexy double agent who shares some sizzling scenes with Cary. The two had palpable chemistry. Healthy doses of comedy help make this such an enjoyable watch. A great cast, a rousing score by Bernard Herrmann, and flawless pacing by Hitch are among the many elements that make this one of the most fun and exciting movies ever made."
aradford57,"Oct 28, 2022",9/10,"Everything that needs to be said has been said about this clever, romantic and thrilling film.Twists and turns abound kept beautifully in check by Hitchcock's direction. Acting from the leads is top draw, Grant, Saint & Mason are all superb.Grant a sauve advertising agent is thrust into a world of espionage due to mistaken identity. Yves Marie Saint soon turns up as a beautiful & enigmatic femme fatale. And the baddy behind all the shenanigans is James Mason who could personify malevolence and evil in the mere tone and volume of his voice.Audiences in the late 1950s must have thought this cinematic heaven. It still is."
esteban1747,"Mar 26, 2005",7/10,"Cary Grant was certainly an excellent actor, he was able to lead some thrillers without loosing his acting humor, and ""North by Northwest"" is an example. Interesting that the film starts with the presence of the director Hitchcock in its first scene. Then Cary Grant became for unknown reasons a man (spy) called Kaplan, he was kidnapped at the restaurant and brought to a big house where the punishment was to get him drunk with whiskey and then left driving a car in the evening. I have no intention to give the whole story of the plot, but you may guess that after these first scenes the rest was very much complicated and if you leave the screen you risk to loose the coherence of the film and not to understand all tricky reasons given by Hitchcock. Grant had a good partner in then beautiful Eva Marie Saint, and to a lesser extent from experienced James Mason. If you wish to see an interesting film, I advise you to see this one, another Hitchcock's jewel."
ender_wiggen,"Mar 26, 2009",4/10,"Now, I like Alfred Hitchcock as much as the next fellow but I can't for the life of me, figure out why this is such a tremendous success and so highly rated. This movie does not make a lick of sense and every bit is so contrived and unrealistic that I was constantly taken out of the film. For example, Cary Grant is in the middle of a dirt road near some crops when out of nowhere a crop duster appears and tries to fly over him and kill him. This is a classic scene but makes little to no sense. Wouldn't it have been easier to run him over with a car or something?Another scene where he meets the heroin is simply laughable. The dialogue is corny (""whenever I meet a beautiful women, I must tell her I want to make love to her"" PLEASE!) and the plot twists are nothing short of offensively stupid. The movie has great sets, like the Mount Rushmore set, but seriously, if a professional knife thrower has a knife, why would he jump at you? Especially on a steep mountain.This movie is contrived and laughable the whole way through, the problem is that its a drama, not a campy 60's batman show. I wish I could be clever with this review but it seems unfair that I should have to put in effort to be clever when its obvious Alfred Hitchcock didn't put in effort to make a decent film."
tedg,"Jun 24, 2000",N/A,"Hitchcock was likely a genius in his day, and many of his films extraordinary. But at least this one has aged poorly. I was prompted to revisit it because I'm making my own Shakespeare film festival, and the title of this ostensibly comes from Hamlet. He is mad north by northwest as a ruse. There is nothing remotely as sophisticated here.What this film has going for it is Grant's suave composure in adversity, which must have been rare 40 years ago. But this has been played to death in recent decades.What it has against it:--the sets, even the monument are obviously fake junk--the story is unbelieveable. This is normal in film, but in this case there are assumptions about the cold war which even in historic context seem offensive.--there are huge logic holes: for instance the bad guys are spies who on the one hand must hide microfilm in a statue, but at the same time fly their escape plane into one of the most popular national parks!--Eva just isn't that charming, and what's up with her motivation? She's a prostitute that turned good at risk to her life because of patriotism?--If Grant is to be killed, why lure him to a remote location so he can be run down by a biplane? Why does the plane run into the gas truck?--If the spy is so smart, why kidnap Grant and take him to a house illegally borrowed from the head of Intepol? Recall that they knew (or thought they did) that Grant knew who he really was, and they intended to kill him anyway. Why the charade?--Hitchcock was a clever user of the camera, with scenes well framed. But that was in the era of largely stationary cameras. A moving camera was so rare as to have been then a noticable effect. Not so today. Hitchcock's camera is just plain primitive now.--Grant was already an old man. His curvature of the spine is noticeable as well as his stiff gait.--Any tension felt by prior generations was lost on me, and I'm a pretty old guy myself!Lord Edward Bulwar Lytton was highly regarded in his day too. Now, he's a joke, of interest only to historians of the novel. To me, this film is only of historic interest."
Mediatation,"Jul 3, 2024",10/10,"North By Northwest includes some of the most iconic action scenes of all time while also creating the blueprint for James Bond's film adaptation. It is Alfred Hitchcock's take on an action blockbuster, packed full of the type of suspense and creative shots Hitchcock is known for.Cary Grant's true cool aura shines through Thornhill, yet he is also a believable everyman hero finding himself in the middle of a spy story. Eva Marie Saint puts on an equally impressive performance as a proto-Bond woman, with clear chemistry when acting alongside Grant. It's a classic action film that is timeless in near every aspect and will likely stay thrilling long into the future."
Spuzzlightyear,"Dec 24, 2005",9/10,"""North By Northwest"" is probably well.. many things! Probably the best mistaken identity film ever made, the film with the most exciting chase sequences (Man vs. plane!), the most awesome set pieces made (Mount Rushmore!) the funniest ""goof"" on screen (kid holding his ears when the gun goes off!) and probably my favorite Hitchcock movie ever. Cary Grant is just amazing in this totally insane plot of mild-mannered ad executive getting thrust into a ridiculous game of underworld espionage, where he's forced to run from planes, gets tied up in a drunk driving rap, is nearly run over by a semi AND has to fight off James Mason and Martin Landau! Ah well, if you're gunning for a blonde as smoking as Eva Marie-Saint, wouldn't you? A lot of this is so over the top to be taken totally seriously, and mostly it's just pure popcorn fun. And cinema doesn't get any better or snarkier then the auction scene. A must see, if you're foolish enough for not having seen it yet."

elvircorhodzic,"Feb 16, 2017",10/10,"NORTH BY NORTHWEST is an adventurous spy thriller that impresses with an exciting story, delicious romance, excellent dialogue, rich characterization and fresh humor. One successful, suave, married and divorced expert on advertising is accidentally involved into an international spy network of intrigue and conspiracy. He has been replaced for an international spy. His quiet life has turned upside down...One nonchalant character is exposed to a serious spy game. He was pushed into a series of shocking and confusing situation at the beginning of the film. These situations are enriched with a large dose of a fresh humor. Hitch has presented a serious life situation or perhaps intriguing drama on a very entertaining way. The main character is not aware of the fraud. He is simply the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time.After that, Hitch has moved his protagonists to an exciting game between a search and pursuit. It is a strange game between cats and mice. An extremely rich scenery comes to the fore in these parts of the film.There is also an eight-minute scene, which I would describe as a masterpiece of cinema. The scene representing expectation through fear of the unknown, tension and excitement. It ends with the climatic action.Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill is a puppet, a charmer and a hero in this film. Mr. Grant is one of the most versatile actors of all time. It can be noticed, when he has created his own rules of the game. He is a somewhat clumsy, self-confident and foolhardy character. Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall is a seemingly fragile, mysterious and dangerous woman. Her character reminds of heroines from James Bond films. The chemistry between the main protagonists is quite good. Their interplay and romantic dialogues with sexual connotation are very favorable.Their support are Jessie Royce Landis (Clara Thornhill) as a silly Roger's mother, James Mason (Phillip Vandamm) as a smooth villain, Martin Landau (Leonard), who has a homosexual trait in his character and Leo G. Carroll (The Professor) as the voice of reason.Mr. Hitchcock has, as a proof of his mastery, toyed with the audience and censorship at the end of the movie.This is an exciting and very entertaining movie."
rbrb,"Jan 7, 2012",10/10,"I must have seen this movie at least 5 times. It is a brilliant drama/thriller and the whole production which includes direction, writing, music, acting, etc., is top quality. By a quirk of fate a businessman is unwittingly dragged into a deadly spy game. A whole series of adventures follow with plenty of twists and turns and surprises along the way. All the characters are charismatic, the villains are suitably bad and the hero suitably brave as well as amusing and flawed. The story is presented in a straight forward interesting way, with no unnecessary sub plots or distractions and a tour de force of a storyline with a super climax. Its over 50 years since the movie was released, and what a pity so many of today's films cannot compare to this one:10/10"
robert-temple-1,"Dec 12, 2017",10/10,"This film is probably where Hitchcock's genius rose to its greatest height. I have seen it several times over the years, and it keeps getting better and better. Now we have a Blu-ray remastered version, so I have seen it again, all crisp and new. A large part of the success of this film is due to Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplay. He was one of Hollywood's top screenwriters and his skills were crucial in making this story work. The film is gripping from the first scene to the last, and never loses its tension for a moment. Cary Grant's somewhat weird personality was perfect for the lead role in this tale of mysterious intrigue. The combination of his droll insouciance and dry humour with his expressions of continually surprised astonishment is just the right mix. I can't think of any other actor who could so perfectly have compounded the variegated tinctures of ambiguity into this sublime decoction of suspense. (What do you mean, that last sentence was affected?) As for Eva Marie Saint, never was she so glorious as in this picture. She has just the right mix as well. And those two mixes went well together, and are the very opposite of oil and water. Or to put it another way, everything gells. And then there is James Mason as the unctuous smoothie bad guy. He really knew how to be convincing at that, and the way he puts his hand on Eva Marie Saint's shoulder in the auction room, to say 'you are mine', is done so delicately but so emphatically. He was always the master of understatement, Every gesture, every grimace is perfectly planned and plotted. Hitchcock was passionate about story-boarding all his films, and this one is a living story-board. Not one thing is out of place, the film was perfectly executed according to plan. It ticks better than any Swiss watch in history. Tick, tick, tick, and the wheels go round and things happen relentlessly, all precisely timed. The most famous episode in this film is probably when Cary Grant gets off a bus in the middle of a corn field in absolutely nowhere and a crop-spraying plane comes after him, trying to kill him. Who says such things never happen? I saw it with my own eyes, in a Hitchcock film, so it must be true."
sddavis63,"Jan 13, 2014",7/10,"I want to say first that I liked this movie. I also have to say that I expected a little bit more from a movie that's considered one of the best ever made, and one of the best (if not THE best by many people) movies ever directed by Alfred Hitchcock. I found it to be an engaging movie, most certainly. It never lost my attention. There was enough going on that I wanted to know how things were going to turn out, and there were even a few situations in which it was impossible to know who's side a particular character was on. All that worked very well for me.I was also impressed by the performances from the three primary leads. Cary Grant was quite good as Roger Thornhill, a New York City businessman who through a case of mistaken identity ends up on the run as apparently Eastern bloc agents try to pull off some sort of scheme (that isn't really revealed until close to the end of the movie.) Thornhill is maybe a little too good at times - your normal businessman who seems to take too readily to the undercover espionage business. But Grant did well as the character. James Mason was the villain Philip Vandamm and was able to offer the perfect combination of menace and charm - just enough to make his character (who could have been quite one dimensional) interesting. And, of course, there had to be a beautiful woman - in this case Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall, who becomes involved with Thornhill but is actually working for Vandamm.I'm not sure that I'd agree that this was Hitchcock's finest performance as a director. He made a movie that was engaging, but not really spellbinding, although he managed to do a good job of gradually building the suspense.Certainly,. this is a very good movie. I'd argue, though, that it's a wee bit over-rated. Still very good, though. (7/10)"
Ed-Shullivan,"Jul 10, 2024",7/10,"No spoilers here but simply by stating that the film was directed by one of the top ranked directors in Alfred Hitchcock and stars the attractive Eve Marie Saint and Cary Grant, how could the film miss? Well, it couldn't miss being a hit, and it does not disappoint.Although I found the initial misrepresentation of Ad Executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) being mistaken for a guy named George Kaplan more than a bit far fetched the rest of the film flows nicely.The interaction and gradual romance between the Ad Executive Roger Thornhill, and the mysterious lady Eve Kendall, (Eve Marie Saint) who aggressively and unapologetically chases Roger Thornhill during a train ride over dinner leaves little to Ms. Kendall's intentions, or does it? As with any good Alfred Hitchcock film look for a few twists and turns figuratively and literally.This is a Thriller worth watching at least twice. I give the film a solid 7 out of 10 IMDB rating."
EdwardCarter,"Sep 30, 2014",1/10,"Cary Grant, who lived with Randolph Scott for twelve years from 1932 to 1944, was far too old at 55 to be playing the romantic lead. It's hilarious that he looks the same age as the actress playing his mother - horrendously bad casting. This movie is a slow, overlong, dated and boring and it certainly cannot be compared to any of the Bond movies. In contrast to what some other reviewers here have claimed, Grant was never offered the Bond role, because he was far too old at 58. If this rubbish had been half an hour shorter, filmed on location instead of on fake-looking studio sets, and if it hadn't been so slow then maybe it would be watchable. William Holden would have been far better as Roger Thornhill."
doverwoods,"Feb 25, 2001",N/A,"I agree with so many of the comments here---and I too feel it's Hitchcock's very best.  All the elements are perfect.  It's hard to pick a favorite scene, but I think it's the sequence at VanDam's house at Mt. Rushmore.  I would love to know about that house.  How much of this was a set piece?  Was it really at Mt. Rushmore?  That kind of thing.  Email me if you have any info.  Also, does anybody agree Grant may have blown a line when he said, ""He's assembling the General Assembly this afternoon""?  Should that not have been, ""He addressing the General Assembly this afteroon""?  I've seen this movie more times than I can count and that has always seemed curious to me. And its always to fun to see the boy stick his fingers in his ears before the gun fires in the Mt. Rushmore cafeteria.  A classic for Gaffe Squad addicts.  And, I've always felt the chase over Mt. Rushmore is one of the very best illusions created in the movies.  A superb achievement in Art Direction.  And if you really want to put this film under a microscope, count how many quick cuts are made after Thornhill gets off the bus at the prarrie stop and is taking stock of where he is out in the middle of nowhere.  Finally, if you are a Hitchcock fan you know how good he was with scary faces.  And NbyNW is loaded with them.  Would love to hear from other fans of this great film--my alltime favorite without question."
charlesturner-75605,"Oct 16, 2022",8/10,"I found north by northwest to be an intriguing film. The start of the film follows the main character being kidnapped by a group of men into a residence and forced to drink alcohol by the men. He then is mistaken for this persona of another man who he has no idea who he is. The further he does along in the movie he wonders who the hell this man is, and so do we the viewer. Who is this mysterious Mr. Kaplan. The whole movie we wonder who this person is. It isn't until the further end of the movie that we find the shocking truth. This film goes down as one of my favorites. It has its its moments, it sometimes moves slow but overall it was a great film."
Danarella,"May 10, 2010",9/10,"Cary Grant is just so darn charming! In everything he does, he creates a memorable character, but none of his roles are better than the ones he has when he works with the great Alfred Hitchcock. North by Northwest is arguably Grant's best role, as well as one of the best from Hitch. It is a case of mistaken identity that leads Roger O. Thornhill, played by Grant, from Manhattan all the way to Mount Rushmore. Two goons are lead to believe that he is a Mr. Kaplan, and this mistake leads Thornhill to a meeting at the United Nations where he is framed for murder.Besides the leading man, the best part of this film is the engaging script. The story came out of a few interesting ideas that Hitchcock wanted to use for a film. A screenwriter was hired to put the scenes together, which is how we get this film that moves quickly and travels through major monuments of the country. In spite of all the fantastic settings, I consider the scene at the auction to be one of the most impressive scenes in the film. Thornhill confronts the villain, Phillip Vandamm, in which neither of them can fight.Eva Marie Saint does a great job as Thornhill's romantic interest with a secret, Eve Kendall. She is a classic Hitchcock female foil, with blond hair and an icy stare. Even before her identity is revealed, the audience senses that she is more than just a woman sitting at a table on a train. The sexual tension between Thornhill and Kendall is palpable in every scene, which makes the finale all the more climactic.I highly recommend this film to anyone. It has action, romance, suspense and humor and is crafted by arguably one of the greatest directors of all time."
pruthvishrathod,"Dec 10, 2013",8/10,"It has the signature of a cool thriller all over it, right from its cool opening credits followed by Hitchcock's cameo. Movie has good background score as always and stylish technical elements. From locations to its camera movements or Cary Grant's drunk driving sequence. Everything stands out. The best thing about the film is its screenplay. It is very exciting and full of twists. I felt surprise at every moment just like Cary Grant's character. Romantic sub-plot isn't as striking as Hitchcock's other films but everything is overshadowed by its engaging story. It is kind of thriller you can watch with ease, it keeps entertaining you. About the cast Cary Grant was quite convincing and so was James Mason. But I really loved Eva Marie Saint. I'm a big fan of her and this time also she stunned me with her fantastic performance. She was just perfect for the role. Such a bold and spellbinding woman. Overall, North by Northwest is one of the coolest thriller I have seen in recent time."
daoldiges,"Sep 28, 2022",8/10,"North by Northwest is one of Hitchcock most purely entertaining films from his long filmography. Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, and a quiet Martin Landau are all very effective in their respective roles. I read some reviews that felt some of the material seemed dated? I wholeheartedy disagree and will leave that at that. Yes, I will agree that there are a couple 'glitches' in the story continuity, but they are not enough to seriously derail everything else around them. All the iconic scenes are still iconic. From the opening credits, to the score and the visuals throughout, North by Northwest is still as fun and entertaining as ever."
tim_s_wiley,"Mar 30, 2013",6/10,"Well i always try to check movies off my ""Must See Before Dying"" list and so i turned this one on. The movie has a great premise and story... my only problem was Cary Grant.I thought he was great on the train scenes with the girl... but as far as the drunk scene, and a normal person who's life is in jeopardy multiple times he just didn't seem real to me... like he didn't take any of it seriously. Just not convincing for a good part of the movie.I think this movie would have been great even now had there been someone more convincing in that role someone who was really concerned with living/dying rather than a regular citizen trying to portray a 007 veteran coolness.Again the part on the train (witty exchanges with the woman) were great and you could really pick up on the innuendo of the times."
coltras35,"Mar 6, 2021",10/10,"A tour de force thriller by the grandmeister of suspense Alfred Hitchcock deserves its reputation, and there are many iconic scenes such as the dust cropper chase sequence and the thrilling finale in Mount Rushmore that stays in your mind well after the film is finished, but it's the plot, music and snappy dialogue that captures the perilous situation Cary Grant's character finds him in is what keeps one engrossed. It all starts from mistaken identity, then warps into a cloak and dagger intrigue. The supporting actors are brilliant, especially James Mason ( his facial reaction when he gets shot with blanks is superb) and Eve Marie Saint. I seen it many times and it's never boring and comes across like a fresh film. Classic."
Steffi_P,"Dec 23, 2010",6/10,"North by Northwest, among the best-known of all Hitchcock pictures, was in fact begun with the specific intention of creating (in the words of its writer Ernest Lehman) ""the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures"". And to this end it does seem to tour faithfully round all the familiar stops on the Hitchcockian trail – the falsely accused man, the espionage backdrop the exact details of which are not elucidated, the showdown on a famous monument, the dry wit and the sharp innuendo. This may make it the most archetypal, but does it make it the best? One thing that really stands out about North by Northwest is that it is one of Hich's more comedy-laced scripts. Or more accurately, the comedy is more tightly interwoven, rather than being kept as a standalone feature for certain scenes or characters. And while there are some good laughs here, such as Cary Grant's nonchalant wisecracking when he is first kidnapped (which really makes us warm to the character), it seems to be at the expense of the action. You see, although there are certainly a lot of speedy chases, narrow escapes and cunning getaways, not a single one of them is up to Hitch's best standard. The drunk-driving chase for example is more awkward than nailbiting. There is simply no material for Hitchcock to do some grand orchestration of suspense, like say the concert hall scene from The Man Who Knew Too Much or the finales of Rear Window and Psycho. All in all this wrong-manhunt seems more like a case of annoyance rather than something to inspire the old ""it-could-happen-to-you"" fear factor.That is not to say there are not good things about North by Northwest. In fact there are plenty. Hitch's direction is on-the-ball as ever, with lots of set-ups where the characters are walking (or running) towards the camera, coupled with moving point-of-view shots, which places us somewhat forcibly within the action. This, coupled with a tight editing scheme, at least makes this 130-minute picture move at a considerable pace. Grant is perfectly suited to the resourceful but unassuming hero, and his laidback approach to comedy makes the most of the witty screenplay. It provides a great role for James Mason too, the suaveness and good looks that made him a desirable lead man in his youth now make him the perfect devilish villain in his middle age. Then there is the hard-hitting main theme by composer Bernard Hermann, the sparseness of which prefigures his stabbing strings for Psycho.However the fact remains that, while this may be very much the tailor-made Hitchcock classic, the finished product is more of a Hitchcock mediocrity. It lacks the sense of showmanship, the shock value and the spiralling tension that really made his finest pictures stand out."
mlleetoile,"Mar 20, 2002",N/A,"I really enjoyed North by Northwest, it was refreshing to see a Hollywood action film with so little blood shed.  When in the right mood I definitely enjoy some good and gory fun; but these days all the good guy/ bad guy films seem to have the same theme: bigger guns and more blood equal success.  Yet here is a film that made me tense when Mr. Townsend and his entourage appeared and had me cheering for Eve Kendall.  More film makers ought to follow Hitchcock's style of film making; subtle and calculated art sometimes makes for a more entertaining experience.  The guns were small when they took Mr. Thornhill to see Townsend for the first time, and the crop duster scene  was rather simple.  This film shows that having a big budget and lots of special effects does not make a great movie; using music, camera angles and great actors with 1950's means can create something much more inspired and fun to watch.  Sometimes things in life do not have to be made complicated, you do not have to utterly dazzle the public every time."
thecaptain-390-686858,"May 9, 2019",10/10,One of the best AH movies. Between the erotic conversations and innuendo between Grant and Marie and suspense and drama throughout that culminates in an epic scene you are in for a real treat. A truly great movie that has stood the test of time!
xiaoli7377,"Nov 26, 2021",10/10,"""North by Northwest"" is gripping and enticing from beginning to end. A classic film, too many things have been written about this one. I'll try to fill in a few of my own observations.The viewer is hooked into the world of Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) instantly. We see him getting abducted very early on in the film, and from that point plunged unwillingly into a twisted plot of corruption and deception. The viewer is fed bits of information to piece together throughout, but it's often at a much later time that Mr. Thornhill is able to grasp these revelations, which really shows Hitchcock's mastery of tense and suspenseful filmmaking and storytelling.A small negative for me personally is the hokey romantic dialogue. It is fitting for its time. Most of the dialogue and acting in this movie is stellar, especially from Grant's female co-star Eva Marie Saint, who plays the beautiful and seductive character Eve Kendall. The romantic subplot is nice, it adds to the overall intrigue, but I just have a very small and minor nitpick over the dialogue. It's a personal taste though, it doesn't detract from the overall objective quality of the movie.Highest accolades and recommendations for this most monumental and influential thriller masterpiece, ""North by Northwest."""
CelluloidTape,"Feb 15, 2009",9/10,"North By Northwest is one of director Alfred Hitchock's most popular movies. it is a classic and has proved itself to have endured over the years, pleasing new generations of audiences.The story about an advertising executive, who is mistaken for someone else by foreign agents, (and they chase him) was wonderfully written by Ernest Lehman and directed with great style by legendary director Alfred Hitchcock.Hitchcock's direction is, as always, sophisticated. The dialog is smart. The acting by all of the cast members is also smart and sophisticated.Cary Grant plays the male lead and he is sharp, fascinating and a pleasure to watch. In the female lead role, Eva Marie-Saint, as one of Hitchcock's cool blonde ladies, is excellent and sexy in an understated way. James Mason is also an excellent bad guy, as is Martin Landau, who plays a killer.There are some great visually composed scenes that now have become classic images, whenever the history of movie making is discussed.I would recommend this movie to anyone from any background and at any age from young adult to seniors."
acanacox,"Jan 7, 2023",9/10,"I love love love grant movies! I love Hitchcock movies because when theirs romance involved, it is legit like a complex puzzle for you to get some of the innuendos! I had to look up Hitchcock innuendos because even as a fully grown adult, I didn't get the banter. And yes now that I know the truth behind the meaning of some of their talk, ohhhh it's enjoyable! I got most of the ""fly over kids heads"" discussions. Grant is silly in some. Eva did one hella fantastic job with this role! Her voice and mannerisms is superb! I absolutely loved how Hitchcock chose her! Loved the ending! I loved the suspense!!!! The ""ah ha, gotchu"" moment at the climax! Everything Hitchcock did in this movie was...*chefs kiss*! I wish I didn't cheat and see bits and bits of scenes before watching the whole movie because I would of been even more shocked! Still a wow movie!!!!!! Loved it."
falconer99,"Aug 13, 2005",10/10,"To summarise, let's just say this is over two hours long and yet seems to last only minutes. You just wish it were longer.And all the clichés in it were there for the first time: we've just seen them so many times since. I think it was in his conversations with Truffaut that Hitchcock said that, when a character is on the run in a film, he is always shown as walking down rain-washed cobbled streets, hiding in the night, but Hitchcock wanted to change all that and make it as light as possible, hence the crop-duster scene ... as every director has done ever since.Back-projection has never been that good in Hitchcock's films, I'm sorry to say. I think that film-goers were just expected to accept it at the time. But I think the special effects in the finale (now where was it set?) are superb, and I really feel that the actors and stand-ins are really there (I was surprised it wasn't actually filmed there) ... apart from the studio inserts, that is.But the plot is entirely original (or so I believe, but you always find something in the archives ...); Lehman's lines are very witty (and sexy!); the casting is superb (Grant never turned in a bad performance, and Landau, Mason and, especially, Carroll, setting himself up for his long-term role in his later acting career, are outstanding); and, like all Hitchcock's films, it's a fine comedy (and Psycho is the biggest joke of all). So why do all the critics always favour Vertigo, Rear Window, Strangers on a Train, The Trouble with Harry or Psycho?Well, North by Northwest is my favourite Hitchcock anyway.And I'm sure I don't have to mention Herrmann's massive contribution.In fact, my only objection is James Mason's cardigan. I find that so irritating!"
Don-102,"Mar 23, 1999",10/10,"The 1950's was an amazing decade for Alfred Hitchcock.  Year after year, he churned out some sort of a classic: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, etc..  He capped it with the most exciting film he ever directed. NORTH BY NORTHWEST is sheer escapist entertainment, a non-stop ride across the country, with Hitch dealing out his usual cards.  Innocent man (Cary Grant) in a crazy situation which he is wrongfully drawn into, and the beautiful leading lady (Eva Marie Saint), who always seem to be blonde.  I also have to say that musical composer Bernard Herrmann has produced one of his top 3 scores (the other 2 being TAXI DRIVER and PSYCHO).  Right from the opening title sequence, we are souring into this story of international intrigue, decoys, and constant pursuit.The film barely lets up as Grant, in his own dashing manner, plays it cool as an advertising exec who becomes surrounded by the bad guys before we even get settled into our seats.  This is the mother of all modern action/chase films, with pitstops at the UN building, Grand Central Station, Chicago, a vast cornfield, and finally, Mount Rushmore.  Grant's scene on the field has become one of the most famous sequences of all-time.  That dust-cropper definitely had a mind of its own.  The great thing about the scene is that about 90% of it was shot on location.  Again, listen to that music.  It explodes with the suspense of the scene.You never know what side of the fence Hitch's characters are on at times. Is there a real ""Kaplan""?  Why did the bad guys pick Grant as their target? Eva Marie Saint is not so saintly as the alluring blonde who has some kind of angle on the events herself.  You're never really sure what she is up to. This is the greatness and originality of the ""worlds"" Hitchcock and his writers create.  Things are never as they appear.  It is up to the viewer to pay attention or let him play you like a fiddle.  Either way, you come out satisfied.This is not his 'best' film.  It is his most thrilling flick, and it also has the refreshing sense of humor that enlighten Hitch's best pictures. In terms of action and adventure, this has no equal within his library of films with perhaps the exception of 1940's FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT.  Great dialogue, slick and stylish directing, and a sense of pure fun makes this one better.RATING - 10 of 10"

As the nightmare then continues, as you sober from all the booze, trace your way to The Assembly, where a dagger makes an entry, pursued and chased and then embraced, on a train that makes great haste, before too long your being dusted, there's nobody, that can be trusted.Of all of Hitchcock's films, this stands the test of time better than most, and Cary Grant is perfectly cast in the role of Roger Thornhill."

jobuchow,"Sep 17, 2002",N/A,"Having seen this movie in excess of 15 times, I am aware of each scene from start to finish.  Yet, this piece is not designed to spoil the plot, merely to entice those movie fans who have not yet seen this masterpiece.""North by Northwest"" stars Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Leo G. Carroll and Martin Landau (pre-""Mission Impossible"").The basic story is one of an advertising man whose life suddenly takes a drastic turn into espionage and murder.  Humor and even romance are deftly woven into this suspenseful tale.This movie will make you laugh and maybe swoon as you sit on the edge of your seat.The cast does a terrific job.  Cary Grant can do drama and comedy perfectly, and this movie shows him in a peak performance.Eva Marie Saint is quite sexy and excellent as the ""cool blonde"" (Hitchcock liked blondes in the lead female role) in this tale.James Mason and Martin Landau play the antagonists.  They are well-dressed and quite sinisterLeo G. Carroll plays a government agent - one can see why he played the spy leader in ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" in the 1960's.If you have heard of the movie, there are sequences involving a crop-duster and Mount Rushmore.  Hitchcock loved to experiment visually, and he succeeds admirably with those aforementioned sequences and the others that tie this film together.Don't look away too long.  This is not a film to be played in the background and interrupted regularly.  Also, Hitchcock made a habit of appearing in cameo roles in his films.  Originally, it was because the film required more people in certain scenes.  Later on, it became a trademark.In addition, the cinematography is very pleasing in color, the script is abundant with standout dialogue, and that music score - Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann were a perfect match.I personally never tire of the film.  It had taken years for me to see in its full widescreen format, and it was worth the wait.See it."

CinePhile-istine,"Aug 10, 2015",10/10,"I watched my first Hitchcock movie, Psycho, in my last year of high school and I immediately became a fan. Over the following 25 years though I have noticed that my favorite Hitchcock movie has continued to change. It was Psycho for many years, but sometime in the mid- 1990s, it became Vertigo (coincidentally a time when a new restored print of that came out). Apart from the beautiful new print (which I also saw on the big screen), I was probably somewhat also swayed by the Sight & Sound critics poll where Vertigo had just displaced Citizen Kane as the greatest movie of all times.But, for the past ten years or so, North by Northwest has become my favorite Hitchcock movie of all times. It is the one I find myself watching over and over again (just caught it on the big screen, for a change). It is also the one I find myself recommending to others, when they ask what Hitchcock movie should they start with.I guess the reason for this is that it is the most ""perfect"" Hitchcock movie. It has all the elements: the Macguffin, the wrongly-accused leading man, and the blonde woman who may or may not be who she claims to be. More than that, it has in one single movie everything that you will find in separate Hitchcock movies: a great screenplay (by Ernest Lehman), fantastic score (Bernard Herrman, obviously), great title sequence (Saul Bass), crackling dialogue and humor, and great chemistry between the leads (similar to 39 Steps). The interplay between Cary Grant (at his best - and more than Jimmy Stewart, the perfect Hitchcock lead) and Eve Marie Saint when they first meet on the train is an exercise in great writing and acting - it could be from any great romantic movie.But most of all it has some of the great set-pieces assembled in the movies - the crop-dusting and Mount Rushmore sequences are already classics. Yes, it doesn't have the psychological complexity of Vertigo, the shock and horror of Psycho, but it is what it is: the most ENTERTAINING movie that Hitchcock ever made, and the one I can watch over and over again."
EgaBog,"Nov 25, 2013",8/10,"Recently, I had to slow down on watching the movies from my Watchlist because of my girlfriend, and finally after a long time I could get her to watch this great piece of cinema.Cary Grant's acting is worth watching the movie, the great pieces of dialogue, the charm and how natural it all looks is amazing. Still, I'd change that pair of gray socks for a pair of black socks anytime.The plot is full of surprises and it's quite hard to predict anything until much later in the movie, so be prepared for quite a few twists along the movie. It's a must watch if you are slightly interested in Hitchcock's work."
snoozejonc,"Jul 16, 2025",10/10,"North by Northwest feels more lighthearted than other Hitchcock thrillers, but it draws you in with a compelling case of mistaken identity and a subsequent adventure.I think you need to be a fan of Cary Grant to appreciate it fully. We are placed in his character's shoes and go through the ordeal with him. His quick-fire banter keeps it light, and vulnerability helps the average Joe identify with his predicament.Hitchcock ticks a lot of entertainment boxes with an intriguing Cold War deception, colourful backdrops, charismatic stars, and beautiful visuals. I can only imagine how exciting it must have been for a 1950s audience. He set a template for the glamorised spy genre. Arguably, it is more relatable than Bond and Mission: Impossible as the central character is not a superhero type (nor a killer).The pacing perfectly balances action, plot development and character moments. There are several unforgettable scenes, images, and transitions that show filmmaking at its best. If I had to pick a fault, I would say it is so lighthearted that it misses opportunities to create extra dramatic tension, but that was Hitchcock's intention."
Kingslaay,"Jan 20, 2020",9/10,Alfred Hitchcock's is at the height of his powers in this fine classic. North by Northwest is easily one of the best movies ever made. Carey Grant is charismatic and brings his troubled character to life in this adventure. Viewers are taken on a great journey of mistaken identity and truth. This is a creative masterpiece on the screen and you are captured from start to finish. Never mind the technology and effects which look dated this film and quality stands the test of time.North by Northwest has echoes of the iconic James Bond franchise.

johnmschofield,"Sep 21, 2009",10/10,"If you read the trivia section for this film you will find numerous bits of information relating to who might have been starring in this film if the circumstances had been different. For me the people who were involved were perfect. I know nothing about film making but it seems to me that the director knew what the story was and who the people were to be in the film and then he decided how to create it. And a masterpiece is what he came up with. The film will keep you transfixed because its overall message is fun. Yes there is tension, danger and some people die but if you watch the film with an open mind you will see what I and lot of other people mean by fun. Life at times can be absurd and unbelievable and there are parts of this film when you just smile because you can identify with most of what happens on screen. As far as I am aware its not a true story, its just a cinematic creation that is also a classic and will be a joy to watch again and again. This film is fifty years old but like every other great film its as enjoyable today as it was when it was made. Buy, rent or borrow the DVD and you will not be disappointed."
ns76,"Mar 25, 2001",N/A,"Not only is this the best Hitchcock, this is one of the best films ever made.  Don't let the date, 1959, scare you off, this has everything possible for a movie: great, believable acting from all(Grant, Saint, Mason, Landau, and even the minor players); stunning cinematography(decades ahead of its time), fantastic stunts(the air-duster scene, and the Mount Rushmore finale), a brilliant score by Bernard Herrmann, and the perfect mixture of action, humor, and a dash of romance.One lesson that all modern film makers could learn from this movie is timing.  With some rare exceptions, many of today's movies have good story lines, but waste several minutes on meaningless scenes (Lost Souls, or Traffic, to name a couple).  Hitchcock proved a movie can be over two hours and still keep you in suspense. Do yourself a favor and rent this, better yet, own it. You'll want to watch it more than once."
commandercool88,"Jan 14, 2009",10/10,"'North by Northwest' is not as experimental as 'Psycho'. Nor is it as confined as 'Rear Window' or as disturbing as 'Vertigo'. What it is, however, is a mainstream Hitchcock presenting an endlessly entertaining effort. One of the most satisfying spy thrillers, this case of mistaken identity plays out like an intelligent and explosive cat and mouse chase.Hitchcock was always one to maintain tight control over every set, every shot. He loosens his reigns in 'North by Northwest' by making the United States of America his playing field. From New York to Chicago to Mount Rushmore, this captivating thriller is a grandiose and ambitious picture from the master of suspense. The result is a brilliantly realized picture whose entertainment value could rival today's Bond.Cary Grant is electrifying as Roger Thornhill, an unsuspecting man mistaken for a mysterious Kaplan. His journey to keep his life becomes a mad dash to escape the hands of the law, and around every corner Grant faces a looming threat. Eva Marie Saint is fantastic as Grant's romantic interest who has much more invested in Thornhill than he ever suspects. The chemistry between the two is unmistakable, making every twist and turn along the way a brilliant sleight of hand only Hitchcock can deliver.From a heart pounding chase in the middle of a cornfield to a thrilling climax on the face of Mount Rushmore, 'North by Northwest' provides many memorable moments that make this classic a wild ride from start to finish. Sweeping cinematography and vivid imagery only adds to this thrilling, funny, and romantic adventure that span across amber waves of grain and purple mountain majesties. 'North by Northwest' may very well be Hitchcock's most mainstream effort, and you'll savor every moment of it.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
beaudare-70996,"Jun 23, 2020",10/10,"I am always amazed at Hitchcock's inventive, resourseful ways. Watch how he uses colour to great effect, as most everything is light blue and white: cars, trains, lighting, etc. to match Cary Grant's shirt and tailored suit. Also, how red appears everytime Grant encounters danger, as when he's abducted in a taxi, a red bus slowly passes by. And at the Mount Rushmore cafe, as Grant slowly walks around the room he passes a man in a red shirt, at the entrance, then a lady with a red blouse cuts in front of him as he buys coffee, and lastly when he sits down right next to a blonde girl in a brilliant red sweater. Of course, he gets shot by Eva Marie Saint a few minutes later. The best is when at the auction, when Grant is avoiding James Mason's henchmen, a red carnation is clearly hovering around his head, convieniantly worn by a lady a few rows in back of him.. Very clever.. As an American actor/ screenwriter who once had the pleasure of working with the lovely, talented Eva Marie Saint, I find this film an all time classic... Beau Dare"
phiya-1,"Dec 12, 2005",10/10,"This is a great movie and while the direction, locations, acting and editing are fun they are second to one of the best film scores in movie history. Bernard Hermann is a musical master and genius and there has not been anyone before or since that compares to his consistent creativity and this is one of his best. Listen to the music from the first opening credits to the scene on the streets and you will hear some of the best compositions since Stravinsky and Beethoven. (He also did ""Psycho"", ""Twilight Zone"" and so many other fabulous scores.) You may think that John Williams music is great, and he is, including all the latest Harry Potter films, but the only thing that he did that comes close to Bernard Hermann is his music for ET, the motor cycle chase in Indiana Jones III, Duel of the Fates and the Droid battle in Star Wars I. Hans Zimmerman, another great film scorer, has tremndous creativity, often more than John Williams, but anything he did and, for that matter, anyone else to date, has never been better than Bernard Hermann; and this movie is one of his best. An essential ingredient to every great movie is an even better musical score and this one of the best examples of this. Musically, previous to Bernard Hermann was Max Steiner, who wrote the score for ""Gone With The Wind"", and before him was the most creative genius in all of film history, Charles Chaplin (who wrote, directed, acted, and scored all of his films! An unheard of feat these days!). See this movie but also listen to the music and you will hear one the best scores of all time."
michaelchager,"Nov 30, 2022",10/10,"Overloaded with qualities as yet unexplored, perhaps best seen with the sound turned down as the realization of pure cinema, with closed captioned titles. The visual rhythm does not need a soundtrack, as neither does a roller coaster. And drives to a stunning halt with the appearance of Eve Marie Saint. James Mason is exalted as a cardboard character or a photograph of a character lacking any depth. Designed to be witnessed on a big screen as much as Rushmore should be seen in person or malevolent flying objects avoided in open fields. Anticipates virtual reality, surround experiences and is amenable to immersive media as a ride or game, predictably a lasting remnant of cinema as technology advances.

Wuchakk,"Dec 26, 2019",6/10,"When an ad executive in Manhattan (Gary Cooper) is mistaken for a government agent by a foreign spy & his cronies (James Mason, et al.) he finds himself a fugitive traveling by train to Chicago wherein he meets a woman that seems to have his favor (Eva Marie Saint). After a curious encounter with a crop dusting plane everything culminates at Mount Rushmore, South Dakota.""North by Northwest"" (1959) is an adventure/thriller by Hitchcock with a huge reputation. It obviously influenced the James Bond flicks of the 60s, which started three years later with ""Dr. No"" (1962), but it's very toned down by comparison because the hero in this case is not a trained spy. It's entertaining to a point, but also seriously overrated due to some glaring problems...Jessie Royce Landis plays the protagonist's mother when she was only a little over 7 years older than Cooper and it's too obvious; the story drags too much at this point (when he's hanging out with his mother); his chance meeting with a key character on the train (Saint) is too coincidental; their make-out sessions are premature, unconvincing and painfully dull; what happens to the plane is stupefying; the crop dusting encounter supposedly takes place in rural Indiana when it's clear that it's nowhere within a thousand miles of Indiana (actually it was shot at the southern end of Central Valley, California, outside of Bakersfield); speaking of which, the geography is too noticeably disingenuous: e.g. during the drunk driving episode there are no cliffs like that on Long Island (it was actually shot at Potrero Valley, Thousand Oaks, CA, and obviously so).Still, there's enough good here to enjoy if you favor Hitchcock & the cast and don't mind quaint movies.The film runs 2 hours, 15 minutes (unnecessarily overlong).GRADE: B-/C+"
C_4,"Jul 13, 2005",4/10,"Hitchcock's sterile universe of non-humanity certainly demonstrates its own limitations in this forgettable attempt at making a combined suspense/comedy. We are supposed to care for Cary, but I simply couldn't care less about this hologram of a personality who is about as implausible as the rest of the story.Furthermore, there are some dreadful flaws in the script: Our dear mr. Thornhill completely fails to wonder how on earth this completely unknown miss Kendall is able to know and even make contacts with the mysterious George Kaplan.There is nothing impressive about most of the camera work either. Apart from an extremely elegant pan from outside to inside the train, most scenes are quite ordinary.This movie is for film buffs and others who prefer hidden references to other events above the actual story. In my opinion this is one of the most overrated films on IMDb. In short: It takes a buff to appreciate this long flick. Others should go and watch an early James Bond instead!"
Rikichi,"Apr 25, 2006",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock made this film at the height of his genius and also at the height of his popularity, when his television show gave him the kind of exposure and face recognition usually reserved for only the biggest stars. Hitch always maintained that great films should also entertain, North by Northwest being presented here as our star witness to prove his assertion to be correct.Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill as the slick Madison Avenue advertising man who is mistaken to be George Kaplin, a spy hot on the trail of Phillip Vandamm, played masterfully by James Mason. All we really know about Thornhill is the statement he makes to Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) on the train from New York to Chicago that he has a mother, several bartenders and two ex-wives dependant upon him for support. The ""O"" used to initial his middle name stands for ""nothing"" and his initials, R.O.T., sum up his life. These details are revealing and the scene is beautifully crafted, showing us the apparent emptiness of his life prior to this adventure. Ernst Lehman's script is loaded with these types of gems throughout the picture.If you're really not into excellent dialogue and clever acting and prefer that the story get on with it, this also is the movie for you, as it has two of the most memorable action sequences in the history of motion pictures. Of course I'm referring to the crop dusting sequence and the finale on top of Mount Rushmore. Those are enough to put this movie near the top of anyone's must see list.Kudos are also due to Leo G. Carroll in one of his best character roles as The Professor, who's humble appearance belies the fact that he is the one who is responsible for manipulating much of the action behind the scenes. A young Martin Landau, as Leonard, Vandamm's ""right arm"", shows us in the few scenes that he's in what a capable actor he was. The music by the great Bernard Herrmann is one of the classic pieces that made him famous, starting from the clever opening title sequence to it's conclusion.If we view this movie in its historical context of 1959, we see that it was made in the middle of the Cold War, and much of the suspense is reliant upon the audience's reality of living with the knowledge that everything could end with the press of a button (I know this is too simplistic, but many people's perception at this point in history was just that). The Professor, Vandamm, Ms. Kendall, Leonard and others are Cold Warriors, and it is Thornhill's misfortune to become swept up in it's intrigues, but our very great fortune to be able to get swept up with him and let Hitcock, the ""Master of Suspense"", be our guide in one of his masterworks."
alkemawitten,"Mar 23, 2008",9/10,"Ever notice how Oprah is trying to pile great life-changing TV-moments on top of one another, time after time? This is exactly what Hitchkock was doing for cinema. The great thing about North by Northwest though, is that he's trying to do it all in one movie.I challenge the reader to name any other title that has so many groundbreaking suspense scenes: the abduction, the drunk driving, the UN-building scene (He has the knife: he's the killer!- oh no!-the paranoia!), the crop duster-scene, the crazy auction (Cary Grant bidding ridiculously high and then claiming the crap isn't worth a buck) and of course the very slow and gripping Mount Rushmore chase-scene.Watching this movie today, it feels easily as fast-paced and gripping as, say, Casino Royale or MI3. It's not overstating to claim that this movie is, in fact, the first Bond(-type) movie, still waiting to be topped.Of course, you have to love Cary Grant, you have to love Technicolor, you have to love the now firmly outdated cardboard characters. If you don't, it's your loss; I beg you: get over yourself!(you don't have to love Oprah) Having said this, I would like to end saluting Eve Kendall and Cary Grant: a match made in heaven. This may not be Hitchcock's finest film, but I think these are his finest leading actors. Eve Kendall is everything you want from a Hitchkock-lady. Women who, under the pretense of ladylikeness, are in fact a tad trashy. So matching the fifties.And Grant is the ideal Hitch-hero: fragile yet masculine, dull, but somehow fascinating.Go watch!"
michadny,"Oct 20, 2015",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock dished something up more then fifty years ago that would change the way cinema looked today. North By Northwest was that film, and whilst at the time I can only imagine it was fantastical, it still holds up today, trumping most films that come out in the twenty first century. It's fast paced action, it's mystery and twists and turns and all the charm from its actors are what carry this film into cinematic history.North By Northwest is one of the greatest films ever made, both for its historic placement and it's utterly great story. It proves to be something more then a film, it's more of an adventure for the audience; we travel with Roger through this fantastic thriller, becoming apart of his venture. Possibly the greatest action adventure film ever made."
troy-53,"Jul 5, 2013",10/10,"If you are a Hitchcock fan, as I am, then this may be the best Hitchcock of all. ""North By Northwest"" has a little bit of everything: suspense, love, mystery, thriller intrigue, danger, and justice. Eva Marie Saint (Eve Kendall) has never been more beautiful, or more endearing as she is in this movie.Years ago I didn't really care for Cary Grant, but he has a way of growing on you, movie by movie, and he is never better that he is in this role as Roger O. Thornhill. I loved James Mason and a young Martin Landau in this movie as well. Well worth the 2 hours and 16 minutes of your time."
tcchelsey,"Jan 10, 2021",10/10,"Get the blu ray box. Released 2015. Superb.A heck of a lot of debate over NORTH BY NORTHWEST as to where it stands among Hitchcock's greatest films. Multitude of classic scenes that have gone on to be Hollywood legend. That much we all can agree on.A gemstone of a movie, meticulously assembled and cast by the master of suspense, an inspiration to present and future film makers. Best thing about any of Hitch's productions is the zigzag storyline, generally pitting the main character against all odds and lighting the fuse... Cary Grant is mistaken, rather simply --if not humorously -- as a gentleman who some international spies are very much interested in. The rest is up to him to prove otherwise and hopefully survive the ordeal.Dark comedy at its peak with some excellent characters to give Grant a run for his money. James Mason co-stars as his unrelenting adversary, and lovely Eva Marie Saint plays the ""mystery woman"" with a few skeletons in her own closet, perhaps needing him more than he needs her.Complicated, yes, but so entertaining. Tag it a contemporary movie serial. Outstanding supporting roles; Jessie Royce Landis playing Grant's wise-cracking mom, still treating him as if he were in high school. Martin Landau, spot on as a cold-blooded associate of Mason's (who you know is going to get his due) and Leo G. Carroll as the proverbial man with a plan.For architechts and art lovers, the house on the edge of the hill is a dream. Love those huge support beams and the long gravel driveway up to the place. Stunning. Don't forget that classic '59 white Lincoln.After decades of watching this adventure, the cornfield scene REMAINS a knockout. One you never ever get tired of, particularly Grant's arrival, stepping off a bus in the middle of nowhere. Hitchcock got it just right. Bullseye. One for film history books.Bernard Herrmann's music score, a star in its own right. Received the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Screenplay. Oscar nominations for Best Art and Set Decoration, Best Story and Screenplay. Why it did not win in these categories, good grief. Hitch was used to the abuse, moving on with PSYCHO.Forever on dvd and remastered color blu ray prints. Thanks to both MOVIES Net (lately) and TCM for making this a certifed Turner Classic."
mbrcf,"Jan 12, 2021",9/10,"This is one of the films that gets better and better with each viewing. The plot is rich to the point that is has something to reveal each and everytime I see this. There are several scenes in this film that are endless and revolutionary like the famous crop duster chase, the drunk conversation or the auction towards the third act. Cary Grant is at his best magical, effortless, enchanting presence here and the rest of the acting crew are great as well.This film is made by Sir Alfred Hitchcock at his untouchable and majestic artistic peak. Seated just between Vertigo (1958) and Psycho (1960), North by Northwest is just as influential and genre-defining as those two above. The film is truly the fore-father and pioneer to all of the spying thriller-action features that came about, including the very famous James Bond franchise."
Julius_Lang,"Jan 1, 2025",6/10,"I had high hopes for North By Northwest. Frequently regarded as a film among the greatest thrillers ever produced. Especially if they were directed by the master of suspense.If one desires to watch North By Northwest, merely watch everything before the Mount Rushmore scenes. That is the actual good portion of the film.I honestly couldn't get invested in any of the characters. Maybe I cared for Roger here and there. I didn't particularly care for the so-called 'plot-twist'.Visually speaking, it must have been extremely exciting for audiences back in 1959. Who could blame them? The iconic plane scene is extremely well done as is the 'climactic' Mount Rushmore scene."
Prismark10,"Oct 10, 2020",7/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest is regarded as laying the footprints for the modern spy action thrillers such as James Bond.The movie is well known for its iconic action scenes. Cary Grant being chased by a crop duster plane and the scenes on Mount Rushmore.Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is a suave advertising executive in New York who gets mistaken for George Kaplan during the cold war.The villains who trade in secrets with a foreign power want to kill Kaplan. The trouble for Thornhill is that Kaplan is a made up operative. He has been created to expose the bad guys led by smooth but deadly Phillip Vandamm (James Mason.)After a death at the UN building, Thornhill is wanted for murder and is on the run. On a train he meets Eve (Eva-Marie Saint) who helps him out but she seems to have her own agenda.Thornhill has no idea what is going on, why the villains are trying to kill him and what is Eve up to.If you actually miss the early portion of the film and see the scenes between Thornhill and Eve. You would think you have walked into a romantic comedy rather than an espionage thriller.North by Northwest effortless switches genres to take advantage of Grant's forte for light comedy. At its heart, this is an escapist action movie.The villains motives though seem hazy. While Vandamm is urbane, his henchman Leonard (Martin Landau) hiding a gay subtext is chillingly cold. They go through some convoluted lengths to finish off Thornhill. Maybe this was another inspiration for the Bond movies.The Professor (Leo G Carroll) tries to provide an explanation as to what is going on. MGM the studio who made this film were right. The film is too long and needed some judicious snipping. There is too much blue screen, at one point during the train journey the background is in sepia. Even the Mount Rushmore scenes look like studio set."
xbacon,"May 31, 2024",5/10,"I didn't realize it was a Hitchcock film, discovering that it was, was disappointing. It should've been so much better! The cars were awesome, but the story was absurd in several ways. A poorly written concept that defies logic in numerous ways some completely absurd. Using a crop duster? This was stupidity on and amplified level, sending Gila monsters would've made as much sense. The Mount Rushmore scene was completely absurd. Still, it definitely had a nostalgic allure, but could've easily been so much better had some thought gone into the writing. All the rave reviews are completely mystifying to me, as is the case with much in this world. Still, it's well worth a watch in spite of the nonsense."
sreearihant,"Oct 6, 2007",10/10,"This is not your average Hitchcock Movie. By ""Your average Hitchcock movie"" I mean stuff like Psycho,Marnie, Vertigo, Rear Window etc. which either have a very depressing end or a depressing protagonist.This movie is more an action Comnedy. The first 15 minutes had me in splits. Then the suspense comes on. Then the magnificent action sequences. The Crop dusting chase, the Mt.Rushmore sequences would give any Bond movie or any other pretentious Big Budget Actioner a run for their money.My only regret was that the protagonist was played by Cary Grant. He may have been a looker, but he looked plain old here. Bent back, drooping shoulders, the movie actually deserved Gregory Peck, who would've looked far better.Still, this is a must watch movie for any fan of cinema. A perfect entertainer.This one is due for a big budget remake."
ecarle,"Nov 13, 2003",10/10,"The great ""North by Northwest"" comes at the mid-point of entertainment film history.  When Alfred Hitchcock made it in 1959, it was the culmination of thrillers he had made:  30's British spy chase thrillers like ""The 39 Steps"" and 40's American World War II spy chase thrillers like ""Saboteur"" and ""Foreign Correspondent.""   ""North by Northwest"" was Hitchcock's greatest chase, part self-homage, part self-parody.All those chase movies came BEFORE ""North by Northwest,"" and then this midpoint movie influenced every action thriller that came AFTER it: ""North by Northwest"" led to James Bond which led to Indiana Jones which led to ""The Matrix.""But besides being historic, ""North by Northwest"" is as good as a classic gets:   three classic action set-pieces (the car, the crop-duster, Mount Rushmore), some of the wittiest dialogue in the history of movies;  Cary Grant at his best, James Mason at his best, Eva Marie Saint at her best. Spectacular modern fifties credit sequence by Saul Bass with Bernard Herrmann's exciting score (launched by the MGM lion's roar.)It's not ""The Matrix,"" but take a time machine back to 1959 and enjoy the most influential chase thriller of all time.And remember Cary Grant, as Roger Thornhill, delivering this great line:  "" I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives, and several bartenders waiting for me, and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed."""
allamericanpsycho21,"Nov 11, 2007",9/10,"One of the most interesting elements I found in ""North by Northwest"" was the way that Alfred Hitchcock toyed with the audience with the role of Eve Kendall. Here is a strong, sophisticated, and independent young woman that is neither played as a bitch nor merely eye candy for the hungry male audience. I have found that the crucial weakness of many movies of the 1950's and 60's is the fact that the strong woman must be punished for her independent instincts. In fact, this could easily be argued of many films today. A strong leading female character is just as rare in Hollywood today as it was fifty years ago. If the times have changed, many of the movies surely haven't.One of the many things that I found intriguing by the character of Eve Kendall was her ability to show empathy while, as the same time, staying true to herself. For example, take a look at the scene in which Roger Thornhill tells Eve, in a heartbreakingly real speech, just how much her deception has betrayed him. Even in this scene, where Eve is the ""bad guy"", she is able to show just how much she deeply cares for this man. Maybe it's a sign of great acting or exceptional directing (the close up shot of her just as he leaves is incredible) but, either way, this is a character that we rarely see in movies today.Here is a character that is not only sexual but innocent. She is neither exploited for her actions nor is she looked down on for being a female of carnal needs. If Roger is unsure and wary about sex, Eve knows exactly what she wants and what she shall get. In this aspect alone, ""North by Northwest"" was a movie years ahead of its time."
chris-politz,"Sep 24, 2019",10/10,"Easily the most influential of Hitchcock's Movies, and does for action movies what Psycho did for horror. All action film that follow will be marked by the touch of Hitchcock. It's more or less a mistaken identity spy action yarn which relies on a series of set pieces, which is the hallmark of action even today. So influential that it gave birth to the premises of Bond films.Love this movie"
Pulpthatsfiction,"Nov 8, 2007",10/10,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This was the first Alfred Hitchcock Film I had seen and I am very impressed. Cary Grant and James Mason do a brilliant job and should have got Oscars. This film has a great story even though that it's used a lot and I think it's one of the best screenplay ever written. there's no doubt that this is Hitchcock's best film. It has everything they say whats so good about is film making. James Mason does one of the best villain. This is a great film and has some of the best acting and this is the best Alfred Hitchcock Film. I highly recommend this film to anyone that like great films.
Gov_William_J_LePetomane,"Apr 12, 2019",6/10,"What I liked: The acting was good. Some of the dialogue was good. The Mt. Rushmore shots were fun, by and large, and the final shot of the train barreling into a tunnel is just too hilariously suggestive not to like. What I didn't like: well, there sure are a lot of far-fetched a-goin's on, aren't there? Thornhill does precious little objecting in regards to his kidnapping. And attempting to get rid of Kaplan by pouring bourbon down his gullet and crashing a car? That's the best they can do? And Vandamm and company simply commandeer the Townsend manse? Is it that easy to do, to just waltz into the home of UN diplomat and take it over? Thornhill gets on the train to Chicago without a ticket too easily. And why not just do a drive-by while Thornhill is waiting in that Indiana cornfield? Killing him from a plane is easier than that? And the final sequence of switching from the scene with Eve dangling from Mt. Rushmore, to Thornhill pulling Eve up into bed - at first I thought it was awfully hokey. But I can also see another side to it: Hitchcock perhaps snubbing his nose at the usual damsel in distress being saved finale that everyone was expecting. Oh, and the laughter of everyone in that elevator to the line ""You aren't really trying to kill my son, are you?"" was bizarre and nonsensical."
barevfilm,"Nov 22, 2018",10/10,"Action and suspense: A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies,
Asking which is the best Hitchcock is something like asking which is the best Beethoven symphony, but if pressed to the wall I would call NBNW Hitchcock's Ninth (and Psycho, his Fifth).
The coolest of Grant and the hottest of Marie Saint is simply
the coolest film ever made from every angle you can think of.
Few people would contend that Cary Grant was not the coolest leading man of Hollywood's golden age but this pic is the peak of his coolness, along with that the coolest James Mason ever as the smoothest polite villain of all time and the slinkiest Eva Marie Saint ever, all adds up to one of the most satisfying pieces of celluloid entertainment ever conceived.
Most Hitchcock movies have one unforgettable white knuckle cliff hanger sequence but NBNW has two -- the chase out in the wheatfields by a poisonous crop duster biplane and the final chase across the faces of the four presidents at Mount Rushmore, which ends up literally ... as a cliffhanger.
Even a third if you include the comical auction scene where Grant keeps making outrageous bids to attract the police and thus escape the clutches of the killers lurking in the room waiting to get him.
So much has been written about this picture that there is no need to recount the plot other to say that it is a towering masterpiece of the romantic suspense drama genre with all players at the top of their game - and don't forget a young menacing Martin Landau as Mason's cold blooded sidekick, another great actor who just passed away on July 15, 2017 at age 89.
NBNW is frequently rerun on TV so it's not hard to catch up with but it never gets old or fails to make you hold your breath even when you know what's coming next. An ultimate classic."
moonspinner55,"Oct 15, 2007",7/10,"Smashing suspense-thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock stars Cary Grant as an ordinary Madison Avenue businessman who is falsely accused of being a spy and a killer, jetting all over the States to solve the tangled mystery. Even when covered with crop-dust, Grant always appears dapper and dry-as-a-martini; both he and this classy adventure hold up extremely well, with Master of Suspense Hitchcock keenly using the patented ""wrong man"" plot just up to a point. With its amusingly inconsequential title, the screenplay is taut yet clever and droll, and the supporting cast (including James Mason as an icily controlled villain and Martin Landau as a faintly fey henchman) does some fabulous work. Even Eva Marie Saint seems to relax here (she's quite sexy and saucy; her best line--an early one aboard the train about making love on an empty stomach--got dubbed over, which hopefully will be corrected someday). Hitch keeps it all snappy and running smoothly, done with a wink and some sly innuendo. *** from ****"
j.pasteur,"Feb 16, 2003",N/A,"A classic film of a classic 'Hitchcockian' case of mistaken identity, this is essentially a remake of THE 39 STEPS - but considerably expanded to make use of glorious technicolour and to emphasize the paranoia that can develop from a man feeling pushed to his very limit by events and circumstances maliciously controlled by others. As usual, Hitch has a cameo in his own film: #Man Missing Departing Bus, at the very beginning!Overgrown mummy's boy but successful advertizing executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for 'George Kaplan,' a CIA-created 'legend' (the intelligence community's jargon for the name and biography invented to hide operatives' real identities) designed to decoy Van Dam (James Mason), agent provocateur of an unspecified foreign power, away from their genuine agent's activities. To prove his innocence, Fairburn must be 'Kaplan' so as to draw Van Dam and his men out and expose them. Nevertheless, 'the memorable scenes' are indeed memorable: the cropduster and the dénoument dangling off Mount Rushmore.Glamour is provided by the very fine Eve Marie-Saint, who demonstrates that 'they just don't make 'em like they used to' ... women simply do not have that glamorous mystique anymore (nor do cameramen have soft-focus lenses, apparently); nowadays, what you see is what you get: very little subtlety, but a lot of bare flesh and squelchy kissing. Come on, film-makers, do leave us something to the imagination - that's what the nickelodeon chaps made films to be all about, remember!I first saw this film when I was 13, in a hotel in St. Dogmaels in Wales. A boy & girl combo came into the TV room and the film managed to desist their squelchy kissing. An elderly couple entered during the ad-break and the chap rather pompously asked if we could switch over for The News. The rest of us thereupon trooped down to the cellar-room, where, unheated (this was still Britain in the 1970s), the remainder of the film was viewed and thoroughly enjoyed. In fact, the cold probably added to the film's atmosphere ...Stalwart and calm Leo G. Carroll, the 'professor,' played this same sort of rôle again the followed decade, as 'General Waverley,' stalwart and calm commander of the United Network for Communications & Law Enforcement - ""When one has manners, one need never apologize ..."" Quite so!"
captainot,"Mar 4, 2000",10/10,"It's all too simple really.  Hitchcock used this plot device before in many of his films; the innocent man caught up in circumstances beyond his control (""The Wrong Man"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"").  However, never will you see Hitchcock use this device more cleverly and stylishly as in ""North By Northwest.""Cary Grant plays the innocent man like, well, Cary Grant.  Add James Mason as the villain (Mason has a great voice... close your eyes sometimes when watching...chilling!), Martin Landau as his henchman, and Eva Marie Saint as the cool blonde equals a great film.What other Hitchcock film can boast of not one but two famous suspense scenes?  Cary Grant being chased down by a dustcropper will be talked about and studied in film schools for years to come.  The chase across Mt. Rushmore is a perfect way to climax the film as well...There are smaller things to look for too.  Watch for the famous kid in the snack shop who covers his ears seconds before a gun is shot and why did Hitchcock use THAT image over ""The End""??? Hehehe..."
The Movie Buff,"Mar 2, 2002",10/10,"I have one word to say about this movie...........WOW!!!!!!! What an excellent movie that was light years ahead of its time.  If it came out today, it would still be ahead of its time.  This was arguably the first big hollywood budget film, and boy was it worth every penny.  The scenary is magnificent.  Most of the film was filmed at actual locations, not some cheap hollywood set(well okay rushmore was a little fake). I was unsure what would happen next throughout the whole movie. Its probably the only movie I have ever watched, where each prediction I made about what would happen next, was wrong.  The plot twisted many times, yet in the end it all made perfect sense.  The audience didnt have to think about the movie after seeing it to figure it out.  Yea Pyscho was a heart pounder, but this is by far Hitchock's best film.  I would put it in my top ten of all-time."
LW-08854,"Dec 25, 2023",7/10,"The plot of the story is kind of thriller in which an ordinary man is thrown into a life and death game of conspiracies in which he has no basic idea what is going on or who is after him. The film is pretty handsome to look at, especially on a big screen with a nice HD transfer. The film is surprisingly good fun and the villain is absolute perfection. I even liked quite a bit of the art and production design. It has a few cheesy elements, including a certain scene which happens at the UN which is all a bit too easy. The cast though all do a good job and any weakness in the story are fairly small. Most viewers will be able to have a good time with this movie."
SPZMaxinema,"Apr 21, 2022",8/10,The only negatives that I have with the film are how abruptly it ended and how it lacked showing the main character's life coming back together after his whole ordeal/adventure.

Marc_Israel_365,"Jun 9, 2013",7/10,"When seeing an older ""classic"" film for the first time, it is difficult to not see the many films and genders it influenced. Purchased the DVD because it was rated so highly on IMDb and was on sale. Time hasn't deteriorated this gem too much, at least where it counted in the performances of Cary Grant and Eve Marie Saint. This classy duo and their coming together seemed to be a Bond film in the making. And despite the espionage element, it was the humor and double entendre dialog that carried the action. The espionage in itself, didn't age well, but knowing the actors James Mason and Martin Landau, added some recognition excitement where the fake sets failed to stir a reaction. ""Roger...

Jonny_Numb,"Apr 18, 2006",5/10,"Had I been alive in 1959 and capable of seeing ""North by Northwest,"" I probably would have gotten up and left the theater halfway through--not because it's a poorly made film, but because it exists, to this day, for no other purpose than to jerk the viewer around to the point of cold indifference.Alfred Hitchcock enjoyed playing his audience like a piano, and while I have no problem with that, all his notes are out of tune here. One part vanity piece, one part spy thriller, ""North by Northwest"" has innocent Everyman Cary Grant on the run after being framed for a diplomat's murder; Eva Marie Saint is the femme fatale who may or may not be playing both sides; and James Mason is some sort of vaguely-defined heavy masterminding everything. Unlike Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho"" or Jon Finch in ""Frenzy,"" Grant is filled with too much winking, boyish charm to ever convey a sense of consequence for his character; Marie Saint is presented as more of a plot device than a character; and Mason brings a fair amount of class to his limited scenes.Maybe I was expecting something different, and therefore kept waiting for ""North by Northwest"" to turn into the tense, gripping thriller it has been hailed as. Ultimately, only a director with Hitchcock's pedigree could get away with a project so flagrantly self-indulgent and impossibly plotted and still earn a slew of sycophantic raves. Perhaps I took it too seriously, but ""North by Northwest"" is an incredibly empty romp that's high on style, but precious little else.4.5/10"
RyanCShowers,"Aug 14, 2013",N/A,"North by Northwest: The feeling I got during North by Northwest initially wasn't a great one. I couldn't focus on what was being shown to me on the screen, something about the story was off-putting, even the directing didn't settle with me at first. Once I relaxed into my chair and gave it a go, I had no regrets and enjoyed myself. As I watched it I realized how much of an impact this single movie had on the industry at the time of its release. Some of the stunts are incredible and the magnitude is just bigger and better than what was in movies at that time. It's Hitchcock's biggest film; it's not bloated, but it covers the territory necessary to best an iconic action thriller. Hitchcock stages everything well here, making the action feel innocent enough to not fall into the ""Action Movie"" stereotypes of today clichéd blockbusters. The roots of the action pieces are in suspense and timing. North by Northwest had great scope with unexpected instruments in the plot to further the film.Rating: AGrade: 9/10"

MovieLooker,"Mar 28, 2002",9/10,"Very few movies have reached the level of sophistication found in Hitchcock's masterpiece North By Northwest.  Many critics believe, myself included, that the entire James Bond series owes a debt to North by Northwest for showing the way to make a spy themed story with a bit of the tongue in cheek.  However, no Bond film comes close to North by Northwest for brilliance and sheer thrills.This movie is epic in scope and you can feel it the second the opening titles begin.  It starts at a kinetic pace and never lets up.  Many before me have described the plot outline so without rehashing, let me just say that believability is not the movie's strong suit.  In fact, it is about as ridiculous a storyline as you can imagine.  That's not the point.  The experience, the rollercoaster of an adventure it takes you on -- as so many great Hitchcock pictures -- is the point.  If you haven't seen this picture, you are in for a real treat.  Don't miss it."
Prince-P,"Sep 15, 2025",8/10,"In several interviews, Alfred Hitchcock has mentioned that ""Vertigo"" was a personal favorite among his own works. So, it must have been depressing for the director when that particular picture became such a disappointment at the box office. But persistence is the key to success. Hitchcock immediately began preparing for a new production. And this time, he planned to return to a plotline that had worked for him so often before. Hitchcock's new film would deal with the desperate journey a wronged man is forced to make, pursued by various spies and government agents.James Stewart, who had played the male lead in ""Vertigo"", was apparently expecting to be in Hitchcock's new movie as well. But as the director prepared to begin ""North by Northwest,"" he declared that the actor was too old for the picture. Hitchcock then gave the starring role to Cary Grant, despite Grant being four years older than Stewart. Something that led many punters to believe that the two men must have had some altercation during their work together.Alfred Hitchcock usually preferred to make his films on one of Hollywood's primary sound stages. The so-called ""Master of Suspense"" was something of a perfectionist and, therefore, wanted complete control over his productions. But obviously, the sequence where a single-engine airplane chases Cary Grant over a barren cornfield was impossible to shoot back in the studio. Hitchcock, therefore, had no choice but to take his entire crew with him and go outdoors.To Alfred Hitchcock's undisguised delight, ""North by Northwest"" became a smash hit with the audience. Which wasn't really surprising. In the film, the director had been able to utilize his full arsenal of studio trickery. With Cary Grant in the lead role, he also had access to the number-one box office star of the time. However, after ""North by Northwest,"" the master of suspense wanted to take his career in a whole new direction. And he sure did. Hitchcock's next film was ""Psycho."""
denverbill,"Mar 31, 2001",10/10,"For those who love Hitchcock, this is the pinnacle of the Master's power. A story written to specifically be the ultimate ""Hitch"" film. This time it is Cary Grant playing the everyman caught in a web he can't get out of, with able support from Eva Marie Saint as the requisite blonde, and James Mason as the villian. Perhaps the greatest asset is the music by Bernard Herrmann, surely his best work in pictures. All in all, a suspenseful masterpiece. Top 20 choice for sure."

Vartiainen,"Dec 3, 2018",6/10,"If you had to name Alfred Hitchcock's two most influential films, you could not go wrong with Vertigo and Psycho. Both are dark psychological thrillers that delve deep into the human psyche, in which you can trust no one or anything, and even though, according to the customs of the time, the good guys win in the end, they're not what we would call clean victories.North by Northwest happens to be the film Hitchcock filmed in between these two monoliths. And it's clear he had decided that he needed a break, because by his standards this is almost a holiday film. But, it's still very much a Hitchcock film. The camerawork is superb and rather noticeable, but in a good way. The characters have that Hitchcock feel to them. And the plot is still a mystery story.But somehow it feels more lighthearted than usual. And I think it is the dialogue that's to blame. Plus the music that's almost frivolous in tone. This is a spy thriller where gorgeous men and women exchange witty one-liners over martini glasses, the villains twirl their mustaches and the death traps defy all expectations. It is almost like a proto Roger Moore James Bond film, over a decade in advance.And yet it is a Hitchcock film, with all the goodies that usual implies. Aside from the nail-biting corkscrew of piling tension, that is. Is it his best film? Nah, but it's a breath of fresh air if you've watched a whole bunch of his films and want something a bit lighter, but still in the same style."
cmantafounis,"Sep 22, 2021",8/10,"Pure movie magic: Hitchcock at his pulpiest, an exercise in sheer entertainment. Comparisons to James Bond here are not just pertinent in regards to the genre and characters, but all the more so in style - this exists on the same plane as Raiders of the Lost Ark in its elevation from any semblance of reality. On this level, Thornhill being forced to drink a bottle of bourbon and then to drive a stolen vehicle is not out of the ordinary. A plan to kill him involving a deserted road and a crop duster is perfectly logical. His dialogue with Eve Kendall, mostly consisting of explicit innuendo, is completely natural in this heightened world exclusive to films. Led by a charming Cary Grant performance, an ecstatic Bernard Hermann score, and plenty of Alfred Hitchcock's visual flair, North by Northwest is designed solely as a moviegoing experience. At 136 minutes, this lacks the sleekness of his earlier spy capers (e.g. The 39 Steps) but more than makes up for it in craft. Any pacing issues in the second act - and occasional instances of clunky exposition - are paid back tenfold with a dazzling final half-hour. A suffocating masterwork of suspense in Vandamm's house (note the ""fake gun"" reveal used here, successfully, *three* times), an iconic chase scene down Mount Rushmore, and a sudden cut so perfectly suited to the tone that one smiles just thinking of it. And, of course, that marvellous final shot. A climax indeed. This may not be as artful or as flawlessly executed as some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, but I'll be damned if it isn't his most fun."
HotToastyRag,"Jul 2, 2018",7/10,"There are so many iconic elements to North by Northwest, from Bernard Herrmann's complicated score, to the chase scene between Cary Grant and an airplane, to Eva Marie Saint's come-on, ""I don't particularly like the book I'm reading,"" to the location of the end action scene. While everyone has their favorite parts to the movie, mine are not the most famous. My favorite scene is when Cary Grant drunkenly phones his mother from the police station. It's easily the funniest scene in the film, and I happen to adore Cary when he's in his humorous element. My favorite line in the film has become a frequently used household phrase of my family's: James Mason, in one of his iconic villainous roles, smirks at Cary and asks, ""Games . . . must we?"" in his imitable accent. It's hilarious, and we frequently say, ""James . . . must we?"" instead when we joke about him or his movies.I don't really like North by Northwest, even though I've seen it over a dozen times. It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films, and everyone in my family really likes it, so it was one of the classics I was raised on as a kid. In general, I find Hitchcock's movies to be a little slow, and I don't think Eva Marie Saint is as appealing as her role necessitates. If it weren't for Cary and James, I'd probably never watch this movie, but their energies together are great fun to watch. They were friends in real life, and when they verbally spar, it almost feels like they're playing a-dare I say it?-game.The plot is always a very intriguing one: an innocent misunderstanding leads certain people to believe Cary Grant has a different name, and he becomes implicated in a very dangerous situation. Since Cary's entirely innocent, it's easy to root for him, but since James is so charming and funny, it's incredibly easy to root for him, too. Aren't the best stories the ones where you're torn between rooting for the bad and good guys? If you think so, you'll probably really like North by Northwest. If you don't end up liking it, then you can ask the screen, ""James . . . must we?"""
aj84,"Nov 11, 2003",1/10,"This film is a poor mans James Bond. Hitchcock might be the master of suspense but he sure ain't the master of spy thrillers as this film goes from bad to worse. This may have been mildly interesting in the fifties/sixties, however a modern viewer must find this film very boring. This has no place in the top 250, let alone the top 20. If you like Hitchcock I would watch this and compare to his over classics. If Hitchcock doesn't float your boat, avoid at all costs"
Michael_Elliott,"Mar 12, 2008",N/A,"North By Northwest (1959)**** (out of 4)Cary Grant has the police and killers chasing him from NY to Chicago to Mount Rushmore in this Alfred Hitchcock classic that's certainly among his best films. I'd probably put this at #5 on my list. I personally see this as a greatest hits collection from Hitchcock and it's certainly one of the greatest adventure films out there. Grant is amazing in the role and nails the comedy and delivers in the action scenes. I didn't really warm up to Grant until last year but he's quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. The grace he shows floating from scene to scene is great to watch and that British humor comes off perfectly in the film. James Mason and Martin Landau are great as well.Once again I was at the Louisville Palace to see this with a crowd of over 2300 people!!!! The first showing had around that number as well so I'm sure the manager is very happy as well. I have a certain friend who can identify himself if he wishes that says younger folks don't enjoy these older films but you certainly wouldn't be able to tell that from these screenings. Black, white, young, old and even a blind person was in attendance, which is great to see. What I really love about seeing older films in theaters is those there seeing it for the first time. I knew this film very well so I knew where the jokes were, where the suspense was and so on. It's great seeing the reaction of those people seeing the movie for the first time."
rollernerd,"Apr 16, 2021",8/10,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's Hitchcock movie review Is North By Northwest (1959), an action thriller where we the story has the same elements as previous Hitchcock flicks - an advertising executive gets mixed up as a wrong man and soon is accused of a crime he did not commit. This New York executive is Roger Thornhill, played brilliantly by the suave Cary Grant. Thornhill is pursued by a pack of thugs after he is mistaken for a government agent spy known as George Kaplan and we movie goers found ourselves on a cross-country journey. But the question begins on who really is Kaplan and maybe Thornhill is Kaplan?The story of the movie is smart by keeping you on the edge, constantly giving us guessing games yet provides you a few answers here and there in a timely fashion while providing you a comic, adventure-caper type flick. And that is what Hitchcock does very well in this entertaining suspenseful flick, he balances out between seriousness and silliness. All this is largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant who not just plays your everyday man but also gives you his trademark jerky movements and exasperated facial expressions. Whether Grant is forced drunk and driving a car to get away from the goons while trying to avoid driving over the cliff's edge, or his expression when his mother asks the would-be assassin whether they want to kill his son which leads to the other people in the lift laughing hysterical - you see his expressions that summarises the film's atmosphere while beginning to question whether this bloke is who he says he is. It flirts with the idea of identity.The plot's MacGuffin allows the Thornhill to move seamlessly across iconic American landscapes by means of plane, train and automobile. There are so many great and iconic scenes in this film - the crop duster chase of course and also those at the United Nations and Mount Rushmore. Coming to the that crop duster scene...before this scene we see a man who comes across as slightly clumsy and under his mother's thumb, but he evolves once it is clear that he's been marked and is a target for a sinister plot. So what happens? He becomes more assertive in taking matters into his own hands.The crop duster scene...have to chat about it folks. As soon as Thornhill is off the bus, stood in the middle of nowhere, the music stops. The audience is alone with him in the vast space of this landscape which is in the middle of no where, which is a clever decision made by Hitchcock as it effectively boxes the character in with four shots; an invisible wall. And then you have the crop duster plane...what happens is a game of cat-and-mouse. When the plane turns its attentions towards him and attack and when Grant turns to the camera with the stuttered movements, you see his survival instinct kicking in is one of Hitchcock's strongest moments. Grant's performance is perfect in his change of running style. Throughout the film, his run has still been comedic, lanky, wide-eyed. Here it is an expression of bare-faced fear as he runs and takes brief cover in a crop. I wont tell you what happens next but wow oh wow.Another great element in this flick is Hitch's musical maestro partner, Bernard Herrmann whose score drives the flick's constant momentum. Smart as it reflects the tone of the flick. The femme fatale played by Eva Marie Sant is performed brilliantly as this alluring woman with a dubious and enigmatic nature - again you question who is she really?? I could literally chat about this flick on and on - do yourself a favour a have a crack, overall 8.5/10."
Hitch-26,"Sep 2, 2000",10/10,"I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie.  This movie has everything.  It has action, drama, comedy, lively music(thank you Bernard Herrmann), great costumes(thank you Edith Head), and of course outstanding performances not only by Hitch in directing, but in acting with Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Jessie Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll(He was in every Hitch movie it seemed), and Martin Landau(in his first film role--he was brilliant as Leonard).  I love the way Cary Grant says things in such a deadpan way like when he says early in the movie, ""Don't tell me where we going, surprise me!""  Although long, you will not be bored for a single second.  It is really hard for me to believe that Ben-Hur was that great. This movie should have won several oscars.  The end is very memorable as well although I won't give it away.  This movie had several memorable scenes although without question Cary Grant running from the plane is probably the most famous and one of the most famous in all of movies.  One curious note is that Jessie Royce Landis, who also appeared with Grant in To Catch a Thief, plays Grant's mother although Grant is 10 months older than her! Also, make sure you pay attention to the kid in the cafeteria who sticks his fingers in his ears a tad too early!  It is a shame that when people mention Hitchcock's name, they think of the horror stuff like Psycho or The Birds or they think of the taut thrillers like Vertigo or Rear Window.  Not that there is anything wrong with these movies, it is just that nobody thinks he can direct such a non-stop action picture like this.  It may have been the most atypical Hitch movie ever in terms of style, but I feel it is his greatest ever.  If you have never seen this movie, you got to go see it now--you'll be glad that you did.  I'll leave with another one of my favorite lines in the movie that Cary Grant says to Eva Marie Saint, ""How does a girl like you become a girl like you?""  WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!"
h-28658,"Apr 21, 2020",8/10,"It holds up well over time despite its very dated aesthetic because of the irresistibly engaging performances from the main cast. It amounts to a surprisingly leisurely ride through the espionage and mystery, and the famous Mount Rushmore chase is solid, albeit abrupt. The dialogue is gorgeous and refreshing, especially these days when writing in films is often so sloppy. The plot is interesting enough to keep the audience's attention without attempting to pose a big enough distraction to detract from the character moments which really comprise the heart of the film."
Storm3p,"May 6, 2020",10/10,"This is another masterpiece by Hitchcock, tells the story of mistaken identities as a man runs for his life from unknown forces of evil. Doing his best to follow directions along the way the spiderweb only gets deeper. The film uses fantastic set pieces and set design, mixed with flawless cinematography and editing. The orchestral soundtrack alone sets this film apart for greatness. The story telling and dialogue are superb and any audience member will be riveted while watching to the end."
kluseba,"Jan 5, 2019",7/10,"North by Northwest, which has horrible translations to French with La mort aux trousses and German with Der unsichtbare Dritte, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movies. This vivid action-thriller and spy epic has influenced franchises like James Bond and many others. Despite a certain nostalgic charm regarding clothes, lifestyles and settings, the movie has aged quite well and is still very entertaining sixty years after its initial release and beyond.The story revolves around a charming advertising executive who is mistaken for a secret agent, kidnapped, poisoned and left for dead. He survives by chance but nobody seems to believe his story and he is instead charged with driving under the influence. The ambitious young man desires to clear his name and starts investigating. Soon enough, he is in the middle of a dangerous conflict between a shady businessman and his associates and the real government agents he has been mistaken for. Along with a mysterious woman who befriends and helps him on a train ride, he travels northwest through the United States of America to figure out what he has been involved with.North by Northwest convinces on numerous levels. The story is twisted, mysterious and dynamic as it will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The iconic action sequences have stood the test of time and are still breathtaking to watch. The unfirgettable locations are chosen with care, intellect and precision. The camera work is very precise and still an example to follow by contemporary standards. The acting performances are charismatic and especially the lead character is truly unique.There are only two minor elements that need to be criticized. The female lead character feels somewhat superficial as she almost instantly falls in love with a perfect stranger despite her pivotal role in the story. Another thing that bothered me was the abrupt ending which could have been a little bit more fluid without overstaying its welcome.Still, North by Northwest is a movie you should watch at least once in your lifetime if you like crime films in general and spy movies in particular."
rufusotis,"Jan 10, 2021",10/10,"I don't think this could be improved in any way. The cinematography is beyond critique! This is, IMHO, the best of all Hitchcock's movies and really doesn't seem particularly dated, compared to other films from this era. If it were cast now, I think Roger Thornhill would be George Clooney, and Eve Kendall would be maybe Evan Rachel Wood... but it really couldn't be better."
kfurnas,"May 27, 2000",7/10,"It's interesting for a younger generation to watch movies such as ""North by Northwest"" to see just how much recent movies rip off original ideas.""North by Northwest"" is a spectacular suspense movie (I would not classify it as a thriller or action), with a keen script and even keener delivery of the lines. Cary Grant is commanding in his role as a fugitive from the law, while Eva Marie Grant is captivating as the femme fatale.I did have my problems with the film. As with most movies of the period, it dragged on at points. While Grant and Saint have a nice on-screen chemistry, Hitchcock at times dwells too much on the duo and not enough on the intriguing storyline.Plus, the movie has unnecessary exposition. There is a lot of emphasis on making the viewer realize Grant's character is a fast-thinking businessman at the opening of the movie, but the story never gets back to that. Grant's character never really has the chance to evolve, he just simply changes.But overall, this movie triumphs because of the pace at which the viewer learns interesting details. Unlike most current Hollywood flicks in which the viewer has to wait until the end to learn anything (and the rest of the movie is spent trying to guess its secrets), ""North by Northwest"" lays down all its cards well before the movie's climax. The result is a story that is interesting throughout the entire film, as well as proof of Hitchcock's genius in direction."
jonas-adolfsson,"Jan 8, 2005",4/10,"One of the big IL' movies. Hitchcock. Cary Grant. 8.6 here at IMDb! This move, along with a lot of other ""golden oldies"", are given much too high ratings at IMDb. I argue that the reason for this over rating is that people review movies as if it was sports and not art. Let me explain ;) When you review a world cup soccer match from the 50:s you must take into consideration that the game was much slower, the tactics simple, and that the players were not very well trained, compared to today that is. The world cup final between West Germany and Hungary in 1954 was top quality entertainment, performed by world class artists, if you looked at it 1954. If you look at it today the first thing that strikes you is how much everything has improved. Put simply,the world cup winners of 1954 would not win one match in any division two series in Europe today. But still we can look at the cup final from -54 and say, yeah that was a great game, considering it was played 50 years ago. With art, it's another story. You don't consider, or rather, shouldn't consider, age as a factor. You won't hear anyone say - Yeah, Picasso painted some good shiit back in his days, but he could never compete with today's artists. The same goes for Mozart, Beethoven, Leonardo, Michelangelo etc etc. My argument is that the movie art should be treated as any other art form.Let's apply this to the movie in question. Acting: I would like anyone that gave this movie a rating over 6-7 to look at the car chase scene one more time and tell me what they think of Cary Grants acting in that scene. I can tell you all that one of my friends, at age 15, acted drunk better than old Cary did here. (And nobody even believed that my friend was drunk.) It pisses me off when someone says that the acting is superb in this movie. It is an insult to all actors of today.Plot: I won't bore you with an analysis. Lets just state that the plot is unbelievable and some scenes ridiculous.Script: Hitchcock is said to be the master of suspense. In North by Northwest the suspense level is so low that not even a ten year old would get a pulse from watching it. The dialogue is however smart and funny.Conclusion: Bad acting. Unbelievable plot. Pretty funny. Extremely overrated. 4/10. If you are hungry for a Hitchcock flick, watch Rear window instead."
guru-12,"Oct 24, 1999",10/10,"Hitchcock was always celebrated for his beautifully articulated sense of humor.  In this movie, that mixes so fantastically well with Cary Grant's natural sense of comedy that we come away having seen both a tight, suspenseful thriller and perhaps Hitchcock's most amusing work.  All in all, such an entertaining film that even those who find Hitchcock overrated (and there aren't a whole lot of them) will love it.  This is a fine picture and perhaps my favorite Hitch film ever."
Thisguy622,"Jan 17, 2013",8/10,"What if it were us against the world? What if one day we were to find that we were rogues on the run from people who are telling us that we are rogues on the run? I've imagined this scenario many times and Hitchcock nows how to tell it better than any.This is one of the first great thrillers, so many twists, so many turns that the viewer could miss the clues to vital information very easily so assure that you pay attention to both the primary things and the secondary things.There is really not much more to say about this film without revealing too much apart from Cary Grant giving another great performance as the guy on the run.There is some great, cheesy and surprisingly witty pieces of dialog in here and by the films conclusion everything is pieced together neatly.North By Northwest= 8.5/10"
robbiejames-17251,"Nov 16, 2020",10/10,"In Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" (1959), Hitchcock's creates possibly his most unique film to date. At the time, Hitchcock's films, while great, were beginning to be considered a little stale and repetitive. That is, until ""North by Northwest"" (1959). In this film, many different genres come together to create a film that goes down as one of the all time classics. With comedy, drama and action all blended together, the phonemail camera work is able to on full display. The classic ""crop-duster scene"" is a scene most people have likely seen before, whether or not they've seen the film before."
ctcpolo,"Apr 12, 2021",10/10,"North by Northwest is a sharp and diverse film, and one of my favorites I've seen from Hitchcock so far. Hitchcock incorporated comedy, action, and romance, with a heavy dose of action. He transfers between scenes very smoothly, and he seems to cut at just the right moment. The cinematography uses lots of zooming shoots, that come into focus on one thing. One of my favorite shots of he film was when the main character was walking through a packed train station. Even though there were tons of other people, the camera seemed to track the main character perfectly so you stayed focused on him. Also the aspect of parts of the film being on a train added a lot of opportunity for close quarters, and cool shots and angles."
CuriosityKilledShawn,"Mar 4, 2012",7/10,"Made 3 years before James Bond made spy movies extremely popular, North by Northwest sometimes comes across as a bit of a caper instead of something more serious, but it has enough going on to keep you interested, even over 136 minutes, a running time few Bond films have exceeded.Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, an NY adman who lives a fast and loose lifestyle. When he's mistaken for an enigmatic spy called George Kaplan his is hurled into a partially confusing plot involving cold war traitors, secret agents and double agents. Thornhill travels up and down and across the country trying to outwit his pursuers and find out what the hell is going on, all while romancing Eva Marie Saint, with Bernard Herrmann boisterous score propelling him along.It's another one of Hitchcock's 'wrong man' thrillers, and probably the best (however, I do rate Saboteur highly). But it IS still a bit overrated. It's shot very well, in many different locations, and there's little, if anything, to dislike about it. But like many early Bond movies there are many scenes where you can easily tell that the characters are just walking on a treadmill with a rear-projection behind them instead of physically being in actual locations. It doesn't spoil anything, though it is always noticeable."
laceup-96849,"Dec 27, 2020",8/10,"One of the best film of 1950s and of all time, very entertaining and well made"
CinemaSerf,"Dec 28, 2023",7/10,"""Thornhill"" (Cary Grant) is your typically fast-talking advertising executive who is meeting some folks for a drink when he is mistaken for a ""Mr. Caplan"". Whisked off at gunpoint to meet ""Vandamm"" (James Mason) and his henchman ""Leonard"" (Martin Landau) his protestations of innocence just get him pumped full of booze and put behind the wheel of a car, the likely suspect of a murder investigation. He has to stay one step ahead of the pursuing police now as he tries to get his life back, a task made more difficult by his encounter with the charmingly enigmatic ""Eve"" (a rather static Eva Marie Saint) whom he is not entirely sure he can trust. What Hitchcock delivers now is a slowly unravelling adventure mystery with loads of red herrings, plenty of well written and executed humour from Grant and a gradually accruing sense of menace as we finally realise just what is going on. The photography is intimate one moment, all-encompassing the next, the crop dusting scene is the stuff of cinema legend and I challenge any non-American to name the fourth bloke atop Mount Rushmore at the end. To be fair, that denouement wasn't my favourite - it's a bit rushed and rather convenient, but this is still a stylishly produced thriller, with an exciting score from Bernard Herrmann that still stands the test of time."
christophe92300,"Mar 4, 2013",5/10,"North By Northwest starts pretty well: it's intriguing, tense, captivating. Not for long unfortunately, because after barely about 30 minutes, the pace, suspense, tension, drop significantly and the movie becomes totally convenient and linear until the final outcome.Hitchcock piles up overlong passages such as the train trip and the romance between Roger and Eve that seemed endless, and questionable ideas like the plane scene or the final chase at Mount Rushmore, unrealistic and ending the film in the most abrupt way. And that is only a small part of the conveniences and incoherences that badly discredit the script.Under these circumstances, how can this movie be considered an all time classic ? Yes, the direction and mise-en-scène are good, if you put aside the dated special effects and extensive use of matte paintings, but that hardly compensates for a mediocre scenario."
andyrogers,"May 13, 2001",10/10,"Having just received the DVD for my birthday, I have spent many hours watching this classic movie.  Listening to the ""making of"" documentary and the commentary by Ernest Lehman dubbed over the movie it is hard to believe that this film was largely forgotten because of the new wave of action movies ie Mr Connery and friends.  Even though nearly every secret is revealed on the DVD, this only helps to enhance the impact of every scene and visual.  Incredibly, Ernest Lehman did not know how to end the movie at Mount Rushmore until he came up with the idea that Eve shots Roger in the dining room area.  Cherish every scene and every line of dialogue as Cary Grant delivers some very funny lines at the expense of the bad guys.  By the way, it's true, Martin Landau was a very strange looking guy at the time and an absolute perfect piece of casting in the role of the sinister and some would say homosexual Leonard.  The very last ""train zooming into a tunnel"" scene may be a little corny, but you've probably had enough suspense (in the cornfield?) thanks to Hitch and Bernard Hermann's rousing score (that tune just gets to you after a while).Sit back and enjoy the master at work."
IamROCKAS,"Jan 15, 2021",10/10,"This movie is great because for the majority of its run we know just as much as our protagonist, Roger Thornhill, played by the late Cary Grant. Finding out bits of information while great action instances, saboteur plots, and plot twists lead us by the hand makes the movie feel really fresh as it flows like a smooth river, taking us unexpected turns along the way. The juxtaposition between Mr. Thornhill not understanding what the hell is going on and dealing with the situation like an experienced spy is a joy to watch and experience as Cary Glant's performance is exceptionally good. I praised movie from this era for having wonderful dialogues before and the witty remarks Mr. Thornhill throws out every other scene is no exception - he uses words to great effect and when you add Eve Kendall, played by Eva Marie Saint (who is still kicking and is three years away from turning 100 years old), to the mix, you get the James-Bond like charisma before James Bond and Bond girls even appeared on the big screen. Overall, Albert Hitchcock did a marvelous job creating a confusing situation that only got better by the minute, and let's take a moment to appreciate his little cameo in the movie too.It's no surprise that I really enjoyed the movie. It makes me want to watch the original James Bond movies from the '60s and see how they did spy thrillers back then. If they're at least half-as-smartly written and witty as North by Northwest, I'm going to have a good time."
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Apr 23, 2020",8/10,"A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies, and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive.Quite reminiscent of Hitchcock's own The 39 Steps, though this one's on a much greater scale. It's a bit of a messy film, and maybe also a tad formulaic, but it's a lot of fun to watch, and is probably one of Hitchcock's most entertaining movies. Worth watching for the crop-duster scene alone, which may well be one of the greatest scenes in motion picture history- absolutely brilliant tension-building and visual effects, and maybe my favourite scene from any Hitchcock film on this list. 8/10"
hitchcockthelegend,"Mar 4, 2008",10/10,"Roger O Thornhill is a harmless and amiable advertising executive who is absurdly mistaken for a government agent by a gang of ruthless spies. Forced to go out on the lam, Thornhill lurches from one perilous scenario to another. Can he survive to prove his innocence? Is the gorgeous blonde who is helping him really a friend? All will be revealed in Alfred Hitchcock's majestic thriller.If deconstructing it you find that this isn't a perfect Hitchcock movie, for it under uses James Mason's coolly vile Phillip Vandamm (which is a crime), and it also doesn't have a female lead acting with any great urgency since Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall fails to fully fulfil the promise of Kendall's arrival in the movie. Yet this film rightly earns the right to be on any critics top 100 list, to be a favourite amongst the legion of Hitchcock fans (of which I'm one of that number), for it is escapist entertainment in its purest form, Hitchcock's most accessible popcorn entertainment piece.From the moment at the film's opening when you hear Bernard Herrmann's wonderful music, it's enough to send goose pimples all over the body. For it is a musical portent that signifies we are about to get a fusion of thrills, mystery, and some cheeky Hitchcock humour, accompanied by heroes and villains all condensed purely for our enjoyment. Fronted by a diamond Cary Grant performance as the man wrongly mistaken for another that leads to him being pursued frighteningly across the states, the pic is never found wanting for genre high points. Coming as it did after the darkly brilliant and soul sapping Vertigo, Hitchcock clearly wanted to hang loose and enjoy himself.Working from a fabulous script by Ernest Lehman, North By Northwest's very reason for being is purely to entertain those wanting to invest a frame of mind with it, with Hitchcock cunningly putting us on side with what is ultimately a shallow character in Grant's Roger O (the O doesn't stand for anything) Thornhill. It's a neat trick from the master of trickery and devilment. Some of the scenes on show are now almost folk lore such is the esteem in which they are held by movie fans and makers alike. A crop dusting aeroplane attack (the prelude to which has those goose pimples popping up in anticipation), a pursuit on Mount Rushmore and the often forgotten drunk car on a cliff sequence, these are all trade mark pieces of work from Hitchcock.North By Northwest is in my humble opinion one of the true greats of cinema history, where as bleak and as unnervingly brilliant as Vertigo was the previous year, this is the polar opposite in structure and fable, but the result is most definitely equally as great. One of the reasons I fell in love with cinema in fact. 10/10"
bensonmum2,"Dec 2, 2015",10/10,"I'd like to kick myself in the seat of the pants for just now getting around to watching North By Northwest. I've been meaning to sit down with it for years and finally got around to it this week. It's a case of too many movies and too little time. Anyway, what a treat! It's Alfred Hitchcock and Carey Grant doing what they do best and treating us to one of the most entertaining pieces of film I've ever seen. I don't throw 10/10 ratings around like candy. Over the years, I've taken the time to rate 2,575 entries on IMDb. Of those, I've only given 52 (well, now 53) 10/10 ratings. To me, a movie has to be really special to deserve a 10. And North By Northwest is a very special movie.I've read more than a few of the North By Northwest reviews on IMDb and many cover the positive aspects of the movie much better and more intelligently than I ever could. Instead of trying to write a real review, I'm just gong to make a few comments on the film:1. I've read a few reviews that complain about the unrealistic aspects and situations in the movie. I hope no one thinks that Hitchcock was ever going for a realistic look at crime. In an interview I read, he calls the movie, ""A fantasy of the absurd"". I'd call it a PERFECT fantasy of the absurd. The movie flawlessly mixes action, suspense, and comedy to create a wonderfully entertaining experience. And as I've said any number of times, I watch movies to be entertained.2. Apparently, Hitchcock selected Grant in the lead over James Stewart. No offense meant to Stewart, but I cannot imagine anyone in the Thornhill role other than Grant. His comedic touch, mixed with his good looks, his acting ability, and his ability to play a put-upon wrong man type role make him ideal. He may not have been the ""everyman"" Stewart was, but there's still something in his character that makes him eminently relatable.3. Like any movie fan, I was aware of the crop duster scene. It's an iconic movie moment that has transcended the movie. And it's just as good as I could have hoped. But I wasn't aware of the auction scene. That has to be one of the best moments I've experienced in a movie. It's just so perfect.4. As much as I enjoyed North By Northwest, there are a few moments that, if they could be changed, the movie would have been even better. Chief among these is the scene fairly early on in the movie where The Professor and his cronies are sitting around a table, discussing the Thronhill situation. I feel they give away too much of the plot's twists too soon. I would have preferred to have discovered George Kaplan's secret when Thornhill does. Playing along with the character might have made a fantastic movie even better.I'll stop. I could literally write pages. I'll sum it all up by saying that if you've never seen North By Northwest, do yourself a favor and check it out. It's not to be missed."
SKG-2,"Mar 15, 1999",10/10,"Hitchcock always called PSYCHO his ""fun"" picture.  It seems to me this film, which is my favorite of his, would fit that term better (though PSYCHO, a great film, may have been more fun for him, because it was probably less of a hassle physically to shoot, and because it appealed to his warped sense of humor), since this basically kids the genre he helped invent, the suspense thriller.  The plot, when you think about it, is a remake of his own THE 39 STEPS, and although I'm not a Hitchcock expert, others could probably point out echoes of other of his films in this one.  At the same time, it still manages to be quite suspenseful.Cary Grant was one of Hitchcock's favorite actors, and it's easy to see why; he lends a class and glamour to the film, yet allows himself to be put in all sorts of sticky situations which he is able to escape from, no matter how narrowly.  Eve Marie Saint is one of the best leading ladies he ever had, generating not only sex appeal but mystery.  Leo G. Carroll is quite good as The Professor, and I wonder if he was an inspiration for George Smiley.  Martin Landau is slimy as Leonard.  But besides Grant, the best performance here is by James Mason, who avoids going over-the-top to just ooze malice.  I especially liked his last line; ""Not very sporting, using real bullets.""  There are so many classic scenes it's hard to list them all, and Bernard Hermann's score is excellent as well."
Roozbeh-Kh,"Jan 4, 2021",6/10,"I was really disappointed as I expected a masterpiece yet it was a very mediocre film. Even if we measure stupid driving scenes and bird eye view shots of poorly made models by the 1950-60 standard, we are still watching a movie with a lot of holes in the plot. Character's motivations are seriously flawed and god the dialogues and stupid jokes by Grant... Seriously, the actors' performance was stupid! from Carry Grant scenes of drunk driving with stupid surprised faces to when he is hit by a bus and miraculously manage to go under the bus. Such a waste of time."
gmc1-823-758803,"Mar 21, 2017",4/10,"They had great cameras in those days, and from this comes the best points about this film - the cameras and how they were used. Very atmospheric, the cinematography is very well done and the visual editing very good.It's possibly better today at home in its excellent transfer to digital. (I rented the streaming film in SD, which was great quality on a computer monitor which is not large.)For me, though, that's nearly as far as it goes. The acting has a lot to commend it at times, and Cary Grant pulls off well what is very demanding - trying to tie the script's lack of conviction and film genre identity together.North by Northwest must be the most contrived of all spy films.It also fails as a typical Hitchcock entertainment piece, I think because the subject is always on the verge of real seriousness. But the film can never devote itself to such seriousness in the way that classic spy films do and in the way these subjects really deserve actually.Too far away from Sunday apple pie movie land to be endearing, too bitty, flimsy, theatrical and unsatisfying to be effective in basic thriller terms, and too unserious and kid glove hewn to be worth its salt amongst the lexicon of classic spy films.North by Northwest was a probably an impressive showpiece for cinematography and the potential of atmosphere and brilliance in the track from camera to cinema screen. But, like a beautiful damsel agent who flirts but is getting paid for her rehearsed attempts to win you, the film has little else of merit beyond its looks and moves."
grantss,"Feb 15, 2024",9/10,"In a case of mistaken identity, a harmless New York advertising man, Roger Thornhill, becomes the target of foreign agents. After trying to kill him they frame him for murder. He escapes the police net by boarding a train bound for Chicago. On the train he meets beautiful, mysterious blonde, Eve Kendall, who helps him escape. He's still not safe though.Possibly Alfred Hitchcock's most iconic movie. Not his best movie - that honour goes to either Rebecca, Rear Window or Psycho, in my opinion - but it contains some of his most indelible scenes - Cary Grant running from the plane, Mount Rushmore, to name but two.It's not all about memorable scenes though. The plot is quite intriguing and interesting, though maybe a bit too convoluted for its own good.Hitchcock's employs his usual tension-building tricks to great effect and actually outdoes himself in that respect as the complexity of the plot can make things quite confusing at times, limiting the tension. In spite of this Hitchcock whisks you along for the ride, whether you understand everything that is going along or not.Cary Grant is great as Roger Thornhill, delivering his lines with his usual charm, wry humour and crispness. Eva Marie Saint is great as Eve Kendall and doesn't take a back seat to Grant."
chucksteel,"Jan 22, 2023",10/10,"North by Northwest is my favorite movie - in a long list of favorites - from the great director Alfred Hitchcock. Also no doubt this is Cary Grant's best film. This is an epic thriller about a man who becomes a victim of mistaken identity, must go on the run from both the law and the bad guys, meanwhile trying to prove his innocence.The way this all happens is kind of absurd. Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) keeps finding himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Things - bad things - keep happening to him that are beyond his control. He winds up going on a cross country journey from NYC to South Dakota. Along the way he meets a beautiful woman (Eva Marie Saint) who may or may not be on his side. Watch also for James Mason as the shady character Vandamm and Martin Landau in an early role as the mysterious Leonard. Most of the time Thornhill can't really be sure who's a friend and who's an enemy. There is a lot of tension and a lot of thrills.This movie has similarities with Hitchcock's earlier classic, ""Saboteur"" (1942). I highly recommend that one also."
frankde-jong,"Jan 9, 2022",9/10,"In hinsight the films Alfred Hitchcock made between ""Vertigo"" (1958) and ""Psycho"" (1960) are the pinnacle of his career. At the time of release however ""Vertigo"" wasn't such a commercial success at all.For this reason Hitchcock wanted his next film, ""North- by Northwest"" (1959) to be of a very different nature. All psychology is gone and instead we have a very complicated plot with lots of action and unexpected twists and turns. We all know the scene with Cary Grant having a date alongside a lonely road through the desert and being attacked by a little airplane.The film became a commercial hit. Hitchcock had not only achieved his business goals, he had also made the first Bond film ""avant la lettre"". A few years later, in 1962, Terence Young would make the first official Bond film (""Dr No"").Guillermo del Toro once called lead actor Cary Grant the best James Bond that never was. Reasoning further along these lines, Eva Marie Saint is the first Bond girl ""avant la lettre"". She sure looks beautiful, but she is a serious actress as well. Five years earlier she was best supporting actress alongside Marlon Brando in ""On the waterfront"" (1953, Elia Kazan)."
Movie-ManDan,"Oct 30, 2014",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's speciality is thrillers. Some are straight thrillers, some conjoin with romances, horror, this conjoins with mystery. Hitchcock has combined these two, but has never done a better and more exciting film. Nobody has ever or will ever do a better, more exciting film. Having said that, is this better than, say, Vertigo or Psycho? Arguably. But Vertigo is a romance/thriller, Psycho is a horror/thriller and NBNW is a mystery/thriller. This does surpass other movies of its kind like Rear Window and The Maltese Flacon. The general story is a classic case of mistaken identity where a complex, top-secret government plan is under wraps. The movie grabs you by your collar the in the first two minutes and never lets go as the thrills and curves never stop coming at you full force. The main character (Cary Grant) careens to different ends of America as he must keep up with the game of cat-and-mouse he dies to get out of. Unlike Rear Window and The Maltese Flacon, NBNW features chase and danger sequences that add more excitement to its already mammoth exhilarating plot.Screw running, screw the gym. This movie can get your heart rate going in a much more enjoyable way."
agmoldham,"Feb 18, 2004",10/10,"North by Northwest is my favourite Hitchcock film. Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is a clean cut Mummy's boy with few vices. He is mistakenly identified as George Kaplan who Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) wants to see the back off.All the classic Hitchcock plots are here. Thornhill is the ordinary guy that is thrown into an extraordinary situation. Eve Marie Saint is the beautiful blond Eve Kendall who falls for Roger and ends up in grave danger. Vandamm is the sinister bad guy who gets his sidekicks to do the dirty work.The set pieces in this movie are truly memorable. The UN, crop dusting and Mount Rushmore scenes are breathtaking both visually and for raw suspense. The casting, acting and soundtrack are all excellent and as usual the best plaudits should be saved for Hitchcock. This is a master on top form. 10/10 !!"
mfkvk,"Sep 30, 2020",6/10,The thing which lets me down is the 3rd act which is kind of too simplistic.
ReelCheese,"Jun 6, 2006",10/10,"A timeless classic, one of the all-time great motion picture achievements. Cary Grant is an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down in the most bizarre way when he is mistaken for a mysterious government agent. Throughout an exciting adventure across America he must contend with spies, romance, betrayal and, in one famous scene, a murderous crop duster pilot. The genius of North by Northwest is that, despite imitations and the countless thrillers that followed it, one never knows quite what the next plot twist will be, or even what is real and what is not. Even nearly five decades later, the astounding finale at Mount Rushmore remains an amazing feat. North by Northwest is the perfect merger of all that was great about Hitchcock and all what is great about film."
nbpatel,"Apr 7, 2004",6/10,"i've decided to see all the films i haven't already seen that are listed on imdb's top 250 list.  so it was inevitable that i would end up watching 'North by Northwest'.either i'm wrong, or the thousands who voted this movie a '9' or '10' are...but i think this is not Hitchcock's best, and i don't even consider this a worthwhile movie to spend $5 renting.  and i clearly don't see this film as one of the 250 best ever.  [the most recently released spy movies i have seen, 'Spy Games' and 'The Recruit', were abundantly better than this disappointing film, and they are not ranked nearly as high up.]why?  (1) in today's age, this movie's special effects (and plot) are sorely dated; (2) the plot is implausible, whether you look at it from a 2004 antiterror or 1950s Cold War perspective; (3) what some would argue are the film's strongpoints (i.e., the romantic interactions between hero and heroine, Cary Grant's numerous wisecracks, etc.) really contribute to its flaws (see (2)).  saying anymore would spoil the surprise for those who are still planning to see it.want to see the quintessential Hitchcock film?  see 'Rear Window'...i rented it only the day before seeing 'North by Northwest', and its superiority is immediately evident.  even the romantic chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly is better; in fact, i dare you to come up with a better pairing. but it's obvious that 'North by Northwest' isn't even comparable in quality, beyond the fact that it, too, is a Hitchcock production.from my interpretation of this website, anything rated above a '7' is worth seeing, and anything above '8' is a ""definitely see, now!""...for that reason, i have to give this movie a '6'.  this flick is a poor man's James Bond movie."
arch-32727,"May 31, 2023",3/10,"Highly overrated. This is an ok movie to watch if you have some time to kill and there is nothing else to watch. My thumb got irritated as I had to scroll past countless 9 out of 10 and 10 out of 10 reviews to find reviews that told the truth about this movie. The best thing that can be said is that the film is visually very nice to look at, like a pretty painting in a museum. Late 1950s New York and America look so nice, clean and orderly. The plot is totally absurd and nonsensical. Am I the only one who believes that Cary Grant is a wooden, unconvincing and annoying actor?? On the plus side, Eva Marie Saint was nice to look at, one of Hitchcock's cool blondes. Incredibly overrated."
patryk-czekaj,"Apr 29, 2012",10/10,"Having seen most of Alfred Hitchcock's works I must admit that North by Northwest has quickly become my favorite, even though it may not possess the typical Hitchcockian motives. What's more, It could as well be placed in the same box as the James Bond franchise, because it may in some aspects remind of the well-known spy movies (Cary Grant could have been a perfect 007, with his elegance, handsome face and fantastic overall presence). However, I must say that it combines a better-developed structure, more wit in its dialogues and greater suspenseful sequences than any Bond movie does. Also, personally I thought that Eva Marie Saint was much more appealing than all of the Bond girls combined.The main plot introduces the whole movie as a serious and thrilling mystery of a man, who is mistaken for an agent and embarks on a journey to clear his name. Still, apart from that, there are various comedic aspects of the film, along with my favorite scene in the first few minutes, when Roger Thornhill (played brilliantly by Cary Grant) is being held captive, forced to get drunk and then ride a car. As for the romantic section, there is the ongoing chemistry between the devious Eve Kendell and Thornhill.All those aspects make up for an amazing and most enjoyable plot. The ideal mix of all the conjoint, yet rather opposing, factors marks the true genius of the director himself. Even though all of Hitchcock's pictures are undisputed masterpieces, North by Northwest captivated me the most. I haven't really seen a movie that offers so much - perfect plot-subplots combination, intelligent script, memorable scenes, many distinct sceneries, tremendous acting (great supporting roles by James Mason, Leo G. Carroll and Martin Landau) and, most importantly, the building of suspense until the very last minute. It is also the best Hitchcock- Grant collaboration you will find.Even though the picture didn't win an Oscar in any of the three categories that it was nominated in, it surely could have won an Award for the best picture of the year. Or the decade. Or the century. Because every time you watch this fantastic movie you will be able to find a new part that will catch your attention. That is the true genius of Hitchcock. He made a movie that brings out everything that is the greatest about the motion picture industry, that is the ability to develop a masterwork that can be interesting to every single person in the world."
mrty-60594,"Jun 18, 2024",10/10,"Thrills, intrigue and humour combine to make this the best of Hitchcock's 'man on the run' movies. With fine support from Eva Marie Saint and James Mason, Cary Grant provides a perfect blend of style and humour with just the right amount of bravado as we travel across the country in a tail with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing as you go from one scene of classic cinema to the next.Whether it's being chased by a crop dusting plane in a cornfield, or climbing atop Mount Rushmore, you're sure to find something in this movie to draw you back for repeated viewings.If you've never seen it, then it's a must. If you haven't seen it in the past few years, it's time to watch it again."
ballater100,"Aug 7, 2008",10/10,"This suspense/action chase thriller is quite simply great entertainment and no other film director seems able to combine the elements of suspense with entertainment. If you want more Hitchcock films in this style, check out The 39 Steps (1935) b/w which is also a 10 out of 10. If you like that one give Young and Innocent (1937) b/w a try. It is in that style and if not a 10 out of 10 it is enjoyable and an 8 or 9 out of 10. Yes Hitchcock did make classic films before his move to America so don't forget them. Finally although in a slightly different style, you must see his other classic British film, The Lady Vanishes (1938) b/w. A 10 out of 10 in anyone's book."
roedyg,"Jun 14, 2013",9/10,"North By North West was made in 1959. You can enjoy it many ways. Let me enumerate: 1. It a predecessor to the James bond films with oily villains with interesting accents, and questionable sexuality out to kill in imaginative ways, always toying with their victims rather that simply shooting them outright. Cary Grant plays a character who likes brave clever repartee with his captors, though he has none of Bond's lethality, just his confidence.2. it is a love story, with lots of clever repartee.3. it is a comedy. Grant's cleverness and unrestrained originality at getting out of scrapes is amusing as is the existential strangeness of the predicaments.4. It is a period drama. It was filmed in 1959 with a cast of tens of thousands, all in accurate 1959 period costumes, and accurate period cars, in accurate period hotels, restaurants, streets and taxis. All this was much cheaper to do then. It is a treat for the eye.5. It is an adventure story with a car chase, explosions and the famous crop dusting scene, but because the special effects are somewhat dated, this aspect would not have the punch it would originally.6. It is a mystery with all manner twists and terms making you guess who is working for whom. It would probably take at least three viewings to begin to figure out the motives for each character at each point in the film.It is an oldie but goodie."
ctowyi,"Mar 24, 2016",10/10,"I have seen all those iconic scenes in snippets but have never seen the film in its entirety. By iconic I mean the scenes where a plane swoops down to attack Cary Grant like a hawk to a prey and the climatic foot chase at Mount Rushmore. Nowadays, the weak CGI might cause a frown on your face and they would probably feel too familiar, but you must remember they are first done here; this is the genesis. It's because of Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest that so many action scenes are possible. This is where it happened. I knew all that plus the taut suspense, the economically drawn characters, and the music score, but I never counted on such an awesome screenplay. The dialogue is simply amazing. Just the foreplay dialogue between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint is the stuff of so much conversations. It is erotic and playful enough to make me grin like a monkey. It is filled with eroticism, yet subtle, never high-brow, with a cheeky know-it-all tone. The suspense coupled with the comedy and romance is almost a template for movies of this type nowadays, but no one can direct like the master. The film may be 1959 but it feels so on the beat even today. This is masterclass cinema."
Falkner1976,"Jan 19, 2024",10/10,"North by Northwest is a maximum exponent of a way of filmmaking, of a type of film that can never be made again, that creates a world of emotion that more than simple escapism enriches our lives. A planet where you can reach north by northwest is Hithcoks's planet. It is a planet that can reveal our world, but that turns out to be substantially different, decanted, filtered, intensified by the most exquisite art, and as a result everything is more impressive, there is more color, more emotion, more rhythm.Our visual range is fuller of simultaneous information, the different visual planes of the image interact generating more tension, infinite details are revealed to us, gestures are more expressive without being deliberate, more plastic without being affected.In this world, strong emotions sneak in, like in our dreams, into the most anodyne of our routines: a man can be kidnapped when he responds to a notice addressed to another person in a hotel restaurant; you meet murderers in a crowded elevator and a few minutes later without knowing how, you are holding a dagger stuck in the back of a man you have just met; there are mysterious appointments in the middle of spectacular and lonely rural landscapes, and when you least expect it you are chased and shot down by crop dusters.With our hearts in our fist we see how a man has to climb a stone wall to the room of the woman he is in love with to warn her that her life is threatened, and he has to be quick because at the same time we see the girl up there, through the windows, in the illuminated room, finishing packing her suitcase and we know that as soon as she finishes that task she is going to leave the room and irrevocably hand herself over to her murderers.The emotional level and the situations in which life puts you are a couple of degrees above normal. You may have to try to kill the person you are falling in love with (and fall even more in love because you have no choice but to kill him) or fall in love with a person who you know is going to try to kill you again without you being able to understand why.In this world, a love scene is accompanied by a beautiful violin melody by Bernard Hermmann and a vibrant percussion fanfare accompanies you as you flee descending Mount Rushmore.Like other Hitchcock films, it is a film in which many exceptional talents come together but is dominated by the magical trio formed by the director and his two stars: in this case Hitchcock, Grant and Eva Marie Saint. It is a glamorous formula that already worked in Spellbound, much more so in Notorious and Vertigo, and that will be a failure in Torn Courtain.The film is unimaginable without its two protagonists. Eva Marie Saint is possibly Hitchcock's definitive sophisticated blonde, with all the haut couture beauty of Grace Kelly but giving her character much more flesh and weight, and the ability to reflect complex emotions. She brings that plus of being an absolutely exceptional woman, not simply an American socialite. And of course the hairstyle of that blonde hair is not to be forgotten.Grant represents what comes after 30 years of being an absolute star. His personality, his natural elegance is striking even in the way he looks at his watch. The expressive adjustment to achieve the ideal effect to awaken in the viewer the exact emotion that the scene requires. Again a perfect balance between the glamour of the star and the emotional capacity to build an unforgettable character. And naturally the suit helps.Hitchcock populates his world with many other fascinating people: James Mason, Jessy Royce-Landis above all, or the menacing Martin Landau.The locations are wonderful (in this case even the reconstructed ones): exquisite hotel lobbies, crowded New York streets at rush hour; the bustling Grand Central Terminal that contrasts with the silent and desolate plain of cornfields and straight roads that stretch to the horizon, where you can barely hear an infrequent bus or a small plane spraying in the distance; Mount Rushmore that we will be allowed to visit in ways we could never have dreamed of; the modernist house on the cliff that allows you to see through its enormous windows the exciting plots that unfold inside, or the classic and luxurious country mansion that surprisingly serves as a temporary refuge for a gang of criminals; and of course the 20th Century Limited express, in whose limited spaces the protagonist has the opportunity to fall in love with a mysterious and fascinating woman while managing to hide from the police.The ""plot holes"", which there are and many, would be considered so in our routine world, on Planet Hitchcock they are justifiable and even necessary poetic licenses, that is, they serve to increase the visual or emotional impact of the scenes or streamline the plot. The plot could develop without them, but the scenes would be much more bland or too many boring explanations would be needed.This plot does not stop insisting on many classic themes of Hitchcock's films, and is basically a kind of Notorious revisited (although in North by Northwest the viewer identifies mainly with Grant, and in Notorious with Bergman), but preserving its intimate side, it now gives rise to a great show of totally new dimensions.A miracle of a film."
jameslinton-75252,"Apr 15, 2016",6/10,"A film from the Golden Age of Hollywood that is almost as famous as its director: Alfred Hitchcock. Whilst I thought this film was good, I also thought that it was a little overrated. Sure the writing was subtle and nuanced, the performances were strong, particularly James Mason who was very scary as the villain, and not over-done and the crop-dusting scene was wildly entertaining, something for me just felt lacking from the film.Perhaps it was the ending which for me felt rushed and anticlimactic. It left me with too many unanswered questions and didn't feel like a suitable ending to such a great film.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/lsKNPn"
virginia72585,"Sep 8, 2007",7/10,"This is one of the best thriller movies I have ever seen. Hitchcock has succeeded again in creating suspense and thrills for everyone to enjoy. The film is mainly about a advertising man who is mistaken for a government agent and is relentlessly chased around the world. Apparently the Oscars liked the film considering it gave it three nominations. I can see why this film is regarded as Hitchcock's best work. The only problem I have with this film is the abrupt ending, thinking it would be climatic it changes to a completely different location and it ruins the suspense for me. If you are going to have suspense and thrills throughout the film, don't ruin the ending by having it change and completely destroy the suspense that it builds."
cfishy,"Jul 26, 2013",1/10,"So I watched this movie with great expectation. Supposed to be one of the best suspense movie of all times.Well it wasn't. I couldn't finish half of the stupid movie. It's made in the 50s, and apparently people in the 50s were naive enough to believe the protagonist would be stupid enough to rush grab the handle of the knife after a man talking to him was stabbed, therefore making him the suspect.How stupid can he be? I couldn't finish watching this film. The sound track was really awful and trivial, I guess that was expected in the 50s.Apparently, modern suspense has advanced much more. I watched Silence of the Lambs yesterday and it held up to the times really well. Not this one."
auriferous,"May 2, 2004",N/A,"No, they don't make them like this anymore, but fortunately you can still rent a copy or better yet go see it in a theater somewhere.  Cary Grant is very good as the baffled ad exec being chased by, and chasing, international spies in a case of mistaken identity.  He never loses his cool and manages to shift effortlessly between comic and serious, making it all look easy. Good casting all around except maybe for Jessie Royce Landis who plays Grant's mother - not that she's bad in the role, but she doesn't quite look the part owing, perhaps, to the fact that she was actually younger (by 10 months) than Grant.  Movie audiences back then took Grant to be ageless, I suppose, and perhaps he was.  James Mason is good as the suave villain."
bk753,"Mar 18, 2023",10/10,"A timeless masterpiece and (to me) Alfred Hitchcock's finest work. There are some movies that age brilliantly, where story, acting, dialogue, and presentation defy time, and endure for generations to enjoy and appreciate. North by Northwest, like Casablanca, is one of those rare films.This is also Hitchcock's most fun movie. Dapper ad-man Roger Thornhill, mistaken for a government agent, finds himself in a web of intrigue and danger, hunted by foreign agents, yet he remains suave and witty. More than 60 years after its release, the humor remains intact, the banter still sharp. Cary Grant shines as the hero, as does Eva Marie Saint as the mysterious Eve Kendall, and James Mason as ruthless spy Phillip VanDamm. Some of film's most iconic moments live here... the crop duster scene, the murder at the UN, the harrowing finale on the faces of Mount Rushmore. It's a joy to watch and enjoy over and over again, and one of my personal five favorite films of all-time. An absolute must-see for all movie lovers."
alexdeleonfilm,"Jul 21, 2017",10/10,"image4.jpegAction and suspense: A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies.Asking which is the best Hitchcock is something like asking which is the best Beethoven symphony, but if pressed to the wall I would call NBNW Hitchcock's Ninth (and Psycho, his Fifth). The coolest of Grant and the hottest of Marie Saint is simply the coolest film ever made from every angle you can think of. Few people would contend that Cary Grant was not the coolest leading man of Hollywood's golden age but this pic is the peak of his coolness, along with that the coolest James Mason ever as the slickest polite villain of all time and the slinkiest Eva Marie Saint ever, all adds up to one of the slickest pieces of celluloid entertainment ever conceived. Most Hitchcock movies have one unforgettable white knuckle cliff hanger sequence but NBNW has two -- the chase out in the wheat fields by a poisonous crop duster biplane and the final chase across the faces of the four presidents at Mount Rushmore, which ends up literally ... as a cliffhanger. Even a third if you include the comical auction scene where Grant keeps making outrageous bids to attract the police and thus escape the clutches of the killers lurking in the room waiting to get him. So much has been written about this picture that there is no need to recount the plot other to say that it is a towering masterpiece of the romantic suspense drama genre with all players at the top of their game - and don't forget a young menacing Martin Landau as Mason's cold blooded sidekick, another great actor who just passed away on July 15, 2017 at age 89. NBNW is frequently rerun on TV so it's not hard to catch up with but it never gets old or fails to make you hold your breath even when you know what's coming next. An ultimate classic."
jluis1984,"Apr 18, 2006",9/10,"Together with ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds"", ""North by Northwest"" is among Hitchcock's most famous and praised films. It has been said that this movie marks the beginning of the action/thriller as we know it today, and not without reason as this film takes Hitchcock's favorite plot (ordinary man in unbelievable adventures) to the extreme in an epic adventure across U.S.Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, an ordinary man who is mistaken for a spy and suddenly gets involved in a series of intrigues and adventures that will take him from Washington to Mount Rushmore as he tries to put an end to his problem. James Mason plays Phillip Vandamm, the international criminal who believes that Thornhill works for the U.S. government and desperately wants to kill him. Eve Marie Saint is Eve, a mysterious woman who helps Roger but has a secret agenda of her own.It is obvious that Hitchcock wanted to pleasure his audience after the mixed reviews he received in ""Vertigo"", as he gives thrill after thrill in this roller-coaster but always with class and elegance. Thornhill goes from one peril to another and the suspense is always on the rise. Also, his dark humor returns and Cary Grant definitely is the best man to deliver it.Cary Grant is perfect as Roger Thornhill, and it is probably the role of his lifetime. It is very well known the fact that James Stewart was the first choice but was rejected after the failure of ""Vertigo"". Even when personally I consider Stewart a better actor, Cary Grant was the perfect actor for the lighter Hitchcock; with his suave persona, good humor and classy elegance, Grant shines here as well as in ""suspicion"" and ""To Catch a Thief"". On the other hand, Stewart was more apt for the darker side of Hitchcock in films like ""Rope"", ""Rear Window"", and the masterpiece ""Vertigo"".Eve Marie Saint joins the ranks of the icy blonds in the Master's films, as the beautiful and mysterious Eve. There was clearly good chemistry between her and Grant, and the sexual innuendo is brilliant. One can really believe that they are a couple of lovers in the middle of the international intrigue. Martin Landau and James Mason complete the cast as the villains and they surely give brilliant performances. The young Landau was set for a bright future and he demonstrates it in this early role.Many things can be said about ""North by Northwest"", but one thing is true; while this movie is basically a series of scenes of danger and adventure, Hitchcock's masterful touch separates it from the rest and puts it in a superior place. His perfect camera-work and the score by the always effective Bernard Herrmann created immortal scenes. Sure, ""Vertigo"" is a superior movie, but it is easy to see why this one succeeded where ""Vertigo"" failed: ""North by Northwest"" was designed to please the audience.Honestly, ""North By Northwest"" is not a perfect movie, it has its flaws and it is definitely not Hitchcock's best film. However, it has a lot of something special that can only be classified as ""magic"" that one can't help but enjoy the 136 minutes of thrills and adventure that the Master of Suspense prepared for us. 9/10"
gridoon,"Nov 28, 1999",9/10,"""North by Northwest"" is undeniably one of Hitchcock's best movies - not to mention one of my ten personal favorites in general. A brilliant script, full of well-planned twists, Hitchcock's energetic and vivid direction, the constantly clever dialogue, the first-rate production values, an incredible score by Bernard Herrmann (who pretty much ripped-off himself the following year when he wrote the score for ""Psycho"") and several memorable sequences (the often neglected auction scene is extremely amusing) are only some of the ingredients that make this thriller so terrific. I have two minor complaints, though: the film is SLIGHTLY overlong (maybe it could have been 15 minutes shorter) and Eva Marie Saint just isn't a particularly attractive woman, compared to Grace Kelly or even to Tippi Hedren, so she is kind of miscast in the role of a ""femme fatale"". And her performance isn't in the same class with the delightful ones that Grant and Mason give. But this is still a superb movie, and it is far less dated than the early Bond films, which it probably influenced."
ssssgelojun,"Aug 14, 2020",7/10,"The main thrust of the film is a deep understanding of the moral relativism and intrigue of the Cold War. But the biggest significance is that Hitchcock's film from this point on is different from his earlier works only around a suspense operation, but began to use multiple layers of suspense transformation and superposition to structure the development of the same story.At the same time, the humorous, relaxed, rich erotic style and comic temperament of the film is also an attempt by Hitchcock to distinguish himself from other works.From today's perspective, in addition to the suspenseful layers of stripping and reversing and beautiful photography, the plot of the silly and logical details of the loopholes are really regrettable."
monsterhunt-94296,"Nov 16, 2020",7/10,"Alright so today I watched North by Northwest, my first film from Alfred Hitchcock, but that doesn't matter much as this film is considered to be the most different from his other movies. I'd also say it's one of the lesser acclaimed ones. The plot was always moving along, the characters were interesting, and it had a lot of nice suspense in there. Despite this, the movie felt very long for me. I wasn't necessarily bored, I just wasn't incredibly invested. I'd give it a 7/10."
son1kyleed,"Dec 13, 2006",2/10,"Before watching this film I have to say that I was anxious to see what many refer to as 'Hitch's best work' and with James Mason and Cary Grant I could hardly see how it could go wrong. But as with so many other 'classics', so many other pieces of 'perfect' film making I was horribly disappointed, and why? The film had so much going for it, but the fact of the matter is that by the end of the film I had lost 2 hours of my life that I will never get back and what is even more tragic is that Hitch lost months.It is easier to list the few good points than the masses of things wrong with this film so I'll start there: Cary Grant; James Mason; the direction (possibly; certainly not Hitchcock's best); the message that if you (the audience) value your masculinity you too will take the first opportunity to drink drive your way out of a perilous situation and let's not forget possibly the greatest moment in ANY Hitchcock film; train through the tunnel metaphor.But now for the rather more in depth list of terrible elements: I'll begin with the most prominent; the cheese, this film has cheese flowing out of the screen, and people argue that it spawned the stereotype rather than is part of it, but is that a good thing? Really? To have created a strain of films not only containing James Bond, but ultimately Tripple X. The direction, save for the crop duster scene is average at best. The ridiculous plot that has Cary Grant conveniently pulling a knife out of a man's back - i mean come on! The list goes on and frankly I don't have the time."
Red_Identity,"Jul 15, 2011",N/A,"I cannot believe it has taken me so long to watch this famous film by one of my favorite directors. It was never at the top of my 'to see' list, but I can say that this is another incredible film by Hitchcock.The story of North by Northwest starts off pretty simple, but make no mistake, this is probably Hitchcock's most unpredictable film (apart from everyone knowing Psycho's big twist). There are so many twists and turns in the screenplay that I could barely keep up, and it's because Hitchcock doesn't let us breathe for one second. We think we know who the bad guy is, then we are wrong. Fantastic screenplay by Ernest Lehman, with fantastic performances from Cary Grant and James Mason. Every time I saw Eva Marie Saint on screen I thought it was Betty Draper (January Jones from Mad Men) running around with another man. I'm telling you, January Jones looks just like her. Now if they make a remake (hopefully not, but we never know) they know who to cast.Overall, fantastic film. Probably a masterpiece in it's great story- telling, and possibly Hitchcock's 2nd best after Psycho."
Bernie4444,"Jan 5, 2024",10/10,"This has become a classic Alfred Hitchcock film, with a film score by Bernard Herrmann.

shafatqadri,"Jan 23, 2008",8/10,"The 1950s was a mixture of successes and failures for Alfred Hitchcock. Most of his successes are classic thriller films such as Rear Window, Vertigo and Strangers on a Train. Hitchcock did have some failures such as I Confess and To Catch a Thief, but I think by the end of the 1950s, his successes definitely outweigh his weaker pictures and he finished off this decade with the critically and commercially acclaimed thriller, North by Northwest.North by Northwest follows Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), a 'Madison Avenue', advertising man from New York, whose life is turned upside-down when he is mistaken as a government spy by the name of George Kaplan. He is mistaken for being a spy by a man named Lester Townsend (James Mason), who also seems to be a spy and is paranoid that this so called Kaplan figure has secrets about Townsend's organization. Along with his bunch of thugs, who are led by Leonard (Martin Landau), they attempt to turn Thornhill's life upside-down.Now a man on the run, Thornhill runs off to Chicago to find the real George Kaplan, who he thinks knows what is going on. However, Thornhill realizes that even when he is on the train, he is being chased. However, a beautiful blonde named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is willing to protect him. However, is Thornhill safe with Kendall? Just watch the movie.Like all Hitchcock films, there are hundreds of things that aren't realistic though set in the real world and lots of highly improbable stuff going on everywhere, but if you give it a chance you'll enjoy it and won't care. North By Northwest keeps the winning streak going, and enjoys a well cemented stay in IMDb's Top 50"
bobsgrock,"May 30, 2009",10/10,"Although it is one of his most famous it may not be considered among his best, which I think it deserves to be. North by Northwest is more than a cross-country trip across America to solve a case of mistaken identity, it is also a send-up of all the old detective and spy movies Hollywood made in the 1930s and 1940s. What Hitchcock has done here is take a similar premise from one of his earlier films, Saboteur, and create a funny, intelligent and wonderfully entertaining story filled with great visuals and one-liners.Cary Grant gives perhaps his best role for Hitchcock in his last as Roger Thornhill, a man caught up in the web of espionage and deceit as he tries to convince a group of men that he is not George Kaplan. Eva Marie Saint is quite a saint as the beautiful and tough Eve Kendall. Perhaps the true reason to this great success is due to Ernest Lehman's fully entertaining script that has many tart one-liners as well as enough twists to screw up even M. Night Shyamalan. Of course, Hitchcock was at the top of his game here, working between his two greatest pictures, Vertigo and Psycho. Here, he is just having fun, playing with us as we try to follow all the action and suspense. Truly, this could be considered a prelude to all those other action movies made today. Some are good, most are pathetic, but Hitchcock pointed the way and it is a path worth going down again and again."
Phillip_Vandamm,"Aug 18, 2022",10/10,"When you've already perfected your craft, what do you do? Have Fun. Big scenes, Big canvas, Big Movie Stars. This one is Hitchcock's most entertaining, even after several viewings. Not quite the texture of ""Vertigo,"" but equally engaging."
MOscarbradley,"Mar 14, 2006",10/10,"This is probably the best loved of all Hitchcock's films and it is also one of his finest. It is a particularly daft comedy-thriller in that the plot hinges on a series of improbable events and it is hugely entertaining, full of classic set pieces. Cary Grant is the suave, debonair hero who finds himself clinging to a man with a knife in his back in the lobby of the United Nations Building. When he goes on the run, determined to find out who framed him, it isn't just the authorities who are after him but the villains as well. When he meets a leggy blonde on a train, (what is it with Hitchcock and trains?), she is not all that she seems. Eva Marie Saint plays her with an easy-going sexiness that makes her character very likable. And Grant has so much charm he gets away with playing Jessie Royce Landis' son when, in reality, she was only eight years his senior.The villains are James Mason and Martin Landau but they aren't given enough to do and as villains they don't feel threatening. What is threatening is the crop-dusting plane that appears out of an empty blue sky to chase Grant around some vast open spaces. And later, when Grant and Saint are chased over the faces on Mount Rushmore, it's our familiarity with the locations that heightens the tension. In the end the McGuffin, as Hitchcock called the device that held the plot in place, hardly matters. His genius is that he makes you care about the inconsequential things. This is a great comedy-thriller."
moviemattb,"May 4, 2014",10/10,"""North by Northwest"" is definitely one of my favorite movies by Alfred Hitchcock. He is a pretty darn good filmmaker who knows how to tell a story and where to point the camera at. The movie is about Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive, who has been kidnapped by Phillip Vandamm and his men by a mistaken identity George Kaplan who doesn't exist. So Thornhill has been wrongfully accused as a fugitive and pursed himself across the country. I thought the cast in this movie did wonderful. Cary Grant does a remarkable job for his performance for being funny, confused, and being likable. Eva Marie Saint was lovely in this movie and she was fascinating. James Mason and a young Martin Landau were terrific for playing their roles as the villains. Bernard Herrmann's score was outstanding for creating music for suspense, romance, and excitement. The cinematography in this movie is beautifully shot, and the cornfield scene where Thornhill is being attacked by an airplane is well done. Give thanks to the Master of Suspense for making such an exciting movie. I give ""North by Northwest"" a 10 out of 10."
BA_Harrison,"Jun 14, 2018",8/10,"North by Northwest is a breezy espionage thriller, much lighter in tone than Hitchcock's later cold war spy movies, Topaz and Torn Curtain, and a whole lot more enjoyable as a result.Cary Grant plays Madison Avenue advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill, who is abducted by ruthless spy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) and his cohorts, who have mistaken him for an FBI agent named George Kaplan. Unable to convince the enemy of his real identity, Roger escapes and goes on the run to look for the real Kaplan, aided by a beautiful, mysterious blonde Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).The action moves along at a brisk pace, with charismatic lead Grant making for a likeable protagonist and Hitchcock delivering a couple of his most iconic scenes-the crop duster attack and the finalé on Mount Rushmore-both of which are excellent. It's not all perfection-the moment where Thornhill is framed for murder is laughable, the poor sap grabbing the knife buried in a man's back and then turning towards a news photographer who just happens to have his camera at the ready-but for a couple of hours of pure escapism, North by Northwest is a good way to go."
alightinthedarkfilms,"Jan 10, 2023",9/10,"Superb thriller from Hitch released in 59, elegant and sophisticated, from a time when men and women celebrated and appreciated each others differences and attractions. The world is clean and tidy, there is class, respect and passion in every scene and set. The train is gorgeous and the scene in the cabin sensuous and warm. Lovely film from a master who understood and mastered his craft. A pleasure to the eyeballs, even the good old sets are beautifully constructed. Wonderful performances and nuances wrapped up with humour and spice. The action scenes are dramatic and inspiring to this day. Love it."
jamesjustice-92,"Jun 3, 2022",10/10,"It doesn't matter how hard we try to explain to somebody something that we know the other person would not believe because he perceives everything through his own point of view - they hear what they want to hear. But sometimes they get it right even if at first they were wrong.I'm talking of course about the case of the false identity in ""North by Northwest"". The movie stars dashingly handsome Cary Grant as a somewhat Cary Grant-ish character who is being taken for a spy therefore must be killed by the enemies. I have to admit after writing the premise of the movie I think of dozen of movie examples with the same formula but what differs this one from the rest and stands high above it are those who had created this remarkable movie.Beautiful cinematography, impressive special effects and excellent music score by the genius of Bernard Herrmann alone make this movie a milestone in the thriller genre. Cary Grant is as charming as ever but he rarely gets the chance to be serious hiding behind his big smile and a charisma of a comedian and there are not so many moments in the movie when he gets to show his dramatic side also which he delivers well nevertheless. The female lead, Eva Marie Saint, on the other hand, shows drama exclusively and is one of the main reasons I fell in love with the movie since the first time I watched it. The villains are a bit dumb and not evil enough in my opinion and it always was the weakest point in Hitchcock's movies but it doesn't spoil the movie anyway because even at 130 minutes the story flies by very quickly when one action scene changes the other and you are not able to leave until the ending.""North by Northwest"" is a legendary movie full of iconic and suspenseful scenes for which Alfred is best known for. Haven't we all ever wanted to become a person of special interest in the eyes of others and step out of our everyday lives?"
vamp-07,"Feb 15, 2007",7/10,"North by northwest is the 5th Hitchcock movie that i've seen,and knowing it's in the top 100 of the best movies ever made,i've had really high expectations..well i wasn't disappointed but i admit that it wasn't what i expected.the direction and visuals are grandiose,the camera angles and the photography,simply beautiful,especially the mount Rushmore final confrontation. But it lacks Hitchcock's taste of macabre,human satire and depth but that's mainly due to the fact that North b n was intended to be different from the earlier Hitchcock movies by having more action and less mystery and drama.this formula pleased the audiences back then but i believe that this is NOT Hitchcock's masterpiece,it has none of that subtle haunting mystery of vertigo,psycho...eva marie saint has a really great character,while cary grant can be annoying sometimes...North by northwest is more like a commercial blockbuster that's really enjoyable to watch but doesn't really linger in ur mind forever..."

sauravjoshi85,"Jan 19, 2024",10/10,"North by Northwest is a spy thriller film directed by Late Alfred Hitchcock, and starring Late Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and Late James Mason.An advertising man, Roger Thornhill, lands himself in big trouble when he is mistaken for George Kaplan a foreign spy who is now wanted in a murder case, during the hide and seek from police he meets Eve, which leads him into a bigger problem.The film North by Northwest which gives the feeling of James Bond film mainly because of the atmosphere but minus the gadgets. The best part of the film is the selection of the characters as Cary Grant looked super in his portrayal of someone with mistaken identity, Eva Marie Saint was stunningly fabulous in the character of a double shaded woman stuck between good and bad. James Mason was also equally impressive in the character of main antagonist.The plot of the film is good and execution is superb, this is a little different kind of Hitchcock film with the flavors of comedy, thrill and suspense. The film might be somewhat long but never leaves the grip from the viewers.Acting as mentioned is superb and climax of the film is good, the BGM somewhat also gives the feeling of James Bond films.Overall a great spy thriller film and a must watch for all the fans of the work of Alfred Hitchcock."
jacobs-greenwood,"Oct 6, 2016",10/10,"This is certainly my favorite from among the director's many movies, and probably the quintessential Alfred Hitchcock film, I think. It employs all the successful elements of his previous films including the use of Cary Grant, as Roger Thornhill - ""the innocent man, unjustly accused, being chased cross-country while trying to prove his innocence"" and yet still manages to excite, surprise, and amaze with incredible imaging and suspense which is thankfully punctuated with humorous relief (some provided by Jesse Royce Landis, as Thornhill's mother Clara).Eve Marie Saint plays the cool blonde Eve Kendall excellently, but not quite as well as James Mason and Martin Landau perfect the villains, Phillip Vandamm and Leonard (respectively). Leo G. Carroll (appearing in his last of six of the director's films), Josephine Hutchinson, and Philip Ober (among others) also appear.So many memorable scenes, but to list just a few: the drunken drive by Grant, the return to the (now changed) mansion with the police, the murder of the U.N. diplomat, the auction scene, scenes on the train(s) especially at the end, the crop dusting chase sequence, those at the Frank Lloyd Wright house, and (of course) the ones at Mount Rushmore.The film received three Academy Award nominations: Color Art Direction-Set Decoration, Editing (George Tomasini's only Oscar nomination), and for Ernest Lehman's original story and screenplay; Hitchcock earned a Directors Guild of America nomination. It was added to the National Film Registry in 1995. #40 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list; #4 on AFI's 100 Most Heart-Pounding Movies list."
kenjha,"Jun 5, 2008",10/10,"Probably no director has made such masterpieces back to back as ""Vertigo,"" this film, and ""Psycho."" Although a bit long in the tooth, Grant is terrific as a man mistakenly drawn into a game of wits between the CIA and a group of spies. Saint is the ultimate icy blond, Mason makes an urbane villain, and Landau is creepy as Mason's sidekick. The dialog between Grant and Saint is surprisingly risqué for its time. Hitchcock keeps the action moving at a frenetic pace while building the suspense, helped by Hermann's marvelous score. The crop-dusting plane scene is justifiably famous, as is the finale atop Mount Rushmore. A masterful blend of action and comedy."

The_Void,"Nov 13, 2005",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of films, many of which are very good; and a select group of which are out and out masterpieces. His 1959 spy thriller, North by Northwest is undoubtedly among the man's best work; yet it stands out as something of a black sheep among the great director's other works. While the likes of Vertigo and Rear Window pull the viewer into the story by way of an intriguing and mysterious plot line; North by Northwest goes completely the other way, and draws you in with simple, old-fashioned entertainment value. It's true that there isn't much substance here, but at the same time; you can't doubt North by Northwest's credibility for a second, as Hitchcock has laid on the style and his story telling is as sharp as ever. The plot is typically Hitchcockian and sees a man kidnapped by a group of gangsters; on the mistake the he is someone else. After narrowly escaping, our hero goes on the run; from both the gangsters and the law. As he is drawn deeper and deeper into unfolding events, he finds himself more and more unable to stop them unfolding.By today's standards, North by Northwest could be seen as clichéd. Hitchcock has thrown in all the common spy thriller elements; from femme fatales and a British villain, to car chases and even an overblown finale; but Hitchcock implements all these elements in such a way that the film never feels old hat and, even now, nearly five decades on; North by Northwest is still an entertaining thriller, and that is testament to Hitchcock's endearing talent, as many of the recent films that are entertaining now, probably wont be fifty years down the line. Every set piece in the movie is beautifully engineered, and as the plot is perfectly paced; nothing ever seems like it shouldn't be there, and North by Northwest flows excellently. The film is best remembered for stand-out sequences including the famous bi-plane scene, but even those scenes, that have been seen separate from the movie many times, don't feel like they've been tacked on when viewing the movie in it's entirety. Many movies these days have instances that are there merely to be in the trailer and such; but here, Hitchcock is as restrained as ever, yet he still manages to insert scenes like this into the film.To be honest, I think Cary Grant got the short end of the stick with Hitchcock's films. While James Stewart got Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Rear Window, Grant only got gifted with Suspicion, To Catch a Thief, Notorious and this film; and while this one is very good, the rest of the Grant-Hitchcock collaborations are not among either man's best work. However, fans of both of these cinema legends can be thankful for North by Northwest, as both are on top of their game and in that instance; only a fine film can ensue. This isn't Cary Grant's best performance; sometimes he looks a bit out of place, and he's definitely spent too long on the sun beds - but his charm and charisma lifts even his most disappointing performances, and the one here certainly isn't one of those. Hitchcock's direction is flawless, and the film never feels clumsy or gets boring at any stage. If I was going to nit-pick, I would perhaps say that the film could have been streamlined a little bit more; but overall, North by Northwest is an entertaining classic that all fans of cinema need to see!"
ger55champ,"Nov 20, 2019",7/10,Vertigo and James Stewart is far better .I really think this movie is over rated .Enjoyable but no more than a 7 for me
WitnessToIt,"Feb 11, 2023",5/10,"Well, almost can't believe I used to love it.It could be considered entertainment. It's beautifully filmed, Eva Marie Saint is great looking...the camera angles....
I supposed there *is* suspense the first time around, for certain...
But the whole thing is nonsense.This whole ""wrong identity"" thing (done a million times better in The Wrong Man by Hitchcock, a far superior movie), here with his old standby of political intrigue and spys and all that sort of nonsense is here; add in a couple of attractive leading stars, a contrived romance, and you've got....
money in the bank...This truly is very well-shot. The Mount Rushmore sequence, the angles from on top of a building, etc....But it's not a great movie in my opinion, not a very good one.For Hitchcock, see Rear Window, see Psycho. Strangers On A Train. Certainly don't start with this.Eva Marie Saint was so wonderful in On The Waterfront - now *that's* a great movie!!!This may be considered a classic but I see through it now and I'm no longer impressed by this movie. I find it utterly ridiculous. I still feel it deserves about five stars from me though - there are worse movies; this just is no good basically. This is not a good example of how Hitchcock could be and was called ""the master of suspense""; this is a cartoon compared to many of his other films."
chemingineer,"Sep 22, 1999",N/A,"Cary Grant, kidnapped in the opening frames of the film due to a case of mistaken identity, is actually a red-herring in a cold war spying game.The game goes awfully wrong, and to set the matters right in comes the sultry blonde Eva Marie-Saint,an avatar of Mata Hari.After some cat and mouse games in a train , a crop-duster tries to mow down Grant in a widely acclaimed and much written about sequence.       But to my mind the auction sequence,in which our hero makes a perfect ass of himself inorder to get arrested and shake off his pursuers, takes the cake.It is top class hilarious stuff. This counterpoint between suspense and comedy is in fact  the tenor of the film.      The  tempo of suspense is heightened and maintained with the help of appropriate music and through shadows and sinister camera angles. The finale on Mount Rushmore is both literally and figuratively a cliff-hanger. Grant is poker faced and takes his series of misadventures stoically - a la 007. Eva Marie, though icily menacing on the outside , shows a vulnerability deep down which is alluring. As Grant aptly describes her ""she is a big girl, and in all the right places too "". The film is replete with such enjoyable one-liners. Cinema buffs would also love the editing wizardry - look out for the cut from Mount Rushmore to the upper berth in the train at the very end of the film. While not definitely the greatest of Alfred Hitchcock's oeuvre , is is nevertheless a cinema buff's delight. Rating - 8/10"
dee.reid,"Nov 28, 2009",10/10,"""North by Northwest"" may very well be one of the most entertaining and highly enjoyable thrillers ever made by a major Hollywood studio. I mean that, really. Expertly directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the film fires an arsenal of thrills, chills, first-rate performances from a first-rate cast, spectacular action set-pieces, and humor. Even with the humor, you can forget how profoundly disturbing this movie can be at times, but it's all part of the fun of ""North by Northwest.""I'll be the first ever to admit that I'm no Hitchcock fanatic in even the slightest sense, but there is one reason to believe that he was one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived. The man knew his way around films in a way few filmmakers today will ever be; today's wannabe directors, take note. The way he composes his scenes, his actors, and the on-screen action with expert precision and style shows that he always knew what he was doing when he was behind the camera, and he rightfully earned the respect as a master filmmaker.The film toys with the idea of identity. ""North by Northwest"" begins with a kidnapping, and a case of mistaken identity: a hapless Manhattan advertising executive, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is taken hostage by hired goons and brought to the lavish estate of one Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Here, he is harshly interrogated by his captors, who believe that he is really a secret agent of the government named George Kaplan. Thornhill tries to prove his innocence to them to no avail, and is soon plunged into a series of harrowing events of escalating danger, adventure and magnitude, culminating in him dangling for his dear life from Mt. Rushmore with the would-be love of his life Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), the mysterious woman he met while on a train trying to elude his would-be captors.""North by Northwest"" may very well be one of the greatest chase movies ever made. The movie itself is a slow-burn of escalating danger and suspense, as Our Hero Roger Thornhill finds himself thrust into events that he can neither understand or comprehend. And we identify with the confusion he has over the surreal turn-of-events that have taken over his life. Cary Grant infuses his character with enough confusion and witty one-liners (many of which are actually quite funny and earn some much-needed laughs to alleviate the suspense) that he earns our sympathy as an Everyman who is forced to take the reins of being a hero to fight for his life against an unspeakable evil.Of course, this film is also noteworthy for its groundbreaking and suspenseful action sequences, the most spectacular of which is the infamous ""crop-dusting"" scene, which has to be seen to be truly believed. That scene alone is worth the price of the admission. Rather than waste time on special effects and explosions and things of that nature (today's filmmakers, again take note), Hitchcock instead relies on the tension and the slow build-up so that he lets us have it with a one-two punch to the gut. Hitchcock also makes expert use of wide open spaces during this scene, and the wide-angle lens of his camera, so that even even when an airplane is the only thing we see in a wide-angle shot of a corn field, there is still an ever-looming sense of danger that something else could jump out at us from anywhere on the screen.""North by Northwest"" is an expertly directed thriller from the ""Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock. Today's filmmakers should definitely take note of this film and look for the many reasons for why it is as good as it is. His next film after this was of course the granddaddy of today's slasher flicks (and my personal favorite Hitchcock movie ever), 1960's ""Psycho.""10/10"
thesar-2,"Dec 17, 2009",10/10,"Yet another masterpiece from the master, Hitchcock. Sure, I've seen very few of his films and I'm really partial to Psycho and The Birds, but North By Northwest is no short of a classic.Granted, this movie may seem dated now, 50 years later, and furthermore, I doubt, if remade, like Psycho, any of the events of this movie couldn't even be remotely possible today, given its time and shape of cinema in the late 1950s, this was a perfect movie. It had absolutely everything: adventure, mistaken identity, comedy, romance, spy and the everyman charm of one of the greatest actors of all time, Grant. He was absolutely perfect in his role, an instant charisma that made you believe in, root for and be like at all times. No one could do it better.As for Eva Marie Saint, she was wonderful too. It's funny. I'm a huge Superman fan (since age 3) and during this updated viewing of the classic, I kept trying to picture her nearly 50 years older in Superman Returns as Martha Kent. I couldn't do itthey just didn't look like. Despite that, she was great in her seductive role.Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill, a thriving ad-exec, who is mistaken for super-spy George Kaplan and gets thrust into a world he's unaccustomed to – the other side of the road. See, he's a self-proclaimed liar (advertising) and now that the shoe's on the other foot, he must adjust.Not before long, he's accused of drunk-driving (which, as I pointed out before, most of these scenes wouldn't work today; here, the DUI's all but comical), murder, eluding the police, etc, etc. He's trying to solve the mystery, survive and romance a stranger (oooorrrr, is she???) on a train, Saint.As in most Hitchcock classics, I'm always drawn to the intrigue, suspense, originality and acting, but I think overall – the dialogue. Here it's pristine. Sure, Grant is responsible for 90% of it, but Saint also delivers some zingers. And to this day, again, 50 years later, is still fresh, funny and moves the story in a perfect rhythm. I can't even think of many movies today that develop such a punch for such witty and sharp dialogue.I think all should see this: young, old, people that first saw this in theatres, or to those who need to put the Wii down for a few hours. It's a fun, extremely family-friendly film that has tremendous depth, layers, adventure and allows the audience to pretend (or I would as a kid) to be someone else, this Thornhill/Kaplan character."
SnoopyStyle,"Sep 27, 2014",8/10,"Madison Avenue ad executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a spy named George Kaplan. He is kidnapped and brought to the estate of Lester Townsend. He is interrogated by foreign spy Philip Vandamm (James Mason). His associate Leonard (Martin Landau) tries to set him up for a fatal accident. He manages to survive but the police doesn't believe him when he tells them the story. It also turns out that Townsend is an UN diplomat. He goes to the UN general assembly to track down Townsend. Vandamm kills Townsend and Thornhill becomes the fall guy for the murder. It turns out that George Kaplan is a fictional spy created by the government to divert attention away from the real agent. On the run from the police, he boards the 20th Century Limited train bound for Chicago. On board, he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who assists him in hiding from the cops. Then it's another twist when he finds out that Eve is working for Vandamm and Leonard. It's a long winding adventure that ends on top of Mt. Rushmore.This is one convoluted story. Hitchcock is able to keep it going by the talents of Cary Grant and the audacity to keep piling on the twists. Cary Grant is a fun leading man. His charm is overflowing and he handles the wild story with great skill. Eva Marie Saint is a great Hitchcock blonde. This is simply a fun roller-coaster ride with the music, the style, and the non-stop thrills."
Spleen,"Aug 6, 2000",7/10,"Let's get one thing straight: this film is tremendous fun.  Don't lose sight of this fact because of anything I say.  It's fun ALL THE WAY THROUGH, even when it creaks.  Moreover I can see some of the things that lead people to the ridiculous conclusion that it's a masterpiece.  Several scenes are classics in miniature - I can't really say which ones, but I suppose you already know about the crop duster sequence - then there's the priceless line Cary Grant delivers as he runs to the aeroplane on the slopes of Mt. Rushmore, so carefully led up to - and Bernard Herrmann's score is brilliant.And yet ...That damned Eve Kendall: SHE'S the McGuffin, not the ""government secrets"" the baddies are trying to smuggle out of the country.  (Clearly the film wants us to think she's so much more important than they are; but if it refuses to tell us what the villains want and why, how are we in any position to make a comparison?  Hitchcock's McGuffin theory led him astray here, I fear.)  The heroine of ""North by Northwest"" can't hold a candle to her vibrant counterpart in the original cross-country Hitchcock, ""The 39 Steps"" (1935).  Watch the original to see what's missing from the remake. The later film has a tendency, just a tendency, to fall asleep on its feet: it needed more poetry in its quest, more humanity in its hero, more vigour in its man hunt, less tedium in its exposition.  If I didn't know better - if I hadn't seen ""Vertigo"", released the previous year, or ""Psycho"", from the subsequent one - I'd say Hitch had ossified."

Fortunately, I didn't study movies, otherwise I turned my hobby into a task, and my hobby would eventually become pain."
Danielpotato,"Nov 19, 2017",7/10,"When he went to Hollywood, Alfred Hitchcock made the movie Rebecca, which cost just over $ 1 million, and had a good box office run. Alfred Hitchcock just wanted to sell a ticket for the people to enjoy a good movie in a good section. After Rebecca, Mr. & Mrs. Smith also had success with the public, however it was with Strangers on a Train, Dial M for Murder, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo and obviously Rear Window that Hitchcock had its biggest hits in his Hollywood career until the mid-50's.With that Alfred Hitchcock gained a lot of strength within Hollywood, and he got a big budget for this movie, North by Northwest. North by Northwest was another commercial project that Alfred Hitchcock embraced in focus in the espionage. North by Northwest was successful at the box office, but it was not on the same wavelength as his previous projects, which I mentioned here, especially Rear Window, and the film did little more than double its own budget. So Alfred Hitchcock returned to Psycho on a more modest budget.North by Northwest, it's a good movie. It has a good suspense, the direction is very good by Alfred Hitchcock, and the performances are solid, especially Eva Marie Saint, who is perfect here. The great sin of this movie, for me, are the characters of this movie. Considering the important ideas and techniques that Alfred Hitchcock developed that could fill some books. I always expected more from this project. The problem with this film is how some of these characters were written, in this department I particularly blame Ernest Lehman. Ernest Lehman, wrote the characters in an amateur way, in which these same characters do not look anything like humans when confronted with the same situations that appear in the film. Particularly the scene with the mother of the main character, when she confronts one of the ""supposed"" hijackers in an elevator. From this moment, I completely lost the notion of a film with a serious focus.And to be honest, the characters surround the comedy tone many times and in many situations, particularly in some situations with the main character at a mid-train station. From that moment, I completely lost interest in this film, and I just went to look at the movie just to pass the time. And waiting for the movie to end. For a film that wanted to be serious, and this was its initial proposal with the public, the movie was loses much coherence as a film. It was a disappointment, for me."
valleyjohn,"Jan 23, 2011",4/10,"Considering the amount of films i have seen over the years , i don't think i have come across a Cary Grant movie. A name I'm fully aware of but does he live up to the Hollywood superstar status he had back in the 40's & 50's ? Not on this performance. I was really disappointed with this , especially because it was a Alfred Hitchcock film. At times i was confused by the plot and at others i was just bored. Cary Grant's acting seemed wooden and the relationship with Eva Marie Saint was never convincing. The loves scenes were very cold and the 27 year age gap seemed very apparent. Plus points are that some of the scenes looked great , especially the aeroplane one and the performances of Mason and Landau are pretty good. Give me Psycho or Rear Window ahead of this any day."
Coffee_in_the_Clink,"Feb 7, 2020",9/10,"""North by Northwest"" is one of Hitchcock's best movies. A funny, adventure-filled thriller about an advertisement executive, played by Cary Grant, who is mistaken for a government agent by some powerful unscrupulous characters and kidnapped. Eventually framed for murder then, he goes on the run, with the police, FBI and the criminals whom he has invariably crossed all hot on his tail. Cary Grant is fantastic. He delivers so many witty and sarcastic lines throughout the film, one of my favourites being ""I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives and several bartenders that depend upon me, and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed."" He was in good shape in this for a man over fifty. Hitchcock's direction is evident and as powerful as it ever was; the Mount Rushmore scenes are highly applaudable and were a fitting backdrop for a story that took us to many places and mad scenarios. Ernest Lehman is the one we have to thank for the story and script. Grant, Hitchcock and Lehman's work together help ensure that ""North by Northwest"" maintains a perfect balance between serious, high-octane thriller and comedy.""Something wrong with your eyes?""
""Yes, they're sensitive to questions."""
noxid100,"Sep 19, 2004",10/10,"One of those great flicks you don't mind watching over again every year or so. Top drawer suspense, all wrapped up in sophistication and some of the best man/woman chemistry ever captured on film. Definitely the highlight of Eve Marie-Saint's career. (I'm betting she'd agree.) Cary Grant was never better. And Alfred Hitchcock, some of whose work made me wonder why he was so celebrated, truly got it right in this movie. Some of the more memorable scenes: Cary Grant creeping along a ledge, high above street level, and slipping through an open window into a sleeping woman's hotel room. ""Stop!"" she cries out when she sees someone coming through the window. Then, as Grant hurries through the room toward the door, glancing at her and apologizing, she more entreats than commands, ""Stop!"" The way the movie ends is as good as it gets, but I won't spill the beans here. Watch this movie when it comes along, if you haven't already done so at least once."
ericolsen1953,"Dec 30, 2004",10/10,"Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill is caught up in a most-absurd set of mistakes and blunders that a super-spy like Phillip Vandamm ever made! Roger is kidnapped, forced into drunk-driving and left for dead by the cell of profit-oriented commie-sympathizers headed by James Mason's Vandamm. This gets our hero good and mad, and he's determined to get to the bottom of things. When he gets chased into a cornfield by a machine-gunning crop-duster pilot, it provides us with one of the greatest SPFX of the 1950's! Wouldn't THAT tick you off, if it happened to you?? Roger eventually learns that not only are the bad guys pulling strings on him, but his own government is manipulating him as well, he wants out! Roger doesn't intend on disappointing his string of dependents by ""getting myself SLIGHTLY killed."" But, beauty gets this Madison Avenue advertising exec back into the spy game when the glorious Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) becomes vulnerable to ""detection and elimination"" as the CIA puts it. Like Gilda, Eve is a very immoral girl who's sacrificed her honor for a comfy life as Vandamm's mistress...in reality, she's a good girl who fights for truth, justice and the American way. The principals end up almost defacing a famous monument (somewhere near Rapid City) toward the end of this flick. Hitch's funny-bone is working well, as the very-drunk Cary tries to save his life while careening down a twisty mountain rode in a convertible...it's actually a very scary scene as Cary narrowly escapes injury and death several times, but it's also hilarious. The morning after, in police court, Roger's lawyer states publicly that he knows his client to be a reasonable and logical man, only to be publicly contradicted by Roger's cynical mother. Like Arabesque, it's all very unlikely, but still tremendous fun."
erwinjones,"Jan 27, 2022",8/10,"First of our new Erwin-Jones Thursday Family film night. A bona fide classic which holds up remarkably well after 63 years! My only problem is with the poster, those arrows on the name point North by West! We awarded it ****"
AdamBolla,"Mar 30, 2012",10/10,"I first heard about this film as I was attempting to watch the top 1000 movies of all time last Summer. I was apprehensive at first only because of the year made and the title was not appealing. After seeing that Alfred Hitchcock directed it, I was a bit relieved. Why do I think this is the greatest film of all time? (a) The plot is solid (b) The cinematography is eye candy (c) Not one hesitation in action. As I am watching the film I notice that every action sequence was original and therefore copied by every action film after 1959. Cary Grant dominates every seen. The dialog is brilliantly written and it's safe to say, no action film will ever come close to topping North by Northwest."
filipemanuelneto,"Aug 6, 2020",6/10,"Personally, this is not one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films, although it is one of the most acclaimed and one of the most interesting. The script revolves around a confusion of identities, where an ordinary citizen is mistaken for a spy and ends up in a tremendous confusion with gigantic repercussions on his personal life and national security.The script is quite good and the story has no dead moments. It entertains the audience in a perfect way until the end and makes us curious to know what is really going on, curiosity being an important part of what keeps us stuck in the film (and one of the reasons I prefer to hardly talk about the plot). The main character, played by Cary Grant, was so well thought out that we quickly established an affective and sympathetic link with her, caring about what will happen to her. It goes without saying that, although the cast is very good, it is really Cary Grant who stands out here. Eva Marie Saint is good, but she never leaves the shadow of the male protagonist. Another actor that deserves a positive note is Martin Landau.Technically, it is an impeccable film, to the taste of director Hitchcock. It is full of symbolic scenes or with more than one meaning, some of them bordering on the dreamlike. Some of the scenes are truly striking, like those that were shot on Mount Rushmore. The camera and film work is excellent and cinematography perfectly harmonizes color, light, shadow and contrast, resulting in a visually elegant film, although with the characteristics of a film of its time, of course. The soundtrack is also quite good, as are the sets and costumes."
Angry_Arguer,"Jan 4, 2004",1/10,"Despite Hitchcock's penchant for perfection on two occasions (Rear Window & Psycho), this is an absolutely imbecilic excursion.  Plot holes fill the script and even Hitchcock's usual visual grandeur isn't present here.  I'll trace this to where Spielberg's trait of ""maximum suspension of disbelief"" originates.  More interesting works like 'Rope' and 'Birds' have daring elements that make them stronger.Cary Grant is a block of wood.  Heck all the acting is simple by today's standards.  The plot, too, is nothing remarkable since there have been so many other ""running man/conspiracy"" movies since this one.  No doubt this work of Hitchcock has dated the worst.Tony Scott tried remaking this, he failed.  Perhaps someone smarter like David Fincher or Robert Rodriguez will try again.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud"
gentk,"Feb 23, 2008",10/10,"no doubt about it, one of Hithcock's finest. drama, suspense, mystery, the the cutting wit and humor of it all, laced with the sensual and seductive Eva Marie-Saint, the sinister and suave James Mason, and Cary Grant who was the ultimate hero. perhaps in my lifetime, i've seen it so many hundreds of times, it's close to a thousand times. as i write, it's on Turner Classic Movies. i wont go on raving about one of my top ten all time movies. i do have a point, or a question. near the end of the movie, when the Chicago Police took Thornhill to the airport, and the Professor walked him to the plane, why did Hitchcock at that time, choose to deprive us of that one bit of duologue between the two of them with the roar of plane engines. it was the briefest exchange, but what was being said has always been lost on me. anybody with any clue, or inside info?"
robb_772,"Jul 28, 2006",10/10,"Arguably director Alfred Hitchcock's best-loved film, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is an insanely skillful blend of action, romance, comedy, and intrigue that never feels contrived or strained. The film was almost instantly embraced by critics and audiences as a film masterpiece, and it has since only grown in reputation as one of the all-time great films of any era. Amazingly, this is certainly one case where such high ended praise is completely deserved, and, in fact, this is one of those rare films that have been heralded as a ""classic"" for decades that truly meets such impossibly high expectations. As a matter of fact, it very well may be impossible to say too many good things about this picture.Alfred Hitchcock is always a director that typically placed technical film craft over the importance of such necessary dramatic devices such as plausible plot twists and significant character development. As a matter of fact, the 1946 film Notorious (which gets my vote as the master's best film) is probably the only truly character-driven film of his career. However, the artificiality of the plot and strictly two-dimensional nature of the character is absolutely not a problem in this film, and may even be one of its strongest assets. This is because NORTH BY NORTHWEST, as with Hitchcock's 1955 picture TO CATCH A THIEF, is a total farce from beginning to end, and typically strong storytelling elements such as a clear narrative and believable characters would have only bloated the picture.Further cementing the film's status as an unquestioned masterwork is the jaw-dropping number of eye-catching set pieces that retain in the memory even years after the picture has ended, yet somehow manage to gel into a coherent whole. Hitchcock was in the absolute peak of his technical prowess here, and each and every scene plays out with the seemingly impossible professionalism that only a truly skilled and inventive filmmaker can achieve. Sure, the now-landmark crop duster scene and the Mt. Rushmore finale are now as permanently etched in the public's collective conscious as the Nation Anthem, but virtually any other scene in the film (no matter how minor it's significance) is nearly as stunning. And Hitchcock also pulls memorable performances from Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Jessie Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll, Phillip Ober, and Martin Landau  all whom are perfectly cast and play their intentionally thin roles with an alarming exactness.Yet even more than Hitchcock's film-making mastery, the real reason the film is an absolute gem from beginning to end is none other than Cary Grant. At age 55 and still unnervingly handsome, Grant is perhaps Hitchcock's perfect on-screen hero as he jump-starts even the most under-developed roles with magnetic charisma, dapper humor, and an disarming sex appeal that remains absolutely effortless even in his third decade as actor. The film basically calls upon Grant to venture into practically ever screen personae that he had personified up to that time, and the dashing actor impressively never misses a beat. Although NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a film that has completely earned the title of masterpiece for many reasons, watching one of the silver screen's ultimate stars work his uncompromised magic is reason enough to hold it in high esteem."
executiveassistant-62259,"Dec 9, 2024",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is one of the best films in his long and distinguished career. Part of the success of the movie lies in the screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era. Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard Hermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the above mentioned qualities, ""North by Northwest"" was photographed by Robert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did outstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired Alfred Hitchcock.The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This has to be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock because of the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the repartee between her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romance that aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be really happening.Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, so we shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time it turns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others of the same period have. The highlights of the film are the sequences involving the crop duster, the train ride to Chicago where Eve and Roger first meet, the auction, and the Mount Rushmore climax.This is one of the best contributions by Cary Grant to a."
