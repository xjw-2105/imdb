Steffi_P,"Oct 15, 2006",9/10,"Although Kubrick's films are marked by their massive variation of genre and tone, one theme that crops up again and again is a strong anti-war sentiment, and this was never stated more strongly than in Paths of Glory. A relatively early Kubrick picture and, despite coming before what is considered his classic period, it is one of his best.In contrast to his previous picture, The Killing, a definite Kubrick style is beginning to emerge now. One notable example is the scene in which General Mireau tours the trenches, walking towards the audience with the camera retreating away from him. This technique would be repeated years later in Kubrick's other war film, Full Metal Jacket. There is also something about the arrangement of objects in the frame, as well the tracking and dollying which hints towards his more familiar later style. His recurring chess motif appears as well, albeit subtly. At the court martial the floor is chequered, and the soldiers on trial are seated with guards standing behind them as if they are pawns about to be sacrificed.The light and contrast in this picture is put to good effect. The palatial officers' headquarters is light and airy with few shadows. The trenches are gloomy and cramped. Kubrick was becoming a real master at contrasting locations and getting the look of a place just right.The use of music in Paths of Glory is bold and brilliant. The pre-recorded score is almost entirely percussive  all rhythmic sounds with no melody. A weird kettle drum track is used to help build tension in the night patrol scene, while in the climactic scene the funeral march drumming instills a sense of dread, further heightened by having the shots edited in time to the beat. In the emotional final scene we get the complete opposite  a beautiful vocal melody. This has all the more impact after hearing nothing but militaristic drums for the rest of the film.The casting is absolutely flawless. While there are no big names apart from leading man Kirk Douglas and the now elderly Adolphe Menjou, there isn't a single weak performance. The despair and resentment of the condemned soldiers feels so absolutely real. In contrast the smugness and fake sympathy of the upper class officers is brilliantly portrayed.Throughout his career Kubrick never seemed to be particularly keen on blatantly emotional moments. Paths of Glory is the exception. The later scenes are incredibly poignant and moving, and the final moments in the soldier's bar are what makes it a masterpiece more than anything else  the icing on the cake. However it's quite probable that Kubrick regretted this as an overly sentimental approach, as woolly sentimentalism was a major gripe of his when he worked on Spartacus. Whatever the case, he certainly reined in the stirring stuff considerably after this, to the point where his later films became characterised by their understatement of emotions."
WriterDave,"Jul 28, 2007",9/10,"An arrogant French general (a superb George Macready) orders his men on a suicide mission and then has the gall to try to court marshal and execute three of them for cowardice in the face of the enemy. A former lawyer turned colonel (Kirk Douglas in his prime) is the voice of reason against gross injustice. This excellently staged and wonderfully acted production is as much an acting showcase for Douglas as it is a directorial masterstroke by a young Stanley Kubrick who adapted this to the screen from a novel based on actual accounts.Kubrick displays a great control of sound effects and camera movement in the brief but effective battle scenes that expertly depict the controlled chaos that was trench warfare during WWI. Things get juicier during the ensuing courtroom battle where the deafening disparity between the elite who propagate and profit from war and the common citizens who suffer and die in war is shown with great lucidity.Unlike later Kubrick epics, this runs at a crisp 90 minutes, though suffers briefly from a slow and awkwardly staged opening ten minutes before Douglas comes on screen. Ultimately, this holds up very well to modern scrutiny thanks to the flawlessness of Kurbick's craft, the amazing ensemble acting, and the surprising depth of its philosophical and psychological pondering. ""Paths of Glory"" is more anti-arrogance than anti-war, and is unapologetically sentimental and pro-soldier. As such, much can still be gleaned from its message."
ma-cortes,"Aug 15, 2010",8/10,"Sensational antiwar treatise based on facts with a relentless and vivid denounce against the military commanding class represented by two senior Generals (George Macready , Adolphe Menjou ) who order his men a suicidal mission . France 1916 , an upright officer , Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), must lead his soldiers against difficult enemy positions called the 'Ants Hill' . Then he's also the Colonel lawyer assigned to defend three (the privates Timothy Carey , Ralph Meeker , Joe Turkel) of them when the attack is lost against charges of cowardice and submitted to eventual firing squad. Never has the screen thrust so deeply into the guts of war! The most explosive motion picture in 25 years ! Bombshell! The roll of the drums... the click of the rifle-bolts... the last cigarette... and then... the shattering impact of this story... perhaps the most explosive motion picture in 25 years! It explodes in the no-man's land no picture ever dared cross before! Now the screen blasts open the bombshell story of a Colonel who led his regiment into hell and back - while their maddened General waited for them - with a firing squad!This is a thought-provoking and intelligent war drama perfectly acted by strong cast and masterfully directed. Interesting screenplay based on a Humphrey's Cobb's novel has been well adapted by Stanley Kubrick and Jim Thompson . It depicts a brooding study about futility and insanity of war , making a shattering accusation against the military ruling staff who cares on promotions more than the soldiers . Kirk Douglas is very good as compassionate French Colonel who commands his troops in some spectacular scenes on the trenches . Stunning support cast beautifully performed by notorious secondaries , such as : Emily Meyer as the priest , Wayne Morris as the lieutenant , Richard Anderson as the Major prosecutor , Ralph Meeker , Timothy Carey , Joe Turkel and Suzanne Christian , Kubrick's wife . Special mention for the two selfish and ruthless Generals exceptionally performed by George Macready and Adolph Menjou . Excellent cinematography in black and white by cameramn George Krause , filmed on location in Schleissheim Palace, Munich, and Bavaria Film studios, Geiselgasteig, Grünwald, Bavaria, Germany (studio). The motion picture was wonderfully realized by the maestro Stanley Kubrick and lavishly produced by James B. Harris , his usual producer at the time . This magnificent film along with ¨ All quiet on the Western front ¨ , ¨Westfront 1918 ¨, ¨ Captain Conan ¨ and ¨King and country¨ result to be the best ones about the powerful antiwar theme . Time hasn't dimmed its power , or its poignancy and remains untouchable the critique to the military hypocrisy in an ultra-lucid exposition . Rating : 8.8/10. Phenomenal and marvellous film , above average . Essential and indispensable watching ."
bmaclach,"Nov 3, 2000",10/10,"I consider Paths of Glory as one of the most memorable of Kubrick's entire output. The most remarkable aspect of this pioneer anti-war film is the complete absence of any persons depicting the ""real"" enemy. Therefore, the significance of the film lay not so much in its anti-war message, but in its brilliant expose of the ""monsters within"" the general staff, superbly acted by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. The message here is that the enemy lurks much closer to home. In most war films, whether they glorify or condemn the carnage, there is rarely any venturing at all into the darker side of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabashed depiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself; and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others for their own self aggrandizement. Truly, one of my all time favourite movies."
dougdoepke,"May 24, 2008",N/A,"How well I remember the audience of 1958 sitting in stunned silence as the daring iconoclasm of the film washed over us like a bucket of cold water at a snoozer's convention. Post-war generations had seen nothing like its brutal honesty before. Instead, Hollywood had taught us that soldiers don't bawl like babies before being shot, that chaplains aren't part of a murderous war machine, that military justice really is about justice, and that generals however far removed are ultimately good and honorable men, (and that cameras always look away from execution scenes). Sure, the movie was not about our army, but the power of its message could not be missed, and no one from that era, having seen it, could again accept Hollywood's platitudes at face value.Now, fifty years later, the film is still timely, having lost none of its power to illuminate. Thanks be to Kirk Douglas for taking a chance on an unproven Stanley Kubrick and getting Allied Artists to finance what was so clearly a non-commercial project. I suspect too, that it was at AA's insistence that Hollywood veterans be cast, even though the movie was shot to great advantage amidst the majestic settings of old Europe. Given the film's message, I think Kubrick would have preferred no-name principals, but then, who could have surpassed the oily charm of Adolphe Menjou's diabolical general, or the pathetic repulsiveness of Timothy Carey's sacrificial dog-face. (It's ironic that the part of the cowardly lieutenant went to an authentic war-hero, naval air-ace Wayne Morris, then only two years away from an untimely death.) This many decades later, I still have mixed feelings about the celebrated final scene. On one hand, it's so clearly manipulative (someone once called it a ""male weepie""), that I try to steel myself against its undeniable force; on the other, it's so superbly well done that the humming chorus of universal brotherhood never fails to move me, even after this many viewings.Researchers digging into origins of 60's counter-culture should check out themes and characterizations of the screen-play, particularly Timothy Carey's social outcast and Fred Bell's absolutely stunning thirty seconds of emotional break-down. For this is one of the few films from the conformist Eisenhower era to cast a shadow forward in time and serve as a reference point for future generations. The film's abundant cynicism may no longer be as revealing as it once was, thanks to Vietnam. Yet the emotional honesty remains as fresh and compelling as ever in its search for a gut-level depiction of real human anguish. Above all, Kubrick's anti-war classic points toward a more civilized potential amidst the barbarities and passions of combat, whether French or American, and given present political realities, still has many lessons to offer."
TheLittleSongbird,"Dec 9, 2009",10/10,"I saw this movie for the first time on television today, after being persuaded by the reviews I read beforehand praising it. Also I like Kirk Douglas. Although I am not directly familiar with Kubrick's work, a shameful admission I know. Out of what I have seen so far I loved Dr Strangelove and despite only seeing it once while flicking through channels liked The Shining too. Anyway back on target, Paths of Glory was brilliant in my opinion!Winston Churchill famously claimed that it was this movie that was closest to evoking the atmosphere of WW1 and the military mind. And you know what, he is right. For one thing, Paths of Glory is gorgeously filmed, with relentlessly beautiful cinematography and nice costumes and scenery. The screenplay is sometimes humorous, sometimes moving and sometimes even haunting, either way it was some fine writing. The efficiency of Kubrick's direction is proof of a great man at work.The performances were superb. As the general who orders the hopeless attack on the German position, Adolphe Menjou's character is perceived as a villain not because of being an officer adhering to the letter, but that he is seen as ""the arrogant aristocrat"" because of his fear of the working classes than his hatred of the enemy. Among the cast, Timothy Carey and Kirk Douglas especially were outstanding. And the music? That is one rousing score I can tell you. Great movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
claudio_carvalho,"May 11, 2004",10/10,"In France, in the First World War, the insane and ambitious general Gen. Paul Mireau (George Macready) orders Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) to lead his men in a suicide attack against Germans in the unattainable Ant Hill. After a massacre of the French soldiers, Gen. Mireau orders his artillery to drop bombs between the French front line of attack and the trenches, to avoid the soldier to return to the protection of the trenches. The commander of the French artillery refuses to accomplish the order. Gen. Mireau asks his superior, Gen. George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), to send three men to Court Martial and execute them for cowardice through shooting, as an example to the other soldiers. Colonel Dax, a former lawyer, defends his men in the unfair trial.Yesterday I watched this outstanding masterpiece for the first time and certainly it is among the best movies of the cinema history. The disgusting story shows the insanity of a war, where men are treated like numbers and not as human beings. The reality of the battles scenes is amazing. The cast has a stunning performance, highlighting the trio George Macready, Adolphe Menjou and Kirk Douglas. The lack of sensibility and respect for the human life and the cynicism in the dialogs of the two generals are fantastic. Two other points that called my attention are the fancy reception for the general staff, while their subalterns are fighting in the front and the misunderstanding of the real intentions of Colonel Dax by Gen. George Broulard. A must-see movie! My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Glória Feita de Sangue' ('Glory Made of Blood')Note: On 07 February 2025, I saw this film again."
Snake-666,"Jan 31, 2004",7/10,"In an attempt to enhance his own reputation, General Mireau (George MacReady) orders his troops to advance and seize the heavily fortified `Ant Hill' from the German army. Despite realising the hazardous nature of the order, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) reluctantly agrees to lead the charge. As expected the attack goes badly and many French troops lose their lives which results in a large number of men refusing to leave their trenches. General Mireau sees this from his safe position and, refusing to admit that the attack was suicide from the outset, blames the cowardice of those who refused to fight for the devastating outcome of the battle. As a result Mireau demands that three soldiers from the regiment be held accountable and face an immediate court martial followed by death by firing squad. Dax seeks for the French military hierarchy to admit the truth.This dramatic condemnation of the politics-over-people attitude of military forces during World War I is an all too accurate portrayal of how the conflict resulted in one of the largest and most pointless losses of life in all known history. Taking place in the trenches amidst the height of the futile conflict between France and Germany, director Stanley Kubrick (in only his second feature film) seeks to press home a fiercely anti-war statement backed up by actual historical facts rather than the typical embellishment that can be found in more modern war films. While the story itself is somewhat fanciful, the portrayal of the morally corrupt military leaders that sent hundreds of thousands of men to their deaths for no more reason than to satisfy their own expanded egos and enhance their perfidious reputations is, unfortunately, all too accurate and a powerful indictment of not just the French army, but all those who participated in one of the most bloody conflicts in human history. What makes the film so stinging in its approach is the flat out lies told by protagonist Mireau, who claims that one man's life is worth more to him than a reputation, yet when presented with the opportunity for political acclaim and honours is all too willing to send troops to battle when freely admitting that four thousand will probably perish in no man's land. A quick glance through history proves such on-screen bald faced lies to be inherently and tragically true off-screen, even in relation to Britain's very own Field Marshall Hague. The French government found the representation of their military too close to fact and banned Paths of Glory', eventually lifting the ban in 1970.The film does not stand out in mere message alone. For those familiar with Kubrick's later work such as 2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968), A Clockwork Orange' (1971) and Full Metal Jacket' (1987) the director's soon-to-be trademarks can easily be spotted. As with many Kubrick films there is a remarkable ability to portray to the viewer what is not seen on the screen. The full carnage of the war is displayed in a darkly amusing, yet chilling scene where one soldier questions another on whether he is scared of death or merely getting hurt. As this precedes the actual battle scenes by a matter of minutes the viewer becomes rapidly acquainted with the carnage, fear and suffering these men faced despite a distinct lack of on-screen bloodshed. One could argue that the short, virtually bloodless battle scene in Paths of Glory' is even more powerful than the bloody, disturbing and prolonged beach scenes from Saving Private Ryan' (1998). Kubrick wonderfully crafts this movie around the composition of the filming rather than relying on any sort of special effects or visual trickery. Throughout the movie, particularly during the battle scenes, the viewer is given a third person perspective of the struggles of men to come to terms with life and death under such harsh conditions. Incredible acting performances from Kirk Douglas, George MacReady and Adolphe Menjou attract the viewer's attention and become the central focus in a war film with scarce amounts of action. Kubrick condemns the politics of war through the use of the politics that control war.It is very difficult to write about this film and fully do it justice. The pre-Vietnam anti-war sentiment is easily the main focus of the movie and it is through competent acting that the movie is made great. It becomes somewhat irrelevant that the movie is set in WWI as the same message applies to every major war, particularly the following decades Vietnam War. It wasn't until Oliver Stone's Platoon' (1986) that viewers were again treated to an historically based condemnation of war that focused less on heroes and more on the way things really were in battle. Wisely, the movie opens with a narrated epilogue which informs the viewer of the absurdity of WWI and then ends with a melodramatic and almost tear-inspiring scene which, although not in place when compared to the sombre and melancholy feel of the previous eighty minutes, ends the film in such a way that the film itself must be contemplated. Paths of Glory' is easily one of the most powerful films of all time and a pejorative anti-war statement where the only real failing is the short length of the movie and occasional poor performances from the supporting cast. My rating for Paths of Glory' - 7½/10."
gbheron,"Jan 19, 2000",10/10,"Paths of Glory is one of the best movies ever made, and possibly the best ""war"" movie, period. Paths of Glory does not portray war as conflict between armies or individual soldiers arrayed against one another on the battlefield.  Nor does it portray the acts of great leaders and heroes of war. No this film takes a different tact.The setting is the Western Front of 1916 in the trenches with French soldiers faced off against an invisible German force across a barren No Man's Land. The German's are never seen and the dramatic ""combat"" is between vain French officers as they vie for prestige and honors.  The victims are the innocent French soldiers under their command who suffer miserably because of their arrogance and ignorance.Brilliant, gripping, and definitely a ""must see""."
TheAnimalMother,"Jan 28, 2010",10/10,"Paths Of Glory is a masterpiece without doubt. Usually a masterpiece is the pinnacle of a directors career. However when you are talking about Stanley Kubrick, you are talking about genuine genius. This is just one of his many masterpieces, but Paths Of Glory is probably as good a film as any of Kubrick's other best works. I have seen tons of war films in my life, many great ones. Honestly, this is my favorite of them all. When I first saw this film I didn't expect it to blow me away. After all it is an early Kubrick film, however it blew me away constantly, and completely. This is not only one of the greatest war films ever made, not only one of the greatest black & white films ever made, it is simply one of the greatest films ever made bar none. The film screams integrity, in each and every way. This film is a joy to watch, and in my estimation, Paths Of Glory will remain forever as one of cinemas greatest accomplishments.10/10"
Xstal,"Oct 9, 2022",8/10,"You've been posted to the front, to serve your country in the war, now they want you to go over, and face the enemy once more, only problem that you have, is you know it's certain death, there'll be no gains made here today, but there'll be, almighty mess.As powerful a film as ever existed against those who pursue war as a solution, painting a portrait of the incompetence of command and the futility of armed conflict, as French soldiers on the front during WW1 discover the penalty for disobedience, the consequence of insubordination and that everyone is accountable, and that nothing's fair, there is no love in war.Top performances all round, especially from Kirk Douglas, and a director that went on to make his mark quite significantly in the world of film."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Oct 1, 2023",9/10,"General Paul Mireau demands that a group of soldiers are executes after they refuse to attack an enemy's strongly held position, only Captain Dax tries to seek justice for the men.The more I watch Stanley Kubrick's films, the more I am genuine blown away and captivated by his incredible film making. He captures the claustrophobia and futility of trench warfare, what a ghastly piece of history The First World War was.It shows the true depravity of some men, as well as the extraordinary humanity some have inside. Definitely dramatic and full of some impressive sequences, it also boasts and ending that may justIt's so twisted, Mireau is one of those characters that manages to get under your skin, he burrows away into the unit like a termite, it's a terrific performance from George Macready, he's so twisted and full of malice.Kirk Douglas is incredible, it's performances such as this that make it clear he was a great, that scene where turns down the promotion was fantastic.It truly is a brilliant film.9/10."
Prismark10,"Sep 7, 2014",7/10,"As 2014 is the centenary of the beginning of The Great War, many television channels are showing some of classic war films.Paths of Glory deals with the French side of the war and contrasts with All Quiet on the Western Front which dealt from the German perspective.This was the second feature film from director Stanley Kubrick and this might the only film where Kirk Douglas is at his most heroic, the straight up Colonel Dax who realises that his men are being sold down the river.A General promised a promotion ruthlessly orders a tired battalion to charge up a hill and then looks for scapegoats when it fails. He wants to shoot a 100 men for cowardice but this number is whittled down to 3. One of them is chosen by his superior officer because he knows that officer is a drunk, a coward who killed one of his own soldier and so takes the opportunity to get rid off him. Another was drawn by random chance. Colonel Dax defends these men passionately but to no avail because its a kangaroo court.The film has a very effective battle sequence and before it starts you see Douglas walking up the trench with a determined grimace, its Kubrick showing his early promise.After the battle scenes, the film turns into a courtroom film and then it morphs into a film dealing with death as the men are sentenced and await their fate.The film has a raw edge, unlike other Kubrick films its not very long, its well acted with some hiss-able villains such as the dastardly General Mireau but it will also make you angry as the soldiers are used as fodder whose lives are cheap."
cfnas,"Dec 17, 2003",10/10,"This movie, along with the original screen version of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" must rank as one of the most tragic versions of what war is really like. The arrogance and total disregard for the welfare of the soldier as beautifully portrayed by Menjou and McReady, in opposition to the care and concern of the Colonel so humanly portrayed by  Douglas adds to the reality of what the world was like in the days of the ""Great War."" Additionally, the roles played by Wayne Morris, Ralph Meeker and the self serving aide to McReady add to the greatness of this memorable motion picture. There is no ""Viva La France"" here."
M-LN,"Sep 4, 2000",6/10,"I was rather disappointed by this movie. It is supposed to bring a strong message about the cruelty of war, not only created by the fights but also by the nature of man. The problem is that the good guys are too perfect while the bad guys are too bad. The story is too simple, and I am not sure it has any intellectual value, despite the evident willing to criticize."
christophe92300,"Dec 12, 2013",3/10,"We're still wondering where Stanley Kubrick wanted to go with this Paths of Glory.Even though the historic facts on which it relies on are far from being uninteresting, the plot is, the dramatic tension is almost non-existent and the story goes from one subject to another from scene to scene with not much coherence.As for the form, granted the cinematography is beautiful with some excellent tracking shots in the trenches and an exceptional travelling shot in the no man's land, but the mise-en-scène is sometimes almost ridiculous when for example two characters are climbing stairs, then stop halfway through, then separate in opposite directions.To sum up, it's hard to grasp Kubric's logic, what he wanted to tell, the level of analysis is superficial and even though the movie is barely an 1h30 long, you just want to get to the end of it."
danm99,"Feb 26, 2003",N/A,"What to say that hasn't already been said. This astonishing cinematic work of art (no kidding) unquestionably is the GREATEST FILM EVER - bar none.  I deeply and passionately LOVE this brilliant early Kubrick production. Congratulations to expert screenwriters (and unique pulp writers of the 5O's) Calder Willingham (who also penned his own excellent adaptation of ""The Strange One""; highly recommended) and Jim Thompson (""The Grifters"" ""The Killer Inside Me""; which strongly influenced Tarantino), who both present a superbly incisive script with powerfully effective dialogue that really rings more than true.  If only we had more real writers and scripts like this remarkable achievement, we'd be writing far more favorable reviews. ""Paths of Glory"", alone, would serve as anyone's lifetime achievement award.I don't care how much you HATE B&W films - put this one on your MUST-SEE. Compelling cinema-verite photography creates astounding visuals from a varity of incisive angles; like the famous mobile wide-angle tracking shot of Dax (probably Kirk Douglas's most stirring and important performance) moving through the squalid and horrifying trenches as the battle begins with explosions breaking out all over.  The suspense and tension is frightening, but almost beautifully eerie in the most compelling ways as Kubrick takes us through the deadly limbo of no-man's land - the 'paths of glory' which finally leads to the grave.  The action, skillfully combined with powerful moral and existential themes are amazingly conveyed through the bleak yet articulately stunning visuals.  THIS IS A FILMMAKER'S FILM!The moral outrage of the sadistic injustice of the military courtmartial never fails to make my blood fully boil.  The hypocrisy and corruption is degradingly infuriating.  If anything will make a cynic out of you, it's this appropriately pessimistic and depressing cinema chronical based on a true stupid incident in WWI.  What's even worse is how POG, in many perceptive ways, serves as an allegory for all the B.S. in real life: Pig-headed leadership in the parasitic hands of the superior greed freaks, two-faced deceptive manipulations, double-standards, backstabbings, social bigotry, arm-chair warriors, egotism, corrupt politics, the militaries's abuse of too much power - and it's destructive desire at satisfying it's lust for vainglory (sounds a little like Hollywood) - Did I leave anything out?  You name it, POG has it - and I'm not being sarcastic.The entire ensemble cast is superb with special mention to George Macready as the utterly pompous power-mad glory-seeking ""soldier"", General Mireuo (who thinks nothing about ordering his troops to open fire on his own men for not charging out of the trenches and dying for his ""country""; which smells a bit like ME ME ME).  Don't worry, you'll throughly hate his guts. It truly is true method acting.  Again, kudos to Macready,  a fine actor who was always too good at playing highly unethical villians. (Incidently, this was a favorite film of a young 195O's Marlon Brando and old salty Winston Churchill, who praised Kubrick's incisive authenticity in the exciting battle scene, which does resemble news footage).Timothy Carey (also ultra-offbeat-cool in Kubrick's other exceptional early flick, ""The Killing"") is morbidly humorous and gut-wrenching as one of the poor fools coldly picked to be executed; all in the ruthless 'patriotic' name (and amoral game) of 'glory'. ARE ANY OF OUR LEADERS LISTENING?  Too bad that Carey's memorable talents were so underused by Hollywood, but that always seems to be the unfortunate norm.  A little like what ironically happens to him in this intriguing but downbeat story.Ralph Meeker (who was also memorable as the brutal and ruthless Mike Hammer in the 5O's cult gem ""Kiss Me Deadly"" - a complete opposite role that shows a true range of his acting abilities) delivers another wretching performance as the true brave soldier unjustly sentenced for ""Cowardice in the Face of the Enemy"".  (Maybe he should have turned 'about face', but it would have still been 'damned if he did and damned if he didn't' - another grim moral theme here).  His breakdown scene right before he is to be taken out and shot is terribly heartbreaking, for I felt so wanting, but helplessly unable, to come to his help.Take my word for it, everyone else is awesome; a true actor's dramatic show with dark satirical overtones.  POG goes beyond the mere preaching anti-war diatribe (though it does convey that almost naturally, like going without having to say).  It's a great classic morality play that will really make you stop (many, many times) and truly make you think (many many times). Airheads not allowed.  Moreover, this haunting and disturbing masterpiece is top entertainment, something too many art films aren't.     >It will really make you question things about our troubled, convoluted world and how things are to often immorally and inhumanly run all in the sick name of greed and destructive power. Not too lovely, for the director pulls no punches.  This film really has grown more profound (and currently pertinent) since its initial release.  Also the editing is taut and concise; there isn't a single wasted moment.  Count the number of films on one hand that has accomplished that miraculous feat; that most critics and user commentators are always rightfully harking on.  I'll shut up now.  Go see this one-of-a-kind film, then see it again - and again, etc.  >"
SnoopyStyle,"Mar 31, 2015",8/10,"It's 1916 France. General Georges Broulard convinces General Mireau to send his men on a suicide mission to attack the fortified Anthill. The men are worn out. General Mireau with glory in his eyes downplays the difficulties to Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas). He even threatens to relieve Dax when he gives less than full enthusiastic support. On a 3-person night patrol, drunken lieutenant Roget kills fellow soldier Lejeune and then falsifies the records despite Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker). Dax leads the attack the next morning. The first wave is wiped out and the men refuse to continue the attack. Mireau court-marshals a man from each company for cowardice. Roget sends Paris as one of those men. Dax defends them in the kangaroo court.Stanley Kubrick creates one of the classic anti-war movies of all times. Its indictment was biting at the time and finds its glory by the opposition it faced. Kirk Douglas is at his heroic best. The vision is sharp. The story is poignant. The movie finds its target and doesn't let go."
r-48240,"May 12, 2020",8/10,The rhythm is tight. Kubrick first touched upon the subject of the institutions devouring individuals.
Embley,"Apr 24, 2000",6/10,i was very impressed with this film - it details the petty politics of war very well.  it is a horrible story.  the acting is great as is the look and feel of the film.  it made me feel as though there were bugs crawling up my arm but there was nothing i could do about it.
kgprophet,"Nov 28, 2013",7/10,"It seems amazing the jump in scope and complexity from Kubrick's previous film ""The Killing"" and this landmark motion picture. The competency in direction - acting, staging, pacing, editing, and of course the pristine cinematography. It seems it was made by a director with many more years of experience. As many people involved with the project knew, this film would be remembered through time. Based on a real incident, it reflected the change in sentimentality of how soldiers were being used as human waves, where it was acceptable to allow for a certain percent of casualties. This disregard for human life is eloquently displayed with a series of scenes the demonstrate the futility of war. From the miserable trench conditions, to the fighting for mounds of dirt, to the blind military strategy that merely repeats failed attacks, to the absurdity of threatening death as punishment as part of the ""rules"" of war. Partly what makes this such a timeless statement is the fact it was banned in many countries, because of the possible explosive anti-military sentiments it may have provoked.Sadly, this film was ignored by the Academy Awards, there are many aspects of the film that are excellently executed. Primarily is the lean script. Clocking in at 88 minutes, each exchange by the great cast is sharp and poignant. The intriguing audacity of executing your own soldiers during a war creates meaningful contradictions. A Colonel wants 3 men shot for cowardice, as a representation of each group. Why not kill all the soldiers if they are all accused of cowardice? And what real incentive does it give the other soldiers to go on to a battlefield and be killed or stay in your trench and be killed? These dilemmas are intelligently staged with a crisp pace that successfully develops sympathy from the audience. Part of what makes the casting great is the use of actors that have distinctive characteristics that present more of the human side of facing death.I don't think anyone will deny the artistic freedom of using American actors as French soldiers. Or the fact this 1916 period piece has distinctly modern dialect and frank honesty about religion, military power, and what the definition of true patriotism is. Even better is that these subject matters are cleanly addressed with not one moment feeling like a dry debate. Rarely do these confrontations occur sitting down, the body language and use of space creates a dynamic that feels heavily thought out and rehearsed. The locations are exquisite. Ironically, the locations were filmed in a castle in Germany. All the characters in this film are well drawn and a joy to watch when sparring against each other. Kirk Douglas particularly savours his juicy scenes of disdain and rebellion. George McCready is the antagonist, and speaks with a lofty prima donna delivery that makes him all that more detestable.This film succeeds on all levels, it has great action scenes but has a moral message. It has unpleasant confrontations with death but is still beautiful to look at. The subject matter is serious yet very entertaining. It achieves the classification of a film masterpiece because of the ability of the filmmaker to encapsulate the heart of the story with only a few scenes (the entire film plays out over the course of 2 days) with well honed dialogue and an active camera."
K3nzit,"Jan 3, 2020",9/10,"A timeless classic by Stanley Kubrick. Great story, great acting - There are not many war movies better than this one."
saadanathan,"Oct 30, 2022",8/10,"Paths of Glory is a remarkable example of how the stupidity and impulsiveness of war takes down those who have done nothing wrong.In this master war film by Stanley Kubrick, Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) finds himself trying to defend his accused men of cowardice in face of the enemy. All awile it was in fact his superior officer who threatened to fire on his own man just to take over a hill. A lost cost from the start.What's interesting about this film, aside of showing a man facing the system to go and defend his men, is also the hidden message and criticism over war and how generals take drastic decisions, ending up killing thousands of their own. The criticism comes to the smallest details of dialogue.Stanley Kubrick's way of telling the stupidity of war and its affects on the military system is a genuine way of his, such the same with Dr. Strangelove."
kaaffilm,"Mar 27, 2023",10/10,"""Paths of Glory"" is an unforgettable masterpiece, a war film that combines the brutality of combat with a scathing indictment of military bureaucracy and the toxic patriotism that fuels it. Directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick, the film stars Kirk Douglas as a principled colonel who defends three soldiers against trumped-up charges of cowardice, only to find himself embroiled in a ruthless power struggle with his own superiors.The film is visually stunning, with Kubrick's signature precision and attention to detail evident in every frame. The battle scenes are harrowing and intense, but it is the quieter moments of reflection and moral reckoning that truly linger in the mind. The performances are uniformly excellent, with Douglas in particular giving one of his most nuanced and powerful performances.But what truly sets ""Paths of Glory"" apart is its unflinching examination of the corrupting influence of authority and the terrible toll of war on the human soul. Kubrick's message is clear: in the face of such senseless destruction and injustice, it is the individual's responsibility to hold fast to their principles and fight for what is right, even in the face of overwhelming opposition.Overall, ""Paths of Glory"" is a cinematic masterpiece that stands the test of time, a powerful and poignant reminder of the costs of war and the importance of staying true to one's own conscience."
tim777ca,"Dec 31, 2002",7/10,"Stanley Kubrick tended to manipulate actor like puppet to serve his camera, that's why I never like his work very much. He had been eager to show off his mise-en-scene ability, which became more and more obsessive in his later films.Early in this over-praised movie, two generals, played by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready, has a conversation about attacking German-occupied Ant Hill. Kubrick makes them walk around in the room without any motivation, just to move the actors so that he can pan his camera to reveal the well-designed set.Later, Kirk Douglas is talking to someone on the staircase of the headquarter, Macready walks up and joins him, then they move higher while carrying on conversation, so the camera can change its angle to pick up other parts of the huge set without cutting. After their dialogue is over, Macready steps down the stairway. (Why he leads Kirk to walk up in the first place?)Not having military background, Kubrick doesn't know soldiers don't talk that way. If a general wants to talk to a colonel, he would simply yell, ""Hey, colonel, come over here!"" He would never go to a subordinate officer in real life. Moving the actor up and down for no reason seems rather ludicrous."
chabbott1,"Nov 8, 2005",6/10,"I've been reading the member comments about Paths of Glory and I don't know why this film is so highly rated. It's filled with clichés, bad acting and one-dimensional characters. It's talky, and everyone seems to be rushing through their lines. Even the editing is sub-par. Some nice b&w photography, a few good lines and a couple of interesting set pieces are wasted in this predictable bore . As for its anti-war message, it's heavy handed and preachy. Dr. Strangelove is infinitely more effective. I find it astonishing to read comments claiming that this is one of Kubrick's best. It doesn't hold a candle to Strangelove, 2001, Clockwork Orange, etc. Second-rate Kubrick, at best."
rupie,"Sep 19, 2002",4/10,"I had read all the hoopla about this being one of the seminal anti-war films of all times and, upon finally seeing it, was astounded at how overrated and poorly done it is. The movie is less a drama than a Victorian melodrama. All the generals and officers are the mustachioed villain and all the soldiers are the sausage-curled maiden tied to the railroad tracks. The dialogue is farcically unrealistic; General Mireau's lines, in particular, are of the ""Aha, my pretty, at last I have you in my clutches!"" variety. One almost thinks that the director is trying to make the audience hiss. Character development is non-existent, as is subtlety. The ballroom scene, in particular, with the grandly attired generals dancing to Strauss waltzes in luxurious surroundings with elegantly attired women is - get it? - supposed to be a contrast with the misery of the soldiers; the point is made like being hit on the side of the head with 2-by-4. Kirk Douglas does the best he can with a limited part. The denouement with the German girl (a prisoner? a prostitute? a lost civilian? just who the hell is she?) singing is both baffling and unconvincing. One keeps waiting for some kind of closure and - bam! - 'The End' comes up.This is not a quarrel with the theme of the movie, just its execution. For a truly brilliant treatment of the same theme - the scapegoating of soldiers by an uncaring and expedient power structure - see 'Breaker Morant,' a movie with complex, fleshed-out characters, realistic dialogue, and true emotional and dramatic depth. And, for good measure, a court martial that puts the one in ""Paths of Glory"" to shame."
Michael_Elliott,"Jul 9, 2008",N/A,"Paths of Glory (1956)**** (out of 4)Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece anti-war drama centers on a Colonel (Kirk Douglas) who led a group of soldiers on a suicide mission but when the troops refuse to leave the trenches, three of them are hand picked to be executed on grounds of cowardice. I think sometimes it's easy to forget the pure genius of Kubrick and to me this was the first of many masterpieces that he'd deliver throughout his career. On a technical level this film is flawless from start to finish and this is certainly one of the greatest movies in its genre. There are so many brilliant scenes here that it's really shocking that such a young and fresh director could come off with something like this. There are many memorable scenes in the film but I suppose to most famous ones are the tracking shots following various men inside the trenches. Kubrick keeps the camera in front of the men and tracks them as they walk and the atmosphere this effect brings to the screen hasn't been matched from any war film that I've seen. This technique really builds a strange and claustrophobic nature that puts you right there in the action and gives you a sense of how tight these quarters are. The actual battle scene is also quite beautiful because it really doesn't center on any one piece of the action going on. Instead the camera just floats as the men try to capture their target and the swooping camera really gives you a bigger feeling of the battle. This scene comes off remarkably well considering the budget Kubrick was working with. The film is incredibly powerful with its messages on war and humans and all of this comes together beautifully in the finale, which is very haunting and touching. I think what made Kubrick a genius of his craft was the fact that he had a lot of guts and it's easy to see this with the ending, which doesn't end in a typical way. The final song was something very tricky to pull off yet Kubrick does so wonderfully well and really hits a home run with the message. Finally, the film contains some of the greatest acting you're going to see in the film with Douglas leading the way as the Col. who then must turn defender to try and keep the three men alive. The restraint nature Douglas shows perfectly fits the character but when his rage finally explodes, there's really no one better at doing this type of acting. George Macredy really steals the film as the General who wants the men executed and really becomes one of the most hated villains in film history."
VicTheDaddy,"May 4, 2006",10/10,"I was surprised how any one could criticise this film,I've always believed this to be one of the greatest anti war films ever made,it is so powerful.It was first shown on British TV in the early 80s,and before it was shown it had been announced that it was banned in France,i don't know if it still is,but they were not happy about this film,this maby why it was late being shown on British TV,after all our British Generals had our soldiers executed on ridiculous charges,so we cant be hypercritical.About 300 British soldiers were executed, the French about twice the amount,so this film is really important,and Stanley Kubrick was probably the first director to pick up on these terrible injustices.In Britain we have had campaigners trying to pardon our men,because the sad thing is their families at the time or their descendant's at the moment can not march pass at the centopath on Remembrance Sunday as where the soldiers were executed this is not allowed,and yet the majority of these men were executed for falling a sleep while on duty,one example that springs to mind was of a soldier who was executed for refusing to put on a wet cap,he was executed for insubordination.Paths of Glory really does open peoples eyes to what these poor soldiers were up against during WW1 as there are a lot of people out there who still don't realize what went on .For a 1957 film this is very harrowing stuff,you know that once the three men are going on trial their fate is already sealed they haven't a chance in hell.And the worst part about it all is that the French Generals actually believe the men had a fair trial,its all ludicrous but sadly true.I believe this film did get people more interested in learning more about WW1 as there were many cover ups and many untold truths like the amount of British soldiers bodies that keep being unearthed in France and Belgium at the rate of about 7 a year and sometimes as many as 20-30,our government kept this quiet for years,so it seems that WW1 is destined not to be forgotten."
Abdulxoxo,"Aug 13, 2024",9/10,"One of the film's most significant strengths is its portrayal of the futility and absurdity of war. Kubrick masterfully captures the horrors of the battlefield and the dehumanizing nature of military bureaucracy. The trench warfare scenes are intense and harrowing, providing a visceral depiction of the soldiers' struggles and the senselessness of their mission. The film's stark black-and-white cinematography adds to the bleakness of the setting, enhancing the sense of despair and hopelessness that permeates the narrative.Kirk Douglas delivers a standout performance as Colonel Dax, a principled and compassionate officer who stands up against the corrupt military hierarchy.The film's script, co-written by Kubrick, is sharp and incisive, filled with powerful dialogue that underscores the themes of honor and sacrifice. The courtroom scenes, in particular, are riveting, as they lay bare the callousness of the military leaders who treat their soldiers as expendable pawns. .While Paths of Glory is a war film, it transcends the genre by delving deep into the human psyche and examining the moral dilemmas faced by those caught in the crossfire. It's a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film that challenges us to reflect on the cost of war and the true meaning of honor."
searchanddestroy-1,"Nov 11, 2022",8/10,"On this Armistice day, I present an American movie showing the French side - and not American one, after all US troops fought too in this conflict - during the most bloody war of the modern era. The most awful, even if the number of dead is inferior to the WW2 one. It shows how the high commandment despised the lives of soldiers, it shows hypocrisy, disgusting behavior towards the troops. Don't miss the sequence between two generals played by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. Macready was at first reluctant to sacrifice his own men, and suddenly he finds a pretext not to lose face in front of his superior officer general Menjou.... And accepts to obey orders from the headquarters. And during the film, the audience can see how Macready takes great concern about his soldiers lives.... Useless to say that this anti war film was forbidden in France before 1972. Only Yves Boisset, the French director, will be courageous enough to denounce this slaughterhouse with LE PANTALON, decades later. I am French and hate France for all this hypocrisy of the high commandment, a high commandment of jerks who were unable to prevent Wehrmacht to succeed in France invasion of May 1940. France, country of mess, total mess, hypocrisy, scapegoat use and incompetence. I AM FRENCH. I now what I am talking about."
smatysia,"Feb 21, 2000",7/10,"A powerful portrait of injustice, and the insanity of military ambition. The poor, scapegoated enlisted men, and General Broulard's assumption that Colonel Dax's motivation is exactly the same as General Mireau's. An interesting technique, wherein the enemy is never seen on-camera. This is a good film, but even though I am a fan of Kubrick, I can't afford this one classic status."
Aditya_Gokhale,"Oct 14, 2010",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's 1957 war film, ""Paths of Glory"" based on a novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb is more of an anti-war statement. Hence, calling it a 'war film' wouldn't be right, as it does not lie in the same category as other war films, plot-wise.The film is set during World War I. The story focuses on the war between the French and the Germans. General Mireau (George Macready) sends his division headed by Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) on a suicidal mission to take over a prominent German position called ""Anthill"". Initially Mireau is reluctant to carry out this task, but is enticed by an offer of promotion from his superiors. With this in mind, he practically forces Dax to begin with the mission. Col. Dax, also aware of the danger associated with the mission, points the same out to Mireau but Mireau does not relent.Sure enough, the mission ends in disaster and what follows next is the crux of this powerful story.What happens when these men in the very same army, defending the same country, from the same regiment turn against each other? What happens when some superior officers get greedy and selfish and stop valuing human life, more so, the lives of their own soldiers? ""Paths of Glory"" goes deep in the psyche of these men, both superiors and subordinates and makes a strong statement on what war does to them.""Paths of Glory"" was just a modest success commercially, I've read. It comes as a surprise, considering the screenplay by Stanley Kubrick, Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson is spell-binding, to say the least. Kubrick directs with his touch of genius and creates a tremendous impact. The first scene of attack on Anthill is so masterfully shot, you actually feel you are in the field of battle! Ditto for the rest of the film when things take an unexpected turn for some of the less fortunate soldiers. Every frame of this picture is gripping, right 'til the final one.Kirk Douglas delivers a fabulous performance as Colonel Dax. His helplessness and the growing frustration about the greedy and corrupt army officers and the overall futility of the system is so convincing, it creates a lasting impression. This is one earnest and unforgettable performance by the legendary actor.George Macready lends a great supporting act as the selfish, cut-throat General Mireau. So do others, including Wayne Morris, Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel and Timothy Carey.A special mention here, of Mrs. Kubrick (Christiane Kubrick) who makes an appearance for a short scene to sing the haunting German folk song, 'The Faithful Hussar'. She appears in a scene towards the end in what could be one of the best and most haunting endings I've ever seen in film.""Paths of Glory"" may not be as popular as some of Stanley Kubrick's later films, but it is definitely one of his best."
urntcookin045,"Apr 27, 2008",10/10,"I feel that still after all its recognition, 'Paths of Glory' is one of the most underrated films ever made. I think it ranks in the top twenty films ever made. Stanley Kubrick's brilliant direction and cinematography go extremely unnoticed, and I think should have won him an Oscar for best direction. Kirk Douglaus gives one of his better performances as Col. Dax. Despite to some belief, this is not an anti-war film. The film is supposed to somewhat of an anti-abuse of power film in a way, as stated by Kubrick. The final scene of the film moved me to tears and is what I consider the most moving and touching scene Kubrick has ever film. If you have not yet seen it, check it out. Amazing film"
perica-43151,"Nov 8, 2021",9/10,"Based on a real story, this Kubrick early work is as condemning of the French mentality as Le Corbeau, but at the same time universalist in its depiction of the corruption of powerful and haplessness of the little guy. In order to get a new medal, a French officer, ugly both inside and out, cold, selfish and arrogant, orders a senseless attack on some insignificant hill along the trenches in which he fully expects more than half of the soldiers to die. During the attack, soldiers fall back to trenches, yet he orders artillery to bomb its own side for not attacking enough, but the senseless request is declined. Later, he orders a court-martial for cowardice for three random soldiers who are later executed, despite being innocent. The men are shot but the officer is revealed to be what he is, ordering bombing of his soldiers, later on. All this based on a real incident in the French army in WWI, and the movie was banned in France for almost 20 years, and Switzerland, Germany and even Spain followed suit in order not to offend the French or military sensibilities. It is a potent condemnation of power and of human condition, a cynical yet realistic view into workings of not only the petty French psyche with its hypocrisies, but is applicable more generally to humans less obviously degen erate. Shot in black and white with some early glimpses into Kubrick cinematic methods and tricks of his later, more celebrated work."
daoldiges,"Jun 27, 2022",8/10,"Visually Paths of Glory is interesting and creates a uniquely atmospheric film experience. Wonderful cinematography and some great tracking shots help to engage the viewer in this film depicting the follies and false motives that can propel wars. Kirk Douglas gives a solid performance and his most interesting character portrayal here. Many of the supporting cast are quite good as well. One of Kubrick's earlier films, Paths of Glory is definitely worth checking out."
Muelko,"Oct 17, 2022",8/10,"Low-tier Kubrick, but it's a good movie for sure. This is like a lite 12 Angry Men, so it's, y'know, really engaging and super-fun to watch. Liked the battle in the first half, the performances are strong, the writing is monumental, very Kubricky, so it's very good. Loved the conflict between the soldiers. But it's not much this movie, that's why I'm not very enthusiastic about this one. It's surely a nice little war movie, but nothing more. And holy smoke the movie looks spectacular, and it's from 1957, but yeah, it's Kubrick, what am I even expecting, right? So yeah, I have to watch every Kubrick movie, there are like few of them for me to complete his filmography. And yeah, Paths of Glory is definitely one of the better Kubrick movies."
coop-16,"May 3, 1999",10/10,"There are only two film-makers who never made a bad film in their careers:Andrei Tarkovsky and Stanley Kubrick.Even though Kubrick's mastery of the film medium was evident as early as Killers Kiss, and maybe even as early as Day of the Fight, his genius was confirmed by this, his second major feature.Some critics even suggest that  Paths  Of Glory was Kubrick's BEST film, and that his subsequent career was one of decline. It would be more precise to argue that Paths of Glory was the film which showed Kubricks complete mastery of TRADITIONAL film grammar and techniques, as first' exemplified by Griffith and Pudovkin, while his later films show him EXPERIMENTING with those techniques,challenging established ideas of narration and characterization. In addition, Paths of Glory is-on the surface- a more 'didactic' and ""humanistic"" film than his later works. He seems to be delivering a conventional ""liberal"" message; ""war is hell', ""men should not be inhumane to man',etc.While Kubrick is indeed a liberal humanist who  looks askance at the military, his film is not simply a pacifist sermon.Kubrick is, instead offering  a close analysis of the meaning of courage , loyalty, and honor. These virtues, so often extolled by 'conservatives' are NOT mocked by Kubrick. Instead he is criticizing the MISUSE of these virtues by ""scoundrels' such as the military brass hats.The true hero of paths of glory is NOT the well-meaning but tragically ineffectual liberal 'hero', Colonel Dax (superbly played by Kirk Douglas), instead the hero is a GROUP of people, the ordinary, suffering 'grunts' of the 'poor bloody  infantry', who, in the films unforgettable closing scene, hum along with a frightened German  girl as she sings a love song in her native language."
dromasca,"Jun 29, 2009",10/10,"'Path of Glory' would not have happened without Kirk Douglas. He not only makes here one of the deepest and most human roles of his acting career, but also put all his influence and some money into determining the great studios to make this anti-war film, which became the first in a series of great anti-war films of Kubrick. The story of the first world war French soldiers sent to an almost sure death by their corrupted generals and then randomly court-martial-ed and sent to death for cowardice when they face the predictable failure is turned by Kubrick into a splendidly built and beautifully filmed pledge for humanity. And it is humanity that prevails despite the tragic destiny of the soldiers. The final scene in which soldiers join a German prisoner girl into humming a simple German love song is a scene of redemption and of pure shaming of nationalism. Kubrick was still, at least at that point in his life and career an optimist."

Defending the men is their regiment's commander, Colonel Dax.Stanley Kubrick's fourth feature film and it's a fantastic one. A gritty, unflinching war drama that shows the wastefulness of war and how generals are willing to sacrifice their soldier's lives needlessly out of blind, selfish ambition. Quite thought-provoking and profound.Very gritty, despite a quite basic production values. Maybe that's why it feels so real as there's little in the way of special effects.

Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Apr 8, 2009",10/10,"War is a horrible thing. That's the general message of Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory,"" but it's not meant in the sense of people killing other people is bad, it's because war makes us dehumanize ourselves, make poor decisions and devalue human life. This is a war story told on one side. The antagonist in this film is not the other side, it's the people in power and our inability to see clearly because our judgment is clouded by ideas we claim to be greater than ourselves. The film might not seem like a fair portrayal of the military, but it is a masterpiece of showing how war can turn us into terrible people if we're not careful.Set on the French side against the Germans in World War I, the film is about a French offensive that ends in death and retreat. When the general charges the survivors with cowardice punishable by death, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) must defend the lives of three of his men from the military powers that want to make an example of their execution. It is a story told with blunt dialog about the use and abuse of power, but it is structured and executed in a way that creates audience sensitivity and emotion first to justify the dialog's use.It also helps the dialog to have much of it delivered by Kirk Douglas. Col. Dax is not a flawless character, but he's about as good as they come: smart, honest, passionate and selfless. Douglas plays the role with equal conviction -- it's hard not to cheer for his character and it's incredibly satisfying whenever he outsmarts the corrupt characters. Though he's far from French (a little authenticity in the film in general, like French extras at the least would've been nice)Though Kubrick's talents will flourish in his later films, ""Paths of Glory"" is filmed beautifully. It is not a very visual war film, there is a lot of dialogue, but Kubrick somehow conveys his meaning so clearly to the audience. He mixes in shots of various lengths, carefully picking his close-ups of characters to indicate the pivotal moments and sometimes capturing the whole setting from far away for dramatic impact. He also uses a lot of long takes, a couple of times following one character who is the focus of the previous scene until the character focused on in the next scene walks by, then he changes directions. The techniques are simple, but they catch your attention when meaningful. Douglas and others like George Macready as the corrupt General Mireau also help maintain that dramatic interest.Once fantastic choice Kubrick makes is keeping the Germans out of it. You never see them, only their artillery exploding in the war zone. It's critical to understanding that the real war here is not against the Germans, its within the French ranks. It's a war Kubrick wages against unfairness and injustice. He also portrays a wide range of character reactions to war. Of the three prisoners, each provides the viewer a unique insight to war and imminent death. The film really begins to make you rethink what courage is. Is it courageous just to accept death, even under unfair circumstances? Each prisoner's battle becomes a microcosm for the initial conflict of the soldiers retreating or in some cases not even leaving the trenches.""Paths of Glory"" is an incredible statement film about war's dark side, about how we're taught to fight for certain things like glory and patriotism and to obey all orders. This film downright questions it from the beginning and supports itself throughout its duration. It then goes on to address deeper questions of courage, faith and ultimately the timeless question of whether or not humans are inherently good or evil. At 87 minutes long, ""Paths of Glory"" still manages to tell a vital story with passion and grace."
Det_McNulty,"Apr 8, 2008",9/10,"With his former directional effort, The Killing, Stanley Kubrick had established his talent as both a storyteller and visionary. In 1957 Kubrick released Paths of Glory, an anti-war film which was instantly banned in France and Spain for its negative portrayal of the military during World War 1. Nevertheless, the director has reportedly claimed that the film is not ""anti-war"", but is ""anti-authoritarian ignorance."" While not receiving much attention at the time of its release critical acclaim grew with each passing year and today it is often ranked among ""the greatest films ever made."" Director Steven Spielberg has even stated that it is indefinitely his favourite work from the late icon.When people study Kubrick's filmography in retrospect there is a particular criticism which nearly always rears its ugly head; this being the accusation that Kubrick was incapable of capturing emotion or providing a sense of empathy towards his characters, therefore distancing the viewer. I for one consider Kubrick's detached manner intentionally in context with the nature of his work. Even so, this definitive anti-war outing is far from echoing the cold demeanour of those endless, symmetric corridors in The Shining and yet it still contains the theme of struggling to cope with a greater force.Starring macho action star Kirk Douglas, the film boasts the greatest performance of the actor's lengthy career. It was the performance which developed the foundations of a two-film companionship between actor and director, the latter work being Spartacus. Douglas defied expectations, performing as a disillusioned French unit commander in WW1. His character's idealistic duty is to protect the human rights of three men who have been unjustly accused of cowardice and are consequently facing firing squad execution as an example for those who retreat while in the warzone. Douglas' performance is an acting showcase, displaying the utmost degree of empathy and moral insight.Much of the narrative is spent with Douglas defending the three men facing death. Kubrick's trademark tracking-shot was introduced and utilised to the best extent during the scenes of trench warfare. The technique adds an enclosed, claustrophobic impression of unease. The meticulous manner of direction is directly impressionable and acts as a method of submerging the viewer in a story of delusions, ignorance and more than anything else, arrogance.If you are yet to of seen this film, go and grab yourself a copy right away as you are almost certain to be blown away at the hands of an auteur. Plus, it beats the noticeably dated All Quiet on the Western Front any day, and you are unlikely to find a story with a more benevolent and worthy conclusion."

There were so many high praises of this film, that I decided to watch it closely, and... and I was deeply disappointed, as this movie surely has not stood the test of time and today is intercepted as a mere bleak, hollow, dark, vapid and rather weak exercise in D - depression, despair, disenchantment, drool and drainage. I agree, was was not all exciting and interesting, but this movie does not deliver any strong message, nor does it succeed to damn war as evil, or nor does it teach us any lesson at all. It is seen as a brisk, but shallow attempt of early film film-making, dire and failed. Kubrick did not persuade us that war is evil, the general ennui and detached air did not help us feel any bonds to main heroes, and even great final scene failed to cement the film reputation. Overrated, boring and zany at places."
lee_eisenberg,"Jul 2, 2005",10/10,"When people think of Stanley Kubrick making an anti-war film, they most likely think of ""Dr. Strangelove"", but ""Paths of Glory"" is equally as great, not to mention based on a true event. It happened in France during WWI. A platoon of soldiers was sent on a suicidal mission. The battle was essentially an excuse for both nations to try and gain prestige. Some French soldiers refused to go into battle. They were put on trial for ""cowardice in the face of the enemy"". In defending them, Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) sought to show how they were doing a sane thing by refusing to go into battle, and that the generals cared more about getting promoted than about the men under their command.One theme that you find in this movie that Kubrick often uses is chess. Chess is an analysis of medieval Europe, with the pawns being expendable. In this case, the soldiers are senselessly thrown into battle, while the generals sit comfortably in the palace. Similarly, in ""Dr. Strangelove"", the men in the airplane were experiencing all sorts of Hell, while the president, generals and ambassador sat comfortably in the war room.It's amazing how much this all looks like so many other things. And I don't just mean Iraq. When Gen. Billy Mitchell condemned his superiors for disregarding the safety of the men under their command, they put HIM on trial! Apparently, ""military justice"" is a total oxymoron. Anyway, this is a movie that everyone should see, just so that we can all know what war is really all about."
Don-102,"Apr 13, 1999",10/10,"There is no glory in Stanley Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY, a devastating anti-war film that looks at the Generals who command soldiers as cowards themselves.  How dare these pampered men who will leave the war without a scratch practically order their soldier's slaughter?  This is the conflict posed by Kubrick with the help of Kirk Douglas, who quite frankly is mesmerizing as the Colonel of the 701st Division ordered to take an anthill they probably have no chance of taking.  Adolphe Menjou is the sadistic General who Douglas must fight for the right of his soldiers' souls as well as his own.  We are able to take an introverted look at the madness of war. Cowardice is frowned upon by governments, but how do you decide what it is in such inhuman conditions.Kubrick shows his talents as a master of atmosphere and looming death in this classic of WWI.  The French are the symbol and a possible execution is the tool with which Kubrick stirs our emotions.  Unlike his later films, we have some pretty realistic characters here.  Douglas is the only man with a head on his shoulders and is so passionate about the cruel injustice proposed by the spiteful General he seems willing to die himself. The court scene contains some of the movie's most memorable emotional moments, but check out the 1957 war sequence.  Kubrick had a definite vision as to how he was going to pull this off.  Shot in Germany, the French soldiers go through a frightening, revolutionary experience.  Deep explosions pulsate the soundtrack, soldiers are blown to bits, and cowardice is nowhere to be found.  The mere possibility of a soldier's ""recollections"" under such hellish conditions cannot be taken as gospel.The attempt on the German anthill is truly something to see, another feather on the cap of Kubrick, who would create the most amazing boot-camp sequence in film history roughly 30 years later in FULL METAL JACKET.  Compared to that film, PATHS OF GLORY is much more effective at portraying a precise vision of the abomination of war.  Whether its the French, or the Russians, it is all the same.  Worthless when unnecessary, tragic when waged.  Ralph Meeker is great as one of the Corporals on trial for ""cowardice"" in the face of the enemy.  At one point, he asks a priest to leave him alone and basically betrays the thought of God in the face of what he is going through.  Pretty deep stuff, I must say.  PATHS OF GLORY is one of the best war films ever made.RATING: 10 of 10"
Hitchcoc,"Feb 16, 2007",10/10,"I've often been Luke warm about Kirk Douglas. This, however, is a phenomenal movie. War is usually fought by people who have no say in what is happening. The despicable man who can send thousands to their deaths to get a military promotion is every bit as bad as the enemy being fought. We have a lot of that going on in this country. Those who choose war should fight it or send their own to fight it. This is ad much a story of how people treat each other as it is a war movie. We hand over power to a complex that sustains itself on the backs of those who never get to state their cases. The men chosen are done so in an arbitrary way, caught unawares and defenseless. Of course, religion plays a part in it too. We may die, but there is a reward for us. There are so many parallels to what happens to men in combat (the ambush, for instance) that these men become victims. Like someone said, so much war is fought over anthills. I have never felt so sorry for characters as I do for these because they are defenseless. The cockroach scene has stayed with me my whole life. It's the same basic premise as Galipoli (which came much later)."
markbellamy,"Jul 26, 2010",9/10,"In reading other reviews I see a lot of them saying this was one of the finest ""war movies"" ever made. I agree that it is one of the finest movies but I do not believe it is a war movie. The war is merely the backdrop for the drama that is human politics, selfishness and greed. The backdrop could be a corporate board room, any place in government, anywhere in which a bureaucratic system is in place with little accountability at the top. The lessons in this film extend far beyond the battlefield. I would say it is a must see to anyone interested in movies about moral inconsistencies, abuse of power, and the realities of the way the world operates."
tenshi_ippikiookami,"Apr 26, 2016",7/10,"""Paths of Glory"" talks about war, about what humans do in war, how power has an important part into who survives, who dies, and why, and how unfair, unjust, and horrible war is and how unfair, unjust and horrible a culture of war makes humans.Douglas's Dax and his men are sent on a suicide mission to take an enemy position. They have to retreat as they can't get to their objective, but their superiors are not very happy about it and decide to bring some of the soldiers to a military tribunal, accused of cowardice. If found guilty, the will be killed.The movie offers a not very nice view of power and war, of how the ones that are on parties and eating nice food send the poor to fight and die, as no more and no less than expendable pawns. It shows how Dax and his men are dehumanized by their superiors, and how these superiors behave like spoiled children when things don't go their way. All very patriarchal, with even a dialogue where a superior talks to Dax in these exact terms: a superior is to soldiers as a father to children. Is patriarchy guilty of violence?The acting is OK, a little bit of overacting typical to the era, and a couple of too long sequences. But the story is good, the direction sound and all the actors give their best. If that was not good enough, the script has some stellar moments for Douglas, with very good writing.A good war movie, to remind us that war, what is it good for?And to whom?"
FilmOtaku,"Jan 24, 2005",7/10,"""Paths of Glory"", Stanley Kubrick's 1957 anti-war film was his first film in the anti-war genre, but not his last. Starring Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax, the commander of a regiment in the French army who fall back on their orders because theirs is an impossible attack. Gen. Paul Mireau (George Macready) is a glory-seeking man who agreed to this attack regardless of the casualties it will cause, and when it all hits the fan, looks for anyone else to be the scapegoats. He and Gen. George Broulard (Adolph Menjou) tell Dax that he must select random men to execute for cowardice, but Dax talks him into only selecting three, and to allow him to defend them. (In civilian life, Dax was the best attorney in France.) All of the events of the film are an exercise in futility, and the entire film's strong anti-war stance is extremely effective.This was one of the very few Kubrick films I had not seen (I think my last one is Spartacus) and I was extremely impressed. As with another early film of his, ""The Killing"", his intelligence, vision and burgeoning talent are so very apparent. I enjoyed seeing certain Kubrick trademarks in this film, (particularly the tracking shot which follows Douglas through the trenches) and the story really was a compelling one. Apparently he had to fight to get this film made, and found a strong ally in Douglas, who used his star power with Warner Brothers to get the job done. This is certainly a must-see for any Kubrick fan, and a worthwhile film to check out anyway. ""Paths of Glory"" does not have the wit or belly laughs of ""Dr. Strangelove"", or even the terror of ""Full Metal Jacket"", but it is a strong film with a strong story. Simply based upon the first viewing I give it a 7/10.--Shelly"
elision10,"Mar 6, 2021",5/10,"Well, another movie that everyone seems to love and I don't. It's all right, but certainly nothing that deserves such accolades. There's no subtlety, everything is flashed to you in big black letters. The villains are so villanous, the heroes so heroic, and the downtrodden soldiers so downtrodden that there's little suspense. Kirk Douglas can be great as he was in Ace in the Hole; but here he is the high-minded, flawless man that becomes more irritating than admirable. The ending is highly effective, but that for me was the only highlight."
ccthemovieman-1,"Aug 26, 2011",N/A,"I thought this was an interesting film, albeit agenda-driven, but one that kept my attention. The characters are interesting, the story moves along well considering its mostly talk, and it's nicely directed by a young Stanley Kubrick. Looking at this on a high-def DVD, it was magnificent in spots. Kubrick's camera angles and photography, as usual, were a treat for the eyes.Although Kirk Douglas gets top billing, I thought George Macready was the unofficial ""star"" of this film, playing the obsessed ""General Mireau."" Douglas' picture dominates the cover of the DVD and is featured in most of the stills seen here on the IMDb home page of the movie. He was good - don't get me wrong, but Macready deserved at least equal billing.Whatever, the movie flows nicely and is sure to invoke an emotional response from any viewer. The only problem I saw was that it was a bit too manipulative. Kubrick's obvious hatred for those in military authority (see ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"") is so blatant in here that the ""bad guys"" are almost cartoonish, uttering statements that are so ludicrous it strains credibility. Speaking of credibility, if this film was re-made today you wouldn't have American actors playing all the French roles.Some supporting actors in the film, were either famous actors like Adolphe Menjou, Ralph Meeker and Richard Anderson or ones with faces you don't forget, such as Timothy Carey and Emile Meyer. Their characters added a lot of tension to this story.Perhaps the biggest surprise (at least to me) was discovering that the German singer at the end of the film was Kubrick's wife! Overall, a recommended film to watch."
ssssgelojun,"Aug 24, 2020",10/10,"In the Franco-German war, the French general launched an impossible and victorious attack for personal gain and sent several innocent soldiers to the execution ground. The upright colonel could do nothing about it, and he could not change the fate of all the soldiers even if he brought down the general.All the fine things said by these generals, by some respectable officers, could be applied to themselves; patriotism, as the colonel said, was the disguise of these scoundrels. The film's title, ""The Path to Glory,"" echoes the film's expression, which is the ultimate satire on this route to military advancement. Kubrick showed a very strong grasp of details in this film. Many characters left a deep impression on people, and these details echoed each other and corresponded to the expression, which is really a reflection of a director's strong ability."
ThomasDrufke,"Jul 15, 2015",8/10,"Paths of Glory is one of those films that really makes you hate war and everything that comes with it. It's a great film that perfectly portrays the many horrors that go along with war. But it doesn't just address the bloodiness and violence, it looks at the psychological imbalance that it gives people during an awful period of time. World War I wasn't perhaps as terrible as the second World War, but it still was a gruesome time for several countries.What I think Kubrick nailed the most about this film was the displaying the vast differences between the colonels and generals personalities to the horrific mindsets that the soldiers have going into a battle. Really, the whole plot of the film is quite ridiculous, but this type of stuff very well may have happened. The film captured the utter loudness that battles create, and even leaves out the music when it needs to. I love a good score but I liked that the battles weren't filled with a bombastic score, rather just the sounds of explosions. I didn't know much about the film, so I was shocked at first to find out it was more than just an epic war film. It was more a look at the trials of innocent men and the sort of dehumanization of them. Kubrick does it well in his later films but his approach to Paths of Glory proved to be different. He implements more emotion and sadness to his characters. This is all evident in the famous final scene, which is probably my favorite of the entire film.So yes the film does become more of a courtroom drama than I expected, but it's a different kind of war film that works. It's a film that deals much more with the political side of war than the battles. But in reality both sides of war are equally as devastating. Especially when you have a story as brutal and emotionally draining as Paths of Glory.+Imbalance of psychological viewpoints+Music hits when it needs to+Kubrick's meticulous directing+Emotional8.0/10"
marmar-69780,"May 6, 2020",9/10,"Paths of glory is great anti war film by kubrick and he was able to put film message in people hearts and it also shows us how war is horrible thing and how it just brings pain and suffering to people,it also showed very realisticly how generals and higher ranking officers only care for their reputetions and how they would left common soldiers to die or killed just to achive their selfish ambitions,kirk was great in a film and he was in acting part highlight of film,and he also give some hard but impactful speeches,paths of glory is a proof that kubrick even in his early days was able to make a great film and how he can take any genre and make a film gem out of it"
dcshanno,"Oct 22, 2004",8/10,"'Paths of Glory' confirms what a great director Stanley Kubrick was early in his career. This and 'The Killing' from a year earlier are just a one-two punch. You can just feel Kubrick sharpening his knives on this one in preparation for 'Dr. Strangelove.' While this is a drama, you can't help but laugh at the complete absurdity of the situations. I kind of doubt (or at least *need* to, anyway) that an officer would be allowed to go as far as he did, but I think Kubrick wasn't necessarily going for a literal lesson here and was instead trying to make a larger statement about the lives of soldiers being in the hands of madmen. At any rate, Kirk Douglas does a wonderful job of portraying quiet, white-hot rage, and I especially liked Ralph Meeker, who reminded me a little bit of a young, goateed Orson Welles.The black and white really stood out as well-I really liked the scenes in the basement of the chateau.If I had to criticize anything about the movie, I suppose the very end with the German girl and the men didn't really work for me. It might have been powerful in another film, but I think it took away from the final showdown between Douglas and Adolphe Menjou. It's a trivial complaint and shouldn't dissuade anyone from seeing this."
MaxBorg89,"Jul 21, 2007",10/10,"Paths of Glory is one of the two war movies Stanley Kubrick directed throughout a splendid career (the other being Full Metal Jacket). And though at first sight these films may seem very different, they share a vital key theme: the futility of war and the monstrous effects it has on the human psyche.In the case of FMJ, the monstrosity is shown through the actions of Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D' Onofrio) and Joker (Matthew Modine), both mentally scarred by the teachings of sadistic Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). In Paths, however, the dreadful actions do not take place on the battlefield, but in a courtroom: it is in that courtroom that three randomly selected French soldiers (the context is WWI) are to be court-martial-ed, the charges being cowardliness and refusal to accomplish the mission assigned to them. What the prosecutors don't know is that the mission in question (attacking the Anthill) would have resulted in a bloodbath on the French side and that Gen. Mireau (George MacReady), who ordered the attack and also insisted on holding the trial, was so disappointed he actually asked one of his men to shoot the retreating soldiers. The only person who seems to understand what is really going on is Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas), and it is his difficult job to convince his superiors of the necessity of the squad's behavior.Anyone who is even vaguely acquainted with Kubrick knows this is not going to be a fairy tale: Paths of Glory is one of the most effective anti-war films ever made because it is not afraid to expose the more rotten aspects of what happens in these situations (and it invites comparison with the M*A*S*H episode where Alan Alda makes a documentary and says :""This is no way to end a movie, I know that, but war is no movie""). The director openly criticizes the very nature of conflict by immediately taking Dax's side, showing that he, unlike Mireau who admires the size of the trenches (one of the most beautiful of Kubrick's many tracking shots) and only wants to be remembered as a great general, is more concerned about bringing his men back home as unharmed as possible, putting glory aside.One scene in particular supports the filmmakers'point more than anything else: the trial. While the prosecutor just wants to have the three soldiers sentenced to death and barely pays attention to them, Dax (played with solemn authority by Douglas) allows them to explain what actually occurred during the attack and uses this to openly express his contempt for what the war has done to everyone around him, depriving them of any reason and consideration for human life. That one powerful and upsetting sequence proves beyond any doubt that any war, no matter how noble it may be in its organizer's intentions, is totally and utterly incapable of bringing any real profit: all that results is hatred and greed.Kubrick directed nine more pictures after this one, and all of them dealt on some level with the frailty of humanity and its inevitable decline. Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket aside, though, none of them, however perfect, resonates with as much anger and relevance as Paths of Glory."
fmwongmd,"Oct 21, 2019",7/10,A telling portrayal of the tragedy of war. Excellent portrayals by Kirk Douglas and Ralph Meeker.
moonspinner55,"Apr 30, 2008",6/10,"Director Stanley Kubrick's first real stand-out effort as a filmmaker, an anxious, disquieting, and ultimately sobering account of wartime power and ignorance. Three French soldiers are court-martialled for cowardice in the line of duty during World War I. Emotional drama dealing with the hopelessness of injustice; its impact hasn't dimmed over the years, and there are fine performances by Kirk Douglas, Ralph Meeker, and Adolphe Menjou. Based on Humphrey Cobb's factual novel, which Kubrick co-adapted. Kubrick also co-produced the film, along with James B. Harris and Kirk Douglas. Very fine, but very heavy-going. **1/2 from ****"
Steve-496,"Nov 22, 2003",3/10,"The occasional standout performance (none from the principals) can't change the fact that, as a whole, THIS MOVIE IS BAD.The story is true, and deserves a better telling than this.  Kubrick is so hamfisted in this picture, I'm tempted to theorize it was actually directed by his Evil Twin Skippy(tm).War is hell.  This movie is almost as bad."
pericles,"Oct 3, 1998",N/A,"Paths of Glory is one of the finest war (anti-war) movies ever made. With an excellent cast, well-defined characters, and a story that focuses on the age-old strategy of finding a scapegoat for one's failures, this film highlights the futility of trench warfare and those who persisted in wasting a generation of Europe's finest young men. Without giving away the plot, I will say it is worthwhile to pay close attention to Dax's defense of the four men accused of cowardness under fire. Of course the charge is false, and....no, go view the film!"
houndtang75,"Sep 24, 2006",10/10,"'Paths of Glory' is one of those rare films that you can come across on TV halfway through and be gripped to the end no matter how many times you have seen it. Easily Kubrick's best film, his later pictures were brilliantly shot but emotionally empty, it also features career-best performances from pretty much everyone concerned. Even Kirk Douglas, not the world's greatest actor, is highly effective in his role as the compassionate Colonel Dax. George Macready and Adolphe Menjou, two fine actors who were only rarely given worthy roles, are excellent as the two despicable Generals. Of course the film is unsubtle but with a story such as this subtlety is not really possible; the message is obvious but no less moving for that."
DocBlink,"Sep 29, 2003",10/10,"Let me preface this review by stating that if anyone has seen Paths of Glory and afterward is unable, for whatever cockamamie reason, to give the biggest kudos to Stanley Kubrick's writing and directing work, then he/she quite simply is swine before whom those of us in the know ought not to cast our pearls.The film is a masterpiece.  From the brilliant choice to shoot in black and white cinematography (thus giving a gritty, darker feel to the entire story, and refraining from sugarcoating the absolutely hellish experience that trench warfare must have been), to the effective use of zoom-ins, to the short, poignant dialogues, and to the generally minimalistic approach to the anti-war message of the screenplay--it all mixes together incredibly. Kubrick could have spent hours of celluloid on the finer illogical points of military court martial trials as well as on the horrors of battle. Instead he wrapped the total package in some 87 minutes, credits included.Though there were several memorable scenes (the battle in question itself, the kangaroo court, the priest's trite comments while administering last rites to those sentenced to execution, the conversation between Col. Dax and the commanding General), the shot that sticks in my mind occurs soon after the lovely German acquisition has very reluctantly and almost inaudibly began to sing ""The Faithful Soldier"".  Kubrick cuts back to the previously heckling, boisterous crowd of French soldiers.  On their faces the spirit of superficial revelry fades away to a much stronger force--that of human understanding and compassion--and the appreciation of innocence and beauty. The things good and true for which these men thrust their lives on the line to defend.  Such evocative images are what make the many sins committed by the modern motion picture industry tolerable--perhaps even forgiveable."
latsblaster,"Jun 17, 2003",8/10,"Stanley Kubrick´s anti-war movie didn't catch me the first time I saw it, but this is a movie that has the ability to touch every living soul. This is about people who doesn't take responsibility - they put it on someone else and have no interest of listen or understand. Even if it isn't Kubrick´s most famous movie, or a typical one (is there any typical Kubrick-movie?) it is one of his finest. Highly recommended for anyone. Good battle scenes also I think.Rating: 8 of 10."
tyson-hunsaker,"Feb 9, 2017",10/10,"It took a while to see the film that put Stanley Kubrick on the map as a force to be reckoned with. Paths of Glory was a war film with an interesting premise and has the reputation for being an ""anti-war"" piece on the dehumanization of soldiers. With Kirk Douglas as the star, the plot centers around prideful and power-hungry French military officers who order an impossible mission from a battalion who fleas upon defeat and is accused of cowardice.Many other films by Kubrick shows his powerful and masterful filming style and Paths of Glory is no different. The focus is strong and it's difficult to take your eyes off the screen throughout the picture. Good use is made of these phenomenal actors who give heartfelt performances and deliver strong and emotionally piercing lines.The film is a short and crisp 88 minutes so it's easy to watch anytime. This also makes the pacing clean and the viewer will know every scene, shot, and frame is completely intentional and justified. Not a single moment of this fascinating and well done film is wasted and the talented actors are utilized to their fullest.Perhaps any downside to this film is the first 20-30 minutes in which the viewer may be wondering what kind of film they're watching and for what purpose. It's easy to see how upon release, however received with high regard, was met with some confusion as to the substance of the story and what it was trying to say. It's not a film that glorifies war or conflict; in fact, the concept of battle (physical or psychological) can cause some irritation for the viewer. This was most likely intended and it was probably a good move in the long run.Personally, I enjoyed Paths of Glory throughout the picture and found it as important as it is beautifully directed. However, the most impactful piece of the story is the final scene in which a woman is singing to a group of soldiers in a bar. Not many other scenes have had so much emotional impact and beauty that it truly made Paths of Glory a personal favorite.Really no complaints about the quality of this film or the personal pressure points it wasn't afraid to touch. It's also amazing how those emotions can be pierced so powerfully more than 50 years after this was released. It's a grand milestone in filmmaking that deserves much more attention and is highly recommended to anyone who has the chance to see it. It's simply amazing!"
Quinoa1984,"Feb 13, 2000",10/10,"Stanely Kubrick's Paths of Glory is a great example of when Kubrick was at his best- and only in his twenties. This depiction of World War one with Kubrick as director and Kirk Douglas in perfect form, it takes the viewer into the objectivity of it all. What happens in the trenches, if just from a bird's eye view? His gliding camera in these scenes is remarkable. Then when he moves into the courtroom scenes, and the following awaiting of the soldier's last call, it becomes heartbreaking, and it becomes one of those rare stories that never loses its relevance. And the last scene shows that Kubrick, contrary to his de-humanizing nature in his films, reaches an emotional peak equal to De Sica or even Dreyer. It gets better every year. A classic of anti-war sentiment."
devonmcarthur,"Mar 4, 2021",6/10,"A masterpiece requires more daring than this. It's very much a movie of its time. But Kubrick's disdain for war comes through loud and clear. Able performances all around. It is hampered by its breakneck pace, never lingering quite long enough to impart the necessary gravity upon the audience."
aidaneccleston,"Feb 2, 2024",7/10,"Caught 'Paths of Glory' recently and it definitely left an impact with its harsh take on the realities of war and the corruption within military leadership. Kubrick's direction is sharp, using the black and white format to its full advantage, creating a stark, gritty atmosphere that really drives the grim message home. The courtroom scenes are intense, showcasing the moral dilemmas and injustices soldiers face. It's a powerful depiction of the absurdity of war, but the pacing and some of the acting felt a bit dated to me, pulling me out of the immersion now and then.The lead performance by Kirk Douglas is standout, bringing a lot of depth to his role as a French colonel trying to navigate the impossible situation of defending his men against unfair charges. His character's frustration and determination really highlight the human element amidst the broader critique of military bureaucracy and the futility of war. However, despite these strong elements, the film sometimes struggles to maintain momentum, with certain parts dragging on longer than necessary, which made my attention waver.Overall, I'm giving 'Paths of Glory' a 7/10. It's got a lot of strengths, especially in its cinematography, direction, and the way it tackles complex themes. But as a younger viewer, the slower pace and some aspects of the storytelling and acting felt a bit old-fashioned. It's a film that's definitely worth watching for its critical take on war and leadership, but it might not fully resonate with everyone used to more modern cinema's energy and pacing."
fergusonchip,"Mar 6, 2003",4/10,"I was not drawn into this movie at all.  The acting was stiff (no, not stiff like you would expect soldiers to be) so I really did not find myself caring that much about the characters.  I have no idea how this movie is ranked above ""Bridge on the River Kwai.""  It isn't even in the same league."
elvircorhodzic,"Jan 11, 2017",10/10,"PATHS OF GLORY is an anti-war film based on the novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb. This is a shocking film, which is inspired by real events, about the shameful incident on the Western Front in the First World War. We've seen the terrifying battleground in the grip of corruption and cynicism.Kubrick's style became known after this film. Extremely long shots emphasize the importance of a particular scene, a part of the story or some locations.Black and white photography goes well with the atmosphere and themes in the film. The dark tones, night scenes and human expression provoke strong feelings of anxiety.The story begins with the agony that goes into the public injustice and ends with the tragedy. One general, on the suggestion of his superior, sent his division across the no man's land in a suicide assault that is bloodily rejected. Three soldiers must pay with their lives for alleged cowardice. However, their colonel reasonably rebelled.... The story of human intrigue, courage and fear of soldiers is honest, direct and explicit. Scenery, referring to the cold, wet and bloody trenches, is amazingly convincing.Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax is a passionate idealist. However, he is only one link in the chain of orders. His character is not a rebel. This is a natural reaction to the apparent injustice. Adolphe Menjou as Major General Georges Broulard is the embodiment of a cunning and ruthless war policy. George Macready as Brigadier General Paul Mireau is a kind of a grotesque. A vindictive character, who is a slave of his own ego.The end of the film is somewhat cathartic. The soldiers revive forgotten feelings in inhumane conditions of war.The future is pessimistic, but the struggle for humanity is visible. War is hell, and it is part of one's everyday life. Rotten people survived the war. The innocent are dying. Nothing changes.Mr. Kubrick is a true master."
Coventry,"Feb 14, 2020",9/10,"Usually I don't comment or popular classics or war movies, but I absolutely wanted to leave a review for ""Paths of Glory"" for two principal reasons. First, as a sort of small homage to Kirk Douglas. This great gentleman of Hollywood passed away early 2020 after reaching the more than respectable age of 103. Nevertheless, he will be sorely missed. Secondly, and most important, because not any other movie ever made comes even close to depicting the pure madness and hypocrisy of warfare as accurately and truthfully as Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"". The three words in the subject line of this user-comment represent the widely known moto of the nation of France. Logically interpreted these words imply that all French people are free, equal and live in brotherhood. Well, this moto certainly wasn't yet put into practice during the horrible World War I. During the most shocking sequences, Kubrick masterfully juxtaposes the wealth and luxury of French military generals (fancily dining and waltzing with aristocratic ladies) versus the daily agony the ""ordinary"" French soldiers are confronted with (suffering and dying in the trenches). These same hypocritic generals give the command for downright impossible attack raids, and then subsequently accuse their troops of cowardice and blame them for their own strategy-incompetence against - around that time - much better organized German army. Douglas impressively portrays the honorable Colonel (and attorney of law) Dax who puts his career and reputation at stake to defend a trio of soldiers put on trial ""as an example"".Powerful and extremely compelling war classic, based on a fantastic source novel, but brought to an even higher quality-level thanks to the meticulous directions of Stanley Kubrick and the dazzling performances of an all-star cast. The dialogues in the script are often astonishing and the atmosphere is so intense that you'll find yourself gasping for air. More than sixty years old, but still as effective and breath-taking as ever, ""Paths of Glory"" is a cinematic classic in the purest definition of the term."
mark-rojinsky,"Jul 15, 2017",10/10,"Banned in France till 1975, Kubrick's Paths of Glory (1957) is an unusually powerful and incisive cinematic discourse relating to the futility of war. In fact it would be almost unbearably grim without the performance of Douglas as Colonel Dax - the liberal French military advocate defending three innocent soldiers accused of cowardice on contrived trumped-up charges by the over-ambitious and arrogant General Mireau (George Macready). Such social issues as class differences and military hypocrisy in the French High Command are emphasised. The contrast between the rococo marbly splendours of the chateau inhabited by the generals and the godawful trenches at the front are telling. Douglas' Dax character gives the film its only light and warmth. In appearance he looks dynamic - sporting greased back fair hair and lantern-jaw; the brigade number '701' is embossed on his collar and cuffs plus he wears a prototype wristwatch. Along with 20.000 Leagues under the Sea (1954), Ulisse (1954) and Light at the Edge of the World(1971) it is one of his most purposeful performances although it lacks the Nietzschean undertones of the aforementioned adventure and sword and sandals films. London's Time Out Film Guide describes Douglas' performance as being 'astonishingly successful' and refers to the very interesting 'diagrammatic tracking shots' relating to the battle scenes."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Apr 12, 2018",8/10,"The beautiful black-and-white cinematography shows off the spectacular battle sequences, which aren't the main focus of this brazenly unconventional war film that refreshingly focuses upon the French within the First World War (a perspective not often portrayed), as the amazing choreography and direction brings to life a long-gone era with vivid ferocity. The bold plot (which seemingly takes a page from the excellent 'The Ox-Bow Incident (1943)' in its latter half) is incredibly impactful thanks to its blatant injustice. 'Paths Of Glory (1957)' has a potently anti-military - or rather, anti-military-establishment - message that's clear but not overbearing, allowing it to rise to the top of its genre with ease. Powerful stuff. 8/10"
gustaslietuva,"Apr 23, 2021",10/10,Kubrick's second masterpiece. It is one of the best and effective war movie that I've ever seen. Just everything about this movie is just great. It's stood the test of time and became a classic.
dunbarhe,"May 24, 2008",8/10,"Great Movie! I just caught it again on Turner Classic Movies, so I thought I'd check out IMDb and see what I didn't know about it.Well, I didn't know that so many folks would choose to see the French generals as representative of shortcomings in the competence and character of all military leaders, rather than examples of poor leadership in general. Certainly those who work in corporate environments or read a newspaper regularly can attest to the presence of bad, greedy, or selfish leaders in all walks of life. If anything, the example of both Colonel Dax and the steady senior sergeant should serve as evidence that good leaders co-exist with bad ones. Their presence offers us hope that honor and competence may occasionally be recognized and given the authority to make intelligent decisions.Sorry to have strayed so far from the movie. It is probably one of the black and white films that I am most willing to sit through. The cinematography and the acting are both amazing. The battle scene proves that Steven Spielberg's work in the opening scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"" certainly had a precedent.As to the final scene of Paths of Glory. I've read a lot of comments here misunderstanding that as well. I suppose that is easy to do, if you don't understand soldiers. These men are asked to exist like animals for months on end, in the dirt, in daily fear for their survival. They are reduced to ""kill or be killed"" and even their enemy is dehumanized in order to make his death less of a moral dilemma. So, of course, when presented with such a beautiful woman, their first reaction is animalistic. Here's the subject of so many dirty jokes and late-night fantasies come before them in the flesh. But then, her singing reconnects these men to their own humanity. They are ashamed of their former actions and of the level to which they have descended. And they are reminded of their mothers, wives, daughters and the homes that they left behind. Their tears stem from shame and homesickness. Colonel Dax exhibits compassion when he instructs the sergeant to allow the men a few minutes more of human experience before causing them to return to the mud, blood and misery of their existence in the trenches."
JuguAbraham,"Aug 3, 2008",8/10,"Here's a significant black and white film from that only a small section of Kubrick's fans discuss. Here's is a movie made five decades ago that film goers might find relevant even to this day. It was not a runaway box office success. It's an anti-war film that has a political relevance for any country that pushes its foot soldiers to fight suicidal battles for the glory of politicians and generals. And the most surprising element of the film is that the film loosely describes events that actually transpired in France. Consequently this 1957 film was not shown in France until 1975, and in Spain until 1986.Set in Europe during the First World War, the movie is based on a novel by Henry Cobb. After the book made an impact on film director Stanley Kubrick, the film rights of the book. That act tells you a lot about Kubrick! Cobb's novel describes a historical event that took place because some French generals decided to derive glory for themselves during the war by pushing soldiers in the trenches to attempt a suicidal attack on an enemy position. Once the decision is taken by the generals, the orders are passed down the pecking order, from general to colonel, from colonel to major, from major to corporal. The suicidal strike does take place, some die, and many fall back under the fire from enemy lines.That's only the framework of the story that Kubrick used to build a film that asks inconvenient questions of the viewer. Kubrick and Cobb underline the difference between the generals who are waltzing with their spouses while the poor foot soldier is worried if he will ever see his wife again. Those in power enjoy, while the poor are pawns caught in the games the powerful play to bring glory to themselves.Kubrick's taut screenplay shows interaction between a general and the foot soldiers in the trenches. Three of the soldiers the general chooses to speak to are the very same individuals who are made the scapegoats at the military court and shot to death for no fault of theirs. Are all of us who do not enjoy economic freedom, slaves to a system that is not fair and just? The content of this film somehow anticipates Kubrick's and Kirk Douglas' next project, Spartacus, a film that was not planned at the time Paths of Glory was being made.The film has shades of existential colors. One of the condemned men compares his life and the life of an insect: ""See that cockroach? Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive. It'll have more contact with my wife and child than I will. I'll be nothing, and it'll be alive."" At several points in the film, the screenplay underlines the reality that a junior ranking officer can never blow the whistle on a senior officer's misdeeds and get away with it. The ending of the film that Kubrick was toying with was a happy onebut the lead actor Kirk Douglas prevailed and made the ending a philosophical and a tragic one. This is perhaps one of the few examples in cinema history when an actor contributed so positively to a film. The film with a happy ending could have made more money but wouldn't have been comparable in merit and strength as this one.The viewers today can approach the film as an intelligent anti-war film in the league of Terrence Mallick's The Thin Red Line. Yet, remove the element of war and what happens in Paths of Glory could happen in an office, in a university, or on the playing field.If we study the film closely the film it is basically a story of men. But the men are always thinking about women. And a woman's (a German, a representative of the army they were fighting) song in a dehumanizing situation transforms the leering soldiers into men recalling their wives, mothers and daughters. The dehumanizing situation of the woman is not far removed from those of the three innocent soldiers killed by a firing squad. The lady who sang the song became Mrs. Kubrick.Philosophically the film asks the viewer whether all the various paths of glory in life lead to the grave. And as the Thomas Gray poem that provided the title of the book suggests: death is a great equalizer. The tragic twist at end of the movie underlines this dark facet of life Many critics have praised the performances in this film. Ralph Meeker and Timothy Carey as two of the condemned men and that fascinating actor, Adolph Menjou and George Macready as the Generals provided sterling performances. (Macready's performance in Tora! Tora! Tora! was probably a notch better) Kirk Douglas had a role that any good actor could have taken advantage ofmy guess is that had Richard Burton been finally cast in the role, as Kubrick initially planned, the film would have been richer. But then if Douglas was not there, we might have lost the tragic end of the film. (Douglas' finest acting credentials surfaced in my opinion in the little praised 1969 film of Elia Kazan called The Arrangement.) Paths of Glory is a film that never won an Oscar or a major film festival award. Yet, it marked the beginning of a series of great films by Kubrick. To Kirk Douglas' credit he is quoted as saying, way back in 1969 ""There's a picture that will always be good, years from now. I don't have to wait 50 years to know that; I know it now"" How true!"
bkrauser-81-311064,"Apr 17, 2016",10/10,"The French Army calls it the Anthill. Mere kilometers away from Paris, German WWI forces have dug trenches and fortified the area for a little over a year. Gen. Paul Mireau (Macready) believes taking the Anthill is nearly impossible and says so within the first frames of Paths of Glory. Yet after the insinuation of a promotion by Gen. Broulard (Menjou), Mireau reconsiders, rationalizing and demurring such a feat of improbability for the sake of glory. Enters Kirk Douglas; cleft chin, movie-star good looks, and despite playing Col. Dax, a Frenchman, Douglas carries a signature American swagger. Surprised by the General's tactical decision, Dax nevertheless strives to carry out his orders.Thus the wheels of Paths of Glory begin to screech and turn. The movie is infamously known not only as a damning anti-war film but as one of Kubrick's first great masterpieces in a career marked by nothing but. As an anti-war film, Paths of Glory is downright incendiary choosing hubris, human frailty and visual metaphor as a means to an end. Generals sit in a comfy château making decisions about the cannon-fodder in the trenches who are shell-shocked due to months of constant skirmishes. Those in the trenches who hold to some semblance of rank, take advantage of it to hide mistakes and keep up appearances. The end result of Mireau's gambit, which according to Dax ""will weaken the French Army with heavy losses for no benefit""? So bitter and damning as to become farcical if it wasn't so unfailingly human.Even as early as 1957, the late Stanley Kubrick displayed a mastery of his craft with a particular affinity to asymmetrical spacing, alienating long shots and mechanical tracking shots. He keeps his camera at a safe distance, robbing the audience of superfluous or unnecessary human emotions; concentrating instead on the chaotic wartime experience on an almost cosmic scale. Each 35mm frame of Mireau and Douglas coolly inspecting the foxhole huddled with frightened soldiers says more about inhumanity than can be found in the pages of a mediocre novel. The cynicism and pessimism of everything proceeding the battle is enough to make anyone revolt. Is it any wonder the film went unreleased in France for over twenty years?But while the first tracking shots are an attack on the inhumanity of war, the scenes of the battle for the Anthill are a full frontal attack on the way Hollywood made war movies. While films like Sergeant York (1941) are drenched in patriotism, Paths of Glory's long, unforgiving battle scene dares to be cruel, emotionally complex and absurd. During an ever escalating barrage of artillery, mortar and machine gunfire, soldiers are dispatched with mechanical coldness, superiors shout out in the organized chaos while Col. Dax's story surreptitiously disappears into the ether. Meanwhile the enemy remains unseen.As early as the forties, Douglas had been attracted by ardent bleeding-heart roles with a penchant for little-man-against-the- system melodrama. In the moments when the film veers into courtroom drama, Douglas oozes carefully controlled personal branding. Many claim that if not for Douglas's involvement, Kubrick would have shown his intellectual colors a lot earlier. Yet there's little doubt that without the interest of Kirk Douglas, Paths of Glory (twice rejected by United Artists) would cease be. While Douglas's star power does on occasion overwhelm the frame and he does chew the scenery with higher-than-thou proselytizing it feels almost like a release. It's almost as if Kubrick brings you to the edge of the abyss while Douglas warmly touches your shoulder and tells you not to jump. He's the bridge and arbiter between the entrenched studio system and the vanguard still percolating in France, raging in Japan and under-appreciated everywhere else.Paths of Glory is a near perfect anti-war film and a high water mark for film in general. While a little stark for some, one can't help but find hope and beauty in the small moments such as when Christine Kubrick (longtime wife of the director) solemnly sings a German folk song to a squad of French troops. Douglas once called Kubrick a ""talented s***,"" yet despite well documented friction, the two tall figures of cinema managed to make something real special here. Something too unique, too beautiful and too scornfully, maddeningly perfect to be ignored."
vanhowell-89564,"Jul 15, 2016",10/10,"Easily the most important movie I've seen in terms of its emotional and intellectual impact. I was nine when it showed at the Main Street theater (25¢ for Saturday matinée), and never forgot it. The idea that army officers would be dishonest, corrupt, and willing to have their own troops executed for no crime was absolutely at odds with everything I was supposed to believe about how the world works—growing up in a military town, in a family proud of its war stories. When I finally saw it again almost sixty years later every scene resonated as if I'd seen it just a week before. The movie was exactly as great as it was the first time around—and for exactly the same reasons. It pulls no punches. Recommended without reservation."
preppy-3,"Mar 27, 2004",8/10,"Not really an anti-war film but a film showing the callousness and stupidity of military leaders.  The film takes place in France during WWI.  Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) is ordered by his superior Gen. Mireau (George Macready) to lead his men on a suicide mission to capture a hill the Germans have occupied.  Dax is against it but follows orders.  Things go terribly wrong and three men are (unjustly) courtmartialed for cowardice.  Dax tries his best to save them.Very strong, depressing drama.  Even though its over 40 years old it still shocks you.  Stanley Kubrick's direction is just great especially during the attack sequence and another part near the end.  All the acting is just great--especially Douglas, Macready and Adolphe Menjou.  Script is just fantastic and the movie never strikes a false note...even when you think there might be a (somewhat) happy ending the movie pulls the rug out from under you.  I can't really say I enjoyed the picture...but it makes its point.  The last sequence with the girl singing is really strange--I'm guessing Kubrick added it so the audience wouldn't be TOO depressed!This was a bomb in 1957 (even though critics loved it).  It was too ahead of its time.  It's now regarded as a classic--as it should be.  A definite must-see...just brace yourself."
valleyjohn,"May 12, 2011",8/10,"Rated number 50 in the IMDb.com greatest movies of all time , Paths of Glory is not a film that i was particularly familiar with. I'm a fan of Stanley Kubrik and i love Kirk Douglas so it should come as no surprise that i really enjoyed this movie. When a group of soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them. I love the look of this film. You can pretty much tell this has Stanley Kubrick's fingerprints all over it. It asks uncomfortable political and social questions and you can't help but be angry at authority which is a thread that runs through a lot of Kubrik's movies. The acting is superb , especially from a super confident Kirk Douglas and like the fact that this does not have a sickly sweet outcome to it which was so common with war films made in the 40's and 50's. It's a film that spits in the face of authority while the common man suffers and i loved it."
Vartiainen,"Mar 5, 2019",6/10,"Stanley Kubrick was a very versatile director. His movies differ greatly in subject matter and genre. Yet there are common elements among all of his films. The technical mastery, the tone, and some themes. Of those themes sexuality was a big one, but not as big as war. Or rather the opposition of war.Paths of Glory takes place in the French trenches during World War One. Desperate and ruthlessly ambitious general orders his men to take a hill held by the Germans. This proves to be an impossible task and the men retreat. Incensed, the general accuses his men of cowardice in the face of the enemy and orders one man from every company to be executed by firing squad.This doesn't sit well with Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), the regiment's leader, and he appoints himself as their defense at the court-martial.It's an early Kubrick film and thus it doesn't have quite as many ""But what does it mean?"" scenes than his more famous films. There are some of those here as well - the ending for example - but it is a surprisingly straightforward as far as Kubrick films go.Yet you can still see his touch in almost everything. Especially on the technical side of things. The film has some great long takes of men walking in the trenches or crawling over the no man's land. The characters are rather black-n-white, or at the very least easy to understand motivation-wise. Which is typical for Kubrick, when you think about it. His characters would develop more grey areas in his later films, but they'd always remain rather... Iconic? Archetypical? They're deep despite it, don't get me wrong. Perhaps it would be better to say that his character are cut with broad, wide strokes, to make them easier to understand in the context of the story.Not the best Kubrick film I've ever seen, but very good nevertheless. If you like this one, you probably should check out The Killing as well."
sme_no_densetsu,"Feb 8, 2009",8/10,"Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"" wasn't much of a success at the time of its release but it has proved its worth over the years and is today remembered as a classic. The film is set during WWI and revolves around an attempt by French troops to carry out a near-impossible mission handed down to them by their glory-hungry superiors.The cast is a pretty good one but you'd be advised to forget about the fact that these guys are supposed to be French. That being said, Adolphe Menjou & George Macready are convincing as the glory-seeking generals while Kirk Douglas delivers a fine performance in the film's pivotal role. The rest of the cast is acceptable but not really worth noting.Kubrick's direction, even at this early stage in his career, shows a master's touch. The battlefield & trench scenes are particularly well done while Kubrick comes up with memorable visuals throughout the film. Gerald Fried, who was Kubrick's go-to guy for music at the time, contributes a score that deftly supports Kubrick's script and visuals.In the end, while the film's acting and technical merits are indeed notable, it is the story that truly makes the film stand out. It defies expectations and incisively examines the supposed glory of war and the price paid for it. I wholeheartedly recommend the film although I think that the current top-50 IMDb rating is a bit generous, particularly when you consider that it is rated above ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" & ""A Clockwork Orange""."
HotToastyRag,"Jan 18, 2018",7/10,"If you liked All Quiet on the Western Front, you'll love Paths of Glory. Told in the same anti-war tone, Stanley Kubrick's film conveys a stark, bleak atmosphere in his black-and-white footage, Georg Krause's stoic cinematography, and Malcom Arnold's minimalistic score. It follows the planning and potential execution of a suicide mission in World War One. If you can use your suspension of disbelief and accept the fact that no one in the movie has a French accent, you'll be in for a very riveting, well-acted film.Adolphe Menjou and George Macready are big-wigs in the French army, and they plan out a mission for their boys in the trenches that has virtually no likelihood of success. Both men are hard-hearted and treat men in uniform like chess pawns. Emotional and physical wounds are often ignored, but when Kirk Douglas hears of the plan, he doesn't want to go through with it. He actually cares about his soldiers and doesn't want to order them to their death.Keep in mind that this is a war drama, so don't pop this in if you're in the mood for a light afternoon flick. This movie will absolutely get you riled up, and if you're already anti-war, it might become one of your favorites. It had the misfortune to be released the same year as The Bridge on the River Kwai, which swept the Oscars in 1958 and took space in audiences' memories in the years to come. You've probably heard of Paths of Glory, but unless you're a film buff or student, you might not have seen it. If you're up for a very heavy, depressing movie, it's absolutely worth watching."
tudormon,"Dec 29, 2006",2/10,"For a reason which escapes me, Kubrick (an extraordinary director) agreed to direct 2 movies of Kirk Douglas, which I am sure actually did all the work and, well, the movies are bad. These movies were both produced by Kirk's production company, and he of course was the great star. Kubrick even disowned one of these movies as not his own - and yes, Kirk's influence is THAT bad.Looking on the Spartacus page, I quote from the currently displayed comment: ""As most are undoubtedly aware, this is the film that the director virtually expunged from his repertoire. But why did Stanley Kubrick really disown SPARTACUS(1960)? The answer can be summed up in two words: absolute control. [...] But you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY(1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company, and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well.""This is very nicely said so I guess I need to add no more.Luckily, these two never made another movie together, and Kubrick made history by following up with Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, 2001, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut. In the meantime, Kirk made no history but instead did 58 more movies, of... shall we say... very sad quality.Overall, Spartacus is even more laughable than Paths of Glory because poor Kirk is a small guy and not even 2 of him would make up for the physique of a gladiator (yet he is Spartacus). But Paths of Glory is certainly more annoying as the sweet perfection, flawless intentions and pure soul of Kirk's character makes you want to puke - they are almost not human, let alone not possible for an army colonel whose job is - ultimately - to kill."
a_chinn,"Dec 19, 2023",10/10,"Often labeled an anti-war film, I'd frame this film as more focused on the absurdity of war, much like Kubrick's later masterpiece, DR. STRANGELOVE. Kirk Douglas plays Col. Dax, an idealistic WWI French officer tasked with leading his troops on a suicide mission to take a fortified German ""anthill"" all so a general can get a promotion. When the mission fails, the general has three of the soldiers put on trial for cowardice, and Douglas serves as their defense attorney. Based on real-life events, PATHS OF GLORY features some of the most harrowing battle scenes ever committed to film. Unlike more sensationalistic war films, such as ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT or the films of Sam Fuller, Kubrick's cold documentarian eye captures all the horror of the battlefield, feeling both real and shocking. PATHS OF GLORY also features from of Kubrick's best use of tracking shots outside of THE SHINING, with Douglas stone-faced marching through the trenches ahead of battle (a nice contrast to when the cowardly general walks the same trenches earlier in the film). Douglas chews the scenery like the Hollywood royalty he is and shows up every actor he shares a scene with. Oddball character actor Timothy Carey (a personal favorite) is the only other actor who comes close to stealing a scene from Douglas, playing one of the soldiers on trial (Watch Carey's film he wrote, directed, and starred in, THE WORLD'S GREATEST SINNER, to see how offbeat he really could be!). Ralph Meeker has never been better playing one of the soldiers on trial. The third soldier on trial is played by Joe Turkel, best known as Lloyd in Kubrick's THE SHINING and Dr. Eldon Tyrell in BLADE RUNNER. George Macready is deliciously slimy as the ambitious general who's willing to climb the ranks even at the expense of hundreds of his men's lives. For me, what makes this film arguably Kubrick's best is that it offers a rare instance of emotion and humanity. An oft-criticism of Kubrick's films is that they are cold, calculating, and sterile, which is a fair assessment (and not necessarily a negative), but without spoiling the film's ending, which is not a typical Hollywood ending by any means, is one that won't leave a dry eye in the house (featuring the future wife of Kubrick, Christiane Kubrick, billed as Susanne Christian). PATHS OF GLORY is a tough, emotionally raw, searing indictment on the absurdity of war that is essential viewing for cinephiles. FUN FACT! Douglas had it written into his contract for this film that there would be one scene where he is shirtless."
Johnny V-2,"Dec 26, 1998",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's film certainly portrays the dangers of marshal law with great clarity. This film is testament all just soldiers and a grim reminder of the upheaval of war.I must disagree that this is an anti-war film but more an insight into justice. Kirk Douglas is the french (but strangely all american) hero who has proved himself not only on the battlefield but the court floor also, he is also a man who empathsises with his men, and so we see a patriot who understands the reasons for war, but a man who also understands the need for true justice.Although the finale is a complete shock to anyone expecting sentimentality from Kubrick, we see how various forms of justice have been dispensed, even the cowardly leitenant, a man who should be on trial, and both of the hateful generals are made to see the full consequences of their actions."
mbrcf,"Sep 9, 2023",10/10,"Year is 1957, you are sitting in a local theater to watch a film called ""Paths of Glory"" with a group of friends. You have this friend that's been talking endlessly about this film, finally forcing the group to watch it together. Apparently it's been made by a Stanley something no one knows anything about. The film starts but people are talking loudly which annoys you. Very early in the film, all the noises drop down, everyone is pinned to their seats, like a strict catholic mass. The film ends in what seemed like 15 minutes, folks slowly leave the hall with bizarre expressions on their face. You feel empty inside, aimlessly looking for words to express your feelings and thoughts. You feel you'll need a strong liquor to digest it all. At the bar, you enquire about the filmmaker, the guy's name is Stanley Kubrick and he's only 28 years old. You make sure to remember that name, a name you sense you'd hear a lot more from."
Bill357,"Mar 25, 2009",6/10,"Paths of glory is an entertaining enough work of drama, but it appears that the filmmakers started out with a viewpoint and pulled out all the stops to steer the viewer towards their own conclusions. They should have let the viewer make up his or her own mind about war and arrogance. Their is no mystery as to what the outcome will be, as it is telegraphed way in advance.Another scenario would be to have the men on trial be accused of real cowardice in the face of the enemy, instead of trumped up charges. The Colonial could have then argued for a more lenient punishment using a psychological defense, for example, ""Should primal fear and being mentally unable to kill a man, be worthy of a death sentence,""We should have then been allowed a glimpse of the tribunal's deliberations as they weighed the pros and cons of sparing their lives. Instead we're given a simplistic story of good guy vs. bad guys, which provokes no thought and runs on sheer emotion."
Chuck-149,"Jul 28, 1999",10/10,"This is no normal war movie.  It isn't even a common type of movie because it declares the stupidity of a war that wasn't the Vietnam war but the World War I.  12 years after WWII, Kubrick went back to the roots of the previous war and showed the downside of the war which should be the one side everybody should see.Not having yet established his trademark as the king of rough and dark movies, Kubrick made his mark with ""Paths of glory"" in 1957 which came to be banned in France for 25 years because of his way of discriminating its army.Kubrick had Kirk Douglas play the lead role which was perfect for him. the movie centers around the decision Douglas makes to withdraw his men from the attack of the ""Ant hill"" after having been bombed by his own superior. Douglas remains unfortunately unaware of this fact until the end of the movie.  But after having had his men withdrawn from the attack, Douglas's men are accused of cowardice and three of his men are to be executed.  A short court martial is held at the demand of Kirk Douglas but he doesn't have the opportunity to defend his men.  The three are executed and Douglas is finally informed that his superior had ordered a bombing on his men.  His superior is to be removed from his post and the penalty that awaits him is unknown to the audience.As in all his movies, Kubrick lets you hoping the badguy will be caught until the end but as usual, it's too late to change the bad part when he is finally caught.  A very close second to ""Dr. Strangelove"", this is one Kubrick movie lovers will not want to miss."

chaos-rampant,"Nov 15, 2008",N/A,"Who'd have thought that at such a young age, and coming after the decent but largely unremarkable heist noir of THE KILLING, Kubrick had it in him to deliver a flat-out, stonecold war movie classic? Had Kubrick decided to renounce the aesthetic grandeur and epic scope of his later films, he could always have had a brilliant and successful career as a genre director. His visual sense is certainly competent at this point but his directing is still very much that of a genre director.He's not trying, possibly not even caring or daring to at this point, to break the norm but rather work inside it the best he can. It is however the mark of a director well on his way to greater things that he nails the themes, conflicts and most striking images of the movie with just five tracking shots - General Mireau inspecting the shellshocked soldiers inside the trench, Col. Dax moving through the trenches before the attack, Col. Dax and the division moving through the wartorn battlefield full of ditches and old fenceposts, the guests of General Broulard dancing, and finally the three soldiers being escorted to their deaths.Interested more in the moral dilemmas pertaining to war and those who wage it as opposed to the physical act of war itself, emphasizing the absurdity and futility of sending out men to die by the thousands for a couple yards of shellshocked dirt, perhaps the best observation on the human nature Paths of Glory has to offer is that idealism has no place in the act of war. War is so far removed from notions of decency and common sense that bringing idealism in it as an afterthought appears out of touch with reality.Although Kirk Douglas portraying Col. Dax, and doing a formidable job at it, is presented to us as the hero in a conventional sense, the selfsame idealist in the heart of darkness that has been the driving force of many a war movie, and he does raise some interesting questions, he is essentially a man deeply contradictory to his own nature and his own choices within it: can a man sworn to service in the army call issues of a moral nature? At what point are any and all such questions deemed completely irrelevant? Is for example Col. Dax in the end any less responsible for the deaths of his men than the generals who ordered this futile attack?I believe some answers are to be found in the philosophy of Judge Holden from Blood Meridian, perhaps the most frightening of literary antagonists ever to be summoned on paper. What this gnostic archon, war everlasting, tells us is that war is the ultimate form of divination because it allows for the individual to be completely susbumed in the whole, the obliteration of will and ego. Reading the scanned pages of an old book from the Civil War-era, written by a Confederate army surgeon, I remember coming across a passage that referred to amputations to be carried out at the field of battle; as the surgeon explained from his own experience, not only are even the most coward of men consumed in the pandemonium of battle and capable for the most heroic deeds, but wounded soldiers will more easily sit through amputations when the battlefield is sight or the sounds of battle can be heard."

ennyman,"Nov 6, 2006",10/10,"I have placed this early Kubrick anti-war statement on my top ten list both for its originality, great acting, compelling story line, plot twists, and surprisingly beautiful and inspired ending. This one is a heart-breaker account of a moment in history that repeated itself endlessly in that horrific bloodfest called the trenches of World War I. To some extent Kubrick returned to the theme in various ways with Full Metal Jacket, but Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax is perfect here, demonstrating the challenge of maintaining honor within a system that has turned values on its head. It is a crisis in the life and career of Colonel Dax, who has lived by the watchword of Duty with a capital D throughout his career, but has remained idealistic and faithful to his men. The army's absurd effort to capture ""the Anthill"" results in a tear in the fabric of his idealism. The ugliness he sees is an eye opener for both Dax and the audience, who sees the truth with tragic clarity.Colonel Dax, identifying with his men, is an inspiration in contrast to an empty culture of power and prestige with no ethical base."
hedgehog-10,"Jan 15, 1999",10/10,"A superb Kubrick film which show the politics which ran throughout the armies of the time. The contents of the film could so easily apply to the politics and class prejudice which is clearly reflected in some of the courts martials of British troops during WWI. Like all brilliant film, Paths of Glory has superb direction, photography, script and the right actor in the right part."
rc223,"Nov 13, 1998",9/10,A powerful anti-war film. There's nothing like WWI for angry movie making but that doesn't mean it's easy. Douglas is superb and Menjou thoroughly hate-worthy. Terrific battle scenes. (9/10)
antonjsw1,"Mar 7, 2010",10/10,"This is an excellent film.It shows that Kubrick is really pushing the boundaries of film-making despite the limits of a modest budget and strongly established film conventions of time. His decision to film in Europe really helps this film with excellent b & w photography and the emergence of the Kubrick signature tracking shots shot with a wide angle and large depth of field. The directing is pretty much flawless and the visceral battle sequences are pretty startling for a film made in 1957 on a just a $1 million budget.The story is fascinating, and providing you can get past the American accents, which is not to difficult, the politics of power is well observed. The machinations of specific characters, and their consequences for those at the sharp end, are also a comment of society in general, particularly how the powerful treat those lower down the social layers. Performances are very good, notably Ralph Meeker, Killing alumni Joe Turkel and Timothey Carey as three soldiers key to the story, supporting player George Macready as General Mireau and a thoughtful turn by Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax. Douglas plays understated extremely well, and the character's conflict and frustration with the situation he finds himself are well played. However, there is a determination to not give up his principles and humanity, which is the highlight and anchor of the movie.Production design Ludwig Reiber, costume design by Ilse Dubois, and b & w cinematography by Georg Krause are superb, and Kubrick's trademark camera-work really shows in this film for the first time.Interestingly I did notice a music track early on that sounds strikingly similar to the drum riff that introduces the preparation of the marines for heading down to LV426 in Aliens. It made me think whether a certain Mr Cameron is paying homage to some of Mr Kubrick's films in Aliens. After all Aliens opening is at the very least heavily inspired by Gayane's Ballet Suite from 2001.In summary a outstanding film that sort of marks the end of Kubrick's breakout phase, before he moved on to direct is one and only populist blockbuster."
david_lockett,"Feb 17, 2006",6/10,"This is a very well made anti-war movie, however since the characters are all French I find Kirk Douglas' portrayal a real blight on the movie. An actor is supposed to do that act! Douglas just plays a modern (1950's) American guy trying to convince as a Frenchman from World War One with no hint of an accent. He comes across as overtly American, the sort who would be leading the invasion at Omaha Beach in WW2. In one scene he even quotes Franklin, an American Statesman - now no French Officer from WW1 would be quoting an American - he'd of course be quoting some Famous Frenchy, Voltaire for example. The movie does steer toward a powerful conclusion, I just wish that the central character was chosen on suitability not star power."
jenkothetarheel,"Sep 14, 2022",8/10,"Shamefully this my first cinematic experience involving Kirk Douglas. Hearing him speak reminded me alot of his son(mannerisms, voice tone etc.) Michael who is an accomplished actor in his own right. Kirk was wonderful in this movie with his performance and I believed him every step of the way. This movie is very well shot and paced. The cast as a whole is very good and the villain character in this story is very easy to hate. This film doesn't have a Happy ending and will leave you with a sickly feeling in your stomach at times as the depiction of war is always ugly. I will be looking more into Mr. Douglas' filmography.Very good film and I would say rewatchable."

It's truly amazing that the same director that directed full metal jacket directed this movie."
fowler-16,"Mar 7, 2006",10/10,"This film is a treasure. I first saw it in the local movie house in Ashland, Oregon, in my second season with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. The theater owner screened it for one night only, I believe, as an ""art film"" that might appeal to a small off-beat crowd. The whole Shakespeare company showed up, and we were enthralled by the acting and stunned and moved by Kubrick's lean, masterful story of an historical cover-up perpetrated by autocratic generals in collusion with lower-ranking opportunists and cowards. Based on a blatant miscarriage of justice in the French army of World War I, the film had a powerful impact on our generation--in the post-Korea, pre-Vietnam era. It is a classic indictment of the corruption of men in war. I believe it holds up very well and that no one who sees it at the right time of their life will ever forget it."
didbecu,"May 3, 2021",9/10,"You don't need Stanley Kubrick to remember that war is stupid and that it only causes deep inhuman traumas, but Paths Of Glory surely is a great reminder of that. It's a big mistery why this movie is rarely mentioned when people come up with big Kubrick-titles as this rather short film (80 minutes) is just perfect from the first tot he last second. Kirk Douglas stars as the officer who refuses to send his soldiers from the trenches into the field of death. The contrast between the privates who are just bullet meat and the officers who keep on partying like there's no war around are mindblowing. The ending scene with the singing German girl says it all. Still one of my all time favourites and I already lost the count of my rewatches.In 85 minutes Kubrick not only shows why he's a genius director, but also why mankind is cruel. One of the best movies ever made......"
Jeannot,"Mar 29, 2005",10/10,"The film effectively depicts, in miniature, a historical realityGeneral Nivelle's spring offensive to regain the Chemin des Dames position in April, 1917. The real offensive involved 19 divisions, and not just one regiment, as in the movie. Forty thousand men were lost on the first day, with almost nothing to show for it.Such a vast undertaking can be dealt with only in non-fiction works such as Barbara Tuchman's GUNS OF AUGUST, which marvelously depicts on a vast canvas, involving the movements of whole armies, the opening of the war in 1914, the events which led up to ""the Miracle of the Marne."" The irony here is that by stopping the Germans at the Marne, the French doomed themselves to four years of slaughter, eventually losing 1,400,000 young men killed.Art cannot deal with such scope, but must miniaturize; thus the offensive in PATHS OF GLORY is confined to one regiment, and then focuses on just five men in that regimentits colonel (Douglas), a cowardly company commander (Wayne Morse), and three privates who are randomly selected as scapegoats. Of course, the selection is not really random; the Ralph Meeker character, for example, is selected by Morse because he had witnessed the latter's cowardice, which cost the life of one of his men on a scouting expedition.In addition, two generalsperfectly played by a self-righteous George Macready (""If those sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face French ones"") and a cynical Adolphe Menjou (who is surprised to learn that Dax is an idealist)are also individualized as the ""bad guys."" The point is often made that the bad guys are too bad. Of course they are. In a movie, more so than in a novel, you have to paint in broad strokes. The essence of film is melodrama.The Macready character is loosely based on the real Nivelle, who was appointed commander-in-chief after the ten-month-long battle of Verdun, in which the French lost half a million men. Nivelle, more mistaken than evil, felt that what was needed was a major gung-ho offensive by artillery and infantry. But the Germans, forewarned, had taken the high ground (called the ""Ant Hill"" in the movie), along the Chemin des Dames, and had prepared impregnable positions. In WWI, unlike WWII, the defense almost always won.The movie, based on Humphrey Cobb's novel, perfectly illustrates art's practice of miniaturization, individuation, and humanization of large historical events. As viewers, we need to see specific persons we can relate to. The Vietnam movie PLATOON, carries this idea still further, in that a platoon is only part of a company, which is part of a regiment. A WWII movie which does the same thing is A WALK IN THE SUN.For me, PATHS OF GLORY remains a classic, and is not just an antiwar filmthough it is that too."
gbill-74877,"Mar 22, 2022",9/10,"A searing critique of the idiocy of war and the military in general, set to trench warfare during WWI. If it sounds like a difficult film to watch I suppose in some ways it is, but Kubrick gives us a war film that keeps its pace up in its 88 minutes and doesn't bog down with excessive action out on the battlefield. The plot seems designed to outrage the viewer and it's certainly successful in that, but it was inspired by a true story. The script and performances are excellent, and it's a stunning film to have been made in 1957, clearly on the early edge of a transition in how the military was depicted in movies.Early on we see the personal motivation of a middle-aged General to send his men into the buzzsaw of the enemy so that he can possibly be promoted, while calculating losses dispassionately and slapping a soldier suffering from ""shell shock"" in the face. When the men can't execute an impossible task, he accuses the entire platoon of cowardice and has three men selected randomly to be court martialed. There are other subplots that I won't spoil, but a common thread is the personal faults of the men in the chain of command leading to senseless slaughter or grave injustice. A perhaps broader theme is that a system that requires all men to follow orders is inherently prone to abuse. We see the artillery commander stand up to the General at great risk to himself in one scene, but it's a pretty easy leap for the viewer to think of cases where soldiers feel unable to do so and then commit crimes against humanity.I liked how in a minor key the film also pokes at religion towards the end. While the commanding officer says do not question your orders (even though they are insane), the priest in the film tells one man to not question the will of God. Both men tell soldiers who are clearly traumatized and in need to empathy to buck up and act with courage, even though they themselves are out of harm's way during the war. Both require men to submit themselves to higher authority, and in so doing, lose their ability to think for themselves, as well as lose their humanity. I thought it was very telling when all the fighting was over a fortified position known as ""the anthill,"" aptly named because the men seem to have been reduced to ants. Great film."
LACUES,"Jan 1, 2003",N/A,"It is interesting to read the range of reviews regarding ""The Paths of Glory"".  While some consider it a classic, others decry it as mediocre or much worse.  As far as I am concerned it is indeed a great movie.  Upon its release, the New York Times film critic, Bosley Crowther,  was highly critical of it... for among other reasons, that the actors do not have French accents and are more likend to WW2 GI's.  For me the message of this movie is not dependent on French accents,nor is it a microscopic view of one war time incident.  It goes to the very heart of moral ambiguity, personal ambition, and rationalizations that enter into so many political and war time decisions.  The dialogue, acting, directing, and characterizations make this a true classic.  Being filmed in black and white evokes the somber and realistic theme of this movie.I consider this to be Stanley Kubrick's and Kirk Douglas' masterpiece.  It is a film that only gains in stature as the years pass.  I rate it a ten.Kirk Douglas, Adolph Menjou, Ralph Meeker, and the rest of the cast are superb.  Wayne Morris is especially fine as the repentant officer who regrets the choices he made."
Doylenf,"Dec 9, 2005",7/10,PATHS OF GLORY provides an interesting glimpse into wartime conditions during World War I when trench warfare was the common way to fight the enemy. The story concerns a self-serving French General (George MacReady) who believes that cowardice must be punished by randomly choosing three soldiers to face the firing squad. KIRK DOUGLAS is outstanding as the officer sympathetic to the men's plight who decides to defend them against a Court Martial.The supporting cast is studded with excellent performances. WAYNE MORRIS is especially good in a deeper than usual role for him as the real coward of the company chosen by Douglas to lead the firing squad. And ADOLPHE MENJOU is devious and cunning as the back-stabbing General who lets MacReady know that he too is going to be scrutinized by the authorities for conduct Douglas has made known to Menjou.Gripping war drama full of realistically filmed battle scenes guaranteed to make anyone understand how men become shell-shocked under constant enemy bombardment.The performance of KIRK DOUGLAS is another milestone in his career. Never has he seemed more defiant and courageous than he does here. My only quibble with the film is that its ending is just a bit murky as to intent and could have used a more satisfying wrap-up to the story.
Il_Magnifico,"Jul 16, 2006",10/10,"I enjoyed this movie immensely and agree with the previous posters who mentioned the stylistic similarities in ""Paths of Glory"" with later Kubrick works. I'm still uncertain of whether Kubrick intended the movie as an indictment of war in general or specifically to the French leadership in WWI. To the poster who asked about the source of the song the German girl was singing at the end, it is ""Der Treue Husar"" (The Faithful Husar). The lyrics and a midi of the melody can be found here: http://ingeb.org/Lieder/dertreue.html. Oh and by the way, the singing girl is Christiane Harlan - later Kubrick's third wife. Veit Harlan who did several propaganda movies for the Nazis was her uncle."
fredrikgunerius,"Mar 18, 2023",10/10,"One of the great anti-war movies, a sub-genre Stanley Kubrick would return to time and again over the course of his career. With its subtle variations in tone and temperament, Paths of Glory evokes a broad spectrum of emotions in its relatively sparse running time, ranging from ridicule and amusement to suspense, anger, sorrow and, ultimately, a glimpse of hope. This is certainly one of Kubrick's most economical movies, and it's remarkably well-made. Every scene and segment is tight, telling and technically proficient. Kubrick creates realistic scenes of battle with very simple means and is able to make the more academic subject matter in the second half of the film come alive and feel palpable, well helped by a passionate Kirk Douglas. Paths of Glory was a bold film, aesthetically and artistically. And like most of Kubrick's films, it holds up remarkably well. It's still one of his best. The evocative score is by Gerald Fried."
the dude-3,"Apr 26, 2000",10/10,"I was originally going to say that a third of Stanley Kubrick's films were about war, but that wouldn't be accurate.  A third of Stanley Kubrick's body of work were anti-war films.  Considering he only made 12 major films (not counting the five theatrically un-released) this is pretty significant.  He practically invented the anti-war genre with this film or at least made the first nationally recognized anti-war film.  His four major anti-war films could even fit the traditional genre cycle model.   ""Paths of Glory"" being his first anti-war film established the genre and thus was its novelty period.  His next anti-war film was ""Spartacus"" and this could be the classic period of the genre.  Next was ""Dr Strangelove or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb"" and this could be the revisionist period of the genre in which it takes a comedic turn.  Lastly was ""Full Metal Jacket"" which could fulfill the parodic period of the genre as it makes fun of itself.  These 4 films might have better fit the genre cycle if ""Dr. Strangelove"" was made after ""Full Metal Jacket"" but I'm not sure.  Anyway, it's a very interesting view of the four movies if you compare them.One thing that struck me in ""Paths of Glory"" was the German woman who sings at the end.  I may be wrong, but she is the only woman in the whole film, and I may again be wrong, but as I recall there was only one woman in ""Dr. Strangelove"" and one woman who was a main character in ""Full Metal Jacket"" (actually two, the Vietnamese prostitute and the assassin, but they could be considered the same woman).  This is very peculiar and thus very relevant in interpreting some of these films' meanings.  Most importantly, in all three of these films, the woman is something of the ""enemy""(somewhat of a stretch for the woman in ""Dr. Strangelove"" but she could be seen as an enemy as she keeps General Turgidson from doing his job and trades information between military officers.)  Also very important in two of the films is that they are the only enemy to be seen close-up.  In ""Paths of Glory"" the German singer at the end is the only time in the film the ""enemy"" is actually seen and this proves quite effective is demonstrating the absurdity of claiming she's essentially any different than the ""good guys.""  Also, in ""Full Metal Jacket"" the only enemy seen close up that's not dead is the assassin at the end who is not only female but a child and this is Kubrick's most wicked ploy as how could this young girl possibly be the enemy?"
jldmp1,"Jun 18, 2006",9/10,"This is early proof of why Kubrick especially loved the topic of war -- it inherently gave him two levels of directorial control: the 'normal' one at the director-over-the character level, and the implied one at the director-over-actor level. Douglas would later give profanely grudging praise to Kubrick about his methods.The best part of this is the meta-level of conflict: that of rogue director against studio bosses, which is mirrored in the story narrative. Kubrick exploits this meta-narrative to get some fine performances from the battle within between Douglas and Macready.Along the way, we get the nascent Kubrick visual treats centering on his trademark use of camera inertia - he would later build entire cinematic worlds on this notion (after gaining full auteurship).Especially striking is the first sight of no-man's land when the flare briefly illuminates a landscape from hell. Also a striking effect, on the macro scale, is the jarring relocation of the story from the obliterated battlefield to the court-martial in Schleissheim castle, a neo-Classical beauty."
elsinefilo,"Jul 12, 2006",N/A,"I have seen ""Paths of Glory"" after having learnt that it has similar similar themes and storyline to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"". After this one there are only two featured Kubrickian movies for me to be seen: Lolita and Barry Lyndon.Since these two movies were adapted from two known world classics one should first know the book before seeing the movies in my opinion.Paths of Glory is loosely based upon the true story of five soldiers who were prosecuted for the cowardice in the face of the enemy. The movies uses three soldiers for the storyline.On a time when the French and German army developed into a continuous line of heavily fortified trenches a selfish overambitious French general during World War I orders a regiment on a suicidal mission to take the Ant hill to get promotion he has been promised. When the soldiers are under constant artillery fire the regiment refuses to leave the trenches with the third of men are dead. The general's order to open fire on his own squad and his accusations of mutiny of the simple soldiers display how Paths of Glory,with a masterly finesse, is making a mockery of the idiocy of high-ranking officials in the army.It depicts the wanton characteristics of the homo sapiens who could just rule out his entire nation for his personal ambitions.Kirk Douglas as the Colonel Dax, who leads the soldiers in the attack and is the counsel of three soldiers before the court-martial is totally great. His lines and cross-examination in the farce court make a laughingstock of war,the judiciary system of the army and the ambitions of the ignorant higher-ups. After having seen this one and Full Metal Jacket I said to myself I wish Kubrick could have done more war movies instead of involving in film-noir or a space flick."
xNecRosex,"Dec 29, 2020",6/10,"I really wanted to like this more, for its time it's superb I guess...now retrospectively looking at Kubrick's career, this is not his best.

ragosaal,"Nov 2, 2006",9/10,"There's not much one can add here to what has been said regarding this excellent and classic War World I film based on actual facts.Perhaps just point out that in a brilliant cast (Kirk Douglas renders one of his best performances ever and George McReady his best), the one who steals the show is Adolph Menjou in my opinion.In his General Broulard character Menjou shows superb acting. He is a cynic and egocentric man who doesn't seem to care much about his men but a lot in his career and position, yet in his calm and at he same time strong manners he shows he will let some things pass but will not tolerate others. His meeting with Douglas while a party is going on downstairs is an acting class; he brilliantly avoids a serious conversation until he is told about MacReady's order to open fire against his own men. Menjou is perfect also when -while having lunch with Mac Ready- and with a sort of total lack of interest informs the man that there will be an inquire to judge for his behavior but you notice his eyes look clearly to see the other man's reaction and enjoy it. But mostly, in such a complex and unlikeable character (he goes along with the three soldiers shooting knowing perfectly it won't serve justice) his General Broulard transmits a sort of dignity and sympathy to the viewers.And incredibly natural performer, Menjou died 5 years after this film at age 73. A great actor indeed."
dworldeater,"May 1, 2020",9/10,"Paths Of Glory is Stanley Kubrick's brilliant anti war film that was in stark contrast to many of the more hawkish war movies that came out during that time. Also, this is one of the few films to be made that take place during WW1. This shows the grim reality of life in the trenches. This also shows how during war how sometimes ridiculous, suicidal orders come from high command and how some high ranking military brass value their own career advancement and image over what would seem to be in the best interest in their troops. Paths Of Glory shows how cheap life is, especially in a time of war and the futility of it all. Kirk Douglas is great as Col.Dax and is the moral center of the film and one Hell of a tough soldier. The themes of the film are still relavent in the modern world, especially in the military. Kubrick's film is timeless in the sense that this still holds up today and is a tremendous achievement and a really fantastic film."
Lejink,"Feb 17, 2010",8/10,"My dad always raved about this film and he was rarely if ever wrong in his opinion about movies so I finally settled down to watch it.It's self-evident that in the world in which we live, war films will always be topical and it can be difficult for film-makers to get across the requisite pacifist message with originality in an overcrowded field. Indeed I'm no great lover of war films per se, bludgeoned too much about the head I guess by the likes of John Wayne, Audie Murphy and others of that ilk too often over-simplifying the very complex human emotions which drive or in some cases hinder the ranks of ordinary men (and although not in this film, women) called up to fight for their country in the prime of their lives.Kubrick chooses to focus in on a seemingly minor uprising in the French army on the German Front in the First World War, which no doubt then, as now, would get buried away in the ""Classified"" files in case its exposure damaged troop morale but goes far deeper in analysing the actions of ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances with not all displaying what Hemingway termed grace under pressure. This is actually as it should be and draws the viewer's empathy as we see that all life truly is here in the fictional drama. As for the ivory-tower generals who unfeelingly treat their exhausted and dispirited underlings like sacrificial pawns to the slaughter, Kubrick delivers to them his greatest opprobrium, highlighting their self-serving, manipulative and downright callous traits, always passing the buck away from their desk.From several scenes which etch themselves deep in the memory, I'll highlight two for brevity's sake - firstly where Kubrick completes the lengthy and engrossing if dispiriting court-martial scene by cutting away from its expected climax by moving straight onto a scene with the now-condemned men already awaiting their execution - completely excising the clichéd verdict scene, so much of a foregone conclusion is it in the ""kangaroo court"" against which Kirk Douglas's character rages in vain. Kubrick then rounds off the film with the deeply moving extended scene where you fear for the safety of a captured pretty young German girl, made to sing for her supper and who knows what afterwards you fear, by a clamouring crowd of no doubt sex-starved troops, who with Douglas waiting outside to intercede, collectively draw back from the brink of primitivism as they one by one realise that this girl could be their daughter, sister or wife, as helplessly caught up in the madness of war as they are.The acting from top to bottom is terrific, Douglas brilliant in a non-action role, wholly immersed in his character's moral dilemma with George McReady and especially Adolphe Menjou, heretofore considered by me as a lightweight comedic actor, ably displaying the venality and shiftiness of the powers that be. The rest of the acting by Kubrick's ensemble as the battle-weary soldiers is also superb. The black and white cinematography hits home too in its convincing depiction of life in the trenches.This is a great film conveying the universal anti-war message with rare subtlety and conviction."
Echoes,"Feb 21, 1999",N/A,"I admire Kubrick for being able to create a movie in the Hollywood system that he was presented with. He made a movie that goes on a much deeper political and symbolic level that appears, but he made the movie that it would appeal to both senses of an audience that was looking for a great war film, and the audience that was looking for something deeper."
Angry_Arguer,"Aug 27, 2003",6/10,"While Paths of Glory is certainly one of Kubrick's best (it certainly ranks above The Shining and Full Metal Jacket), it is only an elaboration on the darker aspects of Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front.  Such concepts as cowardice, insubordination, and prejudice are thrown in to keep things different, but Kubrick can't help hiding that fact.Kirk Douglas never was a particularly varied or useful actor (Michael Douglas only continued that tradition) and here he is his usual maniacal self, only now we are supposed to sympathize with him.  Talk about the impossible.The camera is not as declarative as AQWF, but Kubrick takes some personal notes and tries to be one better through ""artistry"".  That doesn't quite cut it.Overall, watchable understanding of war's insanity.  Better than MASH and most other examples, on the level of Catch-22.  4 out of 5 stars."

broig383,"Jan 22, 2000",10/10,"This film is in the top 5 of the greatest war films of all time.  It is a film of great sadness, showing the harsh reality of war.  It tells a story of three soldiers who will be executed for no apparent reason except that they are chosen to be.  It shows the downfall of man, and how human kind as a whole is unable to understand each other.  This film will make you very angry, but you will realize that war is a conflict and not something that necessarily solves the world's problems."
Sir-Final_Thoughts-No_Review,"Sep 8, 2023",10/10,"I've seen A Clockwork Orange, I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey, Full Metal Jacket is my 3rd favorite movie of all time! Eyes Wide Shut, Barry Lyndon, Spartacus, and pieces of The Shining. That and Dr. Strangelove, The Killing and Lolita are the only ones I need to watch left.What I'm getting at is we all have a sense of what to expect from Stanley Kubrick's movies, an unparalleled and unique vision seemingly from an otherworldly perspective but definitely human. Wanna know where I think it starts? As early as 1957 in this brilliant black & white movie called Paths Of Glory.Kirk Douglas, a 40s and 50s favorite of mine is Colonel Dax, who during World War I unwillingly gets sent a direct order from his French Generals to claim an Ant Hill that's under heavy guard by the Germans. A clearly pointed out several times suicide mission, but nonetheless believed to be a turning point in winning the war for France. Despite objection, the Generals pressure Dax to carry out their orders, and he reluctantly accepts knowing full well himself that its a lost cause. That this was based on a true story is something in itself! WOW!That Kubrick developed the set up and framing and positioning of his shots so meticulously throughout this movie so young in life and his career is a testimony to his raw, natural talent. The atmosphere and uneasy tension he became known for is here on full display. The scene with the reconnaissance team, for example. Colonel Dax's walk through the troops, especially in black & and white, is all world foreshadowing of what's to come. His obsession with mentally deranged characters with no remorse and his awesome use of music to build suspense, its all here. I can't praise this movie enough especially for Kubrick fans.The acting from EVERYONE is top rate stuff, really magnificent! A nice split for many of the fine actors here to get a chance to shine. I loved it! For a war/anti-war film, even for 1957 this feels slightly ahead of its time. Its made and paced unlike other war films of the 50s, another nod to Kubrick displaying his mastery again. The script was wonderfully written and offered alot for him to play with. No weak spots in my opinion, a really solid ending, and certainly rewatchable. A compelling work of art."
Jethro_Clampett,"Oct 23, 2003",9/10,"awesome actors story.   brilliantly directed.   strongly beside the shining, clockwork and strangelove as his best films.   choosing paths of glory in an argument as his best work ever is a safe choice.  more obviously than the killing his genius as a filmmaker is on full display for the first time."
Bobbyh-2,"Mar 5, 2003",N/A,"For me, the most compelling thing about this film is that is is based on actual occurrences: French troops did refuse to attack at one point during this most insane and pointless of wars. The movie certainly makes no attempt to be objective--and why on earth should it? From the perspective of the 21st century, it is hard to imagine a more immoral and outrageous event than World War One--in which an entire generation of several nations was led to slaughter for no detectable reason, except the pique of a group of so-called Great Nations whose era was deservedly coming to an end. Though I cannot comment authoritatively on how realistic the war scenes or the military protocol is--nor, I suspect, can anyone else living in this day--I found the battle scenes devastating, the dialogue often riveting, and the final scene extremely affecting. It would be best to see this film on a big screen, but it's worth seeing however you can. Kubrick might not have attained full mastery of his craft when he made this one, but he was still head and shoulders above most of his contemporaries. I have a slight preference for Grand Illusion as a film about the insanity of war, but this runs it a respectably close second."
paulclaassen,"Mar 2, 2024",7/10,"'Paths of Glory' is not so much a war movie as it is a court room drama. It's a bit of both almost in equal proportions, and captivating throughout. In a time before CGI, the battle scenes had to be done practically on location. These scenes are so well done, and realistic. The film's sound and lighting are very good, as well.Set during World War 1, General Paul Mireau (George Macready) is ordered to take Anthill, which is defended by the Germans. Mireau visits the trenches and orders Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) to take Anthill, even if it means half the men in his regiment might die.Mireau turns out to be an antagonist far worse than the enemy, when he orders the artillery to shoot on their own men to force them onto the battlefield, even though the mission is clearly a failure. To pass the blame for his failure, he orders 100 men chosen at random to be court-martialed for insubordination and cowardice in the face of the enemy. Dax convinces him to reduce the number to only three men.Three men are chosen at random and the film then proceeds with the court case, with Dax trying to defend them. Every time I watch a war movie, I realize the incredible and unnecessary loss of lives. In many instances - as illustrated here - men with authority were responsible for many deaths. Thought-provoking indeed."
brad-draper,"Jul 27, 2004",10/10,"""Paths of Glory"" is one of those movies that movie making is all about. It is one of director Stanley Kubrick's earliest movies, indeed, it is his first really important film, and it is a masterpiece.Today, little is known amongst the general public regarding World War I, the great war, the war to end all wars. I study this conflict because, quite frankly, this war defines how the 20th century will evolve, World War II is merely a continuance of the first war, and the Cold War another chapter of the previous.The film is based on a book by Humphrey Cobb which I have to say, I have not read, a situation I will soon rectify. The story is about this French army regiment's failed attempt to capture a worthless position called the ""ant hill."" The attempt is doomed from the start. Generals are embarrassed and examples must be made in the form of three innocent French soldiers, court martialed for cowardliness and sentenced to death by a kangaroo court.Douglas plays these hapless men's regiment commander, and then their lawyer for defense. But every thing is rigged and so, the three men are finally shot by firing squad. Kirk Douglas' role is in a word inspired, and you can see Spartacus in his future in that intense gaze and strong dimpled chin.But the film is so much more than this thread on injustice that binds scene after scene. It is more about the experience of the everyday combat soldiers trench warfare and senseless battle that marked World War I as the first of so many senseless wars of the 20th century, and finally it is about the commander's ego at the expense of the dog faced soldier.This is an outstanding film. Four stars all the way. The writing, the acting, and the scene structure are all compelling. This is the definitive World War I movie, a subject that film gives little credence to today. It is in ultra silver black and white and filmed in a close up aspect ratio of the classic 1.33 to 1. Wide screen is what it is, but Stanley Kubrick knows the value of intimacy in regards to the original theatrical format, that all TVs use today.I got this fairly new released MGM DVD for 10 bucks at the local big book store the other day. It is truly cinematic drama at a bargain. I know I will watch it again and again.Recommended highly as high film art."
carefulwriter,"Jan 16, 2025",7/10,"Classic film from a good filmmaker. In 1916 in the French trenches, three soldiers are court-martialled for cowardice by officers who want to use their case to instil discipline into the ranks. Paths Of Glory is an incisive melodrama chiefly depicting the corruption and incompetence of the high command; the plight of the soldiers is less interesting. The trench scenes are unforgettably vivid, and the rest is shot in genuine castles, with resultant difficulties of lighting and recording; the overall result is an overpowering piece of cinema.It could have been more faith-based as many soldiers came to Christ, but still lessons learned."
Chrimle,"Dec 2, 2020",5/10,"A well paced movie, despite many shots being unnecessarily long and not directly progressing the story. The story is simple and well established, the only issue is the various characters having similar names - and are often confused when their role were not mentioned. It certainly had the potential to be a lot more emotional, but unfortunately, the characters were completely flat and not at all familiar before it was over. Even though it shows moral dilemmas from difference perspectives, the conclusion was very underwhelming..."
deniz_235,"Dec 30, 2024",8/10,"""Paths of Glory"" is truly one of the films that captures the war atmosphere excellently. The decisions made by the characters feel very realistic, and it's clear that a lot of thought has been put into the development of these characters. The film is a strong contender against modern-day war films (such as Dunkirk). Additionally, the film is straightforward and easy to understand, with an ideal runtime. Compared to other Kubrick films, it's surprisingly clear and accessible.The direction and cinematography, typical of Kubrick's style, effectively convey the brutal nature of war and the harshness of military authority. The music and sound design also enhance the tense atmosphere, pulling the audience further into the film. The depth of the story, exploring human nature and the devastating effects of war, offers not only action but also an emotional and psychological experience.Highly recommended for anyone interested in films that balance action and deep storytelling."
Arriflex1,"Nov 8, 2013",10/10,"PATHS OF GLORY: Here, Kubrick establishes an important thematic component that is present in many of his great films. The idea of entrenched authority answerable only to itself and running amok with cruel insensitivity would seem like the fearful concerns of a paranoiac except that Kubrick is informed by reality. The film is named after and based on Humphrey Cobb's 1935 novel which was based on actual events, making Kubrick's depiction of the sadistic generals unassailable. Their ill-advised forays into the battlefield are horrifying. When their folly turns into unimaginable tragedy we enter the realm of the demented. Willing to maintain their status and power at a terrible human cost the depraved military leaders persecute brave men who are guilty only of following orders. From a moral stance, the viewer is poised to watch hopefully as one man steps forward to begin the search for truth and the fight for justice.Maintaining status and power despite the human toll; Kubrick gives this subject a thorough and unflinching examination in PATHS OF GLORY and it would be a topic he would scrutinize more than once with fierce intensity. In SPARTACUS (1960) the cruelty of Roman might seeks to strangle human freedom. In DR. STRANGELOVE (1964), a deranged general (again the military) strives for purity of essence by driving mankind to the brink of doom. And perhaps most chillingly, in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), a nearly ""human"", all- controlling computer, evolves into a homicidal entity determined to preserve the integrity of a space mission by eliminating ""human error"".The validity and impact of PATHS OF GLORY is underscored by its twenty year ban by the French government. The film is a seamless melding of technique (the dolly shots of Kirk Douglas in the trenches are remarkable for their power), storytelling (the script is highly charged but not hysterical), and beautifully nuanced performances (McCready and Menjou are utterly dynamic; Douglas gives his outrage a perfectly modulated naturalism). Kubrick's emotional passion is unalloyed by his intellectual cool in this film. And that fact makes PATHS OF GLORY my favorite of all the director's work. Recommended: Lewis Milestone's ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (1930)."

zurdulla,"Aug 5, 2022",10/10,Great movie with amazing atmosphere. The film touches on topics such as fake patriotism and injustice. The main characters are well written and their motives too. In my opinion this is Kubrick's best film.
gavin6942,"Mar 13, 2010",7/10,"General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) of the French General Staff asks his subordinate, General Mireau (George Macready), to send his division on a suicidal mission to take a well-defended German position called the ""Anthill"". Mireau initially advises against the attack, citing the low probability of success and the danger to his beloved soldiers, but when General Broulard mentions the possibility of a promotion, Mireau quickly convinces himself the attack will succeed.In a sense, this film anticipates ""Hamburger Hill"", with the military's focus on one impossible task. Though, I don't think this film is historically accurate, and they don't really seem too concerned when they don't make it.The theme seems to be glory over pragmatism, over perhaps glory versus pragmatism. To achieve glory, the soldiers have to accept a mission that will surely lead to their death. From the point of view of the officers (who command but don't fight), glory is an easy choice. But pragmatism, choosing the best option at the moment, is seen as cowardice, despite saving the lives of the men and having them alive to fight another day. In war, who wins this struggle?Kirk Douglas is excellent as Dax, excellent during the trial scene, which I saw as the pivotal part. Along with Douglas, I have to single out Timothy Carey, who made the scene great, and was also excellent in ""The Killing"". (Carey went on to be one of Hollywood's great character actors, and the man behind ""The World's Greatest Sinner"".)Last but not least, this film showcases Kubrick's hot wife... it's no surprise that he was attracted to her, and they had many years of marriage... presumably happy."
TevildoVardoMeiota,"May 11, 2004",9/10,"A plausible antiwar film,  considered a top film at imdb and theyshoot pictures.com (229 out of 1000 on their list), but snubbed by the AFI's top 100, despite being called a ""miracle"" by Jonathan RosenbaumWhy?  Its about how a grave injustice is carried out because of political expediency.  Made somewhat more believable by casting it in the French Army in WW1 (where in that legal system the presumption was guilty until proven innocent), and perhaps to partly side step the blatant antiwar message for Hollywood bankrollers and the American Audience. A futile attack is engineered playing on the ambitions of an unscrupulous officer, and when the attack on a strong enemy position, with a depleted force, is predictably repulsed, scapegoats are identified to be tried for cowardice.  Not only a good performance by Kirk Douglas as the righteously indignant defense attorney, but the villains in the film are totally despicable, which they are supposed to be. Kubrick's portrayal of trench warfare is every bit as good as All Quiet on the Western Front,  and his contrasting of the  circumstances of the officers' lives and of the bizarre trial standing next to the brutality of the war and the insanity of the majority of the frontal assaults is pure Kubrick.  One sees the seeds of Dr. Strangelove."
paul2001sw-1,"Dec 27, 2020",6/10,"'Paths of Glory' is an early film by Stanley Kubrick, a depiction of the indifference to human life shown by the generals in World War One. Kirk Douglas plays the lead, and his resemblance to his son Michael is striking. It's competent, but straightforward, lacking the formal innovation of his earlier film 'The Killing' and his later work. Nothing that happens really surprises, except perhaps for the total absence of any redemption in the ending. But watch 'Dr. Strangelove' instead for a true glimpse of genius."
iamingozi,"Jul 9, 2006",9/10,"Everyone else will tell you about the story over and over again. So I won't need to do that. But, what description I'll give is one in its most simplistic form. One that summarizes the overall feeling, because to put into words such emotion for each scene is not possible. You will understand what I mean once you see this masterpiece of heartache. For it is just as impossible to put into words the emotions of any soldier during wartime. I should point out that I saw this movie on an old B/W set and give my review from this standpoint. To me it was seeing this movie minus the color that really maked it stand out. What makes it timeless. Anyway, to give you a feel for this movie here is one simple sentence. Black and white, and red throughout."
mattw21,"Feb 12, 1999",10/10,"I think that perhaps the most important element of this film is the basic ambiguity of the conclusion. We aren't told what happens to Dax following his tirade to the general, and so forth. The film thusfar has portrayed the politics of the army, but at the end the politics are left hanging.This isn't the only film where Kubrick does this. 2001 especially relies on the unresolved conclusion, and so does Dr. Strangelove. In all three of these films, this manner of concluding allows the underlying themes of the film to transcend the specific characters. As in 2001, the characters themselves carry little importance as people, they're just bound up in a situation, and the situation more than the characters or the plot is what's important to the film."
h-28658,"Apr 8, 2020",8/10,"Paths Of Glory is a one of a kind war film. I love the anti-war theme, Kirk Douglas' performance, long shot takes, cinematography, and story. I also enjoyed the finale when the German singer, played by Stanley Kubrick's wife, sang and every French soldier got sad at the end. Overall, Paths of Glory is a WW1 masterpiece filled with horror and guilt."
Jim Crotts,"May 14, 2000",10/10,"I have nothing to offer that hasn't already been said about this magnificent and powerful film. I will suggest one thought. What elevates PATHS OF GLORY to such heights is not the answers it gives(really none)but rather that it manages so clearly to pose, frame and context the right questions. Answers are easy, and most often wrong. Genius consist largely in finding the right questions. Well done, Stanley. Thank you!"
alibrahim1,"Feb 10, 2025",9/10,"Truly a GREAT movie! Kubrick Masterpiece.Really illustrates the nature of power, corruption, and the dehumanization of soldiers. It's a true story, conveyed amazingly by Kubrick.Unlike traditional war films that glorify heroism and sacrifice, Kubrick's approach Paths of glory differentlyHe shows what happened during world war 1, and in wars generallyy within the military. .. The abuse of power from the leaders and the futility of war and injustice/corruption that occurs.Kubrick's directing is one of the film's strongest aspects. Kirk Douglas delivers a powerful performance as Colonel Dax, showing great emotions of moral integrity and frustration from corruption and how the leaders scape goated their soldiers to save their selves. Unlike the arrogant and detached generals, Dax is a man of principle. Also, nothing matters, war continuous and atrocities continue and the corrupt people are powerful. (when they return to the frontlines in the end).Also, the supporting actors were great (the generals)! Their cold and manipulative performance makes the viewer despise them.One of the greatest it anti-war movies! Directing by kubrick, acting and storyline."
Hildebrando_Martins_Almeida,"Sep 9, 2006",10/10,"Notices for the editors: I don't know how to write in English language. This text was translated by electronic translator of the Portuguese for English.The best film produced by the star Douglas through its called producer Bryna (homage to its mother, that had that name). A superb text (it pays attention in the excellent dialogs), capable to move perhaps to the most insensitive of the military ones.In just 87 minutes, makes an implacable attack to the militarism, to the foolishness of the wars, to the cowardice, cynicism and incompetence of official. So deep in the accusation that the film was forbidden of being exhibited in France by several years. Without doing any concession to the commercial movies, the subject is been in a serious and contusing way.The direction of Kubrick is exquisite  the only moment in that he failed and it allowed that the history was touching, it is in the end when the soldiers hear the German singer (interpreted by the wife of Kubrick). The cast is blameless, with special prominence for Adolphe Menjou, in the paper of cynic general Broulard. The only actor that doesn't have a good acting as the others is Timothy Carey, that makes the cowardly soldier in the hour of the shooting. My favorite scene is that in that colonel Dax is disgusted and he riots before the indecent proposal of general Broulard.Even if you don't appreciate the gender, this film it is to be seen, reviews, debated and never to be forgotten. With a realistic and antiwar history, ""Paths of Glory"" is a rarity in the history of the movies, because difficultly somebody will answer that this production is an authentic masterpiece."
glgioia,"Aug 2, 2003",N/A,"A suicide assault that fails miserably in the trench combat of World War I, leads to the unjust court martial of 3 soldiers, who if found guilty are to be made examples and executed for cowardice.The brilliance of this film clearly is in the camerawork. It can't be beat. I can't decide however, whether I love the story, or hate it. The clash of the old and modern world is really what the Great War was fought over, or better put what prompted its outbreak. You have the old guard in the film, the 2 elderly generals, representing the 19th century remnants of the Napoleonic age, clashing with ideals of 20th century modern man, Kirk Douglas. And I do believe to a certain extent struggles like this were commonplace during this tumultuous period of history. But in the film, they were both ends overly caricatured if not satirized. Douglas's character seems, anachronistically speaking, out of place, more so than the old guard. Almost as if he's a lost time traveler trying to reason concepts that those inhabiting the time he is visiting have no possible way of yet comprehending. Representation of fact, probably not, but it is well written and extremely well acted. Even Douglas is outstanding. For the overwhelmingly positive hype it receives, I was somewhat surprised and decidedly letdown by its transformation from a combat action film into a courtroom drama. Not that it's slow, but I was totally eating up the action and was left wanting more. I still have to put All Quiet ahead of this, since it sticks to the facts and reports the action rather than passes judgment over war, by injecting a fictitious criminal justice proceeding, and making the good guys so to speak, the bad. We don't exactly need this to know that War is preventable calamity. The action, if done well enough, which it was here, will invariably slam that message home with authority. I'm afraid that in the end, this film leaves an after taste of rather naive and rather outdated idealism. But its quality, and worth a watch."
someokiedude,"Aug 3, 2020",10/10,"""...and you can go to hell before I apologize to you now or ever again!""We often see directors playing with their obsessions within their work, as well as with authors. Like with Scorsese's fascination in broken, flawed characters and Catholic guilt, or with The Coens in finding the humor in intense, dark situations, or Refn with his fascination in the perverse and deviance. But as long as we can keep finding new ways to tell these stories in a different way, then we're not just simply treading water.Where I find the most fascination in Kubrick is how he manages to make his films completely different from his last, how he rarely rehashes anything, even going as far as to rarely have reoccurring collaborators on his filmography, with some notable exceptions. Even when he'd return to certain genres, he made it a point to never repeat himself. As in Full Metal Jacket, he approaches the subject of war with sardonic, bitter humor, satirizing the dehumanization of man in war, while in Paths of Glory, he approaches war in a much more straight forward angle, while retaining the bitterness that would inform Full Metal Jacket.Many have accused Kubrick of being nihilistic, misanthropic, and cynical, and if there's anything Paths of Glory would prove, it is that these accusations are nonsense. Kubrick often protested accusations that he was misanthropic, often claiming that despite his more cynical approach in some of his films, that there is a sympathy and love for humanity to be found, if you decide to look. It makes me go back to Emerson's aphorism about greatness being misunderstood, and I've found that it can be done willingly so. Paths of Glory is Kubrick's most passionate film, it is him at his angriest, while also showing him at his most human. It is also the film where Kubrick began to come into his own as a filmmaker and establishing his signature style. We even see some of his sardonic humor come in with the title itself being a bitter irony.But what elevates Paths of Glory to one of Kubrick's masterpieces is the acting. Kirk Douglas is incredible in this film playing Colonel Dax, the everyman who wants to do the right thing, but is left unable to. Douglas plays Dax with a sense of conviction and vigor, but also with weariness and a longing to see this war end. His passionate tirade near the end of the film is one that emotionally impacted me, and it's probably my favorite scene of the entire movie, asides from the other really great scene at the end of the movie. Adophe Menjou and George Macready are also excellent as the shady commanding officers, ones who inspire anger in the audience in their callousness and detachment from the lives of the men who carry out their orders.Much like The Conversation, The Proposition, or Chinatown, much of what makes Paths of Glory so powerful is the sense of failure that is felt by the end of the film. Dax, much like Harry Caul, is forced to live with the consequences of his failure and the guilt that he'll likely encounter for the rest of his life. But also we see the failure of the commanders to realize that their soldiers are human beings as well, and the failure of the soldiers to realize their own humanity, until the end when they rediscover it using a song. If there is a main theme of Paths of Glory, it's failure and the consequences of failure, it is also about the loss of humanity in war, but how sometimes humanity can be found when we come together.In the end, as with all great works, it is a journey that you and the artist share, one that should connect us to our world and come away with our own insights. But it also shows us that humanity can surely be found in a place that has lost semblance of it.""Well, give the men a few minutes more, Sergeant."""
PWNYCNY,"Oct 22, 2005",6/10,"This is a great movie. The story is compelling, the acting powerful, the theme sublime. This movie is about how the individual person can be reduced to the level of a mere statistic, a mere dot on somebody's organizational plan, a mere object to be sacrificed and never be missed by those in charge, who have their own personal agendas and will do ANYTHING to avoid taking responsibility when things go wrong. A military operation fails, and the general in charge is angry and he will not be the one stuck with the blame. As far as this general is concerned, the soldiers are a bunch of lazy, cowardly slackers who don't want to fight - even though the soldiers are dying by the thousands. But that is of no concern to the general who wants to blame someone for the failed operation because if the general takes responsibility he will be revealed for what he is: an egocentric, incompetent martinet who is interested in only one thing - furthering his career at the expense of the soldiers under his command. To pursue that selfish goal, this general will throw away the lives of the soldiers entrusted to him. This movie stars Kirk Douglas. But the real star of this movie is Adolph Menjou who plays the French general. On July 1, 1916, the British lost over 57,000 men killed or wounded while the Germans lost 8,000, with no appreciable gains, tactically or strategically. What an extravagant squandering of human life. But the generals in charge, who did the squandering, lived to fight another day."
Seraphion,"Aug 25, 2014",3/10,"Honestly I don't get the meaning of the story the movie is trying to deliver. The opening talk about the order to carry out the assault takes too much duration and done simply quite about stupidly. The trench scenes are done quite adequately nice considering the technology at the time of the movie's production. It has a nice effort of sound effects. But the story just goes on and on without any real focus, from the talks, to the half baked assault scene where there were no German seen, to the court marshal. Besides the story building talks up front, the sequences show only failures, cheats, treacheries and stupidity. Kirk Douglas is the only actor doing a decent job in this movie. His character is the only one enduring the story quite unscathed. For me, the lack of sufficient technology made the assault sequence quite stupid, where the soldiers just drop dead without shown any blood splattered or bullet wounds opening up."
I_Ailurophile,"Apr 11, 2023",10/10,"It speaks volumes about how well a film is written and made that sharp, vivid depictions of battle violence are nearly the least interesting part of its ninety minutes. It says more still that the best value a film represents, despite unremitting excellence all around, is in its dialogue and characterizations, and the themes that surface therefrom. To say that this picture is anti-war is wildly insufficient - it's also a scathing, wholesale condemnation of the military, its command structure, its rules and strictures, and its bloviating bluster; of the so-called civilian oversight of the military that graciously awards perceived triumphs and sweeps failures and faults under the rug; of the self-serving way those in power cling recklessly to it, leeches on a bloated corpse, and expects, rewards, and encourages like corruption in others; of any system that would hang a sword over a person's head, answer to the beck and call of arbitrary rules and procedures and the whims of those in power, and yet dare to append ""justice"" anywhere to its name; of the unending lies and abject inhumanity upon which military decisions, and power generally, are made; the empty pretenses upon which respect for all such institutions are predicated; the harmful and outmoded gender norms that are detrimental to men (as much as they are to women, non-binary or gender non-conforming individuals, and so on); and more. To watch 'Paths of glory' is to feel one's blood boil, not because all such condemnations go too far, but because they are entirely just.This is barely beginning to even speak of the movie, however. Those early action sequences are executed with outstanding, jarring sound, special effects, and set pieces, as incredible as anything cinematic portrayals of war have given us; if anything the imagery to present at that point simply isn't filthy and grisly enough. At all times Georg Krause's cinematography is exquisitely crisp, smooth, and vibrant, meshing with the same masterful qualities in Stanley Kubrick's direction, his orchestration of every shot and scene. Such keen eyes are matched by the superb craftsmanship of all others behind the scenes, from production design and art direction to costume design, hair, and makeup, the shrewd editing of Eva Kroll, and more. The cast give terrific performances; of course Kirk Douglas stands out most, demonstrating that despite his son's reputation he remains the superior actor, but George Macready, Ralph Meeker, Wayne Morris, and all the rest are just as swell.Finely made as 'Paths of glory' is across the board, still it's the writing that stands out like a beacon. The adapted screenplay whipped up between Kubrick and co-writers Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson is rich and absorbing, laying the foundation for a viewing experience that's as captivating as it is infuriating. There are a couple points where the feature lags ever so slightly as we're given a pause between heavy dramatic beats, but these are so marginal that they're far, far outshone by the magnificence the title otherwise boasts. The dialogue is biting, and downright searing; tremendous care was poured into every scene, no matter the tenor, to make each as full and impactful as it could be. The characters may not be written with all the utmost complexity of real people, but that's rather suitable for the forthright, commentative tack of the picture, and nevertheless there are depths to each: the assemblage ranges from utterly despicable villains, to (presumably) good people being misdirected, coerced, and exploited, to honorable men put in an unenviable position. All this feeds into a narrative that's pointedly bleak but unreservedly entrancing as all these elements come together, and the result is just fantastic.I don't think this is entirely what I was expecting. Entering with no foreknowledge, I had it in my mind that the court martial would represent a larger portion of the runtime; even as the film first began early scenes left me a tad doubtful, uncertain of what I had committed to. Any such concerns quickly melt away, however, as from top to bottom this is shaped with marvelous intelligence and skill in every capacity, not to mention obdurate, unyielding intent. Esteemed, nigh legendary filmmaker that Kubrick was, it's hard to go wrong with anything he's made, and still this might be one of the greatest credits to his name. One way or another, make no mistake, 'Paths of glory' is an essential classic, a movie that earns a strong, enthusiastic blanket recommendation. Wherever you might have the opportunity check it out, this is very much worth anyone's time."
theognis2,"Sep 17, 2022",10/10,"This, the greatest war movie ever made, and one of the ten greatest movies ever made, perfectly conveys the vanity of the officer class and the general indifference to the welfare of those that they lead in realizing their war gaming. The screenplay by the great Jim Thompson is perfect as are the camera placements and staging of former still photographer, Stanley Kubrick. The dramatic structure is tight as a drum; not a single shot is wasted. This was one of the earliest of Kirk Douglas's magnificent credits as a producer. He has never given a better performance, nor produced a film with more astute casting: Ralph Meeker as a tough, decent man caught in a trap, Adolph Menjou as the effete cynic in charge of the army, George Macready as his mercurial and ambitious subordinate, Tim Carey as the odd ""social undesirable,"" Joseph Turkel as the emotional core of the prisoners, Bert Freed as the coolly practical peasant Sergeant, Wayne Morris as the coward, Peter Capell as the casually psychopathic judge, Richard Anderson as the bootlicker, Susanne Christian (soon to be Mrs. Kubrick) as the bashful German girl offered to a mob of soldiers by the barkeep/pimp Jerry Hausner, and, flagrantly against type, Emile Meyer as the kindly, compassionate priest. The editing is brilliantly designed to shock and the magnificent dramatic structure (screenplay by the unique, great Jim Thompson here and for ""The Killing"" (1956)) ensures maximum suspense despite the inevitable. This film was so great, so powerful that it was banned in France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and US military installations. Truth hurts."
Stargrazingreviews,"Aug 27, 2022",9/10,"A devestating study of human cruelty in the face of war and justice with enough tonal and genre shifts in 90s minutes to fill most directors entire anthologies. There is simply no other director who ever lived who could possibly produce anything as complex, taught, tense, riveting and ultimately heartbreaking as Paths of Glory with the technology available in the 1950s. Part court(marshall)room drama part war epic with trench warfare sequences to rival those produced 70 years later Paths reins supreme as a mastery of script and production and truly stands amongst the greatest films of its era, director and genre. Kirk Douglas provides the emphatic heart of the story with a powerhouse performance as the commanding officer/ defence attorney for a group of soldiers accused of cowardice in the face of a suicide mission which lays the groundwork for a thesis on the fight between justice and power which will inevitably leave viewers almost seven decades later with wet eyes glued to the screen in the closing chapters."
adamschretz,"Nov 16, 2021",10/10,This film by Stanley Kubrick is an absolute masterpiece. It's about a total unnecessary battle in WW1. It has a strong message about the nonsense of war and waste of human life. Furthermore the characters were great and the pacing was good. I have nothing to complain.
arstauff,"Dec 9, 2008",10/10,"When the bulk of our generation thinks of black and white movies, we instantly imagine a largely boring experience, filmed on a set with a painted background, with tiresome monologues given by stiff actors and actresses. The movie Paths of Glory (1957) proves these stereotypes wrong and is perhaps more enjoyable than many modern films.Paths of Glory (PG), directed by Stanley Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut), is a story set in World War I era France. It documents a French military exploit that is doomed from its conception. The protagonist, Colonel Dax, played by Kirk Douglas(Gunfight at the OK Corral), is given the task of attacking a heavily-fortified German position, the anthill, by his commander General Paul Mireau, George Macready(Commandoes Strike at Dawn). General Mireau decides to issue this insane order after he is tempted with a promotion. The attack ultimately fails and General Mireau wishes to blame his ""cowardly"" troops for the loss. He has three men court-marshaled for cowardice (Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel, and Tim Carey). It is then Dax's job to defend them against the biased French military command. The movie gives an insightful snapshot of the Great War that was never attempted by any other film, modern or old, and also contains very strong anti-authority/ anti-war messages purposefully intended by Kubrick.The filming techniques that Kubrick uses in this movie are unique for the time of its filming. When I first saw this movie, I was convinced that it was a modern film, done in black and white for dramatic effect, but I later discovered it was produced in the 1950's. Kubrick breaks away from tradition and gives very personal close-ups of the characters in the film. This method shows the actor's emotion in great detail, and adds to the complexity of the film. Kubrick added subtle details to his scenes, like shooting the commanders from a low angle during the battle scene, which gives them an appearance of gods looking out over their creation. He also adds shadows in the office of the cowardly and drunk Lieutenant Roget (Wayne Morris), to make him even more villainous. There is also great use of eye-line match while both General Mireau and Colonel Dax are walking through the trenches, which adds to the realism of the movie. The eye-line match also gives the viewer a picture of all the various soldiers in their different forms of apprehension before the battle.The age of this film does not harm its appearance. Unlike many black and white films, this one was filmed entirely on location. Kubrick paid much attention to detail. He even created a very convincing no-man's land in a German farm field. The court martial takes place at Schleissheim Palace in Munich, Germany, which adds great character to the film and shows the viewer the decadence of the French high command compared to the regular officers. The costumes for the film are very authentic for the time, Kubrick even made sure to have the regimental numbers on the soldiers collars. There was no detail left unnoticed in this movie, and it gives me all the more reason to like it.Kubrick restrained himself in the use of music, there is little sound track other than a march, which opens the film. He does have a great use of drums for suspense, during a night patrol scene in which three characters go out into no-man's land. The last scene, however, contains a very beautiful song. It is sung by Christiane Harlan, who later married Kubrick. The scene has little to do with the plot of the movie, but I feel adds greatly to the films effect. It takes place in a dirty bar, where Harlan is a captured German civilian, who sings a native song to the French officers on leave. When the soldiers jeers and taunts turn to silence and tears, it creates a very moving scene.The characters in the movie are not well-developed and little is given about their background, however, I feel it does not ruin the story. The actors all give great reactions to their situations that I feel are very realistic and honest. There are many moving scenes in this film, the court martial being one of them. Kubrick also adds many subtle details, like having wounded troops pass behind General Mireau while he is laughing.Overall, this film is largely overlooked by the public and should be considered to be one of the great movies of the 1950's. Paths of Glory presents a realistic and enjoyable movie experience, and presents a very stunning picture of authority and war that can relate to any time. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to watch a very moving film. I give this movie 10 out of 10."
whatcanmakemy22,"Jan 9, 2025",7/10,"Great classic. PATHS OF GLORY also features from of Kubrick's best use of tracking shots outside of THE SHINING, with Douglas stone-faced marching through the trenches ahead of battle (a nice contrast to when the cowardly general walks the same trenches earlier in the film). Douglas chews the scenery like the Hollywood royalty he is and shows up every actor he shares a scene with. Oddball character actor Timothy Carey (a personal favorite) is the only other actor who comes close to stealing a scene from Douglas, playing one of the soldiers on trial (Watch Carey's film he wrote, directed, and starred in, THE WORLD'S GREATEST SINNER, to see how offbeat he really could be!). Ralph Meeker has never been better playing one of the soldiers on trial. The third soldier on trial is played by Joe Turkel, best known as Lloyd in Kubrick's THE SHINING and Dr. Eldon Tyrell in BLADE RUNNER. George Macready is deliciously slimy as the ambitious general who's willing to climb the ranks even at the expense of hundreds of his men's lives."
richardchatten,"Aug 5, 2025",10/10,"From his amateur film 'Fear and Desire' Stanley Kubrick commanded an important position in the history of the war film, and 'Paths of Glory' marked a further step in his rise to critical prominence.Filmed in Munich with a German crew and starting with a battle sequence shot in classic Kubrick style; setting it in the French army during WWI already set it well apart from conventional Hollywood heroics."
Falko_h1,"Jun 25, 2024",7/10,"""Paths of Glory,"" directed by Stanley Kubrick and released in 1957, is a powerful anti-war film set during World War I. The movie delves into the harrowing realities of trench warfare and the moral complexities faced by soldiers and commanders alike. Kirk Douglas stars as Colonel Dax, a principled officer who stands up against the senseless orders of his superiors, highlighting the stark contrast between the men in the trenches and the detached generals.Kubrick's direction is masterful, utilizing stark black-and-white cinematography to enhance the grim atmosphere. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing viewers to absorb the weight of the soldiers' plight. The performances are compelling, with Douglas delivering a standout performance filled with intensity and conviction.While ""Paths of Glory"" is a critical examination of the futility of war and the corrupting influence of power, some might find its bleakness overwhelming. The film's unflinching portrayal of military injustice can be challenging to watch, but it remains a poignant and thought-provoking piece of cinema. Its historical significance and thematic depth make it a noteworthy film, even if its heavy subject matter might not appeal to everyone."
StevenKeys,"Apr 27, 2020",5/10,"There must've been many disappointed movie goers exiting theaters on Christmas nite, 1957, when Paths of Glory was released nationally in the US, they having expected an action packed army flick at their premiere, for its focus is not combat in the field but at headquarters. While its message on callous command in war is laudable, director Stan Kubrick neglected the first rule in movie making (Bacon): you must visual a picture people want to watch, i.e., you must service the public's need for a degree of pleasure, whatever the subject matter (See; Platoon, GWTW, Das Boot, All Quiet, Patton, Sands, The Searchers) or, you make a documentary. In time, Stan would come to appreciate this tenet (Dr Strangelove). And it's worth bearing this in mind when your General anger begins to build, just as Kirk's begins to blow: the cold tactics employed in the Great War by leaders who were typically far removed from the dying, followed a long tradition going back centuries, one that cared little for the fighting man's chance of survival. That doesn't make Broulard right, but it does make him human (2.5/4)."
SPZMaxinema,"Feb 19, 2022",9/10,"The ending of this movie and the symbolism of it, along with the drama and acting throughout the movie, made me care about it very much. It seems like only the good things that are seen as the most threateningly influential get censored and banned like this movie has been in the past under many jurisdictions, but it is important for people to see of all nationalities. Absolutely astounding!"
drqshadow-reviews,"Jun 9, 2024",9/10,"An early passion project from writer/director Stanley Kubrick, Paths of Glory was a troubled and unlikely film from the beginning. After he paired critical success with box office disappointment in The Killing, MGM was anxious to score a hit with the nascent director. His suggestion, a fictionalized courtroom account of a true WWI incident, wasn't quite what they had in mind. A moderately successful book some twenty years prior, its first adaptation was such a Broadway flop that every studio in Hollywood turned their noses at the forthcoming screenplay. Kubrick was rebuffed, too, until a behind-the-scenes shakeup and a high-profile benefactor presented him with an opportunity. Bolstered by new bosses at MGM and the support of a big-time star in Kirk Douglas, he managed just enough clout to get the thing made. And the end result? Another critical triumph cut with middling returns.Paths of Glory isn't the kind of production that sells a lot of tickets. Its curt honesty doesn't allow for happy outcomes, and its vocal distrust of the state made far more enemies than friends back in the jingoistic days of 1957. In fact, the film's progressive views on war, military leadership and political justice earned it a spot on the blacklist in many countries, which can't have helped its profits. Never mind that its agenda was based in fact - a messy 1915 affair in which the French army executed four random soldiers as an example - as the Cold War ramped up, diplomatic allegiances carried more weight than morality. Germany withheld the film's release for two years and Spain nixed it for almost thirty. Switzerland banned it out of sheer sympathy for their French allies.So, did it really merit that much fuss? Maybe. It's certainly a powerful film, with an effective message that confidently speaks against the establishment. Countless numbers of powerful men, coats lined with medals, meet in lush, comfortable environs to discuss both the fate of their troops and their own overdue promotions. They're mirrored by rows of aspiring middle-managers in the field; layer upon layer of miserable, self-serving opportunists who specialize in casting blame, not accepting it. Douglas plays the only sensible one in the bunch (or, at least, the only one with a modicum of power), talking down a vindictive general and personally defending the unlucky condemned in kangaroo court before venting a career's worth of frustrations at the film's climax. I'm sure there were still many higher-ups in office who recognized themselves in these characters and felt some discomfort. I wouldn't be surprised if they flexed a little muscle to rid themselves of the embarrassment.Which is a shame, because it robbed the moviegoing public of an extremely well-crafted, intelligent, engrossing film. We're fortunate that it didn't also kneecap the career of one of cinema's finest creators. Kubrick would revisit the subject of war with Dr. Strangelove in 1964, then again in Full Metal Jacket sixteen years later. This overlooked gem deserves to stand right alongside them."
steve-432,"Apr 28, 1999",9/10,"There are two movies that have moved me to tears. The end of the Searchers and the end of Paths of Glory. The Humanity was so thick at the conclusion you could have cut it with a knife.The only slight flaw in this movie was the overacting by Kirk Douglas. Don't get me wrong...I love Mr. Douglas, however I think an unknown would have been better in this role. Mostly because all through the movie I could not help but think it was a Kirk Douglas movie. All the other performances were stellar, especially Ralph Meeker, and George Mccreedy. Kubrick was pure genius. His use of Black and White made the moods in this movie what they were......stark. The war scenes were graphic and brutal pulling no punches. The firing squad execution scenes made me squirm. All in all probably the best antiwar flick made."
chand-suhas,"Jul 21, 2024",9/10,"I will always be in for any sort of anti-war film and Paths of Glory is a near Masterpiece at that. It depicts the cruelty and inhumanity during war times with Stanley Kubrick not holding back. Kirk Douglas gives a Supreme performance as Col. Dax, trying to defend the three helpless soldiers under trial for cowardice during World War. The sheer audacity and power shown by Brigadier General played by stupendous George Macready, towards the French soldiers and the way it is portrayed was top notch.The real highlight was the court room scenes and how one sided it was, building up for Col. Dax's outburst and another strong scene happens just before the powerful climax with an German singer. Needless to say, the film left me speechless. Right from the battle sequences with the shot selection to the much dramatic scenes that followed, Stanley Kubrick showcased why he was destined to be one of the greats. In the end, I was still mesmerized by Kirk Douglas's screen presence. Paths of Glory is a must watch classic for all."
nodialogue,"Jul 4, 2003",N/A,"This movie is a great spectacle. Since it is a true Kubrick film the score and sound effects are equally memorable and effective. As this is a war movie shot entirely from the ordinary soldier's perspective it is shocking. This is a result of true fear in the spectator's mind rather than explicit violence on screen. The presence of death feels real. The story unfolds without any waste of celluloid. Kubrick explains the logic of the characters out of the war-circumstances they find themselves in without establishing the characters over a feature length. Even when it is clear how the film would end after watching it by half, the story telling gains more momentum . Having seen this film only once on a big screen I was surprised almost everybody cried in that movie theatre with the story's unexpected epilogue. These final frames explain how and why millions of people would go out killing each other and on the other hand why they should not. This movie is perfectly understandable because it is brilliantly made in any way with outstanding actors. One may argue whether or not this is one of the best movies of all times. I do believe it is one of the most important movies of all times regardless of film making alltogether. Let me summarize: real, frightening, important."
JuanIgnacioQuiroga,"Jan 4, 2026",7/10,"My first Kubrick's film where the First World War is the great scenario here: the trenches.But the story, filmed on black and white, keeps going thanks to the elections of the plans (and for Kirk Douglas too), a technic element for his filmography.A classic for a History's class, no doubt, because I saw on the high school."
gelman@attglobal.net,"Jun 18, 2006",10/10,"""Paths of Glory"" is a film about the stupidity of warfare, set in 1916, when the French and the Germans were entrenched opposite one another and a ranking officer of the French General Staff (Adolphe Menjou) persuades a field general (George Macready) that it would be good for his career if he made an attempt to capture the ""ant hill,"" a German strong point opposite the French position. Menjou and (especially) Macready are perfect for their parts. I'm of two minds about Kirk Douglas as the colonel instructed to make the attack which he knows is doomed to failure. Douglas was a star of considerable magnitude at the time but he is no more credible as a French officer than he would have been as Lassie. Nevertheless, Douglas could act, and as the central figure in the film, he carries it off. There are a great many outstanding scenes in this movie -- what else would you expect with Stanley Kubrick as writer and director -- but the most telling is when a frightened German girl (Christiane Kubrick, also known as Suzanne Christian) is escorted on stage in a beer hall filled with French soldiers who despise the Germans and forced to sing a sad song in German which when the catcalls die down leave every one in the audience (on both sides of the screen) misty eyed or crying. My own memory of that scene will last long after every other fades away. This is a great film, worthy of its reputation."

jay-22797,"Jan 24, 2025",9/10,"At that time, this work was banned in France by the French military for defaming the glorious traditions of the French army. Later, an explanation was added in the film that ""this is just a small group of scum in the French army and does not represent the entire French army"" before it was allowed to be released.The most important reason why I love this film is that it is shot in a straightforward and concise manner, with hints and metaphors that directly shock the characters. There is not a single word of nonsense in the entire dialogue, and the characters' dialogues are full of satirical themes.The description of the three soldiers is also comprehensive: an honest farmer, a small bourgeois angry youth who has been bewitched, and a soldier with the same qualities as an officer who was played by fate and became a victim of the failed suicide operation."
macho-5,"Jan 16, 1999",10/10,"This film dwells on the 'insanity of war' for no more than six minutes before immersing itself in its real theme i.e.the conflict between good and evil.It is an unrelenting examination of hubris,venality,mendacity and the rationalization of weakness. It concludes with no moral,merely leaving the viewer with a heightened awareness that evil triumphs as often as not. Truly compelling."
naaarfDE,"Aug 8, 2020",8/10,"PATHS OF GLORY disects power, temptation, manipulation and consequently severe disconnects from reality and ultimately humanity. Kubrick shows a war beneath the war - a war for a decency and humanity which both were stripped off of people by the actual war, both in the hostile environment of the trenches and decadent and above all safe residences of higher up military leadership.""Gentlemen of the court, there are times when I am ashamed that I am a member of the human race and this is one such occasion.""Kubrick portrays soldiers as vulnerable human beings instead of pseudo-heroic combat machines only running on duty and pride and reveals that the only path to real glory is remaining human."
hemant_balz,"Apr 15, 2010",9/10,Paths of glory is not a full blooded world war film.Its just so unique.Just tests the morality of soldiers of war.This movie portrays the dominance of arrogance by the generals over soldiers who try to make a mockery of them just for mere pride and satisfaction.This movie shows how generals make few soldiers to pay just to set a mere example for the rest.Kirk Douglas is captivating as Colonel Dax.His speeches in the courtroom of trial are very much captivating.Adolphe Menjou as Gen. George Broulard has given a fantastic performance.Mere soldiers bravery turns to cowardice when they see the casualties in front of them trying to capture Ant Hill.Cowardice is in fact threatening rather than death in war.But just to pick random guys for trial just to create a mockery of others was mockery of the Generals.Colonel Dax tried his best to save his soldiers.But every one was biased.No one listened.This is a brilliant movie by Stanley Kubrick.The ending scene is great where the German girl captured starts to sing and cruelty of men fades into tears.That was the truth about morality in war which opened the pathways for the men to glory.
Wwmbrd,"Sep 20, 2021",7/10,"The droning of artillery fire and crackle of machine gun fire as the wave of soldiers plunges forward is incredible. Some of Kubrick's finest cinematography for sure. The long shot of Kirk Douglas' colonel Dax walking through the trenches before the assault, looking onto the huddled, grayed, faceless men in the smoke and dirt is also a beautiful shot, and could have only been achieved in black and white. Color would have entirely ruined the visuals of a total miasma/fog of war.Unfortunately, the movie falls off a bit after the combat scenes into an unsuccessful attempt at a courtroom drama, perhaps channeling a bit of ""12 Angry Men"", which had released to rave reviews just a few months prior (actually no, because Paths of Glory was based on a book from 1935, but it's fun to imagine). The film is divided into two parts- a combat sequence where French soldiers, led by the wonderful Kirk Douglas' Colonel Dax, attempt to take the ""Ant Hill"" from Germans in 1916's France. No German is seen in the film, however, as the Allies never make it to their lines, much to the distaste of their bloodthirsty General, who would rather shoot his own men for cowardice than see them fail to advance his agendas. This friction between an impossible ask and an implacable General form the crux of the plot, where the put upon Colonel Dax must defend his own men from a sham court martial designed by General Mireau to extract the blood he did not get on the battlefield.The film shifts to this courtroom drama and resulting action on the outcome that, especially in 2021, but even in 1957 seems entirely silly. This being an anti-war film, it's not exactly surprising that we see the army leadership do despicable things at the cost of innocents, but it is still a bit hamfisted. The movie is an entertaining and quick hour and a half, however, so it doesn't suffer from a long runtime to bore anyone to death. Worth a watch for the first half alone, where the cinematography is amazing. It looks like Kubrick shot the first few war scenes on the moon, truly."
FKDZ,"Sep 15, 2024",8/10,"Paths of Glory, a tremendous effort in making war as vile, corrupt, and dehumanizing as possible. Whilst maintaining a empathetic charm and led by it's leading actor to guide you through.I've not dived too deep yet into Kubrick's library of films, only having seen full metal jacket. By accident I managed to select this for a random watch, being in the mood for something war related. I can't say I was expecting such a movie. And in my eyes, a more effective anti-war message than FMJ. As it shows more than one angle in a fantastic story that allows the viewer to be taken from the frontlines, to the back, and the middle. With room for interpretation, but also also a blunt showing of what war can get men to do, and their blindness for power and authority. Paths of glory manages to nails its bleakness. Whilst starting off quite differently the movie develops away from the heroism, the grandeur, and great stories of heroic men, and transfers it to the utterly bleak reality.It's shot well, as you can expect. And paced even better, older movies, especially this era, tend to hang around too long for audiences adjested to modern runtimes and pacing. But it's exceptionally forthcoming with it's pace and never once bores. This is without a doubt also helped by brilliant performances, the hatred Wayne Morris. But especially Macready could evoke from me is incredible. Must be some of the most heartless actors I've seen. Douglas brings the much needed humanity and preforms perfectly.Sound and music is great, for a movie this old, even better than you expect. Though obviously lacking some umphf. Dialog is clear as can be.The story switch, or more like flows, into the trial, that bring such a different feeling, the systematic and cynical approach to men and their worth.This movie gives you a lot to mulch over even after it ends. And that's a great thing."
CinemaSerf,"Nov 23, 2023",7/10,"""Col. Dax"" (Kirk Dougas) is cajoled by ""Gen. Broulard"" (Adolphe Menjou) into taking his Great War weary regiment on one last mission in occupied France. Frankly, it's little better than a suicide one, but his operational commander ""Gen. Mireau"" (George Macready) is determined at all costs that they succeed. Let battle commence! Only the French soldiers quickly realise that they are facing a well armed, immovable, German opponent and are either killed or driven back. Desperate to motivate his men, ""Mireau"" gives an order that is luckily not acted upon and with the mission deemed a failure and many of the men now in the relative safety of their trenches, the general orders a court martial for cowardice of three of the survivors. ""Dax"" is appalled but a trial there must be... Are the right people being tried and is the outcome a mere formality? I saw a 16mm print of this rather gripping and depressing wartime drama and it augmented the genuine sense of peril faced by these men as incoming artillery, the claustrophobic trench existences and - make no mistake - the competencies of their officers are put on display for us. It's dark, wet, gritty and as we reach the denouement clearly illustrative of the futility of much of this stage of this war. Kirk Douglas takes top billing and is adequate, it's Macready who actually steals this for me and the director's wife does the briefest of scenes as a German cabaret singer, too. Again, I think cinema will focus this better than television, but either way it's a thought-provoking exposé of war that holds up well 60-odd years later."
Zooha-47207,"Nov 24, 2024",2/10,"Despite its critical acclaim and significant themes surrounding the futility of war and human sacrifice, Paths of Glory struggles to resonate.The film, while visually striking in parts, fails to keep the viewer engaged due to its plodding pace and one-dimensional characters. It attempts to shed light on the cruelty and absurdity of military hierarchy but does so in a way that feels more like a lecture than a compelling narrative.The courtroom scenes, which should be the emotional heart of the movie, feel overly dramatized and lack genuine impact. For those seeking a nuanced exploration of war's complexities, this film may leave much to be desired."

louissouthpaw,"Feb 5, 2022",10/10,The contrast of the high command vs. The foot soldiers is a parallel of many of today's situations. Consider a police chief who got promoted to corporal with only a few years on the job. He catches a wave of promotions to advance himself to being a chief and along the way avoids doing any actual police work. Now he insists his officers make more arrests - something he has no personal experience with and something he has intensely tried to avoid his entire career. You can make other analogies but that's for another message board. I'll end this with saying that I've written a lot of reviews and rated hundreds of movies and have only given a few tens. This is one of them.

Afterwards, we were sent home and I cried all the way.I hate war with a passion.

ajs-10,"Jul 9, 2011",9/10,"I am a bit of a fan of Stanley Kubrick and have decided to try and watch as many of his films as I can. This one was showing one afternoon and so it was duly recorded for a viewing at a later date. That later date came around today. Set during World War I, this film tells the story of a French Colonel who ends up with the unenviable task of defending three of his soldiers who are charged with cowardice.Colonel Dax, a lawyer in civilian life, cares very much about his troops and tries to do his best for them. When ordered by General Mireau to attack a well defended position called the 'Ant Hill', he follows orders, but the enemy proves too strong and his troops have to fall back. One platoon is trapped in the trenches and the General orders his own artillery to open fire on them. This order is not obeyed despite the General's threats to the officer commanding the artillery battery. After this debacle, and wishing to make an example, the General, along with his colleague, General Broulard, agrees to Court Martial three men for cowardice. Colonel Dax decides to act as their defence, but is not hopeful of a good outcome. The penalty for this crime is death by firing squad. The three men are selected by their unit commanders. At this point I'll leave my brief summary, I won't tell you the outcome because I don't want to give away too much.An excellent example of the filmmaker's art, I couldn't find fault with this film. It may look dated by today's standards, but given the era it was made and the budget available, it's a fine job. Also guilty of doing a great job was Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, he really stands out as a quality actor in this one. Also worthy of note were Ralph Meeker as Cpl. Philippe Paris, Adolphe Menjou as Gen. George Broulard and George Macready as Gen. Paul Mireau.Everything about this film is well done, that is with one exception. The sound in the court martial scene is terrible, it's a big room and I found the echo of the voices quite an annoyance. That aside though, I thought the anti-war message got through loud and clear and you are left with no doubt who the enemy really is. I really enjoyed watching this film and I can recommend it very highly.My Score: 9.1/10"
moritzherz,"Apr 13, 2023",6/10,"I like Antiwar movies like Come and See or the great All quiet on the western front. War is something you cannot glorify, you have to warn your audience of it.Paths of glory tackles the topic of blind obeying orders. It's like the Bad Batch's brilliant quote ""Good soldiers follow orders"". But what if the order is to shoot on your camerades, to friendly fire? Certainly you would not follow such an order. The consequence is being executed because of cowardness.This movie really shows how brutal war is and that many soldiers feared their commanding officers, because they would harm them even more than the enemy.Great anti war on Kubrick style. Definitely worth a watch!"
metodico,"Sep 2, 2024",10/10,"Kubrick is absolutely one of the most extraordinary filmmakers to ever grace the earth. His talent and love for cinema transcend generations. It is impressive how a film made in 1957 can be so current and such a powerful experience. Kubrick's direction is a masterclass in cinema, and there is no denying that ""Paths of Glory"" manages to be a grand war film with just one great scene on the battlefield and a film of dialogue and profound reflections on war, human cruelty and injustice applauded and contemplated by men who have become inhuman and despicable things. If these moments of war and contemplation of ignorance make me ashamed of being part of humanity, cinema makes me proud. And it is films like ""Paths of Glory"" that represent the highest level of cinema, human, beautiful, critical and profound cinema. A masterpiece by Stanley Kubrick."
hemisphere65-1,"Dec 12, 2021",7/10,"Douglas is good in the lead, but his character could have used some human frailty/flaws to make him a bit more believable.Macready and Menjou are both convincing as the generals in charge; one insane and one manipulative!Anderson is perfect as the sycophantic aide-de-camp to Gen. Mireau (Macready), and Meeker does a good job as a soldier accused of cowardice."
slowcando,"Jul 23, 2023",5/10,"I'm surprisingly underwhelmed by this...Paths of Glory isn't the big war epic I was expecting: it's a low-key small self-contained story about the illogical and inhumane decision-making of the authorities behind the French war effort.Thrilling, enjoyable or even interesting it was not. Here are my issues:the 'french' are played by american & british actors, all speaking English in their own accents. This already causing a dent in the suspension-of-disbelief. I understand the production-reasons behind it (especially for the time), but I don't have to like it. The cast just don't fit their roles.the premise (the beginning-section of the film, no spoilers for later sections) of attacking the Ant-Hill in the daytime when bombs are constantly raining down makes no sense for two reasons, but only one of which is intentional to the story: 1) many needless soldier deaths...this is part of the story and acceptable to the viewer. 2) the reconnaissance mission the night before surely proved the best time to take the Ant Hill would be at night when no bombs are falling...this obvious tactic wasn't mentioned in the film, yet we're shown its possibility. Seems careless from a script point-of-view to at least not mention why this wasn't considered. This took took me out of the internal logic of the film.the main antagonist - the arrogant General - is played far too cartoony: with amateur-theatre level of haughty-expression acting, and contrived unrealistic dialogue (especially when barking quite insane orders in front of several men).in his later films Kubrick was able to stimulate via interesting visuals, audio or philosophical dialogue. But in Paths of Glory there's not much of that sort of thing. I got more out of The Killing and even Killer's Kiss. Only at the very end is there something special going on, involving some singing. But that wasn't enough to feel satisfied or stimulated.It's not all bad:the film's plot subverts our expectations in a few different ways making it hard to guess what's gonna happen, this at least held some interest.there's a couple of strongly-filmed scenes: the trench roving camera, and the attempt at storming the Ant Hill plays like a proto version of the legendary storming-of-the-beach scene in Saving Private Ryan.Kirk Douglas is a strong lead.The film isn't boring, it's watchable enough: but is it worth watching? Borderline. Only for Kubrick-completists."
RM851222,"Feb 21, 2015",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Paths of Glory"" (1957) is a stunning motion picture. It's about war, it's about life, it's about immeasurable things. What is courage? What is glory in the face of death? How to measure it? Can it be measured? Does courage or cowordness can be judged? These are just a few questions this movie brilliantly asks. And there is no sure answer.Watching this movie i was stunned how interesting and involving it is. It's superbly acted, directed and amazingly written war drama, that isn't much about the combat, but more of what consequences it brings. I'm still not sure whether the court itself was moral. It's yes and no at the same. If there were no court, many soldiers would have followed by example of those who didn't fight (as it was their responsibility - they are soldiers), and they would have surely lost war, which would ended by deaths for millions. On the other hand, the court itself was just a reminder, of why war itself is the most inhuman thing of them all.Overall, one couldn't summarize this movie and especially it's ideas in one summary. This is anti war movie that raises questions, and as they are eternal, there are no black or white answers to them. ""Paths of Glory"" is a must see motion picture for everyone and for all ages. It's a damn perfect classic."
RIO-15,"Jun 7, 1999",10/10,"During WWI,the French High Command order a suicide attack on a German position.The attack fails and in order to save face the commanding officer orders the trial and execution of three soldiers for cowardice.A powerful statement against the insanity of War,this is one of the best War movies ever made.The horrors of trench warfare are depicted with sharp realism by director Kubrick. Kirk Douglas turns in a marvelous performance,which is only matched by George Macready as the arrogant General. This bitter War movie was Stanley Kubrick's first real masterpiece."
Lee-65,"Jul 21, 1999",10/10,"This is, bar none, one of the greatest films ever made in the English language, or any other, for that matter. The true insanity and stupidity of misguided authority is presented here in no-nonsense terms.  Also some of the greatest battle scenes ever applied to film are here, which even Winston Churchill affirmed were some of the ""most realistic"" he had ever witnessed.  Top honors to all concerned, with fine acting jobs all around -- considering the budget of this film, which Kirk Douglas paid for mostly out of his own pocket. As one of the reviews at the time hailed it: TRULY A GREAT FILM!"
thinker1691,"May 19, 2009",9/10,"Every war bears its own signature. As with all wars, none ever succeeds in proving it's original intention. Take the First World War for instance. It's was touted as the War to End all Wars. That never happened. Instead, it is agreed, it firmly established the reasons for the Second World War. This film is entitled "" The Paths of War ' and like all wars there is much insanity in it's story. During the many battles, there were orders and counter-orders, some of which made no sense at all. In this movie, one such order concerned the careers of several high ranking French Officers, such as Gen. George Broulard and Gen. Paul Mireau (Adolphe Menjou and George Macready) who were only interested in making a name for themselves. Thus when they concocted a suicidal attack on a German position called 'The Ant hill' they were fully aware that such an assault would needlessly cost the lives of hundreds of French soldiers. Being veterans of many such reckless and futile assaults, many in the infantry refused to go. The furious Generals thereafter selected several soldiers to be arrested and tried for Cowardice and executed. Despite the most persuasive and certainly the most logical defense offered by Col. Dax, their lawyer (Kirk Douglas), the cowardly generals refused to change their order. The entire saga of this true story is forever affixed in the annals of French stupidity. Moreover, the insanity of the French Officer corps, is a prime example of all Militaries throughout the world. Indeed, movies like this and 'All Quiet on the Western Front' are excellent reasons for abolishing war altogether. However, like the outcome in this film, it is ordained by the arrogant ignorance of each new generation. We can only pray, it's won't be as repetitive as our propensity for destruction. ****"
husam-74921,"Jul 23, 2022",9/10,"Let's cut right to the chase: This movie is simple and effective. Before making this movie, Kubrick essentially sifted through the things that make war bad; eventually he figured it out.This movie is really more of an anti-hierarchal movie and shows that a hierarchy is primarily why wars are bad. You have people that are more concerned for their self interests than for the well-being of the people. The result? Injustices that go unnoticed and swept under the rug. The same people doing the sweeping are the people getting the promotions.I think one of the other qualities of this movie is that it evokes a feeling inside of you as you yourself witness the injustices; just like the main character, you too cannot do anything about it. What's more impressive is Kubrick's ability to simplify the entire subject-matter and make it impactful.Overall this is a brilliant film and I HIGHLY recommend anyone to watch this movie if you haven't already!"
Boba_Fett1138,"Sep 1, 2010",8/10,"A Kubrick movie is always something unique. No matter if his movie got made in the '50's, '60's, '70's, '80's or '90's, it's always something special and also recognizable. His style throughout his movies and also the way of storytelling have been very consistent. It's a real accomplishment for any type of director to make successful and acclaimed movies over many different decades. ""Paths of Glory"" is one of his earliest movies, or at least it's one of his earliest truly recognized ones. It really shows some guts and confidence that he made this movie the way he did, while he wasn't even an established directing name at the time in Hollywood.It's a bit of a daring and unique movie for its time really, that kicks against the military. It's a war movie without really being a war movie. It's more about humanity and is basically a story that could had been set at any given place at any given time. It actually has a quite simple little story in it, that becomes very effective through its characters and just overall way of storytelling.It's not necessarily a movie about the madness of war but more about the madness of men. In a war its more a character movie than anything else really. So it also really helps the movie that it has such fine actors involved. It has Kirk Douglas in the lead but I enjoyed some of the supporting cast members even better. I particularly enjoyed Adolphe Menjou and Ralph Meeker. Adolphe Menjou was actually an old star from the silent movie era but in this movie he perhaps gives his best performance. Even the acting style in this movie is being quite unique and unusual for its time, like basically all Kubrick movies can be describes as, as well.It's still a large scale looking and feeling movie, despite the fact that it doesn't really feature that many action or battle sequences. It's mostly due to the sets, directing approach and camera-handling. There are some trademark Kubrick looking moments in the movie, such as some long shots, moving camera's and interesting camera-angles.It's not my favorite Kubrick movie and it's also not his best but it's still a more than great early, beautiful and intriguing compelling movie from the master.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
john-basileo-166-946519,"Sep 21, 2011",N/A,"I just saw this film again on AMC for maybe the 35th time. It is truly a work of art! Perhaps the most blistering anti-war movie ever made. Great script, great photography, great acting (with the exception of George Macready occasionally chewing the scenery). Kirk Douglas was at his considerable best here. Menjou and Meeker were also terrific. Richard Anderson gives a great little performance as the consummate, suck-up weasel and a nice job by Wayne Morris. So many scenes stand out for me. Of course, there's Douglas' little speech about apologizing to Menjou. I also love the scene where Douglas toys with Morris about heading up the firing squad and, after Morris asks to be excused from the task, Douglas' sneering ""Request denied. You've got the job. It's all yours."" Only about 90 minutes long, this film grips you from the very beginning and never lets go. The final scene never fails to touch me profoundly. IMO, one of the greatest films ever made!"
StanleyStrangelove,"Jul 10, 2007",9/10,"It's WWI in France and Colonel Kirk Douglas is ordered to take an enemy position named Ant Hill. But his soldiers are not at full strength and he will not be given any support except for some preliminary bombing. When the attack fails, his superior General is furious so he orders 3 men to be chosen for court martial with the charge of cowardice. Douglas has no choice but to obey, but since he is also a lawyer, he insists on defending the men.Paths of Glory is a great film. Director Stanley Kubrick made this film in 1957 and it shows glimpses of what he would do later on with Dr. Strangelove and all of his other films. His point of view, showing the injustice of war, is brought out very strongly and clearly in the story of these men and their commanding officers. Later on, Kubrick's films seemed to become colder and colder with the humans being treated like robots. But not in this film. Every character, even those with small parts, is clearly defined and sympathetic. Kubrick's philosophy, although not fully developed, is evident in this film. He subsequently filmed Spartacus, Dr. Strangelove and Full Metal Jacket, all films that dealt with war.A great film which deserves to be seen."

alexandrelebrun-36205,"Nov 7, 2021",4/10,"The movie is about relations in the army between high ranking officers and soldiers. How one can sacrifice other lives, only to get promotion or fame.And I get it, it's a very interesting subject and I think it needed courage to make a movie about it in 1957.But the way the trial and the execution is shown just kills the movie :
First, how is a French martial court supposed to behave like a freaking usa court ? There is no ""objection"" in French system. The prosecutor and 'defense' don't behave at all like that. The court president can't do half of what is shown in the move, ...I would be fine it was about Korean War, or any conflict that involved USA but here it's France.And it's not like some trials between 14 and 18 didn't result in the same manner, there was execution for the exemple.Why couldn't the producer stick a little bit to history if he decided to go for French history ?The execution although I don't know how it happens in the USA, is certainly not how it happened in France during First World War.The whole movie feel British, or American but certainly not about French army. I understand why it got banned, not because of the movie subject, but because of the travesty of the French army officers in some kind of British style nobility, with a fake American trial and a god knows what execution."
ShootingStar82,"Mar 9, 2025",9/10,"The fourth of Stanley Kubrick's feature films, and the first one to be shot in Hollywood, is arguably one of the greatest anti-war films ever shot. The story is straightforward; in WW1 a French regiment are ordered by their officers to capture a key position (Anthill) - essentially a suicide mission - and after witnessing the first wave of troops being massacred, the remaining troops refuse to leave their trench. These troops are then required to face the consequences of their actions.What Kubrick does so well in this film is ask questions that don't have simple answers and then leave the viewer to come to their own conclusions. Why was this order made? Would it have made any material difference to the outcome of the war? What is the value of human life in such a war?Unlike other directors Kubrick doesn't glorify war, instead shining a light on the absurdity of such wanton violence. He also demonstrates some hard truths that are unescapable to us all as we progress through our own journeys in this world; that life isn't fair, that justice is fleeting and rare, and that it can all be over far too quickly. The result is a fantastic piece of filmmaking that still resonates strongly today."
charchuk,"Apr 21, 2008",10/10,"There's something to be said for watching this after a few hours of Call of Duty (and also followed by Harold + Kumar and something called The Giant Gila Monster - but that's another story), but I'm not sure exactly what it is. Suffice to say, the great disconnect between these two forms of entertainment, both dealing with war, is stunning and affecting.This is a sobering and infuriating piece of work. The characters and dialogue are a little too on-the-nose and obvious, but I'd be lying if I said that they didn't anger me anyway. I'm rapidly getting the sense that Kubrick likes to deal with the dichotomy between superficial 'high' society and passionate 'low' society, and he expands on it here to great effect. The carefully chosen vocabulary of the various generals and other higher-ups contrasts exceedingly well with the dialectic slang of the soldiers, with Dax being somewhat of a bridge between the two classes. With that in mind, it's the eloquence and articulation of the generals as they call for soldiers to be made an example of that truly angers me, as their silver-tongued calls for patriotism and loyalty while they hide behind their fortifications is utterly maddening, if a bit heavy-handed.But it's also in the depiction of the battlefield where the film really gets me. The utterly alien landscape of the trenches at night, as the patrol scampers about, is a suitable reflection of the totally inhuman trial that will soon dominate the film. Combined with the claustrophobic tracking shots through the trenches, as well as that great pan during the actual attack, this is as well-directed a film as Kubrick ever made. And that final scene, when the soldiers realize what they have lost and what war has done to them, is heartbreaking.Simply one of the finest anti-war films ever made."
akhil-jaggarwal,"Mar 25, 2006",N/A,"Man o Man, just finished watching this. The download was finally 100% completed when being hanged in Bitcomet at 85% for almost a fortnight. This is one Stanley Kubrick movie which was eluding me for so much time. Haven't yet seen Spartacus and Barry Lyndon, which are the only two left to see. How many films have you seen, or war films for that matter, in which every scene is so powerful and shot with glorious perfection. Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and other blah blah, but this movie delivers, captures human emotion with such fervor and affectively that you'll be surprised that this movie was made in 1957 about the infamous trench warfare. Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax was excellent, cannot imagine anyone else playing that role, not even James Mason. Remember, a war movie is not always about a soldier killing another shot in a gory manner. What it is about is what this movie's all about."
mayo2338,"May 12, 2003",10/10,"Yes, we live in a world where guiltless gargantuan killer whales, deftly and with agile grace do belly-flop in shallow surf to gulp down baby seals. We cogitating folks live in a more convoluted , subtle world wherein Generals of France ,in elegant splendour and impeccable grace,amid backdrops or Versaille opulence, do with grace and decorum bandy about the most recent or next upcoming carnage with a gelid cynicism of soul that gives evil a bad name. Colonel Dax is impelled to ameliorate the random executions of three soldiers from a unit that did not accomplish a known impossible mission.The darwinian ruthlessness of fate and injustice selects three souls for death {souls as inept, mystified by existence and perplexed as we all.} Perhaps the only humane moment occurs when one of the condemed squashes a cockroach to appease a fellow condemed who decried that the insect on the morrow would have a more robust connection with the deceased's wife than he. Kubrick merits kudos and Adolph Menjou and George MacCready are terror for our souls as the mannerred French Generals. This is an 11."

rmestl2,"Aug 12, 2017",10/10,"The best war and anti-war film ever made, and perhaps on of the top ten films ever made. No wasted action or shots or dialogue--for anyone who has visited the killing fields of WW1 in France and Belgium, this story rings true. This film gives the lie to Renoir's opening of La Grande Illuson in which Renoir seemingly thanks the Americans for coming to the aid of the democracies. This film shows the flaws of the ""democracy"" that was France, and indeed, of all democracies, when life becomes only a percentage of casualty. Would be nice if Trump would watch this.Masterpiece!!"
MovieAddict2016,"May 23, 2005",10/10,"Everyone always raves about ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but I've never really warmed up to it as a film. I feel it's now outdated, pretentious and showy -- at the time, it worked because people were in awe of its effects and futuristic interpretations...nowadays it is distinctly '60s-ish, with its drug trip ending empty and really just a way of expressing psychedelic visuals.""Paths of Glory"" is Kubrick's best serious film. (I'd say his best ever if ""Dr. Strangelove"" didn't exist.) It's anti-war, but more subtle than his 1987 blunder ""Full Metal Jacket"" (one of the most disappointing war films I've ever seen), which lost its point midway and never really recovered.""The Shining"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"" are great films as well but in my opinion ""Paths of Glory"" is Kubrick's best serious film. ""Paths of Glory"" retains a strong point throughout and is consistently engrossing. It is a World War I picture, but at its heart any war could have been used - this is an examination of the affects of war.It is well-acted (Douglas' best performance ever!), brilliantly directed and scripted, and features a terrific ending that ranks as (arguably) one of the top-ten best, ever.Kubrick kept returning to the themes of warfare -- ""Barry Lyndon,"" ""Full Metal Jacket"" -- but this is his best of the genre and, in my opinion, probably his best dramatic film.A must-see!"

bernadinembrown,"Jun 23, 2006",N/A,"During a recent showing of ""Paths of Glory"" at the National Arts Club in NYC, a question was raised regarding the lyrics and the title of the song sung in the final scene (in the bar) by the young German girl (Mrs. Kubrick). Obviously, Kubrick has always made effective use of music in all his films--""We'll Meet Again"" in the last scene of ""Doctor Strangelove,"" ""Singing in the Rain"" in ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Thus Spake Zarathusa"" at the beginning of ""2001."" During the opening credits of ""Paths of Glory,"" we hear the French National Anthem. Apparently Kubrick wanted ""to frame"" the film with a French melody at the beginning and a German tune at the end. Unfortunately no one in the audience on June 22 knew enough German to translate or name the song. Can anyone supply me with the title of the song and an English translation of the German words that so move the rowdy French soldiers?"
hitchcockthelegend,"May 3, 2015",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory is holding up rather well these days, in fact it's as pertinent and relevant as ever.It's 1916 and the French and German armies are in opposing mud trenches, when the French are ordered to undertake a suicidal assault on a German held hill, many of the soldiers are quick to realise it's an impossible order to see through to its conclusion and retreat, something which brings charges of cowardice from the military hierarchy. Someone must take the fall...Withdrawn from circulation in France at one time, unreleased in Spain as well, Paths of Glory is a shattering indictment on military hierarchy. On those General types who watch from afar through telescopic sights as men and boys are led like lambs to the slaughter, then off they go to their dinning rooms to gorge on wine and wholesome meat, the stench of rotting flesh as bad on their breaths as it is out there in no man's land. But it's OK for the war effort, while there might even be a promotion for some lucky soul in nice trousers...A two-parter, the film was adapted from the novel written by Humphrey Cobb. The first half follows the craziness of the attack, the horrors of war brutally realised as Kubrick and cinematographer Georg Krause bring out the worry and simmering anger that jostle for the soldier's souls. The camera is cold and calculating, thus perfect for the material to hand, it leads the viewers - with skillful fluidity - through the bleakness of the trenches and the desolation of no man's land, the former a foreboding place, the latter an atrocity exhibition as bodies get flayed and shattered, while others retreat with limbs or sanity barely intact.Second part shifts to a legally based procedural as the Generals conspire to make an example of those who retreated. Cowardice and a dereliction of duty apparently means the firing squad must save the integrity of the army. Patsies are lined up, but their Colonel (a superb Kirk Douglas) wants to defend them, there's much sweat, tears and anger, accusations hurled, and mistakes once again proving insurmountable. Which leads to the astonishing finale, heartbreaking whilst inducing fury, and crowned by an elegiac song that brings tears for characters and viewers alike.A monochrome masterpiece full of technical skills, towering performances and writing to die for, Paths of Glory, candidate for one of the greatest anti-military films ever crafted. 10/10"
tvalstar99,"Dec 28, 2004",8/10,"I think this movie has a myth surrounding it. The myth has grown bigger over the years.I find this film very good, but not as good as the ratings on IMDb. The story is rather simplistic and so are the characters. No doubt about it who is bad and who is good.But that is fine by me. The story grabs you and you feel sorry for the poor soldiers who are used as cannon meat, shown by the scenes on the battlefield, and you hate the generals who think nothing of their men as tin soldiers. I felt really frustrated when the 3 soldiers were on trial. This movie makes you feel with the characters and sucks you into the story. It shows the cruelty and the insanity of war. The same things Kubrick shows in Full Metal Jacket. The way the soldiers end is not happy but the last scenes of the movie give a spark of hope which can be a little bit silly for some viewers, which I understand, but I liked the ending.It is a good court drama, with great acting and I like these kind of films. And because it is about a war where there are too little films about and because it is a classic and the film is made by Kubrick, I too might just give it a little bit too much credit."

TheNabOwnzz,"Dec 2, 2018",9/10,"Paths of Glory is undoubtedly Stanley Kubrick's first truly great motion picture, and in turn cemented his talented potential in the motion picture industry. Ofcourse, he would later follow this up by directing at least six more films of superb quality, yet the typical Kubrick technical aspects are first visible in this particular picture.In a way, Paths of Glory is the most humane movie that Kubrick has ever made, and while certain trackingshots are very reminiscent of later projects such as The Shining (1980), this is still for Kubrick terms a very unconventional film. While one cannot deny Kubrick's genius as a director of angles, visuals, depth or artistic imagery, his films are generally emotionally quite disconnected since his character development is quite minimal, and the characters themselves one dimensional. ( Yeah, Alex DeLarge is an exception to this ) However, Paths of Glory is one of the most coherently structured films Kubrick has ever made, and doesn't have that 'weird-esque' feeling to it that later Kubrick films might have. It also has the strongest message about humanity and evil indifference, which in a way makes this Kubrick's most personally touching film by far, and the result is that it is without a doubt the most emotionally draining film he has ever made.Colonel Dax ( Kirk Douglas ) is the metaphor for the sole representation and hope of humanity, whereas every other high ranking officer symbolizes the evil and inhumanity of man. The picture does a tremendous job by showing the futility of war, and the corruption of those involved. The enemy is never shown, and battle sequences, while technically superbly filmed, are deliberately not very satisfying. This further symbolizes the fact that this is in the end about an army fighting itself, instead of an enemy, which ofcourse also emphasizes the ultimate uselessness of war. The only German that is shown ( The female singer in the final scene ) is depicted as an array of light and hope, instead of hate and anger as is usually associated with the enemy.The acting is generally superb, with in particular an outstanding performance by Kirk Douglas in the lead role, who truly seems to be the sole 'human' officer depicted in the film. The screenplay that is accompanied with this ( In particular later discussions between him and his superior officers ) is also fantastic, as the dialogue is intelligent and very relevant to this reflection of the human condition and the corruption thereof. There are a couple of short scenes in which the three future victims are introduced, and they are depicted as the average joe's who are quite comparable to nearly every other human being, and therefore their dilemma is even more emotionally compelling.In terms of technical aspects, Paths of Glory is also phenomenal. It is one of the best looking black-and-white movies ever made, which is a result of fantastic cinematography. The lighting in the jail sequences, the sideways tracking shots of the charge on the ant hill or the execution walk, every shot is close to perfection. Ofcourse the long trackingshots in the trenches also help enhance the situation our characters are in, and Kubrick's blocking in the officer scenes is fantastic, with many varieties in mood swings which are always emphasized by a character sitting down, standing up, or walking a certain direction. The dynamics in these exposition scenes are remarkable due to these varying visual hierarchies. One also has to mention the fantastic production design of the indoor sets featuring the high ranking officers, which definitely gives the audience this aristocratic kind of feeling that is in high contrast to the bleak trackingshots in the trenches featuring the normal soldiers.In the end, Paths of Glory is Kubrick's greatest personal effort, and among his greatest films. It is a genuinely human story under inhuman conditions, and with a final scene that is one of the greatest metaphorical and emotional sequences ever created in cinema, it is indeed one of the all-time greats in terms of anti war motion pictures."
thespeos,"Feb 10, 2022",7/10,"Now that is an intense movie.Not the most professionally appearing, but the emotional pitch for me was non-stop anger and disgust.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
Doubtful that this is based on specific events, but I have zero doubt this has happened countless times throughout history.The closest film I'd compare this to is ""Apocalypse Now,"" though this is way, way below that film's story, acting, directing (Coppola).For my our reasons, this movie was exceptionally difficult to watch. In general terms, it's an archetype of what disgusts me most
about our species, but especially the male sub-species. The absolute depravity of men (not women per se) is best shown
here, and I could barely watch this for that reason alone.Good luck enjoying this.ACTING:
Normally, I'm quite hard on actors like Douglas because he's largely an ego-maniac (yes, even in this film we have to see him
half-naked). But I will give him some ""props"" here for taking on a more serious role.As a whole the acting was comprised of a TV cast, and this dilutes the quality of the presentation. This, in part, is why it doesn't
feel wholly professional.TEMPO:
Dark, bitter thumping to the endCINEMATOGRAPHY:
Same as the tempoDIRECTING / WRITING:
Kubrick was a highly skilled technician, and I have enjoyed a number of his films. But, as a person, I think he was a d!ck.Here he shows his talent at realism and capturing emotion in the most intense of situations. That was his imprimatur.Is it a good film? Yes.Should you watch this once? Yes.Rating: 7.5."
DrezenMedia,"Jan 19, 2004",N/A,"The film was remarkably quick, not even 90 minutes in length, but being a very young director at the time, I'd say Kubrick filled it well. It almost reminds me of the earlier ""The Life of Emile Zola"" (1937) with Paul Muni because of the corruption that exists in the French army, and how someone like the character played by Kirk Douglas can stand up to it even in the face of death itself. I work at a video store and some of my customers that watch numerous classic movies like I do said that they thought this was Kirk Douglas' finest hour (and 26 minutes). They were right. But this isn't his only great picture, he's got plenty to offer in just about every film he's been in right from the beginning of his career. If you are a newcomer to Douglasania, this is a great movie to start off with."
EUyeshima,"May 5, 2008",10/10,"There have been many exceptional anti-war films throughout the years - Lewis Milestone's ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", Robert Altman's ""M*A*S*H"", Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" - but I doubt if there's been one as emotionally devastating and economically dramatized as Stanley Kubrick's searing 1957 classic indictment of military politics among the upper ranks of the French army during WWI. Running a scant 86 minutes, the movie wastes no time in showing the exploitation of military ranks by the French General Staff to participate in a suicide mission on the western front. The objective is to take over ""Ant Hill"", a German stronghold of no strategic importance to the French except to the ambitious General Mireau, who is given the incentive of a promotion if the attack is successful. It's oblivious from the outset that the chances of success are practically nil since the men in the trenches are battered and weak from a number of successful advancements into enemy territory. The conscientious Colonel Dax is handed the responsibility of leading the men, but it turns completely fatal due initially to the blunder of one commanding officer's orders and the dominant German forces. Desperate to avoid humiliation, Mireau transfers blame for the failure to the soldiers and accuses them of cowardice.If Mireau had his way, one hundred men would have been publicly executed, but he is ordered to identify three men to be to be executed exemplarily to satisfy the blood thirst of the military command. Dax defends the three men at the court-martial hearing but appears doomed to failure by a kangaroo court. The rest of the story plays out in aching detail until the shattering conclusion. Although he is more famous for his larger-than-life portrayals like Vincent Van Gogh in Vincente Minnelli's ""Lust for Life"" or the title role in Kubrick's later ""Spartacus"", Kirk Douglas is no less mesmerizing in a comparatively subdues performance as Dax. In hindsight, it seems rather punitive that he never won a competitive Oscar. In a particularly poignant performance, Ralph Meeker, an even undervalued actor most famous for Robert Aldrich's ""Kiss Me Deadly"", plays Corporal Paris, one of the three chosen to die specifically because his commanding officer wants to be rid of the only eyewitness to his act of drunken cowardice. With his distinctive facial scar, George Macready plays the fanatical Mireau with uncompromising fury, while Adolphe Menjou, in one of the last roles of a long career, plays the blatantly immoral General Broulard with a slyly sinister panache. It's no wonder the film was banned in France for nearly two decades. The 1999 DVD offers only the original theatrical trailer as an extra. Well beyond Kubrick aficionados, this remains essential viewing for anyone interested in classic cinema."
Hey_Sweden,"Jun 13, 2013",10/10,"Star Kirk Douglas knew full well this was a film worth making, and readily agreed when young director Stanley Kubrick (28 at the time) approached him to star in this memorable commentary on the insanity of war, specifically on the demands of military brass to produce results. Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material. This film may not have been profitable in its initial release, but 56 years later its power remains intact.Based on a book by Humphrey Cobb, it tells the tale of trench warfare during WWI. French general Mireau (George Macready) orders his troops on a suicidal mission. When the mission fails, he determines to save face by selecting some of the soldiers for a court martial. The humanistic, realistic Colonel Dax (Douglas) insists on defending the three men - Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker), Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey). However, Dax has his work cut out for him as proving that the fault lies with the brass, rather than the men in the trenches, will be most difficult indeed.A superb cast, also including Adolphe Menjou as General Broulard, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as the prosecutor, Peter Capell as the judge, and Susanne Christian - a.k.a. Christiane Kubrick, who would become the directors' wife for the next 40 plus years - as the German singer, helps bring this story to life. The mostly percussive music score by Gerald Fried also serves to drive the story forward without calling a lot of attention to itself. Genuinely harrowing battle footage is well staged and executed, and even though emotions are mostly held in check the plight of the three doomed soldiers earns our sympathies; when they start breaking down it's tough to see. And Kubricks' use of the moving camera adds a lot to the scenes in the trenches.With an impassioned performance by Douglas at its core, ""Paths of Glory"" is a quietly potent film and easily stands tall as one of the best films of its kind ever made.10 out of 10."
SoumikBanerjee1996,"Aug 9, 2024",7/10,"In the midst of baleful wars, we often tend to forget the first and foremost duty of a soldier, which is to 'protect,' and a leader's duty is to ensure his/her men or women are safe from harm.More than the order to kill the enemies, it's far more respectable and idealistic to safeguard the interests of the innocents. However, due to corruptive power at the helm, superiors with their superiority complexes, lines get blurred between cowardship and bravery!I love how Kubrick showcases that dilemma in here with such precision and understanding. I wish it was longer in length and delved much deeper into the narrative."
cwarne_uk,"Aug 30, 2008",9/10,"I am no fan of Stanley Kubrick and consider all of the films he made after ""Dr. Strangelove"" to be cleverly made, imbecilic rubbish. The basic problem was his world-view - apparent in the few interviews he gave - deeply anti-humanist and incredibly arrogant. That the later films are so devoid of intellect or passion may well be why he has become a favourite of so many who want films to be arty without actually being truly difficult. This has little to do with ""Paths Of Glory"", made before Kubrick had developed the deadened style of those later films. Perhaps the secret ingredient is Kirk Douglas, here at his muscular, intelligent best and obviously deeply committed to the material. The gliding camera in the trenches and the battle scenes are amongst the best filmed moments of 1950's cinema - realistic in a way few English language films of that time were, the only comparison being in Japanese films such as ""Fires On The Plain"". The film is very cleverly constructed, playing almost as a two-acter of trench and aftermath, with a coda that is surprisingly moving. There are a few gripes, as always, the first one is Kirk's hairdo which is pure 1956, slightly more serious is the loading of the film against the generals - maybe this sort of thing is needed in cinema, but compared to literature it is quite crude. I would disagree with those who see this as an anti-war film - it seems to me to be simply a film that takes place in wartime. It may explore what war can lead men to do, but, like it's hero, there is little suggestion that it explicitly condemns war. Overall I would rank this as a great film, to my mind it is certainly Kubrick's finest."
ksf-2,"Dec 16, 2025",7/10,"Many familiar faces in this one... kirk douglas had just done lust for life. Adolphe menjou had started in the silents and moved seamlessly into the talkies. Richard anderson will be best known as oscar in six million dollar man. Ralph meeker was in some big films, but isn't that well known. The story opens with two military bigshots discussing a mission, as one tells the other that what he's proposing is foolish and destined to fail. As expected, they send the men off to attempt to take the ant hill, occupied by the chermans. Lots of military activity. The soldiers are outmanned, outgunned, and have no chance of gaining any ground. There's a court martial, in the manner of a kangaroo court. As we knew, life is cruel and unfair. It's well done, but pretty dark. Directed by stanley kubrick. He won the oscar for space odyssey, but was nominated for twelve more ! If you haven't seen doctor strangelove, watch that. It also has a dark ending, but is all done with well written humor."
Supachewy,"Dec 11, 2010",9/10,"The war drama Paths of Glory is directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Kirk Douglas and George Macready. The film takes place in 1916 France.General Paul Mireau (Macready) is ordered by a superior general to take an area known as the Anthill in his sector which is currently under German control. At first Mireau declines because the mission is impossible but when the superior general says how he may be considered for a promotion Mireau goes through with the action. Mireau personally supervises Colonel Dax's (Douglas) attack on the German controlled territory but when Dax's troops do not even make it out of the French trenches Mireau orders that the French artillery fire on their own men to motivate them. When the battery Captain refuses to do so without a written order the general does not pursue the option but instead decides to try three men from under Dax's command for cowardice which is punishable by death.The screenplay by Stanley Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson is superb. The characterization of General Mireau and Colonel Dax are both great and by the end of the film you know the two for exactly who they are. Also you get quite attached to the men that are tried for cowardice and hope for them all the way to the end. What makes this film different from most other war films is that there is no action in it after the attack on Anthill. It is part courtroom drama as well and this film is much more than it appears. Also I absolutely loved the ending which featured Stanley Kubrick's future wife, the only female in the entire film and his wife until he died in 1999.Stanley Kubrick is often called one of the greatest directors of all time and this film shows why he is. The shot that I absolutely loved was a long shot of General Mireau travelling the trenches and greeting several soldiers on his path before the attack on Anthill. Nothing makes me happier than seeing a beautiful long shot like that, and by long I mean that it lasts for a long time not that it is far away. Also when Colonel Dax is on the battlefield the shots of him are absolutely mesmerizing, the fact that this film was completely ignored by the Academy Awards is just a shame on their part. Throughout the film there are plenty of more wonderful shots, one is towards the end with a bunch of soldiers in front of a large building, I won't describe what is happening because it is a spoiler. I personally believe that Kubrick is the greatest director of all time and obviously that is arguable but I believe everyone who respects film understands that Kubrick is a genius and this film is just one of the many examples why.Kirk Douglas gives a very powerful performance in this film. He is very strong and military like and deserves much praise for his performance. When he gives his strongest performance is when he confronts General Mireau or General Broulard at the end of the film. Also, when Douglas is leading his men on the battlefield he does a very good job. The only problem with Douglas's character is that he is kind of one dimensional. He is a man who believes in justice and truth, not in politics. Truly a man that a person can look up to. But that is basically it, but that is all he needs to be because even though he is the lead the supporting characters take up a large part of the eighty seven minute film. This is the first of two films that Douglas works with Kubrick, the other being Spartacus, and the two are a great team.George Macready also gives a great performance except his character is the exact opposite of Douglas's, he is a selfish, despicable man. But Macready plays the part extremely well. Whenever him, Colonel Dax, General Broulard, or all of them together all three of them give their best performances. The look of Macready's eyes is what really makes his performance so powerful, his stare can break a person's will. Also, when Macready was at the battle of Anthill ordering the artillery to fire on his own men his devious performance was fantastic as well.Overall I give this film a 9/10, it is another Kubrick classic. Everything about it was great, and what I love about Kubrick's films is that he never uses music to tell the audience how to react to what is happening on the screen. He lets them feel how they want to feel. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys war or courtroom dramas. It definitely is a must see just for Kubrick's direction."
funkyfry,"Oct 28, 2002",10/10,"Impassioned examination of military injustice during WWI.  Douglas must defend 3 prisoners wrongly accused of cowardice and sentenced to be hung. Menjou is powerful and convincing as a military higher up who believes Douglas cares only for a promotion.  Beautiful photography in the style of Ophuls contrasts plush life of higher officers with the hell of trench war. Some melodrama, but all in all it's much less sentimental and also less spectacle-oriented than most war films (including Douglas and Kubrick's later ""Spartacus"", which is a pompous bore).  Doublas only speechifies when the plot makes it a necessity (highly unusual for him, a trained Spencer Tracy wannabe)."
Darth_Osmosis,"Jun 1, 2018",10/10,A brilliant movie about not so much war itself but how ugly and inhuman the politics of war can be. Has a very good courtroom sequence and some very emotional speeches/dialogue. Overall a very powerful film!

46frank,"Feb 24, 2003",9/10,"I show this film each year to high school history students.  While I disagree strongly about it being ""an anti-war"" movie, Its impact is shocking and frightening to students.  It does not decry war, but rather laments the frequent stupidity of those who navigate the waters of war."
alirezazamani-73059,"Jun 16, 2021",5/10,I think this movie didn't show many scenes very good & complete such as the scenes from war but it showed injustice and the comparison between being pusillanimous or courageous very well!Sometimes it was tedious but not very much!In all I think this movie is expired for todays!
Snow Leopard,"Oct 4, 2004",N/A,"The story in Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"" is tense and interesting, with the action and chaos of a bold yet ill-advised attack followed by the drama and fear caused by its repercussions. But if it were only an anti-war film, it would be a bit too pat, aiming at some generally easy targets. Though set in the heat of the action of World War I, the story and characters are vivid enough to suggest some more general themes about human nature.As the man in the middle of it all, Kirk Douglas has plenty of energy, and he handles the various confrontations believably. His character has more depth than the others, and in addition to playing an important role in the events, his reactions also form the lens through which the viewer sees everything else. From the first scene to the last, Colonel Dax is spirited in his responses and acute in his observations.Adolphe Menjou gives a generally effective portrayal of the bureaucratic officer in charge of it all, though sometimes it is hard not to view his character in the same light as the various charming scamps that Menjou played in his less serious movies. George Macready's character is one-dimensional and disreputable, but he plays the role as it was intended. Ralph Meeker has the most presence of the three prisoners.As the story unfolds, some of the characters' decisions are deplorable, but most of them are believable, and not only in a war-time setting. It is possible to see in the characters some parallels to everyday behavior. This is one of the things that sets the movie apart from the many run-of-the-mill anti-war pictures, and it helps ""Paths of Glory"" go a little beyond its immediate genre."
joberthefboom,"Jun 22, 2020",9/10,"Early on in the movie we follow French general Mireau (George Macready) with a tracking shot through the trenches. Occasionally he talks to one of his men and asks him if he is ready to kill more Germans. One soldier, struck by shell shock, can't possibly answer the question. When the general learns of his condition he strikes him down and declares him a coward. It is perfectly obvious that the general has lost touch with the reality of war.General Mireau is only there to instruct the commanding officer to make a suicidal assault on a position of the enemy. The position has no strategic purpose and the only reason it has to be taken is because the general believes that it will earn him a promotion. Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), is the commanding officer and knowing the impossible assault would happen with or without him, agrees to lead the charge. The attack fails and under heavy bombardment the troops retreat. General Mireau is disgusted and infuriated, to make an example, he demands that three men are to stand trial for their lives because of their 'cowardice'. Colonel Dax, once a lawyer before the war, volunteers to defend the three chosen men at their court-martial.We see the three men discuss why they were chosen. Two of them were chosen because they were disliked by their direct officers and the other one was chosen purely by chance. They would find their deaths, not at the hands of the Germans but at the hands of their own corrupt army generals. Colonel Dax tries all he can to save them but it is painfully clear that he is, once again, fighting a lost battle.The battle scenes are incredibly realistic and combined with the black and white almost gives of the impression of a documentary of World War I. This is a gritty and muddy world and color has no place in it. It hits close to home because it reminds us of pictures we might have seen of the battlefields and therefore it heightens our emotions about the war. To make this film in black and white was the right choice.We feel Colonel Dax's frustration and helplessness during the excellent court scenes. Ironically the brave men are labeled as cowards while the actual cowards are only concerned with more power. A war within a war. Good versus evil, honour versus cowardice. Stanley Kubrick would always have this weird way of irony in his pictures, and in this film, at the beginning of his legendary career, you can already sense his genius.A nightmarish depiction of the true horrors of war. But Kubrick wouldn't be Kubrick if he didn't, at least once, catch the audience off-guard. At the end of the film, he plays with our emotions one more time. Colonel Dax finds his troops in cafe, a scared, horrified German girl is brought in to much cheering and screaming of the men. But when she starts to sing, the troops become visibly emotional and some even hum along. They know the song, but not the words and for a moment they aren't thinking about the war."
truemythmedia,"Jun 13, 2019",10/10,"I'd recommend this film to anyone who has a pulse; it's not only exhilarating, it's undeniably important.
I had heard great things about this movie for years, but for one reason or other, I'd never gotten around to sitting down to watch it. If I'm being honest, when I sat down to watch it, I wasn't exactly chomping at the bit to see it (as this was one of the films for the Kubrick series, it felt like sitting down to watch it was a little bit of a chore), but by the end of this movie I was so wrapped up in the story that I could barely take my eyes from the screen, and as the final scene played out on screen I found myself emotionally overwhelmed and I started to cry. This film is a harrowing look at the horrors and absurdities of war, and a commentary on the horrid way that humans can treat each other for no reason whatsoever. This is a truly emotional masterpiece, one that shook me in a way I had not expected."
sol-,"Jan 14, 2005",10/10,"Based on fact, this superbly directed anti war film is both educational and powerful viewing. It depicts not only the attitudes of the corrupt army officials but also trench life and its futility too with excellence. As a film, it is pretty much a perfect film all round  even the length is appropriately short as to not allow for unnecessary sentiments to build up. Kirk Douglas does very well with his lead role, and he even felt that he worked so well under Kubrick's direction that he chose Kubrick to replace Anthony Mann as director of the epic 'Spartacus', a Hollywood success that lead Kubrick to be able to choose his own big budget projects."
wes-connors,"Jan 3, 2010",10/10,"In 1916 France, World War II Generals George Macready (as Mireau) and Adolphe Menjou (as Broulard) decide to order troops attack a German stronghold known as ""The Ant Hill"" - even though they are aware the military will most certainly suffer massive causalities, and will most probably fail. When the orders are given, many of the soldiers are aware the mission is doomed, and retreat to their trenches; although some, like Colonel Kirk Douglas (as Dax) attempt to be valiant. After the embarrassing defeat, the Generals decide to court-martial, and execute by firing squad, a random selection of their own soldiers.""Paths of Glory"" are paved with blood.This film showed anyone who wasn't convinced by ""The Killing"" that Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaker to be reckoned with; it is a bold, innovative, and highly engaging war drama. The French government was, understandably, not amused; but, many other countries recognized France happened to be the setting, and blacklisted the film for its unflattering depiction of military leadership in general.""Patriotism... is the last refuge of the scoundrel.""Quoting Samuel Johnson, Mr. Douglas is towering; suavely Machiavellian, Mr. Menjou plays evil with ease; and, Mr. Macready should have received a ""Best Supporting Actor"" award for carrying out his orders. Neither Douglas, Menjou, nor Macready were nominated, surprisingly. The rest of the regimen is no less impressive; with Ralph Meeker (as Paris), Joe Turkel (as Arnaud), and Timothy Carey (as Ferol) obviously moving up in the ranks. And, note how real-life war hero Wayne Morris (as Roget) plays against type. Kubrick makes more subversive and subtle points with priestly Emile Meyer and the German singer.********** Paths of Glory (10/25/57) Stanley Kubrick ~ Kirk Douglas, George Macready, Adolphe Menjou, Ralph Meeker"
perfectbond,"Dec 14, 2003",9/10,"In Paths of Glory, Kubrick brilliantly explores military ethics. The entire cast led by the immortal Kirk Douglas (né Isadore Demsky) is first rate. Strong characterizations abound throughout. Even by today's standard the trench warfare scenes are brutally represented, as they need to be. Highest recommendation, 10/10."
Kaukas28,"Apr 26, 2023",10/10,"Path of Glory, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is a breathtaking masterpiece that captures the human condition amidst the horrors of war. The outstanding performances by Kirk Douglas, Ralph Meeker, and Adolphe Menjou bring depth and nuance to their roles, and the unflinching portrayal of the human toll of war is both emotionally stirring and thought-provoking.What sets Path of Glory apart is its message of hope in the face of adversity. Despite the soldiers' daunting circumstances, their resilience and courage in the face of injustice is inspiring. The film's finale is particularly touching, reminding us that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.In short, Path of Glory is a must-watch film that will leave you moved and filled with a sense of purpose."
nikxatz,"Aug 1, 2019",9/10,"I just started a Kubrick Marathon this summer and I chose to start with this film and it was a pleasure to experience such a well-presented anti-war film. Kubric is a filmmaking genius and proves it both with his interesting camera work and with the direction he chooses to talk about war and humanity.At first,we get to see the uglyiness and unfairness of war even without seeing the Germans, who in this case, are the enemy. We get to see how unfair and ust plain stupid and politicly-driven can a war be by watching an insident in the battlefiled of the French army. The soldiers are acussed of cowerdness but they actually could noto do anything because the attack was impossible.And the commander says that 3 random soliders have to die in order to give a lesson the other soldiers.The men with the most power are so arrogant and cunning hat only seek for their own good and do not care about the human lives. A life t them means nothing and they do not understand that a human is a being with emotions and wants love and care and is not a robot made to please every higher force.And there we have Kirk Dougles' character who is the face of ethics and truth. He cares for every singl life of his men and rightably argues to any wrong or immoral decision. He is an unstoppable force and craves for the better.And then we have the three exceptional performaces of the ""guilty"" soliders who have been chosen to die for a nonsnese. And it hurts to see young men lose their soles for such a wrong and barbarian order. The monlogue of one of the soldiers about him and the insect that by the time he dies the insect will closer to his wie than him is so true and difficult to swallolw. And all this for a stupid order of a stupid arrogant being.The ending is pure genius. The soldiers desprately cry by listening to a german singer and their sadness and pain and everything that this war has caused to their soles, their longing of family and peace is depicted through their sad and lost faces. And then Kirk Douglas gives a memorable smile, which as I see it, means that he was definately right form the begining. Humans are humans. They can't like a perfect being because being tired and dizzy and not being able to move on are situatin that we all face. And the tears of these soldiers signify that war damages and poisons are nature. War and these stupid men of power torn human nature apart. Humans are afraid and angry and feel pain. We ain't guns, we have a soul.Kubrick delivers a film which offers so many ideas about war that it is impossible not to keep thinking about the film. His camera work is provoking and we should cnsder that this is a film made in the 60's. Every choice, from technical aspects to the main critic on war and poltiics and religion is bold and it is striking to see a film with such a moral compass.A glorious film."
