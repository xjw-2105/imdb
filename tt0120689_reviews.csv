KathyT,"Dec 15, 1999",10/10,"""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"".  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. ""The Green Mile"" will haunt you."
epluribusunum2010,"Sep 5, 2012",10/10,"There's a reason why this Oscar winning tour de force is #67 ranked of all films on IMDb, despite the fact that it's 3 hours long and has some truly grisly scenes (not for the squeamish, children, or a first date.)It's chock full of outstanding performances, not only from Hanks, but also from the many supporting characters, all who are rich and full. It will seem slow to the impatient, but will be richly rewarding for those with the stamina to make it to the end.It will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment and perhaps different shades/degrees of evil. It is either a deeply moving spiritual tale or a wonderfully creepy journey down the rabbit hole of Stephen King's mind; take your pick. Either way, I put it right up there on my desert island list with the likes of Shawshank Redemption. It is definitely required watching."
oundjianm,"Jan 8, 2012",10/10,"GREATEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. i remember seeing it when it first came out when i was 12 years old. now i just finished watching it and have gone through practically a whole box of tissues...that pure, love and honesty was portrayed so exquisitely well by Michael Clarke Duncan... it made me want to tear my hair out. If there is anything in this world which reminds me of true human love and compassion, it is this film. If you ever give up hope on humanity and the destruction which our disgusting race has brought to this world, watch ""The Green Mile"" Hopefully it will change your outlook a little bit like it just has mine.11/10 SHOULD HAVE WON ALL THE AWARDS AVAILABLE THE YEAR OF IT'S RELEASE."
alan photog,"Jan 9, 2000",10/10,"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.BRAVO!"
Matt-231,"Dec 15, 1999",N/A,"Having seen the movie, The Green Mile, and read the novel of the same  name by Stephen King, I am glad to say that the movie stays true to the  book, which in itself is a great read.  I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the  movie, I didn't see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left  out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way  detract from either work.  As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael  Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best  performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that  Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard  Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the  book.  I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the  movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had  written it.  I wouldn't compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The  Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are  both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn't a movie about  hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie  about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.  But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4  stars. Great story, great cast, great look."
uniikki,"Feb 10, 2000",10/10,"Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this.  Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five."
thinker1691,"Oct 29, 2009",9/10,"The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or "" The Green Mile "", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****"
klindon-38400,"Apr 20, 2023",9/10,This is the first time I ever saw this fantastic actor. There is something very interesting going on behind his eyes and compelling about everything he does when he is on screen. Do people know how truly rare that is? He's watchable from the moment he shows up to the moment he's gone and you can't wait for him to show up again. That is serious start quality. I have sense come to love him in everything he's been in. I even watched a superhero movie because he was in it lol. Just kidding. Superhero movies have good and bad just like every other genre. I love great acting and great actors. Sam Rockwell is one of my favorites.
jlacerra,"Jun 17, 2001",10/10,"This movie is a real gem.  It is hard to find fault with it.  Hanks is excellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant toward humor.  He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found.  Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor.  One cannot find a single weak cast member!  Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar.  Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity."
Angel-54,"Jun 16, 2000",N/A,"This movie was spectacular!!  I was watching it intently from beginning to end and did not even notice the time.  This movie is a true masterpiece. Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan were wonderful and the supporting cast was fantastic.Based on a serial novel by Stephen King, the Green Mile is about Paul Edgecomb, a officer in charge of prisoners on death row and everything was the same as usual until the day that John Coffey (Clarke Duncan) was brought to the mile.  Coffey is an extraordinary person and Paul Edgecomb never believed in miracles until the day he met one.This movie is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel that I have ever seen.  I think that I would recommend this movie to everyone, and even if you don't like King's work I am certain that you will love this flick.  This movie was robbed at the Academy Awards, but never the less, it is still one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen.  A small warning though, if you are a bit squeemish then you may need to hide your eyes for a few scenes, but don't miss out on this movie because of it.  I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10!!!"
lalogia2020,"Nov 14, 2010",10/10,"This movie goes beyond others into an elite group with movies like Facing The Giants, Good Will Hunting, Men Of Honor and others; in which the story is so brilliant and takes you to a climax higher than the usual, that it baffles you to think that there exist possibility in the human mind to create such a story. Kind of like songs, in which there are songs so brilliantly written that you can't imagine a human being writing it.I love drama, they're my favorites and I don't get bored with them especially when it's interesting; so the length, which is something complained about by a lot of people with this movie, doesn't bother me at all it just adds more interest.One of the best movies of all time and a must see!10/10 without a doubt."
thomaseb,"Jan 31, 2000",10/10,"The length of the movie was perfect. It kept to the story to an amazing degree. The few changes didn't hurt the feeling nor the telling. The story itself is stirring and captivating. The casting of the parts and their portrayal were right on. This is one of the best movie versions of a Steven King novel I've ever seen, and I think I've seen them all. If you're prone to tears at a film, take extra tissues, you'll need them. The theater I was in was a mass of sniffles through the end credits. If you like fantasy/drama the film cannot be missed. There are some graphic scenes that may upset some, but this is Steven King. This is a movie I plan to add to my video collection as soon as the Letter Box version hits the shelves."
EVON1TY,"Mar 13, 2023",10/10,"As you may know, the movie is adapted from Stephen King's amazing novel.The director Frank Darabont showed this novels are quite amazing for adaptations. This wasn't the first time he directed one of those adaptations. He proved that with The Shawshank Redemption.The storyline is just too effective and great! Not only the storyline is good, the timeline order is the real key. If this movie was on chronological order, the movie would be half effective.Also the great chosen cast with so iconic performances makes the movie even more effective. Especially the brilliant performance by Michael Clarke Duncan.Cinematography is also quite amazing. I think we can see that in especially in the forest scenes and the rainy scene.I think Original Scores could be better. It's good when you're watching the movie but the Scores are not meant for listening after the movie. The Prestige has the similiar scores in my opinion. Not the type of the Scores are similar but they're not that iconic to listen. At least it was like that for me."
transylvanianfairy,"Jul 11, 2013",10/10,"The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget. You can't possibly forget such an emotive story.What, you want to watch it? Great! But don't forget to have grab some tissues first."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jan 5, 2023",10/10,"Paul Edgecomb and his team of prison guards get a surprise when John Coffey walks through the door, a man of huge stature, with a timid demeanour, but a special gift, but convicted for murdering two children.Is this one of the best ever adaptations from text to big screen ever made? I would argue so, twenty odd years on, and I am still captivated by the magic of The Green Mile.Not many films get me, this one always does, it's an incredibly moving film, one of those films where you will need your hankies for a few scenes. Many scenes hit hard throughout, some moving, some disturbing, there really is a richness to its content that is quite something.Plenty of outstanding scenes, I've always enjoyed that moment where the guards are first introduced to John, that scene towards the end though, (we all know which one,) that is such an incredibly powerful moment.Tom Hanks gives an outstanding performance, as indeed do the whole cast.The accompanying music works so well, the score enhances the film.It's quite a long film, but it's one of those will just fly by, you'll be so engrossed you won't even notice the hours ticking by.10/10."
schd5,"Jan 17, 2000",10/10,"Without using all the old cliches, I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a creative, intriguing, and life enhancing experience. Everything about this movie was delightful. I recommend seeing this movie with someone especially close to you. After the movie my Fiancée and I spent two hours talking and expanding on the films ideas and concepts. This was truly a electrifying experience. I would venture to call this movie one of the best movies of all time.  Sure, there are things that I would have liked to see done differently, but that is what makes a movie more enjoyable. The discussions following this film were wonderful."
0U,"Feb 24, 2020",10/10,"Some of the supporting characters are a little two-dimensional, but 'The Green Mile' is an incredibly effective prison drama with terrific performances and a script that deals with grief in an innovative and emotionally resonant way."
frankde-jong,"Jun 22, 2020",7/10,"Frank Darabont as a director has only made 4 films. The most highly rated are ""The Shawshank redempion"" (1994) and ""The green mile"" (1999). At first glance these films have much in common. Both adapted from a book written by Stephen King, both situated in a prison and both about the friendship between a white and a black man.In fact the films are far more different than you are inclined to think. ""The green mile"" is more shocking as it is on death row. The story of ""The green mile"" also involves a supernatural element that ""The Shawshank ... "" as a more pure character study is missing.The character that contributes the most to the dfference between the two movies is the character of the black man. In ""The Shawshank ... "" Morgan Freeman plays the wise experienced inmate Ellis Redding. In ""The green mile"" Michael Duncan plays the somewhat ambigious John Coffey. On the hand he is a simpleton, reminding me of Lennie from ""Of mice and men"" (John Steinbeck). On the other hand he is ""a force of nature"" (I can't thnk of another discription that would not give away too much of the plot) whose initials only are very telling.Personally I prefer ""The Shawshank redemption"", which is more of a psycholigical drama. This is not to say that ""The green mile"" is only plot driven. With a running time of more than 3 hours Darabont takes his time to make individuals of his characters.In ""The green mile"" the guards are on average much more friendly than in ""The Shawshank ... "". There is one exception by the name of Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). I think in preparing for his role Doug has taken a good look at Donald Sutherland as Attila in ""Novecento"" (1976, Bernardo Bertolucci)."
cliff-19,"Aug 29, 2001",4/10,"I use that expression cautiously and deliberately. This film hides its massive illogic and implausibility behind emotional manipulativeness and cheap tear-jerker tricks. Fans of the film who may be reading this will naturally object as though I am invalidating their tears. But please consider that your tears were coaxed out by a crude setup. Some complaints: 1. Where on earth would one find such compassionate prison guards? To quote Mahathir Muhammad, ""Either one gets callouses on one's heart or you bleed to death."" 2. In the South of 1935, not even the white liberals would treat a black man with such dignity, let alone prison guards. 3. How would a patrician white woman thank an illiterate and dirty black man for saving her life? With a hug? 4. Once John Coffey sees Wild Bill, why would his only words be,""He's a bad man!""? Why did he say nothing? 5. After visiting Coffey's lawyer, why did Paul say nothing to any legal authority? 6. The execution of Delacroix was annoyingly unrealistic. A botched execution (and there have been many) would never be anywhere nearly as gruesome. 7. Finally, and this is the point at which I hated the movie, there were MANY opportunities for the guards to get Coffey's case re-opened, even if he didn't cooperate. But that would have turned it into a courtroom drama, not a religious-like story of redemption, suffering and eternal punishment."
snexy,"Oct 10, 2001",8/10,"Having doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours can be death to a film).I was so surprised that I didn't look at my watch once throughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. If you haven't seen this get it out now,forget about the running time and connections to 'The Shawshank Redemption' and enjoy it for what it is, a little miracle. 4 out of 5"

olivercripps,"Oct 5, 2019",10/10,"Absolutely sensational, a masterpiece on all fronts."
undeaddt,"Feb 6, 2019",8/10,"With this movie Tom Hanks proves why he is one of the all time best male actors that shook the world with their abnormal amazing acting roles. Among the TOP 100 IMDB rated movies, he has probably more than 4-5, including The Green Mile, Forest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, Captain Philips was also an amazing movie. But the spotlight in The Green Mile is reserved for Michael Clarke Duncan in the role of John Coffey. Nobody can count the amount of people that this person made cry in the early 2000's. He is the most adoring male human being that showed up on the movie screen in this century, his acting is out of this world and emotions are leaking out of every cell of his body. The fact that the actor died 7 years ago makes everyone 10 times more sad....rest in piece legend. Above all, we must not forget that this is another movie based on a Stephen King novel that succeded big time, which shows why we may consider King as the best novel writer of all time."
undsiebzig,"Sep 7, 2019",10/10,"OMG! This movie has it all. The story, the characters, the setting. It's just such an emotional tear-jerker. I cannot understand how someone can dislike this movie. I can highly recommend this, I can guarantee you this will force you to reflect your own character as well as the choices the movie figures make."
Xstal,"Mar 28, 2023",7/10,"The Great Depression sets the seen for what's to come, inside a prison, on Death Row where men succumb, to the charges that they're passed, other states might have them gassed, either way, they've had their day, thy will be done. Then John Coffey walks the mile and takes a cell, a gentle giant, quite un-defiant, casts a spell; as the residents reduce, restorative magic is produced, in a place, no one should face, a living hell. At the end you might just be at a small loss, was the chair a metaphor for some old cross, or perhaps you might compute, that it's wrong to execute, or just maybe, you'd like to, electrocute."
ttornak,"Feb 7, 2009",5/10,"It's hard NOT to like the green mile. It's like kicking a sweet puppy.The actors are fine, with great performances, the locations are well done, good camera-work and the movie doesn't get (too) boring. If you have half a heart, you will care for the characters and although I cringed a bit at the depiction of another ""simple black man"", you can't accuse the movie of racism, not after they show his lawyer. Overall a nice movie, but...Amongst other things, the movie expects you to believe in miracles, not just one, a bucket load of them.Goody prison wardens and goody prison guards. The guards are all the same, full of mercy and the nicest guys in town. I was half expecting a song and dance act of the guards down the aisle with the prisoners joining in and the mouse doing pirouettes in front of them.The only 2 people in this movie that are ""bad"" you can only feel sorry for. One is a deranged psycho that doesn't seem to enter sanity or reason for a second, the other is a prison guard that is a little jerk that gets slapped around all the time and even tries to change his ways... then gets his feelings hurt, damn.The movie is clearly anti-death penalty as I am, but this isn't the way to present the case."
antmvaughn,"Oct 22, 2018",10/10,"This movie was so well done, always enjoy watching it."
stallone-9,"Mar 29, 2008",9/10,Frank Darabont directs another masterpiece adapted by a Steven King novel.Sheer brilliance at its finest.Tom Hanks makes perhaps his greatest performance as the corrections officer Paul Edgecombe who doesn't believe in miracles until he sees one.While Tom and the others all shine in their roles I think that Michael Clarke Duncan deserves most credit as his magnificent portrayal of John Coffey-a convicted 8 foot tall giant murderer.He is accused in the killing of two little girls and sentenced to death.With time however Paul starts to wonder if the gentle hearted Coffey really did commit the murder.The movie has so many emotional moments that it's hard not to sympathize with the characters.The deep emotional drama of some of them is mentally pressuring and you become connected with these people - again expertly accomplished by Darabont who perfectly understands the source material and sticks close to it.Like Shawshank before it the movie teaches us the value of human life and how strong each one of us can be.This is achieved here similarly as again there is an innocent man put in prison but unlike Andy John is touched by God.He is a magical being who calls forth sympathy and by the end the audience is so аttached to him that the somewhat tragic ending is quite sad.As his previous movie Mr Darabont creates yet another fantastic film sure to stay in your heart for a while.Steven King should be proud.
pceli-71314,"Jan 4, 2019",10/10,One of the best movies I've ever seen. 3 hours that keep you attached to the screen. It's one of those movies that whenever I see it will not bother me

This masterpiece is also ,one of the reasons,why I concidere Stephen King for the greatest american writter!"
Joeyistheman,"May 6, 2011",10/10,This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. do not be put off of watching this movie because of its run time(3 hours) because those 3 hours will just fly by as this movie is so interesting and such a huge success. tom hanks is the main character but i think that Micheal Clarke Duncan really does steal the spotlight away from him. Stephen kings novel (with the same title) is not as good as the movie but it still stands tall i would recommend viewing this little gem if you're a fan of tom hanks or Stephen king.i have never watched a movie that has made me cry but i have to say i was very close to tears after the undeniable ending.the script is just outstanding and the acting is spot on.the storyline is very original as i have never seen anything like this before and i don't think anyone will ever try to copy it.if you're thinking about viewing this title and you haven't seen it already i suggest you get the tissues ready.
Brogan,"Nov 24, 1999",N/A,"People would think that this film from the same director as THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, that this is another prison film.  Well, it isn't. SHAWSHANK was more about a man's search for hope.  The director, Frank Darabont, new film THE GREEN MILE, isn't about a prison, but about a miracle that happens in a prison.  This is a outstanding film that shows what a miracle that could, or we wish that could happen, and how would mankind treat it. The story is based on the Stephen King novel, where it takes place on ""E"" block of a prison in Louisiana.  The ""E"" block is the death row, also known as ""the green mile.""  On the mile, the chief of the security is Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), a sympathetic guard who cares about the health of most of his prisoners.  Paul has fellow kind and friendly guards at the mile which include, Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), and Harry Terwilleger (Jeffrey DeMunn).  There is one rotten apple in the bunch of guards, and his name is Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison).  Percy doesn't care about anybody but himself.  Percy is cruel to the inmates, and loves to taunt them. One day a new convict arrives to the ""green mile,"" a seven foot and 300 pound black man named John Coffey (Michael Duncan Clark).  Coffey (sounds like the drink, spelled different)was convicted of killing two young girls. But when Paul talks and meets Coffey, he believes that Coffey didn't kill the two young girls.  But that is only a part of the story.  There's a secret in Coffey that is a blessing or a miracle.  Whatever you call it, it's highly unusual for someone to have, and it does good towards humanity. THE GREEN MILE has ""classic"" written all over it.  This is a truly fantastic film!  Despite it's 3 hour plus running time, it's the fastest paced 3 hour film since TITANIC.  The story and character's grab your intrest, that time doesn't matter to you.  You're more concerned about the people.  That element alone is a sign of success. Frank Darabont tells a strongly dramatic film that isn't about a prison, but takes place in one.  It's a very emotional film, yet you would walk out of the film not only falling in love with it, but somewhat happy. Darabont does a excellent job of detailing the character's and their feelings and  traits.  And like SHAWSHANK, Darabont does a magnificent job on adapting the work of Stephen King.  If I was Stephen King, I would have only Frank Darabont direct the film adaptations of my stories from now on. But the acting is also worthy of picking up golden statues.  Tom Hanks is different and great as the very kind and caring prison guard.  So are his fellow guards (Morse, Pepper, and DeMunn).  James Cromwell is also excellent as the prison warden who isn't the ""stereotyped"" warden.  And Michael Jeter is quite good as the mousy prisoner Eduard Delaeriox, who's best friend is a mouse.  But two faces or actors stand out in this film.  First is Doug Hutchison, who is very cruel and creepy as the evil guard.  His character of Percy, is the type of villian that you would love to see him get punished.  And the other actor who stands out is Michael Duncan Clark.  Clark is huge, yet he's very emotional and gentle as Coffey that the audience does feel a certain kind of kinship towards him.  You care about Coffey, that you also would believe Paul that Coffey can't be a murderer. I was extremely pleased with this classic. This has Oscar for Best Picture (winning, not nomminated) all over it. It is indeed over 3 hours, yet you'll feel a lot different after watching this movie.  It's a excellent tale about miracles, that happen in the most unlikely places.  And if they do happen, don't abuse them, bless them.  THE GREEN MILE, is paved with gold!  DO NOT MISS IT!!!!!! ***** (out of five)"
joachimokeefe,"Mar 3, 2008",6/10,"It's not all negative; the period feel is strong, if very middle-class (the sharecroppers have a phone???), and so are the ensemble performances. The Green Mile unquestionably does a good job of pressing the right emotional response buttons for entertainment purposes. So does 'Bambi'. My problem with TGM is the amount of disbelief that has to be suspended to enjoy it. In Disney cartoons you know that anything is allowed to be possible, it's an animation. In TGM it's completely obvious - and completely unnecessary - that John Coffey is holding a light bulb in the 'help' moments; it's completely obvious that his breathing out the 'badness' is gratuitous CGI; couldn't they just have left him and the others to ACT it? The overwrought SFX turn Coffey's miracles into cheap sideshow stunts. Don't get me started on the mouse, by which the cardboard characters are upstaged. TOO MUCH MOUSE!It's a shame that the script characterisations are totally subservient to the sentimental story, like in a pantomime. Cold Mountain Block D managed to recruit the most liberal-minded bunch of warders in the country - but not one of them ever has a twinge of conscience, let alone any sense of smell! The only point where a character seems to get complicated is when the oh-so-nasty nephew turns co-operative for five minutes after striking a bargain with Tom Hanks. He soon reverts to stereotype. The rest of the film they all just follow paths that wouldn't be out of place in a high school nativity play. At no time does any of these sensitive, earnest death row wardens question the morality of capital punishment - from either end, even to get slapped down. Nobody criticises it, nobody justifies it, it's just not an issue, even in the modern, smell-less old folk's home at the beginning. You're left with the conclusion that in spite of all their caring, sharing postures, that those warders are just pretending, and just want to see those guys fry, like waiters longing for the last customer to leave. And so you stop believing their good intentions, and your disbelief is suspended. Same as I felt when I saw that poster covering the hole waving in the draft in 'Shawshank'. The morality of capital punishment is an elephant in the room that TGM and its sensitive, liberal characters ignore - apart from the attorney - he had the right degree of bloodlust.TGM is effective as broad entertainment, but the reality of the situations (execution, racism) it deals with is so horrible that you almost want to shout ""stop sugar-coating it!"" at the screen. Tom Hanks - his usual dependable, if ever-so-slightly bland performance - experiences ten times more pain from his NSU than from the gruesome job he does, and the ghastly system he is a pillar of. And the reason TGM takes so long between story beats (how many times must we see him screw that thing on his head, already!) is that if it didn't, the paper-thin story would crash and burn in an hour. Don't take it as seriously as it takes itself, it's a well-dramatised piece of mummery."
Guile`,"Feb 8, 2001",5/10,"This has got to be one of the most overrated movies of all time.  It didn't suck really bad, IMO, but was just plain average - and on the boring side of that.  I didn't find it very emotionally moving, and I thought it was quite ""cheesy"".  I didn't get really involved and enveloped into the movie as one would when watching a truly great film, and I even say this in a nice big theatre too.  This movie just didn't turn my crank, it was very predictable, was not very thought provoking, and I'm very surprised there aren't more mixed reviews at least from the users of this site...The Green Mile is NOWHERE CLOSE to The Shawshank Redemption, and shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence as an emotionally powerful masterpiece such as that.  Granted that neither film is meant to appeal to your intellectual side, but more to your emotions - this film even fails at that, in my opinion.  Perhaps I just couldn't get into it because it was too cheesy...Overall, this was a disappointing film, and I know I'm not the only one who thinks that as well.  Based on people I've spoken with, this film should have more mixed reviews rather than the overwhelming praise it seems to have got."
TheLittleSongbird,"Feb 27, 2011",9/10,"I am starting to like Stephen King's work more now, and I read the book. A wonderful book, that is faithfully(mostly) adapted into an equally wonderful film. My only complaint of The Green Mile is the length, I do think it is too long. However, The Green Mile is a film that is haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing.The film is beautifully directed by Frank Darabont(director of the slightly superior The Shawshank Redemption), is beautifully shot with a foreboding setting and atmospheric cinematography and lighting and has an engrossing and haunting story that is well-paced too. Thomas Newman's score is positively hypnotic and very beautiful, with some great authentic song choices, my favourite being Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams(And Dream Your Troubles Away).The script is thoughtful too, and the movie also has a big emotional impact without feeling manipulative, I honestly couldn't help crying at the end of the movie. I have to say as well, the execution scenes were really quite harrowing. The performances are strong, Tom Hanks is excellent as the warden, as is Doug Hutchison who gives a credibility and complexity to a character that could have easily been clichéd and David Morse as Brutus. But Michael Clarke Duncan is the actor I want to give the real kudos to, he has a wonderful character and he absolutely nails it.Overall, a very, very good movie. Had it been shorter, it would have been perfect. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
Rockford_6,"Aug 19, 2008",9/10,"Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. The Green Mile isn't a movie about hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects."
santhosh_ssr,"Aug 9, 2013",10/10,"The Green Mile.... Yet another movie which made me cry.Outstanding work by Frank Darabont. Both his prison dramas ""The Green Mile"" & ""The Shawshank Redemption"" are real class!This film is beautifully written and perfectly cast. Michael Clarke Duncan delivers the performance of his career. There are scenes in this film that will make you quiver, and there are scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat until you cry.Tom Hanks once again provides a strong support for a talented ensemble cast.Darabont's skills as a screenwriter that even after three hours, he can bring the film to such a good, solid conclusion."
alekspredator87,"Jul 17, 2022",10/10,"""The Green Mile"" is one of the most famous and excellent film adaptations of the works of the master of horror Stephen King. Choosing this movie to watch, you immerse yourself in the beautifully rendered world of the last century, where prisoners are waiting in the wings in a prison cell. And the guards are represented by a variety of images. And each of these images shows us completely diverse and well-developed stories. Those that allow you to get into the soul of each hero.Frank Darabont's magnificent production lasts more than three hours. However, this story will not have enough shorter timekeeping to introduce the audience to the whole picture. However, the film does not seem to be drawn out at all. He moves in a good narrative manner, with well-staged scenes, elaborate dialogues that allow you to get to know the characters from several sides. The accuracy of the frame, the lighting, the prison atmosphere - everything is shown very interestingly.The cast is full of famous names, among which the main decoration, of course, are two for me personally: Michael Clarke Duncan and Tom Hanks. The first one plays a good-natured big man accused of murdering little girls, who does not pull at all like a murderer. The second is the head of the security shift. Throughout the picture, their interaction, dialogues leave a feeling of some kind of restrained warmth and barely perceptible sympathy for each other. Hanks is ready to believe in the innocence of the hero Duncan, and he is ready to help with the warden's illness.Separately, I would like to say about the hero Doug Hutchison. He played Warden Percy. In general, I have my own attitude to this actor after the role in the series ""The X-Files"", where he played Victor Eugene Tooms, a nasty and nasty character. But in this film, the actor has reached a definitely new level. He conveyed the image so well that to this day, remembering the film ""The Green Mile"", I shudder from the memory of this warden. I think that this is a great actor's performance, if the viewer has such emotions.The picture, of course, is not complete without some mystical and even fantastic component. It is very skillfully and organically woven into the canvas of the work, makes you think whether what happened in the performance of the hero Duncan is real or not. And these moments are so successful that there is no doubt that the story is authentic.""The Green Mile"" was nominated for 4 Oscars, but did not receive any. It is sad. After all, among the awards could be the Best film and the Best supporting actor. These would be worthy victories. But this is not very important when you know that such a picture rightfully occupies one of the highest places in the ratings of all films that have ever existed. The film will not leave anyone indifferent, will give a lot of emotions, will allow you to look at the characters from unusual angles. The viewer will understand that not all people behind bars are the ultimate villains, and the police are completely human and represent justice and truth. I think that this film is mandatory for everyone to watch.10 out of 10."
atgooder,"Apr 22, 2022",10/10,"I'm not usually the type of person that writes reviews like this but after watching this movie, I felt it needed one.When I first heard about ""The Green Mile"", I didn't think too much about it since it was over three hours long and didn't believe it was worth my time. People were telling me that it was a good movie and I like Tom Hanks as an actor so I finally took the time to watch it and I gotta say. In my opinion, I found it to be one of the best Tom Hanks films I had seen in my entire life. The whole three hours my eyes were glued to my TV. I laughed, I cried, I pretty much felt different emotions throughout the entire movie that made it an adventure for me. The actors gave an amazing performance and the storyline was a mystery that I was trying to piece together the entire length of the film. By the end, I was in absolute tears when the scene was taking place. It was an emotional rollercoaster that kept me on the edge of my seat up until the credits started rolling. Although the movie is slow, it definitely meets the criteria for my top 10 movies that I've ever seen. It is definitely not a waste of three hours. So sit back, relax and prepare for a crazy mystery that will leave you wondering what will happen next."
ronakkotian,"Sep 25, 2020",8/10,"Frank Darabont has given us some classic films like The Shawshank Redemption and whilst The Green Mile isn't as great, it's still an emotionally moving experience.The Green Mile shows the lives of several guards of Death Row and how the arrival of a prisoner named John Coffey, who has mysterious powers, affects them.Regarded as an absolute classic, The Green Mile is sure to tug on your heartstrings. Whilst the film may be three hours long, the emotional weight that this film brings is sure to make you cry. Frank Darabont's direction is great. You really feel transported to this place and Darabont conveys the cruel nature of the death penalty as honest as possible. The execution scenes involving the electric chair can be hard to watch especially one which becomes quite unsettling. The film does a great job making the audience care about the characters. Whilst the character of Del has done bad deeds, you still care about him after seeing his relationship with the guards and what eventually happens to him. My main issue with this film stems from its runtime. I think it's way too long and because of how long it was, I lost interest during some parts.The performances were stellar from everybody. Tom Hanks is great as usual and played Paul Edgecomb really well. However, the real star of this film is Michael Clarke Duncan. Despite his large nature, Duncan really manages to make Coffey seem as vulnerable and sympathetic as possible. He truly does a great job and is the trigger for tears streaming down many people's faces. Michael Jeter is terrific as Del and once again makes the audience sympathetic towards him. Both Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell did a great job as their characters and made us feel very hateful towards them.The Green Mile does drag with its three hour runtime but at the same time it's one of the most heartfelt and emotionally gripping films I've seen. It's certainly worth a watch."
AnglsBbgrl,"Dec 12, 2002",N/A,"I love this movie, and I have seen it a couple times. It doesn't matter that I know what is going to happen or that I know the movie like the back of my hand, I cry endlessly every single time. I watched it again last night. My boyfriend and I bought it, and he had never seen it. So we sat down to watch the movie, and I realized how truly emotionally moving this movie is.IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE ENTIRETY OF THE MOVIE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER DOWN...The characters in this movie really hit home. You fall in love with these men that are on death row..(all except for ""Wild Bill""). You don't know what on earth they have done, yet it is so bad that they are on death row, and you fall in love with them. You can't help it. I sat there last night, propped up on my pillow in the bed and watched and fell in love with this huge beast of a man that is convicted of raping and murdering two girls. (I knew from the get-go that he didn't do it). And I watched and fell in love with Dale, a French, homosexual, crazy, mouse-loving man. I watched him fall in love with Mr. Jingles. I grew into this hate for Percy ""WET""more (I still get a kick out of that name). And when it came time for Dale to be executed, I cried like I was losing a family member. It was so hard to watch this happen! My boyfriend had to pause the movie, just to check on me. I sat there for five minutes, crying so hard. Then the same thing for John Coffey, I couldn't even watch him be persecuted. I sat beside my boyfriend, face buried in his chest weeping every tear out of me. It was so awful. I have NEVER in my life had a movie effect me like the way this one does. It is a brilliant movie, and the characters chosen for each role could not have been better portrayed if this was a true story, with the real-life people playing their own parts. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and personally I think he does his best when he is acting as a southern authority figure. He is such a convincing actor, along with everyone else in this movie. Props to the actors, director, and Stephen King, you all are wonderful!"
mrcastle-68049,"Sep 21, 2021",7/10,Keeps you locked in from start to finish. Duncan and Hanks knock it outta the park.
Pearson,"Dec 29, 1999",5/10,"How ""The Green Mile"" can possibly be ranked in the IMDB's Top 30 as of this writing completely escapes me. It's a commendable film for the most part, but lacks the immediacy and intricacy of ""Shawshank Redemption"" (which is nonetheless ALSO hilariously overpraised by IMDB voters) and plods along a little too deliberately. It also sells itself out to schmaltz in the final third. The acting, particularly that of the villains, saves the film; and to be fair the level of sloppy sentiment isn't as pronounced as that of the original book's. In a landmark year of cinematic breakthroughs, though, ""The Green Mile"" was a step backward, the same way ""Titanic"" was."
alexandrugarlea,"Dec 15, 2020",10/10,"Everything about this one is perfect. From beginning to end. Had to give it 10 stars because it had exactly what we need, as humans, walking through the Green Mile.
Not to mention the soundtrack, which is by far one of the most inspired themes I've heard in a while.
I've seen this movie 21 years later than it appeared. With that said, for those who are afraid of watching ""old"" movies. Don't be scared. Watch all the old movies!
Top, top, top movie!"
bcent-2,"Nov 23, 1999",10/10,"I sat in the free preview with a tears in my eyes for the full  three hours. This movie has got to be the best book to movie adaptation I have ever been privileged to see.  The casting was incredible and Michael Duncan as John Coffey was dead on.  No glitzy camera work or snazzy editing, just deep, deep story.  You feel for these characters and hate to see the movie end.  I read the book that took six months to deliver the goods, the movie did not disappoint.  Great job Mr. Darabont and Mr. King.  Just like with The Shawshank Redemption, you made me look at life a little differently.  I would recommend that everyone see this movie."

chiragrathod09,"Jul 18, 2024",10/10,"""The Green Mile,"" directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novel, is a poignant and powerful film that delves into themes of justice, compassion, and the supernatural.Set in a Louisiana penitentiary during the 1930s, the story revolves around Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), a prison guard who oversees death row inmates awaiting execution. When a gentle giant named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is convicted of a heinous crime, Paul and his fellow guards (played by David Morse, Barry Pepper, and Jeffrey DeMunn) soon discover that John possesses miraculous healing powers and a profound innocence that challenges their perceptions of justice and humanity.Tom Hanks delivers a stellar performance as Paul Edgecomb, capturing the character's moral dilemma and internal struggle with integrity and empathy. Michael Clarke Duncan's portrayal of John Coffey is equally compelling, portraying a character who is both enigmatic and deeply sympathetic.The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the characters' emotions and moral dilemmas. Darabont's direction creates a somber and introspective atmosphere, effectively contrasting the harsh realities of the prison system with moments of profound grace and compassion.""The Green Mile"" explores profound questions about guilt, redemption, and the nature of evil. It challenges viewers to confront their own beliefs about justice and mercy, especially in the face of extraordinary circumstances.The film is rich in detail, capturing the period setting with authenticity and enhancing the emotional impact of its narrative. The soundtrack, composed by Thomas Newman, complements the film's mood with its evocative and haunting melodies.""The Green Mile"" is a masterful adaptation that resonates long after the credits roll. It combines exceptional performances, thought-provoking themes, and a compelling storyline to create a deeply moving cinematic experience. For those who appreciate thought-provoking dramas that explore complex moral issues, ""The Green Mile"" remains a timeless classic."
thompd09,"Apr 29, 2011",9/10,"My Plot Summary:The Green Mile, set in the 1930s, is about the mental and physical health effects of working on death row. In this film the guards encounter many different men that have been put to death for various crimes. It isn't until they come across a black gentleman that has been falsely accused of raping and murdering two young girls, that they begin to really have second thoughts about execution. This inmate has the magnificent gift of healing through his faith. A mix of the inmate's gift, and the fact that he is innocent, causes the guards to question whether or not this man should be executed. The situations a person encounters in their profession can affect them for the rest of their lives. Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks, is the supervisor on death row, a dimly lit, dungeon-like building. Edgecomb has suffered major effects from the many executions that he has taken part in. He encounters a once in a lifetime experience when John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is sent to the Green Mile to await his execution. John Coffey is a very large and intimidating man that is extremely soft at heart. All this man wants is peace in his life from all of the hurt that is going on in the world around him. He has been blessed with the gift of healing. While he tries to help all he can he learns that it is impossible to help everyone. Paul Edgecomb's fellow prison guards are of varying personalities. Brutus Howell, played by David Morse, is a large man who has been given the nickname ""Brutal"" due to his size. In spite of the fact that he is a tall man, and somewhat intimidating, he is a kind man that comes to second guess the ruling for the execution of John Coffey. Percy Wetmore, played by Doug Hutchison, is an all around jerk who is all bark and no bite. This is proved when one of the more violent inmates grabs hold of one of his co-workers while he stands there shaking in his boots. Percy's interaction with the inmates causes John Coffey to dislike him. As a result, John Coffey has decided to ""infect"" Percy with an ailment that he cured a person of. Percy lashes out on another inmate, kills him, and then releases his ""infection."" Percy, in the end, ends up going to a mental hospital.My Review:The Green Mile, starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, and Michael Clarke Duncan, is a brilliantly written and produced piece of work. The choice of actors and actresses along with their exquisite performances could not have been better. The lighting and angles made the viewing of the movie a one of a kind experience. The artistic dimness of the lights, and dull colors within the walls of the Green Mile made this film all the more believable. It gives the viewers the sense of doom and dread that is felt by the inmates knowing that their lives are soon coming to an end because of the crimes they have committed. John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, delivered the most convincing, amazing, and overall ground breaking performance in this film. In spite of his extra large stature, Coffey is a kind, soft hearted man who brings a lot of heart-felt emotion to the Green Mile. The attachment that the guards develop to Coffey makes it extremely hard for them to carry out his execution; there was not a dry eye amongst the guards. This film shows that any situation that is encountered in a person's profession, whether it is mental or physical, can affect them for the remainder of their lives. These men face the biggest moral obstacle they will ever come across in their lifetimes. When asked by Paul Edgecomb how he is to answer for the execution of John Coffey, he is assured by the large, gifted inmate that it is OK to execute him, that it will end his pain and he wants it to be carried out. All he wants is to end the feelings he has every day because of all of the violence and hurt in the world around him. This film is, by far, one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. There was laughter, tears, and amazement throughout the entirety of this film. The performance of the cast of The Green Mile was above and beyond my expectations of a film that deals with a prison setting. Tom Hanks, along with the many other actors and actresses will leave you begging for more. If you have not seen this brilliant piece of work, then it should be added to your list of must see movies for the year because it is guaranteed to please! If you liked Shawshank Redemption you will love this."
harrylosborne,"Feb 6, 2021",7/10,"Stephen King never spins a bad tale, and The Green Mile is one of his most endearing, probably helping its widespread likeability.It's a film you won't be able to find many flaws with, but also isn't something I think will blow people away.All the acting is decent, but nobody blows you away: I would argue that the best performance probably comes from James Cromwell as the warden (a fairly minor role). The story does feel slightly dumbed down (I imagine King's original retelling doesn't hold so much of the feel-good factor), and the flashback premise is something I'm not a massive fan of, but otherwise this is a solid flick.The CGI has held up, and the characters give a clear direction of who to root for. It also doesn't skimp on the violence (however infrequent), and no doubt this is a plot you have not seen before; all in all, you can't go wrong watching this, provided you've got three hours."
Deanjones1970,"Nov 14, 2012",10/10,"The Green Mile was definitely one of the best movies of the year. With the character driven storyline, all of the characters played well, to the mix of joy, laughter and sadness. This is one of those movies where every single actor puts their all into their craft. It was interesting that this was taken from a book that Steven king wrote being that it seems he writes a lot of horror and thriller books. I did not get a chance to read the book but i have heard it is almost perfectly taken from the book with just a few parts taken out that didn't improve the movie. Some people have complained that it was too long around 3 hours but i believe that is what made it even better. the way the story flowed and the skills of the actors the movie did not feel like it was slow and dragged on. The movie wasn't about the friendships on the green mile but it was more of a miracle of a man and the people he effects. When Michael Clarke Duncan's character gets convicted of a crime and is placed on the green mile everyone is in awe of not just his size but how humble and mild mannered he is. When a few miraculous events take place the guards start to think he has magical powers gifted to him from god. With all the things the happened and his attitude the guards start to doubt that he did the crime he has been convicted of. The message I got from this was that there is clear that there is injustice and the miracles can happen in the unexpected of places. One thing I also noticed was the depiction of the relationship of the guards and inmates. They all seemed like friends they seem to have been treated with respect and dignity and because of that they seemed to not have as many problems that you may have in other prisons. Weather that was because of the beliefs of King or the director or both that we should treat our prisoners better so that they don't end up back in prison and not as violent while they are in it. This film will get you to think about its subjects and gradually build on you. This will be a movie that will be hard to forget even after the credits have ended."
Gagy,"Mar 24, 2006",10/10,"It is difficult sometimes to watch long movies, because just a few of them are so tense to rivet you to television for more then two hours, but this one really does, it shows you the way how to understand the people around you! It is story about human character,their life and believing...It shows how we react on things that just happen without reason, things that we can't explain even if we see it by our own eyes. It is true like movie tells us- it is difficult to find miracle or better that miracle find us, but if we do, we don't believe in it or worse we destroy(kill) it! Great act by Tom Hanks like always, role of a good family person, who help those around him, person who stands up for his convictions, is written all over his skin, actually whole crew that cared about prison was picked up very carefully and they really made a great entirety...great story by Mr. King...maybe a little unusual for his writing, but one more reason to congratulate him for this one! We all walk down the (our) green mile, but it seems too long sometimes...I hope they both will have a very long walk and let us to enjoy in their writing and acting! Really great movie!"
Wuchakk,"Aug 19, 2011",9/10,"""The Green Mile"" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; ""The Green Mile"" is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.THE STORY: Tom Hanks plays the head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression. A new inmate is introduced, a hulking black man named John Coffey (exquisitely played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. Hanks and his guard friends slowly become intrigued by the seemingly pure-hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way; they conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. If that's the case, who is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.""The Green Mile"" is a 3-hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable. Please don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama.*** SPOILER ALERT *** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey)John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means ""winged creature."" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. In truth, John is an obvious type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1.) His initials are J.C. (2.) He's completely pure/good-hearted and can easily recognize true evil. (3.) He miraculously heals people. (4.) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5.) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6.) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse ""Mr. Jingles.""*** End SPOILER ALERT ***BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, ""The Green Mile"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. Now please excuse me while I wipe the tears from my face."
theindustry,"Dec 25, 2011",10/10,"Truly a wonderful picture. I agree with what most people on here are saying: this film, along with Shawshank define great American cinema. Both pictures are ingenious in their conception -kudos to master writer Stephen King - and really spark more than just entertainment. This is not ars gratia artis, art for arts sake; it's art for the sake of humanity; for portraying brilliant stories that center around human interactions in the most inhuman of places. If anyone stumbles on this review, understand that there are few similarly heart-wrenching films out there. Others have pointed out more, and I agree. But these stand out among the rest, and that is indisputable.If you are a film enthusiast that has not seen these films, or if you are just looking for a great flick, look no further. Definitely rent or buy these films for they are pearls of American cinema.Enjoy!"
hamsolo-07326,"Sep 29, 2018",10/10,MCD was an amazing actor. Seriously could not believe my eyes when I watched this film. One of my all-time favorites. It will have you in tears I'm sure! And Tom Hanks is good as always in what was a very sensitive role.
Jasper76,"Aug 24, 2008",9/10,"I think I got the message of the film after about 45 minutes; that there is so much hatred and anger among people, and that revenge is nothing constructive. A very important message which I think the film delivers brilliantly, with John Coffey as a ""triumphant card"". The supernatural effects in the movie might be unbelievable if you focus solely on them, but I think they're ""metaphoring"" and make things a bit more understandable, maybe. A wonderful movie that moves at a measured pace on to a very unexpected ending. As with most great movies the casting is almost perfect and each character gives added depth to a rich script. Tom Hanks gives another outstanding performance, his supporting actors (particularly David Morse)actually support and enhance his role. A really great story - not at all what I expected, but much more."

First it is a three hour movie that never gets boring, second it has great writing that is comparable to The Dark Knight, and third the characters are lovable and you actually care about them. The acting from both Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan was excellent and you could tell that they actually wanted this movie to succeed. It is a very somber film that you will remember for years. I think this is one of the rare moments when the movie was better than the source material. I hope that years later this movie will be remembered as one of the best movies ever made."

fredrikgunerius,"Aug 24, 2025",9/10,"The second of three pairings between filmmaker Frank Darabont and author Stephen King, following the surprise hit The Shawshank Redemption five years earlier. Again, King and Darabont examine life in American prisons during the mid-20th century, and again the key themes are male camaraderie, morality, and mortality. At three hours, The Green Mile affords itself the luxury of presenting its characters and building up its story slowly and patiently. It's a risky move by Darabont that requires considerable skill - both in creating an atmosphere in which his actors can thrive, and in finding a pacing that ensures a constant sense of progression. He succeeds wonderfully on both counts. The Green Mile is about as close as you can come to flawless novelistic cinema: the film draws you in, glides effortlessly from subplot to subplot, and invites you into the minds of its richly drawn characters much like a good novel does. It's a page-turner filled with poignant drama, multifaceted personalities, and an elegantly rendered dose of magic realism. A simultaneously uplifting and sombre tale, elevated by a brilliant ensemble cast, many of whom deliver career-best performances."
miabroughton,"Sep 23, 2022",10/10,"This film is up there with the best films again I have ever watched, I'm not suprised that it's rated so highly on teh IMDB list.I just absolutley loved everything about this film but i'll start with the charaters. They were so beautifully developed. Tom Hanks character, even though he sent peple to death hewas still extremley respectful and kind to those who were to be executed. This made his character so admirable and liked him instantaniously. Then Micheal Duncan and his character was portrayed so fantastically. His performance was so emotional as he was so innocent it was extremley moving to watch.I very very very highly reccomend this film, wach it at least once in your lifetime you won't regret it."
ROK,"Sep 3, 2000",N/A,"Well I've just this second finished watching the Green Mile, and felt I must post something. The acting was superb and Michael Clarke Duncan should definitely have got the Oscar. Tom Hanks was as great as ever and the other supporting cast were to a man perfect for the roles.  This was film making at it's best, it may have been 3 hours but it didn't seem like it. I've seen films a fraction of that length that have dragged interminably.The scene of the last execution ( I won't say who's encase you haven't seen it yet ) was one of the most moving I've ever seen.The story while involved was engrossing and the effects spectacular. More over it was a story of hope and good overcoming evil. And will definitely be a must buy when it's released on ""Sell Thru"""
Fiona G.,"Apr 21, 2000",3/10,"""The Green Mile"" tries hard to be a nice movie, to steer your emotions, to feel along. Etc. Everybody who is nice simply is nice, character depth is secondary. What completely ridicules the entire thing is the influence of fantasy elements to enlighten the atmosphere. Not only is everybody nice, but heah, with some special abilities they are even nicer!Technically the movie is of course well done. Camera, lights, everything is in the green. Unfortunately that doesn't make a good movie, when characters are simply created to fulfill general expectations. Although this simply seems to be a routine production to appeal to mass audiences, anyway, and of course it hits right on the target. That Hanks was in for a role here is understandable - his main aim nowaday seems to be building up his reputation with the Academy. For Duncan the decision was probably more difficult, he got to play the usual part of the black country guy. But a chance to get a role in a ""made to please the academy"" film is a hard thing to refuse, esp. when your co-star is Hanks and a name like Stephen King stands for the novel.It is much more reccomendable to watch ""Dead Man Walking"" for a good look on the topic, but of course if you felt along with the characters in Cameron's ""Titanic"" this is your thing to go for."
kannan-78269,"Jul 10, 2017",10/10,"Would rate it as one of the best movies I have seen. Its power lies in its simplicity of telling a story that would even make an atheist a believer.This story is though not about GOD, but goodness, humanity, faith, kindness, envy, friendship, innocence, honesty, desire, pain, succor and above all the power of doing good.This is a story so well entwined that you find characters that will fit every stereotype including the filth you can think of and also one that comes close to GOD and a cute mouse.I walked out feeling humbled and drove back home without one swear word at a jaywalker or a signal jumper."

There were many things that I did not know before but watching when I'm older, it all makes sense. Love all the acting esp from Tom Hank! I just found out that this plot is also based off on a real event that happened to a 14 year old African American boy. Went to search more about it on the internet and can't believed it took so long for him to get the justice he needed.Great film! Great acting from everyone. Great directing and soundtracks.

joakim-ericsson,"Sep 23, 2022",10/10,"It's sometimes difficult to know what's able to hit you hard, until it actually hits you. I haven't had such an emotional reaction to a movie since E. T. when I was 10 years old.First time I watched The Green Mile was a late, hot summer night. My girlfriend became too tired to watch a movie, so I decided to watch it by myself. Good call...Frank Darabont's script and direction is flawless from the first frame to the last. Production design and acting as well. Story is very compelling and hits on all the emotional notes you can imagine. For anyone that has a problem with ""the supernatural"" as an ingredient in a story it might not be as strong. But if that's not an issue, you are in for an emotional ride.If you ever had doubts about your deeds in life, and question if you are doing the right thing, with the potential of eternal judgement, this is a very strong story.At the end I found myself sobbing loudly and uncontrollable. I was stunned that it hit me so hard. Glad I didn't watch it in the cinema, that would have been embarrasing :DStill watch it at least ones a year, and though I can now control my reaction (because I know the story), it's still very moving and really makes me think about important stuff. Life, death, justice etc.Can't recommend it enough, but talking about it with others, it seems you are either gonna be destroyed by it (like I was), or just think it was a good film.My girlfriend got to see it the next day, but her reaction was nothing near mine. Remembering her reaction to ""Bridges"" though, which was uncontrollable.weeping, I realized that The Green Mile was basically a ""Bridges"" for men... At least some of us.Masterpiece!"

sspenny-85173,"Nov 25, 2020",10/10,"""The Green Mile, ""was the movie from 1999, which had been nominated by Oscar. The movie is adapted from Stephen King's novel of the same name. Through Tom Hanks acted a death row correction officer that make the movie full of exceptional. ""The Green Mile, ""is attractive based on story line, vivid character, reflection after finished the movie as well.
The story is about Paul Edgecomb as a death row correction officer. One day, John Coffey, a giant black man convicted by raping and kill two young white girls, arriving at the death row. John was full of mystery, unlike other prisoner, he was a kind, timid and lonely person. However, it happened a serious of miracles at the dead row.
The main character was acted by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, they were both a talented actor in 90's. They let Paul Edgecomb and John Coffey become more vivid in ""The Green Mile.""
After finished the movie, I had a lot of reflections and feelings. For instance, whether the death penalty is justice or not, like John Coffey, even if he was innocent, he could not escape his penalty. And the guilty in Paul Edgecomb.
There is one saddest line in the movie, John Coffey said, ""I am tired of people being ugly to each other, I am tired all of the pain."" In that scene, I cried with him. ""The Green Mile,"" is the classic in 90's, including the amazing story, lively character and reflection issues. It is one of my favorite movies, watching this movie at different stage of life will bring you different feeling."

drhemp,"Nov 17, 2024",7/10,"While The Green Mile may take its time to unfold, it's far from a bad film. Its deliberate pacing allows the story to build emotional depth, giving viewers the chance to connect with its richly drawn characters and weighty themes.At times, the film ventures into macabre territory, exploring the grim realities of death row and the darker sides of human nature. Yet, these moments are balanced by a profound sense of hope, compassion, and the supernatural, making the story both unsettling and uplifting in equal measure.Superbly acted by a stellar cast, led by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, The Green Mile is also a well-made film, with careful attention to detail in its direction, set design, and storytelling. This is not a movie for those seeking fast-paced thrills, but for those willing to let it unfold at its own pace, The Green Mile reveals itself to be a touching and thoughtful story that lingers long after the credits roll."

fredosteen,"Aug 6, 2022",10/10,"As a matured adult I experienced the film very differently. On the surface level, this film is about the brutal murder of two young girls which led a black man to be falsely accused of the crime and sentenced to death. The film delves into the relationships formed between the prisoners and the officers in charge, and the realization that he may be innocent of the crime. However, beneath the surface, the film is riddled with deep symbolism that makes it incredibly difficult to watch.The selection of cast members for this movie was expertly chosen - each one bringing a new layer of humanity to the overall story. Tom Hanks was breath-taking in his portrayal of Paul Edgecomb, the head guard on the mile who was greatly affected by the magical presence of John Coffey. Tom captured Paul's inner struggles beautifully and brought the character to life.The late Michael Clarke Duncan, who played John Coffey was mesmerising and I could not take my eyes off of him. His muscular physique and rough exterior made him perfect for the role but it was his ability to embody the mysterious and often naive nature of John Coffey's character that should have won him an Oscar. His character's growth throughout the film and his ultimate realisation that the only way to escape this unpleasant life is to go through with his execution are what made him so heart-wrenching to watch.Moreover, the underlying symbolism in this movie was expertly hidden and handled with care. Most notably was Mr Jingles, the little grey mouse who befriended inmate Edward Delacroix and offered him some relief from the pain he was facing as his impending execution was fast approaching, symbolising the child-like nature of the human spirit and our longing to cling to life. I found their interactions very heart-warming but it was his brutal execution that awoke a sense of hopelessness and sadness in me."
AndreaB-057,"Oct 1, 2025",10/10,"Simply gorgeous. The story is very faithful to the book.

Buddy-51,"Jul 14, 2000",N/A,"`The Green Mile,' since it is based on a Stephen King novel, emerges as a death row prison story with a sci-fi twist.  Chances are the viewer will either be swept up in this tale of life, death and spiritual renewal involving a group of characters working and languishing in a 1930's prison cell block - or dismiss it as a prime example of sentimental hooey.  Like the similar (and similarly overrated) Stephen King-inspired prison epic, `The Shawshank Redemption,' this new film provides far too sanitary and romanticized a vision of prison life to be either entirely convincing or particularly meaningful.  Indeed, `The Green Mile' goes a step further into the realm of parable by ascribing to one of its main characters the power of miraculous healing.  Unfortunately, however, a parable is, almost by definition, supposed to be short, pithy and to the point.  The story here - which runs a presumptuous 3 hours and 8 minutes - is so overstuffed with subplots and subsidiary characters that it actually works to weaken the emotional effect generated by the plight facing John Coffey, the innocent messenger from God condemned to death, and Paul, the prison guard assigned to run the death row cell block, who comes to learn of Coffey's innocence.`The Green Mile' certainly has its heart in the right place, but it divides its world too evenly up into good guys and bad guys.  Perhaps the decision to cast Tom Hanks in the leading role of Paul accounts for the fact that the character seems far too genial, soft-spoken and humanistic to be a man dedicating his life to dispatching convicted murderers to their just (or unjust) rewards.  Coffey, a mountain of a man in the form of actor Michael Clarke Duncan, ranks as the oldest cliché of all:  an uneducated, marginally imbecilic lug of a guy whose innocent, childlike heart and mind, though trapped inside a behemoth's body, provide the clean vessel through which God is able to work his wonders.  Except for this last fact, Coffey's pedigree descends from a whole multitude of earlier characters, including Lennie in `Of Mice and Men' and even Frankenstein's monster.  Is this possibly why `The Green Mile,' in deference to the former character, features a mouse in a prominent role?   Similarly, one doubts it is mere coincidence that the crime for which Coffey is convicted is that of raping and murdering two little girls, an echo of Frankenstein  - albeit, in this case, Coffey, of course, is innocent;  after all, having him be guilty of the brutal murders would muddy up the moral waters and make it a lot harder to elicit tears from a sentimental, happily rheumy-eyed audience.   Also, this allows the authors to pound home the Christ figure qualities of Coffey (John Coffey - JC - get it?) to an unsubtle fare-thee-well.  In addition to dying innocently for another's sins, Coffey gets to heal the sick and smite the evildoers (the latter, more in keeping with Jehovah perhaps than with Christ per se).Nor are the filmmakers much more successful with their villains.  Amidst all this amazing good will between condemned killers and supportive prison guards, there has to be some vinegar to cut the sweetness.  This comes in the form of a too neatly balanced duo, one a guard, the other a far-from-model prisoner.  The guard, Percy, is a craven, sadistic coward who delights in antagonizing the prisoners, taunting and torturing the men at the moment of execution and, most monstrously of all to the animal lovers in the audience, squashing a pet mouse on the eve of its owner's death.  The evil prisoner, Wild Bill, provides a similar two-dimensional quality to his wickedness, serving as a too-obvious foil for the other pure-as-the-driven-snow condemned men.  By so neatly divvying up the characters into clearly delineated categories of good and evil, the filmmakers rob their film of the moral complexity that might have lent it some real meaning.As to the film's rather startling and, initially unexpected, flights into fantasy, they serve mostly to further soften the edge of this already overly idealistic and mawkish story.`The Green Mile' is certainly not a `bad' film.  It sports a number of excellent performances, generates some moments of genuine emotional power and, though languorous at times in its pacing, admirably refuses to hurtle ahead as it patiently gathers the strands of its story together.  As with a good long novel, one approaches it with a sense of patience and goodwill. We want to give it the benefit of our attention.  Therefore, we regret even more that the makers of the film too often settle for the easy path of cheap emotionalism and simpleminded sentimentality.  Those of us willing to dedicate more than three precious hours to this particular cause deserve better."
ccthemovieman-1,"Sep 28, 2006",7/10,"This was such an intense movie that, at three hours in length, I didn't really wind up watching this as many times as I thought I would. This was another of those films I rated very high on the first viewing but lower and lower on the second and third looks, finally eliminating it from my collection. However, that first look was a memorable one because this film had some dramatic moments!The acting in here is outstanding and runs the gamut from well-known actors like Tom Hanks to several unknowns, all having major roles. It's also nicely filmed. However, the story and the acting are the main attractions. The unique story gets you involved to the point where, even having to watch several very, very unpleasant scenes, you don't want to put the movie down.Big Michael Clarke Duncan elevated his career a lot with this role, playing ""John Coffey,"" a prisoner with strange powers. You could root for all the characters save two, a sadistic guard aptly named ""Brutus 'Brutal' Howell"" (David Morse) and Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell). I was sorry to hear Cromwell blaspheme regularly but not surprised since he seems to have played so many ""bad guy"" roles in the past dozen years and done this in other films. With those two exceptions, however, it was nice to finally see prison guards as good guys, something rarely seen since the classic-movie era. Michael Jeter, one of those unknown actors, was a lot of fun to watch as ""Eduard Delacroix.""Overall, however, as much as I praise this movie, the unpleasant scenes, the high use of the Lord's name in vain and the length of it all make this a tough movie to watch over and over, but it's a movie to definitely see at least once. Let's put it this way: it gets your attention!"
matzucker,"Sep 11, 2000",3/10,"That it should've been, at least.But let's start at the beginning, which is, I might add, terribly slow. A lot of time passes before something actually happens. King & Darabont use this time to carefully put their chess pieces in place before making their move in the last 60 minutes or so. There's a host of details during the first 2/3s that later become significant. And since I'm not one of those who need to see fireworks of action and suspense from the first instant of a movie, that's fine with me. After all, the pace increases considerably during the course of the movie.Some of these aforementioned details are so predictable that I could guess the next turn of events half an hour in advance. And that's never a good thing.The last hour, however, makes up for a lot of the film's former trappings. There's no arguing that the solution is quite touching.So finally, a movie worth watching, but there were still a few things that bugged me. First, I would've liked to know more about the inmates as murderers, which I guess they were supposed to be. (You never notice, though.) In the way they're portrayed, these are good, righteous people that are good friends with the wardens, love a cute mouse and are generally lovable. So- why are they in death row anyway? I understand the novel shed some light on this, and the film could've certainly needed some of this other side of the story to avoid some of the schmaltz.Second, isn't this prison just lovely? I mean, it seems like a camping tour at some points. If death row is like that, I want to be in it!If The Green Mile was supposed to make any statement about the right or wrong of the death sentence, you'd better watch Dead Man Walking to form your own opinion instead of being manipulated into believing that all killers ultimately become nice people once they're in Our Favorite Death Row. It works for tearjerking, but not for discussion of that subject.But, mind you, I couldn't help being manipulated myself- and it worked. I was genuinely moved at the end and, despite the occasional predictability, the story had its clever moments.So, it was an OK movie, at times even a bit more, but it sure didn't deserve its Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, and it sure can't hold a candle to King's and Darabont's first joint venture, the brilliant The Shawshank Redemption. 7 out of 10."
mashamanakova,"Jan 19, 2022",10/10,"""They helped him kill himself and it happens every day all over the world""...A film that I can safely call a masterpiece. A film that lasts three hours and which fly by unnoticed. A film that looks like the first time every time. A film that can not be forgotten and which can not be imbued. A film that makes you think about the life that we spend on trifles, indulging ourselves with the illusion of immortality, about a death that spares no one.The film is about evil, which is not always punishable, and about good, which is sometimes powerless to change anything. And you just have to look at how the court is administered, over those who should not sit in the dock.A film that changed my worldview and taught me to relate to life differently."
AdityaG-8739,"Nov 18, 2025",10/10,"The Green Mile is not a film you simply watch, it's a film that settles into your soul, gently and painfully, like truth you weren't prepared to face.It isn't about prison, death row, or crime.It's about the quiet, devastating humanity that exists in places the world has already given up on.Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb with a softness that feels almost sacred, a man whose job requires him to walk prisoners to death, yet whose heart refuses to grow numb.Every expression, every hesitation, every haunted glance makes you feel the weight he carries: the burden of deciding what justice means when compassion won't stay silent.But it is Michael Clarke Duncan's John Coffey who transforms the film into something unforgettable.His childlike gentleness in a world built to crush people like him becomes a powerful accusation, against cruelty, against prejudice, against the violence people justify as ""the system.""
His innocence doesn't shout; it trembles.It hurts.It breaks you open.The film moves with the pace of real heartbreak, slow, careful, heavy.Each moment feels like a breath held too long.The supernatural elements aren't there for fantasy; they're there to magnify the tragedy of a man who could heal the world but is destroyed by it.The Green Mile reveals something uncomfortable:
that kindness can be punished, that goodness can be overlooked, and that sometimes the most innocent people carry the deepest wounds.Visually and emotionally, the movie feels like a long walk toward an ending you dread but cannot turn away from.And when it arrives, it doesn't demand tears, it simply lets them fall.⭐ Final Thought
The Green Mile is a story about grace, injustice, and the unbearable cost of empathy.It leaves you believing that miracles are real, but also that the world often doesn't deserve them, and that's what makes this film timeless, shattering, and profoundly human."
raphaelyegles,"Jan 30, 2025",9/10,"An absolute masterpiece, filmed with sensitivity and finesse. A rare work that surpasses everything we could have expected or imagined. The story is permeated with tenderness, love and infinite respect, in an environment as thankless and dark as death row. A prison where the worst criminals pass through. By way of contrast, a black prisoner, a force of nature, is also incarcerated. The story reveals that this man possesses an extraordinary healing power and is empathy itself, feeling the suffering of others with intensity. John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) embodies pure tenderness, innocence made man, a man crossed by God's forgiveness and healing, an angel living on earth who wouldn't hurt a mouse. Never has this been seen on death row. John Coffey is the real star of ""The Green Mile"", because Grace inhabits him. The team of prison warders Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) and Brutus 'Brutal' Howell (David Morse) are extraordinary actors. This film lasts over 3 hours and is enjoyed minute by minute. It's a moving reflection on evil, the meaning of life and death, and the death penalty as practiced in several American states. With its ritual of the electric chair, the presence of witnesses in the execution chamber and the last moments of those condemned to death. It's a film, based on Stephen King's sublime novel, which you absolutely must have seen once, if only once."

Bernie4444,"Mar 8, 2024",10/10,"What more can you ask for? Lots more and this movie has it. As a rule, I steer clear of prison movies but this movie transcends the prison genera. They depict the prison as a working environment where the guards calmly control the prisoners through quiet resolve instead of cattle prods.It maintains King's ""more than life"" world without the ""you'll-be-et"" monsters. Michael Clarke Duncan made a great John 'Johnny' Coffey and some credit needs to go to the mouse that was a much better actor than the one in ""Mouse Hunt"". Even though we know that the guards do not wear uniforms. They were an added plus in the movie; you knew when the hat was on that they meant business.With all the great acting and actors sometimes, a good one is over looked. Do not miss Gary Sinise as Burt Hammersmith the defender."
sankrisram,"Aug 25, 2007",8/10,"Had been long waiting to see this movie. At last when it happened, it was really worth the wait. One of the few beautiful movies i have seen. Hanks comes up with yet again splendid performance and adds crisp to the good cast. Particularly Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, WOW what to say!! He, his size, his innocence surely cant go unnoticed.Every scene creates a sort of expectation on whats going to happen next. n satisfies them pretty nicely too. It makes a good watch. It may not b a feel good movie.. but definitely makes u think a lot about humanity and human values. I am waiting to read the book from which it has been adapted"
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"May 1, 2000",N/A,"Before going to see The Green Mile tonight, it was only very recently that I had read the novel, and so I was able to know who the names of the characters were fairly quickly, and a lot of the story,for the extreme running time it occupied, became pretty easy to follow.But, if truth be told, I could have read the book 4 years ago when it was originally published, and still today be able to draw the same comparisons.The fact is, that if you read any novel which the film you are about to see is based on, you can make up your own interpretation of the story, and that is way better, because it happens at your own pace, and it unravels in your own way. So, out of the two, although the film was good, I would probably advise to read the book instead.The film picked a wise number when it chose to add light, humorous intervals to the story,e.g. Mr.Jingles first introduction, and all the other comic moments it inspired. A movie focusing on a story this grim and unrelenting would need moments like this to make it bearable, because when it is, it chills the blood with it's nastiness. John Coffey's wailing with the two dea d girls, and Eduard Delacroix's execution are profoundly nasty moments in the film. Another of the film's merits is the performances of it's stars. Tom Hanks seems to subconsciously mesmerise with his portrayal of the lead character. His bit as the regular honcho guy who has to place firm law and order on the inmates and his henchmen is affected by the smallest of things. His eye movement, his expressions, and his observations of the time and the place and indeed, the situation he is in truly lift the character he is playing up many notches. As for Michael Clarke Duncan as Coffey, well, in the next role I see him in, I'll be wishing he was in this one again. With one shot, he transforms a regular joe movie personality into a magnificent powerhouse of a performance, that powerfully renders all the cliches/stereotypes obsolete.Another asset of reading the book, however, is also that if you absorb it, if you take in everything that is happening, ,it will make the film go by far quicker. Although the novel is a far greater suggestion, really, The Green Mile is what proper moviemaking is all about.****"
the coyote,"Feb 5, 2000",3/10,"Frank Darabont's follow up to the Shawshank Redemption is a poorly written and painfully unoriginal story.For starters, the Noble Savage stereotype is racist at best. A character that is misunderstood by society and doesn't want to live in that society due to the character's extreme moral idealism (i.e. edward scissorhands, powder, etc.) is far from new.Coffey's character is not the only one that is one dimensional. Pretty much all the characters' dispositions are made to be one of two things: good or bad. There are no gray lines and it is obvious who the audience is supposed to hate and who they are supposed to root for. It's boring and childish. The frenchman, Michael Jeter, is made up so that we feel completely sorry for him. We're not even allowed to know what his crime was because then we might not love him so much.The prison guards are the most loving forgiving group of prison guards that have ever lived. Hell, they're the most loving forgiving people that ever lived. A prisoner spits in Tom Hanks's face and he actually does nothing about it? My grandmother isn't that nice.Stop reading here if you have not seen the movie.And wasn't it convenient that that prisoner, Sam Rockwell, just happened to be the actual criminal behind Coffey's crime? And when they ""caught"" Coffey with the girls, can anyone honestly say that if a black man was found with two dead white girls that they would not shoot him? Black men in the 30's, and especially in the South, would be killed for being seen in public with a white woman, much less killing a white child.And when Coffey does die, Tom Hanks doesn't put too much effort into stopping the execution. He just asks Coffey what he should do, and Coffey says nothing, so that's what he does. Of course Coffey must die, because in all racist Noble Savage films the savage must die so that his white savior can learn a valuable lesson.And where is the warden at this point? He said he can't stop the execution, but I find that implausible. I'm sure he could at least try to save the man who saved his wife. And wasn't that a plot twist that was hard to see coming? I also found it interesting that when Coffey healed her, he also did her hair and put makeup on her.The whole movie has no real continuity being that it was adopted from a serial novel. The movie could have ended in about five different places and the audience wouldn't have minded.The only interesting element of this movie is its ending which certainly does not save it. I suppose this movie is more Stephen King's fault than Darabont's, but regardless the movie is a disappointment in front the backdrop of all the superb movies that have been released with it in the past few months."
benimsandalyem,"Dec 7, 2023",10/10,"This movie is a masterpiece! His story takes you deep. I wish I could forget it and watch it again. I get emotional every time I watch it.The story offers a powerful message to make viewers think about the complexity of human nature and the fine line between good and evil.The film offers the audience the opportunity to think about the complexity of human nature and the fine line between good and evil, through ***'s special abilities and the events that occur around him. However, without giving more details, I can say that the film has a deep and impressive story that offers an emotional experience to the audience.""The Green Mile"" stands out with its emotional depth, powerful performances and striking atmosphere. It is also known as an unforgettable film that manages to impress the audience by focusing on human inner struggles and social justice issues.10/10."
clarkaaron-98947,"Jun 17, 2023",10/10,"My personal favorite movie of all time. How this didn't win Best Picture is beyond me. Just over three hours long and never feels like an endurance test. Not a single scene is wasted in this riveting saga of humanity and emotion.A raw and powerful study that forces one to look beyond the skin at such eternal issues as life and death, faith, the human condition, the innate goodness and evil of which humanity is capable, guilt and innocence and penitence, and criminal justice and capital punishment. So broad is this movie's scope that we see the value of life in everything from a creature as small as a mouse to as grand as a human.We see the power of kindness to make a difference in the end and of wanton cruelty to make just as big of a difference.This is a prison movie that forces a rethinking of the genre. We don't see good prisoners and barbaric guards like in Cool Hand Luke or The Shawshank Redemption. But it is not merely the opposite either. Humanity and barbarism are on both sides of the bars - from guards Paul Edgecomb and Brutus Howell doing everything they can to foster a calm environment (Edgecomb likens death row to an ICU in a hospital) while guard Percy Whetmore sadistically abuses a vulnerable inmate over and over and disrespects another inmate's body after the execution. At the same time, with the prisoners we have John Coffey's gentle nature, Eduard Delacroix taming a pet mouse and Arlen Bitterbuck reminiscing about his youth contrasting with the violent and maniacal behavior of William Wharton.Complexity abounds.Viewers will cry at some deaths and pithy emotional observations and will feel just as uplifted at some of the more miraculous scenes, rays of light in the darkness.An emotionally draining experience that will stay with you long after viewing. One of the rare movies that, beyond entertaining you for a night, will enrich your soul."
mcomeg,"Nov 24, 1999",10/10,"Although The Green Mile shares the same director, setting, and source novelist as The Shawshank Redemption, it is about as far from Shawshank as is possible.  This slightly sci-fi, slightly eerie, and very moving drama is a top-flight morality whose ambiguous aims allow for a whole lot of interpretation.  In the preview screening that I attended, there was not a dry eye in the house during several scenes, and clearly rattled many members of the audience.  Tom Hanks continues his winning streak as a death-row guard, and is wonderfully supported by the entire cast.  Although this film may not be as technically groundbreaking as Being John Malkovich or Three Kings, it is not standard Hollywood fare, and achieves its own perfection. May sure to catch this when it is released, it will be the final classic of the 20th century."
brvhrt-4,"Nov 30, 1999",9/10,"...and give it to the makers of THE GREEN MILE.  While you're at it, go ahead and engrave the Best Supporting Oscar with the name of Michael Clarke Duncan.  This is everything a movie is supposed to be.  The only reason I voted it a 9 rather than a 10 is a needless explanatory speech at the end... I got it the first time around.  I didn't need it explained to me afterward."
beratbutuc1,"Dec 25, 2025",9/10,"The Green Mile is a deeply emotional and unforgettable film that goes far beyond a simple prison drama. It explores justice, compassion, and human dignity with remarkable sensitivity and restraint. Tom Hanks delivers a strong, grounded performance, while Michael Clarke Duncan's portrayal of John Coffey is nothing short of heartbreaking and iconic.The film's slow, deliberate pacing allows the story and characters to fully resonate, making every emotional moment feel earned. It is not an easy watch, but it is a meaningful one-quietly powerful, morally challenging, and timeless.A near-perfect classic that leaves a lasting emotional impact long after it ends."
michaelheiser-25099,"Nov 5, 2021",8/10,"Loved this film - very powerful. The cast plays a significant part because these are people we care about, no matter how big or small their roles are, each one shines at a moment or another, providing an extra level of depth in characterization, and when they leave us, we can't help but feel something cruelly missing, as if we were really experiencing death as a human loss. But aside from the acting, the directing and the writing are responsible for this level of empathy we feel. Indeed, the film doesn't embarrass itself with subtleties or nuances when it comes to the characters, the guards are all sympathetic and Percy is clearly the main antagonist, doing everything to be unpopular both among the guards and the viewers. And in the prisoners' group, while they're all bad people by society's standards, only Wild Bill stands out as the evil one. In the hand of another director, this wouldn't have worked, but with Darabont it does.Darabont may not be the best director of his generation, nor the best writer, but he's got one rare talent: he's a wonderful storyteller. And this talent shows in his films, he has a unique ability to transport you in his universe with such respect and carefulness that you forget all the elements that could undermine the believability of the story. How can the death row's corrections officer guards be so mild-mannered? How wasn't John Coffey lynched at the very minute he was found grabbing two little girls' bodies in his arms, what's more, by a Southern angry mob? Why falling in the 'Magic Negro' stereotype again? I was so mesmerized by the story, and so focused on the supernatural power of Coffey and the bonding it inspired in the block E, that I unconsciously wiped all these considerations.And I enjoyed ""The Green Mile"" for what it was, a great MOVIE. And I emphasize the word 'movie' because there's a sort of genius in the way Darabont sticks to cinematic conventions. Darabont never hesitates to use archetypes because he's confident over his material; he knows that his screenplay is adapted from one hell of a story, written by the king Stephen. And it sure pays off, the story has the thrills of the electric chairs scenes, the heart-pounding horrific moment when the machinery goes wrong, it has the laughs, the joy, the emotion, and even a nice little comic relief incarnated by a little mouse named Mister Jingles."
RoseannaMorley,"Jul 8, 2020",10/10,"This film brings so much emotion every time I watch it, each and every actor and actress involved in this production produced outstanding Oscar Winning performances!The story is deep and will touch the hearts of every one who watches. It definitely enables you to open your mind into the way we once faced punishment within capitals of the world - the punishment that many endured once upon their lifetime. The story is so gripping and the ending will break hearts!This film will never get old, I would and could watch a million times over! Definitely worth the watch if you have not done so already."
lacrimosa_de_magpyr,"Feb 23, 2000",N/A,"This film is a masterpiece. I can not praise it enough. Although it is on a rather unpleasant subject I found it a very moving and excellent film.I haven't cried so much in a film ever before this. It is a very powerful, wonderful film. Although some parts are shocking and horrible, and the subject is distasteful, you can not be anything but moved by it's relevance and mature approach to a very controversial topic.I myself do not really enjoy Stephen King films, but I am willing to say that this film (and book by S. King) are a masterpiece."
Serva,"Oct 28, 2001",6/10,"I don't know, I rented this movie after hearing a lot of people claiming it was so touching and all(including Britney Spears herself in an interview, damn you Britney!). They should've labeled this movie ""Based on something Stephen King has written"" so you know that prior to actually watching it. I'm not saying Mr. King is bad, it's just that it's very hard to make a touching movie out of a plot that is depending on something that is so hard to believe in. It's just too unrealistic with all the healing stuff, when the movie was over I just thought 'Ok... so?'. I gave this movie a 6/10, if you want good Stephen King, watch the Langoljeers (that what it's called?). If you want a touching movie on the subject, watch Dead man walking. And if you just want a damn good touching movie, go see American Beauty."
Roemer,"Apr 5, 2001",4/10,"OK. The movie starts all right. The acting is good. But my god, what a sentimental crap is this story! It seems to me the writers only thought of jerking as much tears as possible. By making the big feller soooooo innocent. And the bad guy soooooo bad. And they leave no stone unturned to tear your tears out, because when an audience weeps, the film must be good.Well, it isn't. YES, I wept. But it didn't feel good. Because it was SO cheap. When you hit me with a hammer on my toe, I weep as well. And this film was about as subtle as that. And so I felt emotionally raped by this movie. I actually did.PLEASE see the Shawshank redemption instead..."
scarlettcooper-65755,"Sep 6, 2024",9/10,"Tom Hanks delivers a heartfelt performance as Paul Edgecomb, portraying a man torn between his duties and his growing empathy for Coffey. Michael Clarke Duncan's portrayal of John Coffey is both moving and nuanced, showcasing a gentle giant whose presence resonates deeply throughout the film. The supporting cast, including David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, and James Cromwell, all contribute strong performances that enhance the film's emotional depth.The Green Mile is celebrated for its emotional intensity and its exploration of themes such as the moral ambiguity of justice and the power of redemption. The film's ability to evoke a deep emotional response from its audience, coupled with its thought-provoking narrative, has earned it a lasting place in cinematic discussions. Its impact is further amplified by its exceptional performances and Darabont's skillful adaptation of King's work."
evseeva-88338,"Jan 19, 2022",10/10,"The film ""The Green Mile"" was created in order to show what prejudices sometimes lead to.Everyone should watch this movie. The action of this film takes us back to the thirties of the last century, while showing all the realities of that time, a black man was easily, without any special proceedings (and the proceedings would quickly establish the true criminal) sentenced to death (due to the fact that racial inequality still persisted in America at that time)
The way the outcome of this case was determined will not leave you indifferent."
psc-3,"Feb 7, 2000",10/10,"Frank Darabont's second feature adaptation of a Steven King novel proves to be just as touching and inspiring as his first.  Like ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Green Mile"" is set in prison, though in the latter, it is death row that is portrayed.  Tom Hanks, playing the compassionate head prison guard Paul Edgecomb, puts forth the type of performance that has made him the success that he is today.While Hanks is the ""name"" attached to ""The Green Mile,"" it is in fact Michael Clark Duncan that steals the audience's attention, and in the end, their hearts.  His portrayal of John Coffey, a huge but loving death-row inmate, makes you want to believe in miracles.While some will complain of the length of the film (somewhere around 187 minutes), I on the other hand, felt that ""The Green Mile"" is more than capable of holding an audience's attention for the complete duration. Frank Darabont and Co. have brought us a gem, without a doubt."

nickmesafilms,"Jul 2, 2011",10/10,"Frank Darabont, the extraordinary director of the hit ""Shawshank Redemption"", comes back to the big screen with yet another adaptation of another prison drama novel by Stephen King. This time, the story is ""The Green Mile"", and this time he has the help of Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan joining a powerful cast that also includes Bonnie Hunt, Michael Jeter, and Sam Rockwell. The movie stars Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, an officer on death row, with a serious bladder infection, who rounds up a new suspect named John Coffey, portrayed by Michael Clarke Duncan, a man with mysterious immortality powers, that may have been accused for the raping and killing of two innocent girls. The movie follows as a dramatic and entertaining tale of hope, faith, and courage. Darabont brings back the lucky charm used in ""Shawshank"", but this time he combines real life with fantasy, and creates a story of miracles and dreams. Anyways, the film has powerful backgrounds, and the film focuses on the story with lots of drama and thrills, and the script is more well-written since Shawshank was well-written. The special effects are amazingly realistic, and the story is like a special charm from the heart. I really enjoyed this film, and it's fun to watch it again and again. You will enjoy it so much, you will start to wonder where the 3-hour running time has gone. ""The Green Mile"", in my review, ""an exhilarating prison drama, truly watchable""."
Kirpianuscus,"Aug 6, 2015",N/A,"more than a film, it is a fascinating embroidery. more than a good adaptation, it is a special meeting. because it is a graceful portrait of miracle and the image of Michael Clarke Duncan remains in memory a long time after the end of the film.because it has the simple charm of the old fashion stories and the desire to respect the book has a magnificent result. because it is a Stephen King but it has not only the virtue to be a good adaptation. it represents a beautiful exploration of the nuances. and a special portrait of emotions. the perfect cast in an inspired movie about the force of intentions. a film who becomes magic. for this cause must see it. and than, sure, discover the book."
joecoby45,"Feb 15, 2018",6/10,"The Green Mile is a fairly decent movie in most regards. Its well filmed with good production values and has a pretty OK story that overall is entertaining to watch. The performances are also all very good. Especially by Michael Clarke Duncan, Sam Rockwell, and Doug Hutchinson.However by the end of the film I just felt underwhelmed. Nothing really special happened in it. The super natural aspects really weakened the story in my opinion. Going into it I was expecting the story to be about a prison guard who works on death row who just so happens to befriend one of his prisoners. So when the whole thing became supernatural I was a little disappointed. If the story was more grounded in reality and had a lot less filler it would have been emotionally gut wrenching. But its not.Also there is a very out of place violent scene in this movie. A man gets slowly burnt alive because of a villain sabotaging the electric chair. Its a scene that feels taken directly from a Hostel movie. Ugh."
TOMASBBloodhound,"Jun 6, 2004",4/10,"There are some times when I can say that I must have seen a truly different film than the vast majority of other people in the world. This time is one of them. For this film to be rated so highly, is completely bewildering to me. Let me just say that I am by no means some kind of American working class slob who can only sit through a 90 minute action-packed popcorn film loaded special fx and t&a. I can easily sit through films like Barry Lyndon and 2001 without even getting up for a snack. If a film is truly great, it will hold my attention. If it isn't, then I may just doze off. At least I was interested enough to rewind it when I woke up to see what I missed. It wasn't worth the effort.This film failed on almost every level to connect or convey any true emotion to me. The only character I liked was Michael Clarke Duncan as a Christ-like figure who has exceptional healing powers, but is put to death for a crime he didn't commit. The film is slow, talky, and not very well-acted. This was truly surprising since the cast members of this film are usually quite good.Tom Hanks stars as a guard in charge of the death row wing of on old southern prison. Through most of the film, we see him and the other guards interacting with the prisoners and carrying out an execution here and there. Tom Hanks gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen him give. The only emotion he shows at all is agony while trying to pass a stone through his urethra! Yes, a major plot point in this film is that Hanks is having trouble urinating! Whatever.As far as the other characters go, nobody does that well in the acting department. David Morse, Barry Pepper, and James Cromwell have boring characters. The individuals who play the bad guard and the psychotic prisoner over-act badly. Michael Jeter's character is so annoying that I couldn't wait to see him executed. His execution scene is perhaps the most memorable scene in the film.And the part with the little mouse! Way too cutesy for words. I thought I was watching Stuart Little for a moment.And not to spoil the conclusion or anything, but there is absolutely no payoff for anything we've learned throughout the film. I at least was hoping the ending would tie everything up in a thoughtful manner that would somehow make the whole experience rewarding. Nope!Overall, this film is a dud. I really can't see where all the hype came from. Do yourself a favor and stick with Shawshank instead. That's one hell of a lot better film.4 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound."
lars3002,"Feb 17, 2006",10/10,"Is there anyone out there who could not love this movie? I cannot imagine. This is such a perfectly cast movie with superb performances from each actor. The movie is flawless as far as I am concerned and as close to brilliance as you can get on film. Who could expect anything more from movie watching? I smiled, I laughed, I cried. It touched every emotion and that is what makes a great movie, ""Great""! Tom Hanks is his usual awesome actor-self, and all the actors seemed to have wonderful chemistry together which makes this movie so touching. You find yourself lost in the story and so involved with each character, it is a disappointment when you realize the movie must end. I cannot begin to count how many times I have seen this movie. Yet, I find something new each time I view it and I never grow tired of seeing it. Certain scenes stick out in my mind and I catch myself repeating funny and catchy phrases over and over! Bits and pieces of this movie adhere to you long after you have seen it which is another reminder of how this movie has all the necessary parts fused together which make it a perfectly wonderful film."

olisilumea,"Nov 8, 2024",10/10,"*The Green Mile* is a cinematic masterpiece, blending powerful storytelling, extraordinary performances, and profound emotional depth. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, the film follows Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), a prison guard on death row, and his relationship with John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a man with extraordinary healing powers. The film beautifully explores themes of justice, compassion, and the supernatural, drawing you into its emotional core with every scene.Tom Hanks gives a heart-wrenching, compassionate performance, while Michael Clarke Duncan's portrayal of Coffey is nothing short of iconic. The supporting cast adds further richness, and the cinematography captures both the time period and the emotional weight of the story perfectly. The score by Thomas Newman enhances the mood without overpowering it.With its unforgettable characters and thought-provoking themes, *The Green Mile* is a timeless, deeply moving film that will stay with you long after viewing. A definitive 10/10."

hawaiianancestor,"Jan 20, 2021",9/10,"I love every single thing about 'the Green Mile', the same way I loved everything about 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump'. The acting in the movie was just perfected on all corners. Tom Hanks brilliantly portrays the complex character of Paul Edgecomb and the late Michael Clarke Duncan absolutely steals the show in an Oscar robbed performance as John Coffey. May he ever rest in peace. It wasn't, however, just those two who gave strong performances. The actors playing Brutus, Hal, Del, Percy, Wharton all did an unbelievable job at portraying how realistic prison life may truly be.The story is so emotionally moving that it is impossible to not like and connect with. The characters presented in the movie are some of the finest movie characters that I've ever seen. This film truly mastered characters and what they undergo during prison life.The directing and writing by Frank Darabont, the man behind 'The Shawshank Redemption' absolutely masters everything a film needs to get right once more and adds such layers to each character that we come to truly love by the end of the film.The tone to the movie is so dark that we are immediately thrown into the world presented in this movie. The movie is so sad on many occasions that I was truly left bawling my eyes out.**Spoilers*** The scene where Del is horribly executed to death was just too sad to look at. This movie made me sympathize with criminals more than any other movie.The last half hour made me truly cry all the way through it. The film doesn't attempt to out do itself and just masters it all. The ending to the movie just continued to make me cry."
candy_girl,"Feb 25, 2004",N/A,"I was 12 years when I saw it for the first time. When I went into the cinema I had no clue what's gonna happen and what's this movie about. My Dad suggested watching it and I agreed because I admire Tom Hanks.But what I saw blew me away. I've never seen a film that was so amazing. In general I'm not a very sensitive person who cries often, but since I watched it for the first time I've been crying anytime when I saw it.After the I had seen the movie I read the book and it was the first time that a movie was as good as the original story. It's also very hard to to as well as Stephen King and to produce emotions and fear like he does. But this very movie succeeded in doing both.It's also because of its great story and its amazing characters. The whole movie is not just about one single person as you might think. You get to know about the story and the situation and the destiny of every single character.It was the first movie that made me cry. When you watch it you just don't simply ""watch"" it. You become part of it. You can feel the anger and the hatred that is felt by the wardens against this damn Percy and you can fell the pain John Coffey has. It touches you so much when Coffey says that he never had a friend to tell him where they should go. You wish to be his friend. You wish you tell him that he's the most fantastic person you've ever met in your entire life.The end drives the emotions to the peak. John Coffey: Sorry for what I am. What do you say, John? You are one of the true miracles! Don't apologise for yourself. And when Hanks comes towards Duncan and touches his hand and Duncan thinking ""He killed them with their love for each other"" you're gone.You can't understand why such an amazing person wants do die and doesn't like himself.I can't understand when people complain about this movie. Mostly about its length. But imagine this movie was 2 hours, would it be that good? Would you really realise what it's about?I don't think so. In my opinion this is the best film I've ever seen, and it will always be my favourite film."

yuenw003,"Mar 7, 2006",10/10,"I think this movie addresses a universal theme that's almost biblical in nature: Man is basically evil. He will manufacture and rationalize in his own way to distort good (in this case a good man named John Coffey) into evil (Jesus Christ suffered the same fate.) The question pose by this movie as we identify with the main character prison guard Paul Edgecomb(Tom Hanks) who is in the position as a modern day Pontius Pilate is this: When we are faced with what is told to us and packaged to us as evil, and we discover to the contrary, are we bound to be an agent to evil or do we have the backbone and strength of spirit to expose the wrongdoing and act on our principles for what is right? Life is a test and we will pay a dear price for bad choices with our conscience for the rest of our lives."

turlututu,"Mar 3, 2003",N/A,"When I watch films like the Green Mile I feel absolutely furious. Mainstream US cinema industry has unfortunately bombarded us with products (I cannot treat them as artworks) of very low quality, to be consumed immediately and provide some instant but short-lived gratification of the senses. Such films trigger shallow reactions of fear, sadness, sympathy etc., but never stick to mind and will never become points to which one would return at leisure to ponder or draw meaning for one's own purposes. Extraordinary and unrealistic situations, special effects, obsession with violence and cruelty, cheap morality and ostensible moral struggle and (on other occasions) sex are the ingredients of 95 per cent of such products. I am deeply sorry that these so-called artists seek to maximise profits at the expense of their art and I hope that they sometime wake up, if they ever can, to complex social realities and relations and to the multiplicity of the human condition, which they so obviously ignore and downgrade."

snsh,"Aug 31, 2003",2/10,"I don't understand why this movie is so highly rated.  I suspect it's partly a christian-thing given the theme and all.  Not being raised christian it doesn't connect with me.  But regardless, the movie has several problems:First, every scene is twice as long as it needs to be.  Also include many formulaic scenes when I the moviegoer was supposed to go ""ooh ahh"" in wonderment, but instead I was so bored.  This film could have been 1.5 hours long with no loss of content.  Tom Hank's closing line is even something like ""the green mile can seem awfully long.""  Oh the irony.Second, the writers give the characters a handicap of being incapable of communicating -- JC rambles about ""helping people"" when he could simply say ""hey look I have special powers allow me to demonstrate.""  If I were in charge of sentencing, I could see myself putting him on death row too -- it is so frustrating.  The same frustration comes from the buildup to the scene with the warden's wife -- if Tom Hanks only lucidly told the warden what's up, they could've done the job in 5 minutes without any fuss.  Instead, they were cryptic and turned it into a 45 minute production.  What a waste of time.Third, the philosophy of the movie just doesn't seem right.  The prison guards all have super-cushy jobs.  Compare to the characters in Saving Private Ryan.  Which extreme commands more respect?  I don't see building heroes out of prison guards.  Similarly, the main character JC is wallows in self-pity.  Rather than be so depressed about the evil in the world, he needs to swallow it and go out and do something with his life.  Take valium if you have to.  If you're in trouble with the US government, flee to Yemen.These problems were on my mind every minute of the film.  Most likely you won't be bothered by them, given the ratings.  But to be safe, in case you watch The Green Mile and after 1/2 an hour you don't like it, turn it off you won't like the next 2 1/2 hours either."
lee_eisenberg,"Dec 8, 2005",10/10,"...and I'd say that it was a perfect way to end the 20th century (unless you say that the 20th century ended in 2000). For years, movie adaptations of Stephen King novels bungled everything, but with ""The Green Mile"" in the hands of the man behind ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (also about a prison), it clearly had to be good.In case you've never read the novel - which I highly recommend - the plot has prison guard Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks) overseeing death row in a Louisiana penitentiary in 1935. When a very large African-American named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives, Paul witnesses some events that no one could ever imagine.This is the only which comes to my mind that I would classify as both haunting and heartwarming at the same time. Haunting because the prison's bleak environs drain all hope; heartwarming because of what happens in this particular prison. Both Hanks and Duncan turn in pitch-perfect performances, as do the other cast members. Bonnie Hunt as Paul's wife Jan, trying to cope with the effects that her husband's job has on their personal life; James Cromwell as Warden Hal Moores, doing everything to carry out his job but depressed by numerous factors; Doug Hutchison as despicable guard Percy Wetmore, who likes nothing more than to be as cruel as possible; David Morse, Barry Pepper, and Jeffrey DeMunn as fellow guards Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, Dean Stanton, and Harry Terwilliger, respectively; Sam Rockwell as vicious inmate ""Wild Bill"" Wharton; Michael Jeter and Graham Greene as fellow inmates Eduard Delacroix and Arlen Bitterbuck, respectively; Patricia Clarkson as the warden's wife Melinda, afflicted by an awful disease; Harry Dean Stanton as loopy janitor Toot-Toot; and Dabbs Greer as the elderly Paul Edgecombe. Gary Sinise all appears as Coffey's lawyer. An 11/10."
view_and_review,"Jun 26, 2014",10/10,"The Green Mile was a tremendous movie. That's no news flash as it was nominated for four Academies and it won a host of other types of awards. And let's not forget, as of this review, it sits at number 45 on IMDb's top 100.The story was fantastically done. A man (perhaps) that can remove illness and injury from people and animals is arrested for murder. The dynamics of the story are further amalgamated by the fact that this man is Black during the Jim Crow era and he is accused of killing a little white girl.The acting was superb. Tom Hanks around this time was just hitting homerun after homerun. Philadelphia in '93, Forest Gump in '94, Apollo 13 and Toy Story in '95, Saving Private Ryan and You've Got Mail in '98, then Toy Story 2 and The Green Mile in '99. All of his performances were stellar. But the X-factor, the dark horse in The Green Mile was, the now departed, Michael Clark Duncan. An ex-bodyguard turned actor, he did a wonderful job as John Coffey.This movie evoked a myriad of emotions. Anger, joy, hope, and sadness. The various characters in this film all offered something. No character was wasted. They all made you take interest in one way or another. I know Shawshank Redemption is the most highly touted movie on this website but The Green Mile just may be better."
djcpierotti,"Sep 8, 2019",10/10,"I've heard good things about this movie, and when I watched it, I was not disappointed. Everyone is perfectly cast,from Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, to Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey. I dare anyone to watch the scene of John Coffey's execution and not be upset, or in tears. Though it runs over three hours, I didn't care, it gives more time to develop characters, and get us to either hate them, or love them. I normally don't give a full ten stars to a film unless I think it deserves it ,but I think The Green Mile is worthy of ten stars, because of its emotional impact, well developed characters, powerful acting, and its enjoyability. I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat."
patrickeab,"Feb 12, 2006",9/10,"Without prior knowledge this long, long film threatened me with a late, late night. I started it with prejudice and with reluctance. Prejudice perhaps because the mere idea of death row is horrifying in itself, and to make a movie that is set right in and on death row sounds unappealing - and it is exactly that at first sight. But the quiet dignity of the boss warder (Tom Hanks) is convincing and compelling.In juxtaposition to the 'quiet man' was the wimpy, nasty little thorn in his side - Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) playing another prison guard. But as a vicious, sadistic little bastard who wants to inflict his own punishment on others because of his warped view of life and his own insecurities. Well enough played for one to develop a keen dislike for him within minutes of clapping eyes on him.Set in a time not long after Fred Astair and Ginger Rodgers this film plays out the agony of seeing a huge black man brought onto death row as a convicted murderer of two little blond girls. Even his defending council says the he is guilty and never to be trusted - not even for a moment. Implying that if Hanks is foolish enough to trust him he will regret it. Despite that Hanks takes the risk and pays the price in an unexpected way.This huge black man excellently played by Michael Clarke Duncan cures the ailing Hanks (he has a urinary infection in the days before antibiotics) just by a laying on of hands. Hanks accepts this as a miracle, but he then sees further evidence of this huge, gentle giant's miraculous powers.With a real sense of claustrophobia the scene of the nasty guard, Percy Wetmore being punished by his fellow guards is not for the squeamish. It will worry me for a time to come.The agony comes when the black gentle giant carries out further miraculous acts and yet is still not saved from the electric chair. The ironic 'punishment' Hanks receives for not saving him from his execution turns on its head what most of us would value greatly. It is both a sad, and yet at times a darkly humorous film, but at all events not to be taken for granted nor dismissed easily.For me this was one of the most compelling films I have seen in a long, long time. If you only watch films just to be entertained, don't bother. If you watch films just to be excited, don't bother. If you watch films because you want to be transported to another time and another place and want to experience the moral dilemmas of some good men and to see the actions of some evil men then this will hold your attention from start to finish. You will remember this film as well as you have the Shawshank Redemption."
Loren-3,"Sep 30, 2004",10/10,"Ensemble Performance (n): Wherein all elements of a stage play, film or other suchlike entertainment deliver together, all participants contributing equally as their characters allow, creating a singular and powerful presentation.The above is my own ""definition,"" if you will, but that's how I feel about The Green Mile. From Tom Hanks to Michael Clarke Duncan to David Morse to Doug Hutchenson in the major roles to elements as small as James Cromwell's warden or Gary Sinese's cameo, no one and I mean NO ONE ""phones it in,"" or merely goes through the motions.Also appreciated was the pace of the film. Some complain that three hours is too long. I submit that to allow the characters to unfold at the pace of the South in the 1930's, to get the depth and breadth of them, three hours was necessary. For myself, I started watching it of a Saturday evening, thinking I'd ""spot"" through it. The three hours flashed by. Frank Darabont creates the reality of a Louisiana prison in the 1930's, sets the stage with the characters of Paul Edgecomb, Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, Eduard Delecroix, Arlen Bitterbuck and Percy Wetmore. Into this menage he weaves the magic of a simple black man, John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelt the same""). The impact Coffey has on Paul Edgecomb, on Warden Moores's wife, on a mouse named Mr. Jingles, indeed on the entire Green Mile ... is a source of wonder in the story-telling that makes this period piece the marvel that it is.Also very worthy of mention is Thomas Newman's brilliant score, which brings blues and prisoners' chants and multiple flavors and nuances to the table, as much a part of the ensemble as the above-listed characters.Keep in mind, this is no action-packed, whiz-bang, shoot-em-up piece of eye-candy. It's a beautiful, detailed and subtle piece, not much like any other piece of Stephen King I know of other than ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (which I've yet to see, believe it or not!). And it's a piece I've repeatedly enjoyed for the quality of its production and the power of its performances.I recommend it heartily. Please enjoy."
darnaggy-60525,"Oct 2, 2018",8/10,Such an old iconic film - another Tom Hanks great. Michael C-D was an amazing actor who will be missed but his job in this film was nothing short of tear-jerking. Watch it!
allowallo_135,"Mar 20, 2008",10/10,"The Green Mile is a very very powerful and moving film. It's one of my favourite films along with The Shawshank Redemption which is also by the same director. I would definitely recommend this film to teenagers and above, it's got a very deep meaning.Tom Hanks is at his best in this along with top class acting by all the cast. It's one of those films that really hit's you after you've watched it.It's also based on a novel by Stephen King, I don't know how King can come up with all these stories!! The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, The Shining.....the list is endless.If you haven't seen this film watch it!! It's a must have for film lovers. Once again after the everlasting and profounding effect that Shawshank had worldwide, this is another one which will forever be remembered, well done to Frank Darabont.It had me crying through the whole film!!FANTASTIC10/10"
bob the moo,"Mar 8, 2003",N/A,"Now a resident in a rest home, one time head warden on death row, Paul Edgecomb, is struggling with his untold memories.  When a film brings it all back to him he recounts the story of the time when a huge black prisoner called John Coffey was put into wing.  It is not too long before the peaceful, loving prisoner, found guilty of the rape and murder of two children, has mysterious gifts that transcend the decay of the lives around the prison.After Shawskank Redemption I was attracted to this as many of the makers were the same not to mention the author, the prison setting and the running time.  However that same running time and some negative reviews put me off and I didn't get round to seeing it till recently.  The film is very slow and this is occasionally to it's detriment but not too often.  It's main failing is that it's supernatural spin makes it difficult to get involved and lose yourself in completely.  `Redemption's ` strength was that it was a human story.  Green Mile tries to have the strength of human spirit at it's core but it doesn't quite come off.That's not to say that the story still isn't moving and involving because it is.  However it doesn't come as easily as it should and when the story slows a little bit it does feel slow.  It could easily have lost 30 minutes as at it's current  length it feels like a long movie which is a bad thing  Two Towers is long but didn't FEEL long!  Also something I always find annoying is when a score really works the emotion where the actual film can't manage it by itself  here the score is working overtime to wring every drop of emotion from the scenes.The film is very well directed and there are powerful moments of cruelty. When the chair is used I couldn't help but feel that it was real.  However the main attraction (other than the mouse!) is a wonderful performance by Duncan.  True there is an element of slave cliché about it but he rises above that a gives a performance of such emotion and such gentleness that came as a surprise from someone of his build.  Hanks is also good and wisely plays it quite low-key and the support cast is solid, comprised of many many well known faces including Morse and Cromwell.Overall this is good but overlong.  It is a very different film from Shawshank and many will compare it to that much better film.  However the film is worth the work despite some simplistic errors and flaws."
annick.dries,"Jul 31, 2000",6/10,"If you love Stephen King film the Shawshank Redemption, you will even like this film more.  If you're some kind of philosopher, this film can be seen as a modern version of the story of Jesus Christ's crucifixion.When you leave the cinema, you may think differently about death penalty, although the film is more than just an anti-death penalty statement. If you don't believe in magic and if you don't like the cast of 'good'(Coffey, Des, ...) and 'bad' people (Percy, ...), then this 3-hour-movie will be hard to swallow.  I, for my part, tend to be in the 2nd group."
Dr. Don-2,"Dec 24, 1999",1/10,"Nice packaging, but too much of it. Typical Stephen King story, well-told but not much weight.  Full of stereotypes and predictable good guy/bad guy stuff.  I loved Tom Hanks in ""Philadelphia"" -- that was a challenging role and he performed it magnificently, with depth of character, pathos but no sentimentality.  Ever since, though, he's taken on one interchangeable role after another. Enough, already. The sad thing is that I truly CAN believe that almost 50% of the IMDB voters so far rate this very average and over-long film as a ""10"".  Excellence apparently is a function of the volume of tears they make you shed.  I say, ""make you"", because I think this film fully intends to manipulate emotions -- the emotions of white, comfortable, middle class Americans who enjoy cheering for the oppressed, simple but pure of heart big black man who is abused by Southern crackers.  Aren't we glad we're not like that? Yet again, a black man gets to be a parody, not a person.  We white folks don't have to be afraid just because he's big and black, see, 'cause he's really a Jesus figure (""J. C."", his initials).  What a relief. Still wouldn't want him living next door, though, would we? All in all, good actors playing two dimensional roles. In the real world, as Kosovo and Northern Ireland and Rwanda show, we're all just a hair-trigger away from being cruel.  Let's have more films that recognize that there are few good guys and bad guys, just a whole lot of us doing the best we can and trying to do it right.  That's too complicated for most Hollywood types, and doesn't usually make much money. ""Dead Man Walking"" was ten times the film that this one was, and even it wasn't a ""10"".""Besieged"" and ""The Informer"" were so much better than ""The Green Mile"" that to mention Oscars without naming those films is ridiculous.And that's all this middle-aged long-time and ardent lover of films has to say."
j_great,"Mar 5, 2006",9/10,"The Green Mile is a movie of emotions, a movie that leaves a life lasting experience and above all a movie that keeps you involved in till the very end. Director Frank Darabont does take his job seriously. The events in the movie take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.The action done by each and every person is fantastic, specially John Coffey (Michael Duncan) who plays a little less prominent role in super hit movie Armageddon. This movie is all what a classic should have. It's not a special effects action or adventure. It a movie for people who really appreciate the basic elements of a feature file and that is story, acting and flow.My recommendation is don't ever miss it and keep a hanky with youjust in case??"
blanche-2,"Jun 19, 2000",10/10,"This knockout of a movie is the best of the Stephen King ""morality"" films such as the wonderful ""Shawshank Redemption"" and the TV versions of ""The Stand"" and ""Storm of the Century"".""Green Mile"" manages to inspire and devastate at the same time. The casting is interesting, utilizing such actors as Bonnie Hunt and Dabbs Greer brilliantly and everyone performs with warmth and deep feeling.Hanks, of course, is the glue. Michael Clarke Duncan is powerful in his simplicity. This is a film that will never leave me."

Because The Green Mile has it all: Drama, Romance, Comedy, and everything else in a movie that makes it a masterpiece.  Especially the acting by Tom Hanks as the pleasent prison guard and more especially Michael Clarke Duncan as the miracle prisoner John Coffey (like the drink, only not spelled the same)and he not only gives his best performance yet, he gives probably the best performance of the decade. Add that plus a great score, great story (three hours gives it time to expand) and great direction (by Frank Darabont) and you got a great film."

Steviestar7,"Jul 26, 2013",10/10,"I think I would go as far as to say that this is one of my favourite films. I love that it's a simple story of right, wrong and the goodness that some people can hold that is so strong it's magical. I recently read The Green Mile book and I can't think of any other book to film adaptation that is more faithful. About 90% matches up perfectly. The only things removed were some scenes in the nursing home that reminded Paul of Percy which didn't affect the story at all. Michael Clarke Duncan is excellent and understated as John Coffey, a role that could easily be too overplayed in the wrong hands. The Green Mile is a classic film that will never age."
Big Germ,"Dec 16, 1999",9/10,"The Green Mile contains the best ensemble of actors.  In any film with Hanks it would be easy to lose the other actors in such a huge shadow, but everyone shines with equal brilliance.  All the characters are believable. The script is absolutely amazing and spreads the mezmerizing dialogue around very democratically.  Also, that mouse deserves some kudos for performing so well.  The Green Mile is the best movie I have seen this year, and while sitting for three hours seems to be an awfully large commitment on behalf of the viewer, not a minute of it is ill-spent."
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Jul 17, 2010",9/10,"If given the choice, I don't think many filmmakers would choose prison dramas as their area of expertise, but Frank Darabont seems to have no problem with it and neither should we; he has directed arguably the two greatest prison films ever made in his highly selective career. Both ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" are weighty but moving period pieces with impeccable characters and an epic quality considering the literal confines of the story. ""The Green Mile"" puts a supernatural twist on the genre and though it lacks the inspirational kick that allowed ""Shawshank"" to win the hearts of nearly all who've seen it, it holds its own among the many great dramas of the 1990s.Based on the Stephen King novel, ""The Green Mile"" is a Depression-era film that takes place in a Southern prison on the cell block that houses the criminals awaiting death and ""Old Sparky"" (the electric chair). The ensemble consists of a few of these prisoners and the guards that watch them, led by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks). The story is partially narrated by the elder version of Edgecomb as he reflects on the strange and life-changing events that occurred in that prison when a large man with mysterious healing abilities named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrived.Darabont's adaptation is meaty with smooth and effective story arcs and full-bodied characters who feel 100 percent authentic. Just like in ""Shawshank,"" Darabont separates the good guys from the bad guys quickly and they tug at our emotions right away. Doug Hutchison plays the mean-spirited and snotty Percy Wetmore, the one prison guard who's aunt is the governor's wife and tries to use that privilege to behave however he likes. All the other guards (a strong ensemble cast including David Morse and Barry Pepper) treat the prisoners with some humanity, but Percy treats them as if they're the scum of the earth, which easily rattles us.Darabont asks for a small leap of faith in that we're supposed to pity the prisoners, but considering the flaws of the criminal justice system at the time and excessive and unnecessary use of the death penalty, this is not too difficult. In general, Darabont has the uncanny ability to influence his audience and it's everywhere in ""The Green Mile,"" namely with characters. The introduction of Sam Rockwell's ""Wild Bill"" to the prison is the finest example. He acts catatonic until he gets to the prison and then attacks the guards. From there on out, his subplot is a roller coaster. When he finally gets what he deserves (solitary confinement a couple times) its cathartic for the viewer, but then he's right back at his usual hi-jinx.Character mastery is the strength of the film, but its weakness is the supernatural element. Considering it takes a long while to enter the picture and everything else feels like authentic historical fiction, John Coffey's healing abilities feel out of place even though they drive the latter half of the film. They're intriguing and add a layer of mystery that certainly complicates matters and when it's used it usually has an impact on the more powerful events of the story (one involving a wonderful little mouse named Mr. Jangles). Yet there's still a continuity issue that just kind of snaps the illusion of the film for a brief moment.""The Green Mile"" is often considered one of the greatest ""tearjerkers"" of all-time and it certainly warrants that notion whether you cry or not. Rarely does a film pull at your insides like this one, just as it did with ""Shawshank,"" and rarely does a three-hour movie manage to never get boring or talk-heavy. Darabont's excellent script carefully places the turning points of the story to ensure just that.Here is a film that will radically influence your perceptions of justice. The line between good and evil in this movie is so thick as if suggesting for every definitive good there is in this world there is its equal. Normally we're introduced in film to characters who suggest every person has the capacity for both, but ""The Green Mile"" argues that's not always the case. ""The Green Mile,"" which refers to the green floor of the cell block, symbolizes the path before one is ultimately judged as being one or the other. A tough idea, a powerful idea and one that suits the weighty impact of this film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
punawai,"Dec 1, 2000",N/A,"congratulations to a wonderful cast who could keep my attention riveted uninterrupted for 3 solid hours,with total obliteration of my personal surroundings.Tom Hanks is a wonderful entertainer whom I have followed avidly for years,but new to me was Michael Clarke Duncan,what an awesome actor,if his personality has even a remote resemblance to the role he played,well he must also be an awesome guy.For a movie which changed scenery so little,it only left those amazing character portrayals to lift the movie from the ordinary to the extraordinary. Congratulations to those wonderful people who give the world the magic of movie making."
daveisit,"Jan 9, 2001",6/10,"Tom Hanks seems to be obsessed with starring in movies that go for ridiculous lengths of time. Once again I was bored out of my brains watching Hanksy (who can act) work with nothing for 188 minutes. So much boredom, so much of my time wasted.I don't mind a magical story as long as the characters who are portrayed as normal humans react in such a manner. None of these characters did react realistically which quickly turned the movie into not only a raving bore, but an absolute farce as well.I didn't altogether hate this movie, even though it was awful. If the small potential it possessed was condensed into a two hour flick then it may have kept me from yawning for 188 ridiculously long minutes."
bad-mojo,"Mar 16, 2007",9/10,"It's rare that I'm moved to tears by a film; I'm rather hard to impress. Schindler's List, for example, almost got me crying -- almost, but not quite. The Shawshank Redemption is another one. This film, however, never fails to make me weep.John Coffey's life as a Christ-like figure on Death Row is touching and moving. The only reason this fails to achieve a ten-vote from me is because of a certain scene involving ""punishment"" that seems out of character -- I'll say no more than that, but you will recognize it when you see it.Suffice it to say there is not much to be written about this film other than that it is worthy of the highest praise; if you have not seen it, you must do so -- and if you have, then you know why it moved me to tears."
lamourfifi,"Dec 19, 2004",8/10,"I watched the Green Mile a few days ago and since then have come back to it twice. My children have sat through all three hours, silent, and obviously moved. While the magical elements are at times whimsical, the leisurely drawing of the characters and the sheer weight of Tom Hank's and the supporting cast's acting, ensure that what could have been an over sentimental movie leaves you with the feeling that you have spent a worthwhile 3 hours - a rare feeling. This is not a particularly challenging film - its treatment of the death penalty is ambiguous but this is not the real thrust of the plot - this is a film about people, love and moral conscience. Main criticism is the end - unnecessarily contrived adding nothing to the message."
claybo76,"Dec 3, 2000",10/10,"I was riveted to the serial chapters of The Green Mile when Stephen King first published them in 1996 and I was absolutely delighted to learn of the film being made.  I was really hoping that they wouldn't screw it up.  I needn't have worried.This is a brilliant film, and it is as close to perfection as you can get. It is everything I wanted it to be.  The entire cast are magnificent, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan and Doug Hutchinson.  I feel that Michael Jeter's performance was ignored, because he was fantastic.  Tom Hanks, as always, well...the man can do no wrong.  He's an excellent actor.I can only describe this movie as essential viewing.  It will move you so much, if you haven't seen it yet, please take the time.  Be prepared for that lump in your throat, though."
mahmoud_abdelmohsen811,"May 8, 2014",8/10,"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears."
Spleen,"Jun 22, 2000",6/10,"Everyone remember the story about Christ and the public stoning?  Well, to the extent that ""The Green Mile"" is Christian allegory, Christ said something like this: `Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.  -Oh wait, I'M without sin!""  THUNK!Why does everyone assume that this story even takes place in a Christian universe?  Is it because so many of the characters are Christian?  But this is 1930s American South.  What did you expect?  When a character with supernatural powers of healing lumbers up, OF COURSE everyone assumes the powers are God-given; they assume his perfectly ordinary eyebrows are God-given, too; but the script gives us no reason to suppose that they're right.  Rather the reverse.  There's something random and essentially pointless about Coffey's abilities and actions, something that suits an atheist or pagan universe in which all sorts of oddities just turn up, something which doesn't justify the atmosphere of reverential ponderousness adopted by Frank Darabont and his cast.  (What IS that brown dust that Coffey spews out periodically?  Is it now OBLIGATORY for directors to run the rough footage through a computer and make it worse somehow?)  But it's a very modern sort of paganism.  There's nothing at all beautiful about the magic, which is a telling flaw.Look: it's not as bad as I thought it would be.  I THOUGHT that Darabont would have let the extravagant praise heaped upon ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (a good film, by the way) go to his head, and produce a slow, lingering, pompous version of a less interesting story.  Sort of true, but it has its moments (although, as more than one critic I've read has added, ""perhaps by chance"").  I thought Tom Hanks would be unendurable.  Surprisingly, he does a good job, all things considered.  I thought the racism would get on my nerves.  It's not really racist.  Coffey is a simpleton, but not because of the rule that blacks must be simpletons; rather, the rule is that good people must be simpletons.  (Coffey is so good he can barely form sentences.)  I thought that the bookends would waste my time and weaken the film's structure.  They do.Objectively speaking, a bad film; but, although my interest waxed and waned, it was easy to stay involved through to the end."

Such a brilliant story seldom comes around and having acting and direction to match is a miracle.The movie featured a diverse lineup of talented actors, and having Frank Darabont as a director helped bring them to life and provided great scenes typical of the 1930's.I was particularly impressed by the settings for the films. They mastered American ranch life in that time period and I always felt like I was in the era.Stephen King obviously influenced the supernatural features of the movie, which were put into screen format brilliantly.As I said, A Wonderful Watch. 9/10."
graemeneilson,"Apr 13, 2006",10/10,This was a brilliant movie. Why? Because it had great actors who understood their parts and played them well. That and the fact that they stayed true to an Excellent book. It is hard to find things like this today when it is all trying to make things cool for the younger people. The way great books can be murdered to turn a buck. The Green Mile proves that sticking to a great concept can also make a brilliant movie.Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan made this movie into what it is. If you have read the book then you will know that they fill those images in our minds we get from the writer. Hope you enjoyed both Movie and book as much as I did.G
mariasacouto,"Feb 17, 2007",10/10,"only recently have I seen this movie, and I must say that despite the excellent performances of the characters, this story reveals to be a huge lesson of life. this is the story of the contrast between life(portrayed by the guards) and death(convicts). there's a lot of emotions mixed : revolt, anger, despise, contempt, love, self survival..and humor. the movie represents the American mentality of the thirties, that is, no respect for human life. the motto was to punish and revenge and not restore and re-educate to integration. apart from other comments I've read, I think Paul happens to be human; he treats the convicts with some kind of mercy and humanity, as he understands they are no longer alive inside that prison."
gavin6942,"Nov 17, 2014",8/10,"The lives of guards on Death Row are affected by one of their charges: a black man (Michael Clarke Duncan) accused of child murder and rape, yet who has a mysterious gift.Starting off early with ""Top Hat"", not unlike its use in ""Purple Rose of Cairo"", one wonders if this old film has grown in popularity since its earlier days... but this is neither here nor there.The writing of Stephen King is largely dismissed by critics, and the movies made of his books are very hit and miss. The same with Frank Darabont, whose work is overall nothing terribly special. Yet, somehow when they come together, they do amazing things, at least with prison films. Both this and ""Shawshank Redemption"" have sat firmly on IMDb's Top 250, usually very high on the list.And this one should be. Maybe not high art like the French new wave films or the works of Chaplin, Kubrick and others, but this is a movie that will be timeless. One hundred years from now, it will still be remembered and enjoyed by fans. And that means something."
hokiemo,"Mar 18, 2004",N/A,"This movie makes you wonder how many innocent people have been executed.  I found strong religious symbolism in John Coffey to Jesus Christ in that Jesus performed miracles and he too was put to death despite his peaceful and innocent nature.  I do believe images from the movie will stay with you long after, but not in a bad way.  I didn't think the movie pushed a viewpoint regarding death row convictions in one direction or the other, but just made you think about the judicial system.  Maybe DNA testing would have freed John Coffey if the year was 2004, but I think he would have been implicated in some way, maybe as an accomplice, since people judge each other based on appearances.  There was one very nasty character in the movie who most people would agree deserved death row. But of course, is the satisfaction of putting down the vile murderers of the world worth the life of even 1 innocent person?  What if that innocent person was you?"
crazy_c02,"Jun 4, 2003",6/10,"I'm quite surprised at the high marks this has been attracting, as I thought that this was a bloated version of The Shawshank Redemption. The performances from the cast are very good, but the script have the same pull that Shawshank had. My own opinion is that whereas the mind-numbing grind of life behind bars was alluded to (and briefly illustrated) in Shawshank, The Green Mile seems intent on spelling more of it out. The film feels sluggish and leaden, and the plodding pace means that by the time the grand finale comes, you're not sure whether you care or not! Could have been great...."
Steven Reynolds,"Feb 20, 2000",5/10,"Well-acted, nicely shot, and at moments quite moving, ""The Green Mile"" is ultimately undone by its staggering 188 minute running time.  Such languorous pacing adds nothing to the film - except fuel the audience's irritation with an unforgivably predictable plot and some pretty heavy-handed moralizing.  Darabont tries his best to wring some significance out of King's story, but the material ultimately proves to be too slight: this tale could have been capably told in 100 minutes or, better yet, deployed as a 20 minute ""prison life"" vignette in a film such as Darabont's vastly superior ""The Shawshank Redemption.""  Dragging it over three hours stretches the material too thinly, and in the end leaves a potentially deep story looking rather shallow.  This is a good lesson in filmmaking: you can have a fine director, a savvy cinematographer, a marvellous score, an excellent cast, and $60 million to play with - but if you don't have a decent screenplay, then you might as well stay home.  Just ask Kevin Costner.   5/10"

I have seen this movie MANY times and NEVER get bored of it! Not many movies move your emotions like the Green Mile as well! I could not understand in 2000 how it did not win or get nominated for more awards!! Hanks wasn't even nominated for an Oscar? Probably because 3 wins in-a-row would be unheard of! It's crazy how Stephen King, the master of horror novels has had many great screen adaptations, but his 2 best were prison based flicks, Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile .. with the same Director I might add! How come they just don't make these great movies anymore? The 1990's was a great decade for movies! Silence of the Lambs, Braveheart, Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile, Titanic, Jurassic Park, Shindler's List, all in my top 10 of all time! The past decade has been ""crap"" in comparison! Again, The Green Mile ... a great movie!"

Tucker_Keon,"Aug 18, 2008",9/10,"It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. ""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999."

williamunny1,"Nov 30, 2002",N/A,"The Green Mile was a powerful film. It is one of the best films of all time. The acting, it was a Oscar deserving performance. Michael Clark Duncan played convicted killer John Coffey and Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb. Duncan delievered a powerful performance. He has that child like look in his eyes, something most actors cannot portray. Duncan also portrays that innocence that only a child would have. In a literal sense, John Coffey was an angel. Hanks delivered an equally powerful performance. Everyone who acted in that film did a wonderful job. This film like a lot of King's other films explore human nature. The Green Mile will be remembered as one of the best."
moonspinner55,"Jul 1, 2006",7/10,"Prison guards in the 1930s are profoundly touched by one Death Row inmate. Surprisingly complex, absorbing and emotional film--surprising because ""The Green Mile"" is a big commercial release, it is (ostensibly) another Tom Hanks vehicle, and it's yet another adaptation of a Stephen King story--and yet, the talented filmmakers are able to pull some lovely magic from this trifecta. The subject matter, featuring several vile supporting characters, is unpleasant, though this doesn't detract from the emotional value of the piece, which is professionally-handled despite one or two small missteps (an execution scene, for instance, which runs too long). Terrific acting by Hanks (who blends right in with the large cast) and Michael Clarke Duncan, exceptional production design and cinematography. Some may quibble over the epilogue, but it's a sweet touch in a movie with a big heart. *** from ****"
zza99tmk,"Mar 6, 2000",1/10,"I really wanted to like this film, I really tried to. But in the end I heavily regretted having seen it and personally I think of ""The Green Mile"" as the first appalling film of this year. This saddens me the more as the director of that film is Frank Darabont who brought us the wonderful ""Shawshank Redemption"". The parallels to his debut from 1994 are obvious: a prison story full of optimism(a friendship between the two main protagonists (one black, one white)) written by the same author (King) and again overlength (this time you've even got a running time of 3 hours+).I would argue that already the story itself is problematic in its conception: the characterisation is implausible. The prisoners (with the exception of one) are all portrayed as good natured men who obviously could do no harm to other people. It makes the fact that they've been sentenced to death for heinous crimes the more unlikely. For a grim and dark place like a prison the green mile is a unusual harmonistic place.This depiction of a prison and the characters is not just naive and almost laughable, it also reminded me of how more realistic and appropriate in such terms ""Shawshank Redemption"" was. People could say that the film generally is not very realistic since John Coffey has supernatural powers but I honestly think that capital punishment is a too serious subject to treat it as an element of a fairy tale. Moreover the film never questions the death penalty, the message rather seems to be that death row is a necessity. Again I was reminded of an another film, Tim Robbins' ""Dead Man Walking"", arguably one of the best and most important american films of the last decade(if you want to see an appropriate and artistic convincing account of the death row, then you're in for a treat).There's basically nothing to say against an optimistic approach when you're talking about such a sad, disturbing and important issue, but what made me really upset about ""The Green Mile"" is the unbearable extent of sentimentality and naivety in the film. Sure, ""Shawshank Redemption"" was emotional, too; but there it felt right, there Darabont managed to find the right tone - here it is just pure kitsch. When Coffey says towards the end something along the lines that people shouldn't treat each other badly and that he wants a peaceful world, I almost started to giggle. Moreover the contrast between the harmonistic, light- hearted scenes with the mouse and the execution scenes doesn't work at all, it destroys the film. Moreover these three scenes (particularly Percys revenge on Delacroix) are not justdisgusting(and believe me, I can really bear a lot),they perfectly fit into this unpleasant mixture of feel good- mentality and pathos. There were good performances in the film (Doug Hutchinson, the ""Polaroid Man"" from Chris Carters ""Millennium"", Michael Duncan Clarke, who made the best out of his cliche role), but in the end I didn't care about the one or two good things I could say about this film. And Tom Hanks? Well, Hanks should really try something new-he's played the clean, good-natured guy so often, that it starts to get on my nerves and not just on mine.I just can't put into words, how much better, how superior ""Shawshank"" was than ""The Green Mile"". The difference is not just striking, it really hurts. When I was watching ""The Green Mile"" I heard people in the audience crying - I was tempted too, but not because I was moved, no, in my case it would have been out of sheer disgust. What a missed opportunity..."
itchy-8,"Jan 10, 2000",10/10,"This is an excellent adaptation of a novel, far better than most adaptations. I've been to see it 4 times (I'm not usually that type) and each time the audience is larger and more expressive. Full burst of applause at the end, as at a play. Too bad there's no curtain call, because everyone is great. This movie, I'm afraid, is going to get ripped off at the Oscars. I've seen many excellent movies this year, but this is the best.Watch for the little things. ([1] I think the last line of the movie is an ""in"" joke. [2] Del assumes a Jesus-crucified position as his mouse runs across his shoulders. [3] John refers to God specifically as ""God the Father""; there is more than a hint that he himself represents the Son, whose initials {and, in some cases, abilities} he shares. [4] Check out the names on the tombstones at Elaine's funeral. [5] Old Paul's teacup is one of a set that he and his wife had in the 30s. [6] Melinda gives John a St. Christopher medal; St. Christopher is supposed to have carried Christ to safety once. [7] Hammersmith, an unsympathetic observer of the early part of John's ordeal, has a name that suggests preparation for crucifixion. No doubt there's more!)"
rkeaney,"Feb 14, 2006",9/10,"This movie, well what can i say from the same director and author of The Shawshank Redemption which you can sort of guess from numerous similarities.The movie starts off in an elderly peoples home where we meet Paul Edgecomb a resident at the home he talks with his friend and eventually starts telling her the story of John Coffey...We go back some 60 years to the time when Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks -who i thought was magnificent in this film)worked in the ""E"" block in Louisiana state prison everything in this prison is pretty routine with nearly all the cell mates on death row bound for a visit to the electric chair this all changes when John Coffey(Michael Clarke Duncan- also exceptional) who was wrongly accused of the rape and murder of two small girls ,the man who stands at a bit over 8ft comes into the ""E"" block upset and with a remorseful look on his face the guards are soon very shocked to discover that this giant of a man is afraid of the dark.The Guards soon find out the mysteriousness of this man who it seems couldn't of been guilty of this crime as they also find out that he has the power to perform miracles.This is a magnificent movie one that I strongly advise any movie lover to see it is a very upsetting movie so don't try to promise yourself that your not going to cry or be very emotional because when the credits come rolling you really cant help it not as great as Shawshank but definitely up there.10/10 WITHOUT A DOUBT!Deserves to be up in the top 50 movies of all time not in the 120's!!!!!"
Enesy_1907,"Oct 5, 2025",10/10,"When The Green Mile ended, I just sat there staring at the screen for a while. The film drags you through so many emotions that at some point, you don't even know what to feel anymore. It's powerful, heartbreaking, and deeply human all at once.Yes, it's a long movie - but every minute of it matters. The story moves slowly, yet everything has meaning. The characters are so well-written that each one touches your heart in a different way. Tom Hanks is brilliant, but John Coffey steals the show - it feels like you're witnessing something truly miraculous.This isn't just a movie about death row or justice; it's about kindness, faith, and what it means to be human. Some scenes take your breath away, some make your eyes water, but by the end, you can only think, ""I'm really glad I watched this.""In short, The Green Mile isn't just a film it's an experience that stays with you long after it's over.Rating : 10/10."
JimmySturt,"Oct 9, 2010",10/10,"The Green Mile is THE most moving film I have ever seen. John Coffey is accused of murdering two children. He is eight feet tall and has a childlike mentality, often crying himself to sleep in his cell. With a run time of just over 3 hours, you can be sure to have an immense amount of sympathy for this 'Big Friendly Giant' as he awaits his execution on Death Row. You can also be sure to shed a few tears at the end of the film, so don't forget the tissues ;) This film is most definitely a 10 outta 10, although arguably deserves much more. It is a film guaranteed to make you feel an exotic cocktail of emotions, and with the sad ending, it will be on your mind for long after it finishes. I would recommend to EVERYONE to watch, despite the 18 certificate I personally think it is suitable for a younger audience."
yan_rules_50,"Jul 14, 2013",10/10,"After reading the book, i was sure i would be disappointed by the movie, but no. The movie was really well done and even made me cry. It's probably more the story than the screenplay, but this movie is still one of the best i've ever seen. The acting is really good, the story fits the book. I think this movie is more for adults, but it can be appreciated by everyone. I wouldn't suggest it to too young people, but it can be a good movie for 10+.

jjcanty,"Apr 11, 2001",1/10,"This is the worst film i've seen all year, in fact I thought it was aimed at children.  How anyone can call this a piece of uplifting cinema is beyond me.  Okay, Tom Hanks gives a pretty good performance for a one-dimensional do-gooder, but the rest of the film is pantomime of the cheesiest kind, Puss-in-Boots at my local theatre was less predictable. The characters are cliched stereotypes bar none.  We have good kindly guy, comedy good guy, insane bad guy, nice but dim black guy (particularly offensive for this millennium) which leads us to a tedious sermon on good v evil of the most simplistic sort .  The director is clearly living off his reputation, having directed the excellent 'SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION' and poor old Stephen King must be turning in his bed (hopefully he's recovered now). The best thing about the film is Mr Jangles the comedy reincarnating mouse who makes a glorious reappearance in the final reel with slightly longer fur.  The death of Mr Jangles earlier on in the proceedings probably arouses more sympathy from sentimental American audiences than the sight of nasty prisoners frying in 'Old Sparky'.  Please go and watch 'Midnight Express' instead for a slightly more realistic representation of prison life. Risible."
gordywright,"Mar 13, 2002",10/10,"After many years, and hundreds of films, I really thought that The Godfather was the finished article, it couldn't be bettered.Until that is, I bought The Green Mile on a whim.I confess that I am a huge fan of Stephen Kings early work, Carrie, Salems Lot, The Stand,( in which Gary Sinese is tremendous)Christine,etc. Although in my opinion, most of his writing since Misery has been pretty grim.This is very different indeed.As an example, when I bought the film, I came home and stuck it in DVD player, just to watch the first 15 minutes, to see if I could get a grip on the plot. I was concerned that it would be another Geralds Game or Delores Claibourne and would be better in the bin.I watched the first 15 minutes and checked the clock, and found that 50 minutes had passed!!.  As i had to go work, I Left it alone.Later I watched it with my wife, and when it was over, we watched it all again.This without doubt the best film I have ever seen.  I have recommended it to numerous people who have, without fail come back to and said ""what a film , this is the best they have ever seen"".Tom Hanks is excellent, and in my opinion gives an Oscar winning performance when he is not even on screen!!, in a portion that he does with John Coffey ( Michael Clarke Duncan), Who tries to explain himself to Hanks.The opening part of the film, where a posse is searching for two missing girls, is frightening when they catch up with Coffey, you could see someone shoot Coffey, and it wouldn't have been out of place.David Morse is very good, as always, with a dry wit, that permeates through his role, similar to Victor Borge in a lot of ways.Doug Hutchinson as Percy Wetmore is tremendous, if ever i wanted to give someone in a film a punch in the face, he is the one. He plays the slimy, backside kissing, hateful, know it all to a tee.The only flaw I could find in the whole film was James Cromwell.  He played his part very very well indeed, but every time I see him in a film, I think of him as Zephram Cochrane in Star Trek - First Contact, Boogying hid brains out.This is an awesome film, without doubt the best of them all, better than the Godfather, not by much, but better, if you haven't seen it, watch it, and then , watch it again./"
osnelgro,"Feb 6, 2006",8/10,"The Green Mile wasn't as good as the shawshank redemption but it was still worth the watch. It was good because it began as your average prison start that didn't exactly blow me off my seat but it the gradually became more and more interesting until it eventually began to become a bit stupid when the guards discovered that the man on death row had some powers.The story is about an execution place where everything is normal until tall, mean looking, colored man enters and the saying don't judge a book by it's cover definitely occurs with this film when he touches everyone's heart and the workers there start to query the execution of the tall colored man.I'll admit that when the guards call out ""Dead man walking down the green mile"" it does become quite upsetting for the characters that you have just gotten used to are becoming executed. The acting is very, very good which should have won some awards.I'm not overly keen on the fact of the powers that the colored man gains powers, I found that that turned a normal movie in to a weird movie and those two certainly do not go well together. The directing was fantastic because the picture looked brilliant and the it also gave the depressing mood that it aimed to give.The Green Mile is certainly as I have already explained very different to your average film but still give's that upsetting atmosphere that it was aiming to give. The acting was very good that almost brought tear to my eye especially from Tom Hanks. The Director gave a brilliant atmosphere and the writer did very well until the disappointing end."

Although containing some very disturbing images, Green Mile, the (1999) Is one extrordinery movie, in wich everything connects. It makes you wonder. it creates inner feelings. from the begining, you just know, john coffey didn't kill those little girls. From the begining of the movie you see how evil persy is. from shouting ""A dead man walkin'! Dead man walkin' here, people! A dead man walkin'!"", too where he tries to kill Mr. jingles, and when it killed it. and to the very disturbing point when he didn't wet the spunge. From that point, you just feel you want to make him pain... It shows how much sadism can be painful, if it isn't ceing controlable. Tom Hanks is the greatest actor, or one of them. each movie is being putt into your memory, and it's a feeling like your'e in another planet, watching earth at all it's glory..."
Oliveraandreasson,"Jan 27, 2020",10/10,"This movie is a masterpiece, plain and simple. It is well acted, has a beautiful story, a fantastic ending and is extremely emotional. I'd like to focus on the latter, and if you want a more ""normal"" review, there's plenty of those on this site. Let me tell you about about three ways this movie absolutely toyed with my emotions in ways I did not expect;1. It made me cry more than Forrest Gump. This is truly a feat, and a record I thought never would be broken.2. It made me despise a character even more than Joffrey from Game of Thrones. Yet another truly hard task.3. It made me walk away from the screen with my ears covered and eyes closed, for the first time since I was little. I just couldn't stand the shocking brutality of what I was watching.This raw emotion is what I believe is the true strength of this film, and what sets it apart from other movies. If there's any movie at all out there that's deserving of a 10/10 rating, this is certainly one of them. Stunning."
Quentin-12,"Dec 19, 1999",N/A,"First off I must say that this was, hands down, an amazing film - there can be no argument about that.  Beautifully acted, directed and written, now all of that aside can this movie be seen as anything other than a re-telling of the New Testament set in a prison???  John Coffey, first off let's look at the man's initial's for starters, excluding the fact that Paul (Tom Hanks) tells us that he's God's mircale worker, it looks pretty obvious as to the real identity of who Michael Duncan was playing :).  Next we have the apostle, aka prison gaurds, with Paul playing the role of Peter, who denies John Coffey the chance at freedom three times - and his punishment is to watch everyone die. (which I found to be the high point of the film).  Our beloved mouse-killer Percy is Judas, and Wild Bill and the french guy that owned Mr. Jingles were the two criminals that died with Jesus on the mountain - one of who asks for forgiveness, the other who doubts him.  Now as for Mr. Jingle - is he perhaps God himself?  Who knows....  This movie is hands down the #1 film of the year so far, still waiting for ""Man on the Moon"" to open - Hanks was stellar but not Oscar worthy - defintly up to par with ""Shawshank"" it not only meets Darabont's previous attempt, but destroys it."

That said, it's a shame that in its third hour the movie just keeps getting increasingly ridiculous to the point that I really can't recommend it. Oscar nomination for best picture was a joke, as was the one Michael Clark Duncan as the giant, childlike black death row inmate.

I was working on a school project at the time and I turned the television on just as a little distraction to keep me entertained abit. I kept the movie on for about 45 minutes until I realized just what I had accidentally tuned in to. I forced myself to turn the TV off because I knew this was a movie one needed to watch and devote all their attention to - and if I would have kept it on my project would never of been touched.About a week or two later I found myself with an empty Saturday afternoon, I sat down to watch a little TV. To my unexpected surprise The Green Mile was airing again on History channel and I caught it about 20 minutes after the part I had originally left off. I simply had to watch the rest of it, and quite quickly, the movie I suspected to be a deep & powerful story evolved into so much more.When the movie ended I sat through the credits unable to move, paralyzed in awe. The story was unbelievably powerful, messages were abundant, acting was terrific, cinematography was outstanding and I simply can't praise this movie enough. Keep in mind I missed the beginning of the movie and a small portion of the middle and this is the way I feel - as soon as I get a chance I will buy this movie and watch it through fully. It shook in a way very very few other films have ever managed to even come close to and I immediately knew the answer to that perplexing question, which before this experience I never believed was answerable: If you could only pick one movie to ever own and watch for the rest of your life, what would it be?Do NOT let the runtime scare you (I have always had a mean bias against movies running longer than 2 hours) it will be over much sooner than you want it to be. Watch this movie alone with no distractions. Have a tissue box next to you, if you let yourself understand the characters and the situations there is no doubt in my mind that little box will come in handy. This movie WILL move you - be prepared."
chris-syvertsen,"Jan 5, 2021",10/10,"Shawshank is great, but THIS really is a better movie. I know there is a supernatural aspect to it, but how John Coffey affects you is just so much. Especially now with MCD actually gone. This for me is my top movie of all time. Still can't watch it without going to pieces. Top Hanks and the whole cast do an amazing job of connecting us. So, so, good. This 6'4"" giant still is a puddle on a couch every time I watch it. I'm not even ashamed."
jayrb-30977,"Apr 8, 2020",10/10,"This will rip the emotions out of anyone. It starts with an old man telling the story of when he worked on death row. He tells the story of John Coffee a innocent man who had a miracle gifted by God who was wrongly sentenced to death. On IMDB its the 29th highest rated, but I feel it is still one of the most underrated movies of all time. Everyone must see this before they die"
cdmcdade,"Dec 7, 1999",10/10,"This will be the film of the year. The combination of cast, director, writer, producer makes this one of the best films that you will ever have an opportunity to see. Filming this movie was such a blast! All departments worked great together and everything seemed to just fall into place. A lot of hard work went into The Green Mile and it shows."
silvery_tomcat,"Dec 5, 2002",10/10,This is an absolutely stunning movie. Looks brilliant and with a truly moving story and a brilliant cast which does not fail to dissapoint. It's really good to see a film that doesn't make it's money from special effects and big explosions getting the attention that this does.Brilliant!
Joe Moretti,"Dec 29, 1999",N/A,"The film business is certainly going out of the 20th century with one hell of a bang.  1999 has had an astonishing amount of excellent films with some of the most powerful acting that I can think of.  Just trying to keep up with the slew of great films is a full time job and here at the tail end of the year comes another superb, if slightly flawed piece of filmmaking, ""The Green Mile"".  Like 1994's, ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Green Mile"" is adapted from a Stephen King novella and directed by Frank Darabont, who also directed ""Shawshank"".  The Green Mile of the film is the section of the Louisiana State Penitentiary for death row inmates. Tom Hanks is Paul Edgecomb, the head guard of death row, who is battling a nasty urinary track infection, a sadistic guard (Doug Hutchinson) and the crew of inmates, particularly the nasty William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell).  Enter into Edgecombs life, but a new prisoner, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) who has been convicted of brutally raping and killing two young girls.  A seven-foot gentle giant, Paul is convinced that Coffey is not capable of harming a soul, especially after witnessing his unique healing powers that can't be explained.  The more Paul gets to know him, the harder it is for him to walk Coffey down that green mile.""The Green Mile"" is somewhat sentimental and predictable, a tad bit too long, starts off at a snails pace, plus the one prison guard is a typical stock villain and the mouse bit (a very cute one to boot) goes on a little too long, but this film is good old fashion story telling with some great acting to help it rise above its minor flaws. It is a powerful and mystical tale that shows the best and worse in humanity.  Much superior to ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Green Mile"" is one of this years best films that relies on great writing with potent acting. The acting is pretty much flawless and Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are being mentioned for Oscar time.  Both are very good, especially Hanks, who gives another great performance as Paul, but it is Michael Jetter who deserves the Oscar nomination for supporting actor as inmate Eduard Delacroix.  Jetter, a veteran actor of film, stage and television (Evening Shade), gives a brilliant performance creating a very memorable character.  It was not till part way through the movie that I realized that the actor was Michael Jetter.  It will be a major disappointment if he is not nominated; it is a remarkable performance in a film with some of this year's finest acting. David Morse (St. Elsewhere) as prison guard Brutus also does superb work. This fine actor should be working much more; he is totally captivating while on screen.  Overall this is some of the finest ensemble acting this year.Tom Hanks has good instincts for picking great roles in very good films and ""The Green Mile"" shows him at the peak of his career.  If only more of today's ""movie stars"" could follow his lead.  ""The Green  Mile"", another great film to end 1999 and this century. Recommended.  × × × × out of 5."
smartgggg,"Jan 23, 2003",3/10,"Yesterday, I saw 'The Green Mile'. I actually expected quite a bit from it, based on comments and its rating on IMDB. But disappointment hit me early, and it was a direct blow that knocked me down and out.Prisons are fun, aren't they? Well, in this film they sure are. Chasing a mouse and stuff. And, oh yeah, most inmates waiting for the electrical chair are actually kind, nice, sometimes even philosophical people. THEY are the victims. Not the relatives of the people they murdered. Those inmates are in there for murder for crying out loud. But they act as if they can't even put their own pants on. And this Percy character, he is really 'bad'. But he's the most 'real' person in the entire film---a film which is basically as ridiculous as Tom Hanks playing a SERIOUS role. Tom Hanks IS Forrest Gump, or the main character in ""Big"", both essentially being large kids. Picturing Hanks as a warden is as silly as claiming that James Bond is a monogamist.After having fast-forwarded the second half of the movie, I'm trying to figure out whether it was intended to be a comedy or a drama. Essentially, it's neither.""I'm tired boss"", well, I'm tired of this film, which I give a green light. A green light to take the 3-lane highway, right into the trash-bin.And, please, let someone please get rid of that stupid mouse!Rating from the Dutch judge: 3 (out of 10)."
guilhermetirone,"Apr 20, 2018",10/10,JUST WATCH IT!!! This film just goes straight to our emotions deep into the twilight room of the soul. Extraordinary. Beautiful. Uncommon. A materpiece. 3 hours of pure greatness. Its a shame that some people just didnt get the message that this masterpiece gives.
Moondog,"Dec 21, 1999",10/10,"Stephen King truly is a brilliant storyteller. This is another of his novels (but the first 6-parter) to be made into an instantly classic film. Featuring rich, gripping performances by David Morse, Michael Duncan, Doug Hutchison, and of course Tom Hanks, this movie presents the human struggles with good and evil, justice and law, and our ultimate fate.  Kings story telling juxtaposes often gruesomely terrible events with the true goodness of the human soul.  Because he is never afraid to present the audience horrific images of the evil potential of man, his examples of goodness and love shine through even brighter."
ebarnabas,"Oct 3, 2020",10/10,"This film is outstanding. I can't even count the number of times I have seen it.I think I could write a very long-winded review about the movie if I had to, but I will not.
Suffice it to say that one scene after another the cast proves to be singularly superb in all the ways of bringing the characters to life. They convey all manners of human emotions, ambitions, mannerism etc. in such a wonderful way that many times you just wish you were right there with them. Tension, levity, grace and brutality, love and hate, caring and rejection, and so much more. The movie is crafted with elegance and style moreover, it is made to be watched and enjoyed on very deep levels.I heartily recommend this film to everyone!"
steve_baillargeon,"Jan 29, 2006",10/10,"I saw The green mile yesterday, and wow I was very astonished. This is really a fantastic movie and sometimes I had the envy to cry when seeing it.It relates the story of Paul Edgecomb, a former warden who witnessed during the Depression miracles in jail which changed his life forever. He met John Coffey, a physically shaped and tall prisoner who was wrongfully accused of the murders of 2 little girls and unfortunately sentenced to death. This guy, a very kind person despite his threatening shape, was in reality a healer who cures with Faith, and he did miracles, like resurrecting a mouse who was crushed by a rebellious warden, curing the wife of Edgecomb's friend (who was in the death article) and of course curing Paul's painful urinal infection.But the most important thing that happened, is when Paul took the hand of John Coffey after he resurrected the mouse. It gave him almost immortality, cause in the end, Paul Edgecomb told his girl friend that he was 108 years old, and I was surprised for a man who takes walks outside with such shape and age. Unfortunately, all of his friends he had and loved, including his wife, died while he grew older and older. The green mile is a very long road to take...The green mile is a very fantastic and fabulous movie that everyone should watch, cause you'll like it and maybe cry.Steve Baillargeon"
Petals4Zuzu,"Sep 2, 2010",10/10,"As of Summer 2010, this masterpiece is my favorite film of all time, I'm a movie critic, and not a single film stands up to this creative, passionate and extraordinary movie. I caught on FX a few summers back and I was just enthralled in this epic masterwork. I like Michael Caine, but Duncan deserved the Oscar as a sad, runaway slave accused of raping & killing 2 little girls. Tom Hanks and Sam Rockwell are also great, some of the best performances cinema has to offer. Also, I've yet to see ""American Beauty,"" but it's pretty safe to say I'll like this film better, so I was also sad to hear it lost Best Picture to that film. Long live ""The Green Mile,"" a masterpiece every human being should enjoy!"
pinoverde,"Mar 9, 2016",10/10,"What to say, one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen! It makes 3 hours pass like a second. One day a new prisoner arrives. He is a gigantic black man, framed by the low-angle camera to loom over the guards and duck under doorways. This is John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelled the same""), and he has been convicted of molesting and killing two little white girls. From the start it is clear he is not what he seems. He is afraid of the dark, for one thing. He is straightforward in shaking Paul's hand--not like a man with anything to be ashamed of. The actors are the best and nothing else to say. Best of all"
hhharmon,"May 12, 2001",10/10,"This is a must see movie. One of the best group of actors I have seen in one film in a long time. If this one doesn't catch a tear, none will.

avatar6,"Aug 21, 2000",N/A,"I just watched this movie, and was moved to tears. The big deal is, I haven't cried at a movie since I was 9 years old, and I'm considerably older than that now! This movie was just that powerful. It wasn't so much the plot, but the people that evoked such emotion. The guards and the kindness they showed to people who had committed heinous crimes, really made me well up. The acting was superb by everyone. I especially liked the performance of the highly underrated David Morse. When this stoic character cried, I did also. Just something about his performance I found striking. I also found Duncan's performance to be outstanding. He was so believable and REAL. Wonderful movie all 'round. Kudos to everyone who made it what it was... a fantastic film with a fantastic cast!"
lagudafuad,"Oct 25, 2012",7/10,"The Green Mile is based on a 1996 Stephen King novel of the same name. Done three years after the book release, the Green Mile was nominated for four Academy Awards, which included Best Supporting Actor for Michael Clarke Duncan, Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Adapted Screenplay.The movie was directed by Frank Darabont who also developed the screenplay of the movie under an eight week period, an adapted screenplay that i have to commend as one of the best i have seen, but it lost in the Oscars to the movie The Cider House Rules. Frank Darabont was also in charge of directing the critical acclaim The Shawshank Redemption which also earned him a nomination of best Adapted screenplay in 1994.The high point of this movie will be the whole movie itself; i happen to have read the book before seeing the movie so watching a well adapted novel on the silver screen made me feel like i was reading the book all over again.The movie plot and the story itself are based on a flashback of a tale Paul Edgecomb was telling an old friend about his time as a corrections officer in charge of death row inmates in the Cold Mountain Penitentiary in 1935.The cell block Paul (Tom Hanks) worked in was called the ""Green Mile"" because the condemned prisoners walking to their execution are said to be walking ""the last mile"". Here, it is a stretch of faded lime-green linoleum. The other guards which were Paul's friends in the movie were Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery DeMunn), and Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper).In addition to the guards was Percy (Doug Hutchison) an arrogant misfit who took pride in terrorising the inmates.Everything in the cell block was as usual until the guards got a visit from two inmates who changed their very view of life itself.One of the inmates that visited was John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) a giant of a man who had some weird miraculous power ability to heal and feel the pain and sufferings of others and the other was ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell) who was a psycho, murderer and paedophile.Their arrival was plagued with chaos miraculous healings and with the addition of Percy it became a handful for the other guards.The Green Mile is a movie i have seen over and over again, and i believe you will enjoy watching it too.www.lagsreviews.com"
Mike-299,"Jan 6, 2002",5/10,"This was a good- not great- movie. The sad part is that if it wasn't so drawn out, it would have been much better. The acting- particularly Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan- was tremendous. However, the other characters really aren't fleshed out well at all, which is really bad in a three hour plus long movie. ""Shawshank"" it ain't."

It is such a beautiful story, so masterfully directed, acted and brought to life. Stellar performances all round.Tom Hanks does what he always does and plays the role to perfection and between him and Michael Clarke Duncan they create the perfect pair.Frank Darabont does it again. His direction and visually story telling as well as his ability to create pure emotion is something throughout the majority of his work. There are better directors in my opinion but no one does emotion the way Darabont does.Stunning."

I never get tears at a movie, but whit this one i did, that why i think the movie is so great(im glad i watchet alone). The great thing of the movie to is that it takes 3 hours before you can go on whit your normall life again, but the time wented very fast while watching the movie. I think it's one of the best movie around. Ive you like this one you must see Shaw Shank Redemption too!"
jalemidir,"Dec 12, 2024",9/10,"The Green Mile, directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novel, is an emotionally charged exploration of justice, compassion, and the supernatural. Set in a death row prison, the film follows the lives of the guards and their encounters with John Coffey, a mysterious inmate with extraordinary powers.What makes The Green Mile unforgettable is its delicate balance of deep emotional resonance and compelling storytelling. Tom Hanks delivers a powerful, nuanced performance as Paul Edgecomb, the prison guard whose moral compass is tested by the miraculous events around him. Alongside him, Michael Clarke Duncan's portrayal of John Coffey is nothing short of captivating, infusing the character with a raw innocence that tugs at the heartstrings.The film excels not only in its performances but in its ability to evoke profound questions about human nature and justice, all wrapped in a poignant narrative. Its pacing, direction, and stunning cinematography create a lasting emotional impact, making The Green Mile an unforgettable cinematic experience. It's a rare film that blends sorrow, hope, and redemption into a narrative that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll."
MovieMan-112,"Jan 1, 2000",9/10,"The Green Mile was a very good movie. It seemed more of a Stephen King story than The Shawshank Redemption because of all of the magic and supernatural powers it had in it. Don't walk into this movie expecting to see a regular prison movie. That's The Shawshank Redemption. This is a spiritual fable that has 3 different stories in it..they are the following:1.) An innocent 7ft. tall black man on death row with magical healing powers. 2.) 4 kind prison guards and 1 sadistic one. 3.) 2 other unique prisoners: a man who grows to love and care for a wild mouse and a crazy, violent man named Billy The Kid.You wonder at first why are there so many different stories but it all fits together at the end. It has a happy ending to it. So happy that I cried tears of joy. While Shawshank was great from beginning to end, Green Mile starts to get good after the first half hour. Good movie, worth a watch, but still not as good as Shawshank. Not by a long shot."

uRMyRuSHMoRe,"Jul 3, 2004",N/A,"I am 14 and I just finished reading the novel The Green Mile by Stephen King. The book is wonderful and I decided to watch the movie that I had heard about but I had never seen. The first scene of the movie and I started crying. The actors were amazing! They played the parts splendidly.Even though they had to condense the book and change a few things it still fit. You hated Percy like you did in the book and you loved Brutus/Brutal, Dean, and Harry. You even kind of like Delacroix. Michael Clarke Duncan. Wow. He nailed it. Same with Tom Hanks. Two of my favorite actors in my favorite movie. And they did it right. I was afraid they were going to change some things like it always seems to happen when you transfer book to screen. But they didn't. I could go on and on about it and still not state all my feelings. I loved the movie and I'm thankful that they brought a wonderful, terrific story to life. Excellent. Justice."
REDFOOT4,"Mar 29, 2000",6/10,"In a year with so many wonderful, original, intelligent films, I expected The Green Mile to  deliver as well.  I left the theater in a daze at the 3 hour running time, and utterly disappointed in the film.  Let me just say that I thought that the film was very well cast, and the direction from Darabont was actually quite good.  What was lacking was a good, intelligent script.  If you break it down, there is not really an original idea in this entire film.  It's like King and Darabont watched as many prison films as they could, and stole all the good ideas.  If you don't believe me, check out Birdman of Alcatraz.  They even stole from their previous collaboration, and far superior film, The Shawshank Redemption.  This script, and story in general, also lacks any true heart or emotion.  The characters are paper thin, and we are told which ones to like and hate.  The filmmaker does not give us a chance to choose; the bad guys are totally bad, and the good guys totally good.  Plus, all the big so-called ""emotional"" scenes are totally contrived and completely phony.  I might be coming down a little hard on this film, but only because I wanted to like it, and I expected better. With all the talent involved, this should have been a great film. Instead, it is quite disappointing.  Sorry guys."
Mayor-3,"Dec 23, 1999",5/10,"Seeing this movie was a very interesting experience. Several of my friends loved this movie, and people were crying their eyes out to the left and right of me in the theater. I, however, was left feeling uncomfortable and unimpressed. The Green Mile is very well acted, with good cinematography and so on, but the story is flawed. It is annoyingly predictable, with straight personalities and crushing religious overtones. I really disliked how the movie tells you how to feel. I disliked even more how it gets its laughs from torturing a ""bad"" character, while at the same preaching kindness and healing. Why did so many people besides myself like this film? Well, that's why I called it an interesting experience..."
brown-08754,"Jan 25, 2021",10/10,"I gave this movie a 10/10. Not because of the seasoned Actors. But because of the talent that has never surpassed the novels and creative mind of Stephen King. His work is always a front row seat with my family.One Actor really stood out to me was Doug Hutchison. His role as Percy Wetmore deserved an award and at the very lease a Golden Globe Nomination. He was able to bring emotion, cruelty, sadisism to his character so well. Nobody on the earth could have done it better than Doug. His performance is one of the reasons that The Green Mile will never depreciate over the years and all of them to come. If you end up hating the villain after watching this movie then you know he did and excellent job."

WesleyB-842,"Nov 13, 2025",6/10,"The Green Mile is not a bad movie by any means and has some amazing performances. However, I felt the length of this movie was such that my attention drifted at multiple points. Although the movie is long and certain points feel slow at times, I found that the performances are what propelled this movie up. Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, and David Morse are the heart of this movie, and the relationship between Paul Edgecomb and John Coffey is what makes the ending incredibly impactful. Overall, The Green Mile is a good movie with some pacing issues. Not a must-see in my opinion, but if you have time and can carve out three hours, you won't regret it."

alishahmohd,"Nov 25, 2013",10/10,"The Green Mile is a movie based on the Stephan King book by the same name, however unlike some other movies based on his books, not only this is a magnificent movie but the movies stays true to the plot of the novel.The film moves at a slow pace, but it is still very entertaining to watch from it's beginning to the end, it's plot is also engaging and keeps us interested in finding out what will happen next. While the Green Mile has it's share of amusing scenes, it is a completely serious movie. As a matter of fact emotional might be more accurate. This movie has so many scenes that are just sad and may make you tear up. I try my best not to cry during movies, even during very sad scenes, but I just couldn't control myself while watching the Green Mile, many scenes just touch your heart and the tears will start falling down. The ending was also good but also very sad at the same time, but after this film ended I was simply in awe after watching such a magnificent work of art. The Green Mile is a 3 hours long mesmerizing masterpiece.The acting is almost perfect almost all actors play their role perfectly, Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are fantastic in their roles, although i wish Michael got more screen time in the first half of the film. Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchison play their villainous characters perfectly and really make you want to hate them. The actors who portray the prisoners and show innocence make you feel sympathy for them, like the guards in this movie, and you realize they really do regret what they did, and when they are executed you can't help but feel sad, at least from the inside. But the casting is almost perfect, the actors portray the characters next to perfection, specially Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, as a matter of fact King himself said he had imagined Hanks in the role of Paul Edgecomb.The music and direction is also brilliant, Frank Darabont did a fantastic job of portraying king's other book into film (ShawShank Redemption) and he continues his success with the Green Mile. He is a magnificent director, I just wish he does more movies based on King's book, because King + Darabont simply results in magic on screen.While almost perfect, the Green Mile's slow pace, long duration and large amount of emotional scenes do it's replay value no favors, also I find it hard to believe that all prisoners on death row are so civil and nice towards the guards and vice versa, it maybe explained in the book but I find it unrealistic, also the twist that was revealed near the end, in the flashback, just seemed random and ironic, they could have gone in another direction and used another method to bring more light to the truth. Also John Coffey's goes a little out of character in that scene.Regardless, The Green Mile is mesmerizing and a classic work of art which will make you smile, cry and simply leave you in awe.Overall Rating: 9.5/10"

Mikew3001,"Nov 19, 2002",10/10,"""The Green Mile"" is the second adaption of a Stephen King jail house drama after ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), both being directed by Frank Darabort. Tom Hanks in one his best roles plays a jail house office in the ""Green Mile"", the death row of a Lousiana country prison in 1935. When the tall black prisoner John Coffey arrives, being sentenced to death because of a double child murder), nothing will be the same. John appears as a simple-minded, but jesus-like faith healer, laying his hands on aching scrotums, trampled mice and maniac housewives and healing them within a few seconds only. While Hanks and his colleagues become aware of John's abilities and innocence, the sadistic rookie Percy Wetmore brings violence, hate and destruction into the small world of the ""Green Mile"".This is not just another prison movie, but one of the most touching statements about love and violence, life and death, belief and disbelief, and finally about humanity and against the death penalty filmed during the last few years. The jail house wardens celebrate a row of executions - one becoming a painful torture to the victim and the audience after an act of sabotage by officer Percy - like a ritual, switching off their personal feelings. In the end they have to execute John, and even if they all now that he's innocent they can't stop his fatal walk to the electric chair... the film ends with one of the most touching finals of the movie world during the last few years!The complete cast in this stunning drama is brilliant, especially Tom Hanks, his colleagues and the death row inmates. The most stunning roles of all is played by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, not speaking or moving much, but with an instant expression of pain and suffering on his face that won't let you untouched.The whole atmosphere, especially in the Green Mile settings and the execution chamber, are touching, depressing and fascinating at the same time. There's a fine and minimal score by Thomas Newman and some lovely filmed tricks with a  mouse who becomes a big attraction in this small world of death and suffering. Even if Darabont/King use some standard elements of fantasy/horror movies like Tom inhaling the evil and sickness from other people with a light stream, it never becomes kitschy or unbelievable. Watch this great movie!!!!"
MxS7HGS,"Dec 10, 2023",9/10,"Frank Darabont's direction does justice to Stephen King's novel, but unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the men facing death row in the film. The movie reveals that, like in real life, there are good and bad men on both sides of the prison bars.The film's success is largely due to its character-driven story, with roles given to actors like Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, James Cromwell, Barry Pepper, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, Sam Rockwell, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Harry Dean Stanton, all of whom have well-deserved acting pedigrees. I had never heard of Doug Hutchison before this film, but his portrayal of Percy made me feel disgusted, loathing, and outright hate towards his character.Despite the 3-hour runtime, the story never lost steam, and I felt that we were all better off for it. The story and characters are complex and multi-layered, and a shorter runtime would have done them a disservice. The film's magic realism kept me riveted to my seat, eliciting a sense of wonder and awe. Prepare to experience a range of emotions from start to finish. I assure you, it's worth it."
DanielHong.org,"Mar 12, 2000",N/A,"Capital punishment still remains as controversial issues although still some innocent people go to death row and bad people walkout fine. And someone who is watching the ball s**t as a witness can't do anything about it but comfort the prisoners until the final day. But watching actual electric chair execution is whole different story. Disregards of intensity of crimes he did, no guards can watch him being fried from the chair. That's why many guards are nice to prisoners in death row because sooner than later the prisoners will face worst treatment ever. In this movie, I can see guards and prisoners bond with friendship behinds the strict rules. Well, there are ass-guards in this movie and so there are full of revenges here and there in this movie.One last thought, Tom Hanks distinctive facial and voice expression fits very well in movies such as ""Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Turner & Hooch"" where he plays with black characters as partners. It is fact that there are plenty of racial conflicts going around and perhaps this movies (where he is in) can lighten up people."
ofgods,"Dec 21, 1999",6/10,"Upon reading that Tom Hanks was in another ""Oscar"" worthy movie, I decided I needed to see it.  This was four months ago.  This much oscar hype about a movie should have tipped as to how boring this movie would be.  Not since the ""English Patient"" have I been this bored with a movie.  Using that formula, I guess ""The Green Mile"" will win 9 Oscars. I'm not really sure what exactly bores me about this movie, but I'm pretty certain I can pinpoint it to the mouse ""Mr. Jingles"".  This mouse takes over way too much of the movie (precisely 1 hr of the movie is the guards chasing the mouse and it's relationship with the inmate played by Michael Jeter).  I have never read the book by Stephen King, but it has been pointed out to me that the mouse plays a much more important role in the book.  The book explores the relationship between John Coffey(whose initials, ironically, are J.C.).  If Durabont would have done this, the movie would have been four hours. There is nothing special about the acting here.  Tom Hanks does not, I repeat, DOES NOT deserve an Oscar for this picture.  It's nothing I haven't seen before by Hanks. Edgecomb is a combination of his ""Saving Private Ryan"" character and ""Forrest Gump.""  The one actor that does have a breakout performance is Michael Duncan Clarke.  His portrayal of John Coffey is the one reason I didn't walk out half way through the movie. If you have three hours on hand and want to watch a movie about a mouse, go watch ""Stuart Little"" twice."
neil-321,"Jan 31, 2006",3/10,"I was coerced into sitting through ""The Green Mile"" the other evening on video. Quite a watchable thriller, really, but left me very uncomfortable. I'm a white Englishman, but even for me the words ""Uncle Tom"" were hovering in the air and refused to go away. OK, the plot device of the automatic assumption of guilt and wrongful arrest of the big black guy only worked if he was black. But the - apparently surprising - fact that he could be huge and black but still ""nice"" then seemed to be a central part of the plot.The only thing this story reveals is the prejudice and bigotry of the writer and his intended audience."
mrstamps,"Jun 28, 2022",9/10,"At first I didn't like it or understand why it was ""such an amazing film,"" and I really only enjoyed some scenes and was really amazed how a movie could but you in such a state of shock and sympathy in such a way. But now, around a month and a half later, I think I actually enjoy the whole film and think it was really good! Like...SUPER GOOD!!! A masterpiece of a film! With a great plot and development & use of character traits through the actions (evil or not) of the characters!"
mohammedalkhaledoffice,"Jun 14, 2021",10/10,This movie is one of the best things that I watched!!
deakzsoltstunt,"Feb 2, 2018",10/10,Tom Hanks is a huge figure in the film. The film is shocking but fantastic. I can recommend everyone!
maximinilale,"Apr 5, 2021",10/10,Tom Hanks is the man. One of the best performances ever in Hollyqood.
meshai,"Nov 11, 2015",8/10,What can I really say about the experience that is the Green Mile....The fact that Tom Hanks was in it was/is your first clue to the experience you are about to witness...As one of the first movies I had ever seen Michael Duncan Clark in (RIP) I was blown away by his performance! There was so much said and tackled within this movie that it almost goes beyond description....I enjoyed this movie so much and the story it had to tell was so moving and implicative of the world we live in....It made me re-evaluate how I lived in the world and how I wanted to be seen as an individual and as a part of this world. If after viewing this movie you haven't shed a tear or gotten angry...I'm not sure if your human
kaetybass,"Nov 13, 2022",10/10,Seeing this movie before is the best!! I love watching it all the time even with people i love!!!!

NoArrow,"Apr 3, 2004",N/A,"""The Green Mile"" should be in the thesaurus as a synonym for ""amazing"".  The story it tells is one of the saddest, heartwarming, most brilliant ever told (and I don't mean just in movies).  Everything about this movie is perfect, it literally has no flaws.  Yes, some may complain about the running time, but anything shorter wouldn't have been able to tell the story right. Truly, I doubt anyone could put up a good argument that this isn't a terrific film.The [brilliant] story focuses on death row guard Paul (Tom Hanks) and how he copes with his job - executing the inmates.  Everything is regular until gentle giant John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives with a death sentence for the rape and murder of two little girls.  Coffey is an unlikely pedophile/killer - he's afraid of the dark, he cries in his sleep, he speaks with an innocence as if he's never come in real contact with a person before.  Seeing this, Paul starts to question whether or not Coffey committed the crime he was sentenced with.Paul is also suffering from a bladder infection, one day, when its really bad, Coffey grabs him, touches him, and then he's healed!  He does the same for a pet mouse crushed by the villain Percy (Doug Hutchison).  It is thought that maybe Coffey was trying to heal the two dead girls he was found with.And so starts this great, great film.  Every cast member puts forth.  There are some great side performances from Michael Jeter, David Morse and Patricia Clarkson - but don't get me wrong, there isn't one bad performance in this movie.Of course, the greatest comes from Duncan, playing a sad, hulking simpleton often drenched in his own tears.  This is the performance of a lifetime for Duncan - who is now unfortunately wasting his talent on ""Daredevil"" and ""See Spot Run"".  He was nominated for an Oscar for this film, but Michael Caine beat him.  This is an outrage, Caine always plays the sympathetic British guy.  Duncan's performance is one of the greatest I've ever seen.This movie is one of the most touching, sad movies I've ever seen, watch it, 9/10."
