Xstal,"Dec 20, 2021",9/10,"Emotional extremes abound, this story takes you round and around, elevating high, then smashing you down, your guiding light, an endearing clown.The essence of all that's right, that's wrong, a fathers love for his wife and son, to the thieves of liberty with power - and a gun; the worst of man, the world undone."
kvonarx,"Dec 6, 1999",10/10,"I am surprised about the negative comments that some people made on this web-page.  I can see how some people might not experience the same kind of uplift or joy that most of us lived through when seeing the movie.  But that some viewers felt insulted and betrayed because the movie did not depict ""reality"" as it really was or is, is not fair.I must concur with my fellow proponents of the movie -- it was a great and very satisfying movie.  It provided me with something that everyone in one or another shape or form needs -- Hope.  The movie showed the cruelty of life and yet managed to shed some light and insight into the beauty of love and life in general.I urge anyone who has not seen La Vita è bella to go out there and watch it. If we all take with us just little bit of that hope and love that this movie is trying to convey; this world would be a much better place.Thank you for reading this and I hope you enjoyed or will enjoy the movie as much as I did."
amira_berzi,"Aug 29, 2000",9/10,"This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you.   After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son.  The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie.  No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie.  The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is  not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war.  Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles.  This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state.  Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son.  You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh.  One can go on forever  describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing."
Anonymous_Maxine,"Mar 27, 2000",10/10,"I find it sad that so many people are so narrow-minded that they will not watch a movie that is black and white or, in this case, is subtitled. I feel sorry for people who refuse to watch a movie like Life Is Beautiful just because it is a foreign film. They have no idea what a beautifully acted and directed film this is, and they'll never know what an amazing experience they are missing.Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy. Sure, the film is clearly comedic, but nevertheless it manages to very effectively communicate the tremendous losses suffered in the Nazi concentration camps and has scenes at least as intense as any scene in Schindler's List.This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It manages to be so encompassing that you hardly notice the subtitles are even there. I proudly cast my vote of 10."
Conservative-SNAG,"Oct 23, 2004",N/A,"I can't understand how other reviewers see this as a film about the Nazis or the Holocaust. It's not!!! ""Life is Beautiful"" is a film about love, optimism, courage and inner strength.To be honest I can't get this film out of my thoughts and decided to write this brief review in the hope that I could move on.""Life is Beautiful"" is an unforgettable film. You go through emotions you were surprised could have for a fictional film. The story, although totally implausible, is uplifting and depressing at the same time.Please see it for yourself. Have a box of tissues handy.Best film ever seen!!!"
farkas419,"Jan 30, 2006",10/10,"The first time I saw the movie was when I was about seventeen or so, and I never forgot it. The incredibly human characters (such as the doctor who loved riddles), the fantastic script-writing, the amazing acting, and of course the heartwarming story. This movie proves once and for all how strong we are, as humans, that in the face of adversity we can make the best of things. There is so much love in the characters; Dora's love for her husband Guido is boundless, as well as Guido's love for his son. Sure, it's a slightly unrealistic movie, but hey, aren't they all a little unrealistic? I've also seen people review this movie and say that it made light of the Holocaust, which was of course a dark point in history. I don't think so; I think that it's only delicately handled, and because of that, the movie is one that a person can watch in one sitting without being thoroughly disgusted by mankind. I would say that those who think this movie is too ""light"" are cynical and bitter. The whole point to the movie is to show what love is capable of, and to provide encouragement and perhaps guidance. This movie changed my life from the first time I watched it. I came away with this feeling that no matter what I have to face in life, that I can overcome it. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone over the age of eleven. The acting is superb (though Roberto Benigni is a little over-the-top, LOL), the story heartwarming and easy to understand. It's excellent!"
Serpico-7,"Feb 26, 1999",9/10,"Roberto Benigni's Vita e bella, is in many ways similar to Chaplin's Great Dictator.  Both are comic attacks on fascism, but the former's is the more successful.  Benigni initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy, which is a pleasant mix of Keaton and Chaplin.  Romance ensues with his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi.  The first half of this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior to the second, but this is certainly not the case.  In the first section we follow the delightful romance that will eventually lead to marriage and the creation of the wonderful Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).It is the first half where the audience can laugh the loudest and delight at the immense comedy talent of Benigni.  Unlike so many films nowadays there is nothing crude or course, his is simple innocent humour, which is all the more effective.  The way he ties together little strand in the film to create comedy elements shows a great writing ability, and a mastery of timing when it comes to their execution on screen.  Various incidents related to the rise of anti-semitism and fascism in Italy show that there are sinister forces at work which come to the fore in the second segment.Guido (Benigni) moves events on from Tuscany in 1939 to the last year of the war in a concentration camp.  In this period he and Dora (Braschi) have had their son Giosue (Cantanarini).  The five year old greatly reminds me of Toto in Cinema Paradiso, and plays an equally important role in his prospective film (though in Paradiso's case it is at the beginning of the movie).  The relationship between the two is very similar to that of Jackie Coogan and Charlie Chaplin (though Benigni, unlike Chaplin, keeps the best of the comedy moments).  Guido attempts to keep from the boy the horrors of what is going on, and this eventually manifests itself as a game where the aim is to score 100 points, with the winner winning a real tank (which, of course appeals to the young boy).  Comic moments are still present, that involving Guido's translation of the rules of the camp is particularly notable, but it becomes somewhat more difficult to laugh when we consider the gravity of what is going on.The emphasis begins shifts, and we realise that this is a film about human spirit above all else.  Guido not only appeals to the audience due to his comedy and sheer pleasantness, but also in the way that he loves his family and the measures that he will go to to protect them.This is certainly no Schindler's List, but it never pretends to be. Occasionally events seem a little contrived, but this does seem to work in the film's favour.  However, this film avoids the tendency of Hollywood to go far over the top in emotional and credibility terms.Benigni shines like a lantern throughout the picture, showing that he is a talent, not only in comedy terms, that far outshines his peers.  Cantanari is a delight, and Braschi also plays her part well.  There is even an appearance by The Magnificent Seven's Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, a man who events change for the worse.Please don't let the fact that it, to all but the Italians, is a foreign language film.  The language itself adds a beauty of form to the film, much as it did in the case of Il Postino.  This has to be a certainty for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, though something tells me that it will be overlooked for other awards as it is Italian and not a mainstream English language picture.Please see this film, and make up your own mind.  It is appealing in so many different ways that I'm sure that you will not be disappointed."
gaur-abhi,"Nov 12, 2005",9/10,"I have never in my life seen a movie that so truly symbolizes its name and its message. Roberto Benigni - 'The Italian Treasure House' has probably given to his viewers his best. The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring. 'Life is beautiful' as the name goes is about a Jewish man, who falls in love with a non-Jewish lady, marries her, has a kid and who is then taken as a prisoner in a concentration camp along with his wife and kid. But the way he protects his kid from the horrors of the genocide, how he always tries to find ways to make his wife and kid smile and laugh, is what makes the movie, a MUST SEE.It is certainly one of the best movies that I have seen."
gbheron,"Nov 12, 2000",9/10,"Life Is Beautiful takes the premise that love and hope can survive the most trying of conditions, in this case a Nazi concentration camp. Most everyone knows this very popular and honored film, so I won't belabor the story. Briefly, in my humble opinion, this film deserves all the accolades it's been awarded. A near perfect film, my only gripe is that Mr. Benigni's performance could have been more understated, especially the half of the film that's set in the concentration camp. But this is only a slight complaint. For a joyful, life-affirming movie, Life Is Beautiful is tops. But be forewarned, as its principal backdrop of anti-Semitism and Nazi murder, it is not a very happy movie."
Monika-5,"Jan 3, 2000",N/A,"This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negative things about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make this film, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy and drama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery, and the characters. This movie is magnificent in every way. Don't miss it!"
baumer,"Jun 25, 1999",9/10,"I typically don't care much for sub-titled movies.  Foreign films to me are slow and about nothing.  So I naturally went to see Life is Beautiful with a chip on my shoulder.  I wanted to hate it.  I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people.  Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life.  Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan.  The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke.  It's actually funny.Benigni did everything in this film.  He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night.  There is that much raw energy in this film.  There really is.  For someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible.  And not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter, but it is one of the funnier films I've ever seen.  When Roberto is translating the German soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn't scared, it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell.  He's got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you're witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.I loved this film.  Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars.  He certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more."
TheLittleSongbird,"Dec 19, 2009",8/10,"Before I eventually saw this film, I was not sure whether I was going to like it or not. While in general it is very highly regarded, there have been those who have said it is overrated or whatever. Just for the record, I did like the movie very much. It is uneven, and there were parts that didn't work as well as intended, but this is a brave and affectionate realisation of life during the Holocaust. I asked myself after watching Life is Beautiful, is it really overrated. Well, maybe a tad, but I can really see why people like this movie.So what didn't make this film perfect? Well, as I have stated at least twice already, it is uneven. And in my humble opinion, the second half was better than the first. I just want to clarify that I didn't hate the first half. Some of it is very funny, but some of the slapstick humour didn't work as well as it should, namely eggs breaking on people's heads. It also works very hard, to provide charm. That is perfectly acceptable, but because there was a lot of charm in the performances and the production values it felt slightly overdone. Though I will say that Benigni's tribute to comedy greats like Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx was inspired.The film changes tone to a more poignant, compelling and harrowing second half, that I think was much needed. While the character of Guido ""amusingly"" tries to convince his son Giosue that life in the concentration isn't so bad, the second half's tone has a lot of poignancy. Most notably Guido and Giosue trying to communicate to Dora over the loudspeaker, and the ending did have me in tears.That said, there are a lot of truly good things about Life is Beautiful. For one thing, it is sumptuously filmed. The costumes look amazing and the Italian landscapes look breathtaking. (If there is one place that I would love, love, LOVE to go to it is Italy, not only for the food but for the opera as well.) The story is an effective and affectionate one, about a Jewish man who falls in love with the help of his humour, but has to do the same to protect his son in the Nazi concentration camp. The quality of the script, I saw the Italian version with English subtitles, is thoroughly decent, and hits more than it misses.The performances are excellent in general. Roberto Benigni, one of Italy's favourite funny men, gives a admirable performance. He does overact at times in the first half but he appears a lot more subdued in the second. And I also thought he did a better job acting than he did directing. His direction once or twice in this film was a tad stodgy. Nicoletta Braschi is just stunning as Dora, she looked amazing in this movie and was solid in terms of acting. Giorgio Cantarini didn't always convince as Giosue though, there were times when he comes across as whiny and maybe I am being unfair but I have seen better child performances.All in all, beautiful to watch, and a nice story. It is very pleasant to watch with a compelling and poignant second half, but there are flaws that bring it down from what could have been outstanding to just a film worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jan 20, 2023",9/10,"Victims of The Holocaust, and placed in a concentration camp, Guido tries to make life bearable for his young son, and those around him.A fathers love truly can make the most horrendous situation, bearable. This is one of the most original, unique war films of all time, and whilst I know subtitles are a challenge for some, I beg you to stick with it, as it is a truly unique experience.This powerful film takes you on a rollercoaster journey, elevating you to real highs, then sinking you to painful lows. After a truly fun, amusing start, it changes into something very different, and you get a true sense of the misery The Nazis caused.Roberto Benigni gives a quite captivating performance as Guido, perfectly cast, he has charm, charisma, he's funny, and able to switch it up in a second.Wonderful visuals, as you'd expect, it's beautifully well made, produced with flair and style, even the scenes inside the camp.Quite an experience.9/10."
JonB-2,"Dec 12, 1998",9/10,"On seeing this film, my first thought (after wiping the tears from my eyes) was ""My god, he pulled it off.""  I can think of only one other director who's dealt with the Holocaust in a comedic film and done it with any depth, and his name was Chaplin -- and ""The Great Dictator"" was made before the horrors of the Final Solution were known to the world.  Chaplin didn't have to deal with that baggage.  Begnigni did, and did so brilliantly.The film begins as an earthy comedy as only the Italians can do and ends as a dark tragedy with a hopeful note -- and the transition from one to the other is seamless.  In fact, the latter half of the film would not work without all the meticulous set-ups of the first half.  That we get to meet Begnigni's character, see his world and hopes and dreams, makes it all only more poignant as they are threatened with destruction.  On top of this, the first half of the film is reminiscent of ""Amaracord"" (one of my favorite films) in appearance -- possibly a result of it being set in the same period, possibly intentional.  (Begnigni pulls off at least one homage to ""The Bicycle Thief,"" among other films, during the first act and a half.)Anyway... I really debated with myself before seeing the film, thinking, ""Hm.  A comedy... about the Holocaust.  Do I want to deal with that tonight?""  I went, I saw, and the film conquered me.  Fellini made me suspect that the Italians might be film geniuses... ""La Vita è Bella"" made me realize they are film gods...See it.  Now."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Feb 6, 2005",9/10,"When I first saw this film, I was told up front that the first full hour of the film, the first half, was all slapstick comedy and character development, and that the second half was more serious and important. I prepared myself mentally for the first half, but I was still surprised by how annoying the gags and jokes were. We're talking cake-in-face, fall-over, slip-on-banana humor. For one full hour. At the end of the first half of this film, I was thinking ""this had better get better very soon..."" And it did. Right then and there. From the very beginning of the second half, the serious mood enters. And it doesn't take long for even the most average minded viewer to realize that the first half of humor and character development was important. It was important for us to ease into a less tense mood, to make the important subject strike even harder, and for us to get to know the characters, to make us care more about what happens to them. I've just finished seeing it for the second time, and I've come to realize that this film is not entirely perfect, as I felt just after seeing it through first time. It does have its flaws, though there aren't many of them. The first half, and some parts of the second half, are heavy on humor, which some will mistake for making fun of the subject(which is almost a crime), or trying to make it seem less important. I don't believe this to be true, it's just a retelling with a more positive message; yes, people do horrible, inhumane things sometimes... but after all, there is beauty, too. The first half will also deter some viewers who will enjoy the second half much more. The plot is very good, though slightly unrealistic. The acting is pretty much all flawless, even in the child actors. The characters are well-written and interesting. The humor is more acceptable in the second part, because it's more toned down and not trying way too hard to get a quick laugh out of the audience. All in all, a great film which anyone and everyone should see at least once during their life... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll realize that, in the end, Life Is Beautiful. I recommend this to just about anyone, but I know that not everyone will enjoy it equally. A near-perfect film. Keep watching past the first half... you won't regret it. 9/10"
steve_y,"May 11, 2005",10/10,"There are a small handful of reviewers who are lambasting this film , crying phrases like ""unrealistic and contrived"" , ""emotionally manipulative"" and most risibly ""an insult to the memory of the victims of the holocaust"".Id like to address such interpretations.In the latter day audiences search for films bereft of cliché, derivativeness and lack of independence there seems to be a counterintuitive rationale that if a film cannot be explicated and stand up to analysis from every myriad aspect of possible critique, then it lacks worth or merit , taken as a piece of work in its own right.It should be suggested that the intent of the film is so clear,the aims of the film so evidently manifest, that to brand the film unrealistic and then carp on with minor details regarding obvious inconsistencies, is to not be able to see the film for what it very plainly proclaims itself to be.This film NEVER tries to be realistic in the modern sense of film critique, this film freely admits to being contrived, this film unashamedly focuses on the characters at the expense of portraying an historically accurate reality.For the whining reviewers to not see this, is either an example of disingenuous folly or plain hard-heartedness.The film is driven by ideals, of romance and of selflessness.This film clearly asks the watcher to suspend belief, to enter into its fantasy, to embrace the human emotion as elucidated through the characters.Not only is this film NOT an insult to anybody who has ever been persecuted (Jew,Chilean,African,Russian,Japanese,Chinese,Cambodian - the list of persecution goes on), rather it heightens empathy for such people in this plight ,through the use of poignancy.Its intent is NEVER to trivialise such.Yes the uniforms aren't dirty enough , yes Guido takes ridiculous risks,yes the likelihood that the German guards knew some Italian are apparent but the question is - given the context of the presentation - do those niggling details matter ?Surely the film is engaging the viewer on an emotive level,evoking empathy for the individual case,for the desperation that sees a father moved to unthinkable extremes in an attempt to prolong the life of his son.Thus - surely , Guido's actions should not and never were intended to be 'realistic' but rather he is - to our despairing eyes ,simply pathetic ie he is evoking pity.How any discerning fair minded person could honestly and objectively brand this film as disrespectful and hateful because of comedic elements, is missing the point by oceans.This film is about the individual circumstance and thus the slapstick and ingenious way we are drawn into knowing the characters and the way we are immersed in the burgeoning love story of the small boys' parents, necessitates the audience to empathise,to engage,to feel.The by-play between father and son is to look at innocence personified,the bitter sweet forgoing of self in a seemingly doomed essay at escaping the impending inevitable spiral into oblivion.I think Life is Beautiful is an important work that might demand a rethinking of priorities by hard hearted critiques , who may have to shed that veneer of bloody-minded nitpicking and, to wit, see the forest for the trees.Of course the film is flawed,what film attempting such a tight balancing act between comedy and poignancy isn't? But there is a certain state of mind and spirit that needs to be adopted to be receptive to its message and i fear perhaps that such vulnerability and innocence required seems too hard and bitter a pill for some.If only they dare taste - its sweetness and candour resonate persuasively,indelibly."
schroeder-gustavo,"May 8, 2015",6/10,"I had heard so much about this movie for so many years until I finally watched it. The first act is very different than the second, which is, in my opinion, superior by far. The first act contains too much unnecessary comedy and is not taken seriously. At all. But then there's the wonderful second act. It shows us the love between a father and son and how far a man is willing to go to achieve the happiness of his son. The second act is taken a lot more seriously and I consider it to be excellent. That being said I do think this movie is very uneven, and therefore overrated. But because of the great second part of the film, I would recommend Life is Beautiful."
thedavidovitch,"Nov 21, 2007",1/10,"Words fail me. How can Hollywood have duped by such a simpleton? Truly one of the most wretched films of the decade, this sentimental dreck insults its audience as much as it does its basic grasp of history. How dare Benigni think he's capable of pulling a trick like this? Except - gasp - he did and he won an Oscar in doing so.This film is cast iron proof that the Oscars are largely meaningless and occasionally just plain insulting. The final insult is that this film continues to occupy a place in the all-time top 250 movies on this site. Come on, guys, you're doing humanity a grave disservice. Let's drag it down to the gutter where it belongs."

ellendellen,"Dec 14, 2001",10/10,"I love La vita è bella/Life is beautiful. It's one of my favorite movies and Benigni is fantastic! I laughed until I cried when he translated the Nazi soldier´s threats to Italian. I was skeptic to non-English movies before, but after seeing this movie I can easily say that I'm not. I thought it would be a problem that I didn't understand the language, but Benigni isn't just a talking actor. He is an acting actor, and I don't think I missed a lot being dependable to the subtitles. I sure hope not, but I guess you always miss a bit.I have seen other movies about the Holocaust, but they have all been so dark. Not surprisingly since the the Holocaust is a dark chapter in our history. But it's painful to watch them. It's easier to watch La vita è bella, because it's not as dark, but it still succeeds in telling the story about the Holocaust.And Roberto Benigni doesn't joke about the Holocaust as some criticizers claimed. He simply puts some love and hope into it. And I get the message. Love is everywhere, even in the darkest of places."

ma-cortes,"Dec 4, 2012",8/10,"Wonderful fable plenty of amazing fantasy, lively comedy and sad tragedy . This is a poignant and moving fable about a sacrifice to save a son and a wife . It's an unforgettable story formed by two halves that proves imagination, family and love conquer all ; as Benigni's focus is on the love between daddy , mummy and son . The first part results to be an Italian comedy style , the second is horror along with humor . It concerns upon Guido (Roberto Benigni, a magnificent rubber-faced funny man), a Jewish man who has a wonderful romance with the help of his humour, but must use that same quality to protect his son in a Nazi death camp . He's a madcap romantic man and women wish him . But he falls in love with Dora (Benigni's real-life sweetie Nicoletta Braschi). Every day Guido dreams of marrying her , under Nicola Piovani score . When the Second World War spontaneously breaks out , he and his family is imprisoned at concentration camp . Guido is determined to save his lover and son (Cantarini) from dangers around them . His effort sometimes is pure fantasy , though with ruse he pull off more impetus to keep his son and accomplishes feats no man could realistically execute . Guido fabricates an elaborated game to convince his child that the whole ordeal is an endurance proof to be won with prizes forthcoming , as it turns out to be a special contest to win a tank.This is a story about love , war and sacrifice , well starred and directed by Roberto Benigni who develops a fire-line between comedy and tragedy . Inventive gags and wacky humor are splendidly proceeded . At first consideration , the theme of a feel-good holocaust comedy war was a non-sense . However , Benigni doesn't describe a holocaust film but rather a tale of endurance of family love . Benigni tirelessly maintains the humorous ingenuity, even as the horror war escalates. Actor and director Benigni shapes simultaneously haunting and hilarious comedy out of the tragedy of Nazi concentration camp . In a especially humorous scene , Guido translates a guard's barking at the inmates as furthers clarification of the rules of game . The picture is divided into two parts , the first half deals with an entertaining boy-meets-girl tale , a light-weight comedy in which Guido relentlessly pursues Dora ; the second half shifts and depicts the horrors of the concentration camps . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries as the Spanish Marisa Paredes , Lidia Alfonsi and Horst Buchhold as a Nazi doctor . The film displays an emotive musical score by Nicola Piovani, who deservedly had Oscar winner . Furthermore , it won Academy Award to Foreign film and of course to Benigni ; Roberto Benigni's Oscar for best actor marked only the second time that an actor had directed himself in an Academy Award winning performance , the other was Laurence Olivier for Hamlet . Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli . Effective and appropriate production design by the veteran Danilo Donati . The motion picture was marvelously directed by Benigni. He's a good comedy director (Monster, Johnny Toothpick, Little devil) with some flop (Pinoccio) and usual actor for Jim Jarmusch (Coffee and cigarettes, Night of Earth, Down by law). Rating : Better than average . Well worth seeing ."
ecom-bkl,"Jan 9, 2022",10/10,"This film is a brilliant masterpiece. An expression of deeply felt humanity.Benigni is a clown - his comedy is often reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin. But he is also a great film artist. Greatly funny and wicked at the same time the impromptu speech of the school inspector who shows the students how superior the Aryan navel is.Heartbreaking the entire 2nd part of the film. A manifesto of humanity in the face of pure horror. Every father, every mother, and everyone who doesn't have a heart of stone will be in tears by the end of this film. Benigni has made himself immortal. Even 25 years later, this masterpiece has lost nothing of its brilliance and warmth. Thank you Roberto!!!!"
Theo Robertson,"May 18, 2004",6/10,"I know little about the acting career of Roberto Benigni but I was told by a famous film tutor ( Who`s Jewish by the way ) that Benigni plays more or less the same character in every single film he appears in and I have no doubt this is trueAnd after seeing his performance as Guido in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and seeing Benigni clamber over several rows of seats to accept the Oscar as best actor I can`t help thinking Benigni is unable to play ANY character that ISN`T Roberto BenigniThis film is about the holocaust - The greatest example of mans inhumanity to man -  and that`s why it`s undeservedly well regarded . The scenes in the concentration camp are touching sad and funny as Guido explains to his son Giosue that they`re actually taking part in a contest to win a tank , but it also means sitting through a whole lot of irritating dross featuring Guido wooing his Princess . In fact the whole first half of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL ( Written , directed , produced by and starring Roberto Benigni ) is an ordeal to sit through unless you`re a fan of Benigni . To be blunt if anyone deserved an Oscar it was Giorgio Cantarini as Best Supporting Actor as Giosue who gives perhaps the most memorable performance by a child actor I have ever seenTo be even more blunt I`m getting fed up with both holocaust films and the way they`re over rewarded at film award ceremonies . If  you want to know about the horrors and dangers facing Jews and wider human civilisation go and watch one of Pierre Rehov`s documentaries which are often held at Jewish cinema festivals where after the screenings security guards have to check under the seats to make sure no one has left a bomb for the next audience sitting , or access a website featuring a young self employed Jewish man called Nick Berg who went to Iraq to help with the reconstruction and where he was captured by Islamic terrorists who then brutally murder him by holding him on the ground and slowly hack his head off with a knife .Not praising LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL or indeed any holocaust movie is not anti semetism"
Dr. Strangelove,"Apr 7, 2001",1/10,"What an awful movie. This is supposed to be a perfect match between drama and comedy. It has missed the nail on both counts. In fact it misses every nail you can think of. It is badly acted, totally incredulous, unbelievable silly extremely childish jokes, no tension whatsoever. I only liked Benini (a lot) in Down by law. Watch the movie to check what a lot of other people say, and wait to be heavily disappointed like me."
livar,"Dec 18, 2002",10/10,"Didn't really think that much about what to expect of this movie and expected a sort of ""happy happy comedy"" where life's a dance on flowers. But a positive surprise the film appeared to have deeper tones, the movie is set in Italy right before and during WW2. The main-person is a jew and that causes bad things to happen. But in spite of everything that happens Guido keeps his spirit up to the last and shows a wonderful and humorous perspective of life. A must see!Notice how everything in the movie has a purpose. Every little thing that happens will serve a purpose later on in the movie. For example the weird habit of swapping hats with this other person at any possible occasion will serve its purpose later on in the film :) I liked this intelligent and highly entertaining way of bonding the story together. This and many many other things makes this film well worthwhile watching. Go see it and make up your own meaning!"
LaBellaPrincipessa,"Jan 9, 2009",10/10,"No matter who you are, or what preferences you have in movie, I can almost assure you that this movie will stay with you.The first time I saw it, I was about four or five. For the longest time, I had no idea where to find it or even what it was called. I searched for years.Finally, about a week ago, I saw it on Stars, and I instantly knew what it was. I recorded it and watched it again. That movie, and it's message stayed with me for a very long time, and I think I'll remember it forever.Whether you are 4 or 40, I can say that you will most likely love this movie. It's got the perfect amount of tears, laughs, and adrenaline.I hope you love it as much as I did.Ps. This movie is REALLY sad, so don't watch it without tissues and some happy music to listen to afterward. :)"
Mike Z-2,"Nov 8, 2001",10/10,"Written for my high school's weekly new supplement my junior year.I saw the Italian masterpiece Life is Beautiful twice before Thanksgiving and after I saw it I recommended it to just about everyone who crossed my path.  Unlike the last brilliant film I reviewed, Rushmore, this film should certainly be enjoyed by everyone, as it is as worldly a movie as you can get.  To say it is about this Holocaust is a gross understatement, for put together with the rest of the story which focuses on love, life, and love of life it almost serves as a background.The first half of this very different film by virtuoso writer, director, star Roberto Benigni is complete comedy.  It portrays the enamored main character, a life-loving Italian Jew named Guido, chasing after the woman of his dreams, Dora (Benigni's real-life wife, Nicoletta Braschi), who is about to be forced into an unhappy marriage.  The comedy is so pure, even if you don't enjoy some of the slapstick you cannot help be taken in by the heart that is at it source.  Eventually, through a series of hilarious coincidences, he wins Dora over, and together they have a son, Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini).Throughout the first half of the film, the audience catches glimpses of the evil that lies below the thick layer of humor and warmth.  It is World War II, and the Fascist regime is growing in Italy, and through a sign here and anti-Semitic comment there we get the picture of what is going on.  On Joshua's fifth birthday, he and Guido are taken away to a concentration/work camp in Italy.  Trying to save her family, Dora, who is part of a prominent Italian family and not to be touched by the Fascists, begs to be placed on the train and gets her wish, only to be separated to a special women's camp. Innocent Joshua, though, wants to know what is going on, and Guido explains to him that this is a big trip that he has planned for Joshua's birthday. The rest of the film shows the different ways in which Guido convinces his son that the camp is all a game, and if you score one thousand points (for such things as good behavior, being quiet during the day, etc.), you win a real tank.  Though occasionally Joshua senses something wrong, he has so much faith and  love for his father that he wouldn't dare doubt him.Though the second half of this film may seem depressing and unhappy by what I write, you will still smile at the love, warmth, and amazing humor that Guido, in this most awful time, still maintains just for the sake of his son.  In the first part of the film, the visuals are full of life, color, and beauty (in certain instances to an almost unreal extent), but in the second part, many of the colors are dull and lifeless to contrast the change in environment with the struggling brightness of Guido's hope and joy.  The beautiful score written for this film (including Offenbach's Barcarolle) is the perfect compliment to the different moods that are portrayed throughout the movie.By the end of this film, you are uplifted instead of put down by the bittersweet joy and the true beauty of life which is so wonderfully portrayed by Benigni's characters and story.  The acting is a flawless blend of humor and pathos, and the fact that the film itself flows so extremely smoothly between its two distinct parts alone shows what immense talent Benigni possesses.Life is Beautiful is a film that should be seen by anyone who has the chance to go out and see a movie.  It is a shame that I am only given so much room to write about it, but I wouldn't want to give any of the surprises away either."
Spleen,"Jan 30, 2001",10/10,"This film is a beautiful thing.Okay, perhaps that's cheating.  I don't really like responding to people who carp at ""Life is Beautiful"", mainly because I don't see how they could fail to have the required reactions.  How could anyone not find Guido charming? Yes, he's a pathological confabulator, but that's the point.  This is the story of someone whose way of life consists of enchanting the world around him with white lies (most of them are white) and manipulative genius.  He tries to continue living in the same way as the civilised world around him collapses; arguably, he succeeds, but he ends up paying a heavy price.  How could anyone not like this fable?And how could anyone not find both halves of the film - particularly the first, of course - funny?  It's the kind of humour where it doesn't matter if you laugh or not; either way, you can still enjoy the wit, and marvel at Guido's folkloric cleverness.  And on subsequent viewings it becomes more and more clear how the two halves set each other off perfectly.  Toccata and fugue. ...I understand the viewpoint of those who think that Benigni shouldn't have made a comedy about the Holocaust.  I can see how Holocaust survivors (and perhaps those close to them) might be genuinely offended.  But this doesn't make ""Life is Beautiful"" a bad film; it simply means, at most, that making it was an impolitic act.  I've heard interviews with Holocaust survivors who thought ""Schindler's List"" was a similarly impolitic act.  (And note that ""Schindler's List"", however good it may be, is clearly inferior as a work of art.)  If anything is wrong, it's the act of using the Holocaust as part of the subject matter of ANY work of art.  Benigni's particular way of handling the subject is as good as any other, provided he succeeds, which he does."
allmets-38552,"Nov 23, 2019",10/10,"This is a deeply moving and funny portrayal of a clever father's bottomless love for his son, during one the most horrific times in history.It is overblown to say that he doesn't respect the seriousness of the subject matter, he does, it just isn't the point of the film. The point of the film is the psychological journey of a man, who has always been able to scheme his way out of anything, trying to shield his son from brutal reality as they both find themselves in a Nazi Concentration Camp."
Neil-54,"Mar 26, 1999",1/10,"I find it awfully strange that everyone is embracing a movie that strips the Holocaust of any of its meaning.  This movie asks us to laugh at the events transpiring on screen, but not to feel or understand any of the horrors.Benigni would have done his film a lot of good had he given us more of a feeling of how the people's lives were in terror.  Then, the message of the transcendence of love and life would have been so much more powerful. Instead, he merely laughs everything off, giving us the feeling that even he's not taking his subject matter too seriously.So, in the end we are left with a movie that trivializes the Holocaust - and people should be ashamed that they think so highly of it."
dzontra-nikola,"Mar 2, 2019",10/10,"When you think about a comedy about the Holocaust you can't imagine the movie like this.This movie is a brilliant mixture of comedy, romance, and above all love and hope.I must say that I think Roberto Benigni (the writer, director, and actor) created a masterpiece that touches your heart in many ways.Brilliant movie!"
ccthemovieman-1,"Feb 27, 2006",8/10,"I first saw this in a movie theater when it came out, and I discovered later it didn't remotely compare to watching it on DVD. The latter is a far better experience.It's spectacularly filmed, one of the better looking movies you will see on DVD: sharp as a tack and gorgeous, something a big screen kind of makes fuzzy. I found that more attractive than the story, even if it is a good one and one that you never forget.Few films have changed gears as dramatically as this one. The first half is a slapstick comedy-romance featuring the goofy Roberto Benigni, a hyperactive Italian who successfully woos a woman he accidentally meets one day. About 35 percent of this part in the film is clever and funny and the rest, kind of stupid....but not annoying. The only aspect that grows tiresome is Benigni's motormouth, which is always going and is just too much to bear after awhile. The guy wears you out, listening to him!The second half of the story jumps ahead to about 5-7 years later when Benigni and his girlfriend are now wed and have a little boy. Being Jewish, the man and his boy are then taken away from his little town to a concentration camp by the Nazis. The wife voluntarily goes, just to be with the other two. The rest of the movie shows how the father protects his son by pretending it's all a game. The second half, of course, is what most of us remember best and is very inspiring, a haunting tale with a few scenes that stay in your memory.On DVD you have the option of Italian with English subtitles or a dubbed version. Since the visuals are so good and the dubbing is expertly done, I would recommend that. It's a cliché but, this is an ""unforgettable story."""
stefano-13,"Feb 19, 1999",8/10,"I've read all the previous comments. It's amazing to see someone advocating this is one of the best movies ever and someone else saying this is a very bad and offending show. Very few moderate comments...Usually a movie so much debated is at least interesting. I believe this is really valuable, first of all because making such a blend of humour and drama isn't easy at all. No other filmmaker did something like ""Life is beautiful"" in the past: the Holocaust, humour and a lovely story in the same film. Probably this is one of the best movies ever for bravery and originality, yes.Do you want a harsh, historically correct view of the Holocaust? Please read the books written by survivors, like Primo Levi's ""Se questo è un uomo"", and watch original footage filmed at the end of the war, for example by the Russians when they entered Auschwitz, if you absolutely need something visual too. Even ""Schindler's list"" doesn't show the worst of that tragedy, for I believe it's simply impossible to represent such an horror with a fiction work, with actors and special effects. ""Life is beautiful"" doesn't want to represent the Holocaust, and IMHO this is a Good Thing.BTW, I'm Italian and Benigni here is a superstar; you see him everywhere on TV. If you saw the Cannes ceremony you have a vague idea about what he's capable to do. I saw him live years ago and he's even completely different: much better!!"

Thanks for letting me share. and i also showed it to my friends and they liked it very much. i really recommend you to watch it as soon as possible."
Sethtro,"Aug 28, 2020",8/10,"Personal Rating: 8/10 (very good)This movie paints a picture of a beautiful day but then adds gloomy rain clouds. However, you don't have to look too closely to notice the rainbow, the thing of beauty, that shines through.Right from the onset, you know what's coming, for over an hour you just wait, smiling through the highs, laughing at the humorous lines, and grow anxious during the lows, but nothing prepares you for how the movie concludes.There were two themes this movie impressed upon me, two reasons I would implore you to watch this film.
The sacrifices made by a loving parent. There's nothing that compares it goes beyond all human logic and reasoning because it's motivated by love.Ultimately, life is beautiful. Having a beautiful life does not mean having a perfect one, always smiling and laughing, no, life has ups and downs that's what makes life life. It's up to us to decide whether or not to make life beautiful, to never let go of the highs and let them carry us through the lows. When you feel at your worse like you can't go on, it's focussing on how close you are to 1000 points, that will keep you going.Win that tank."
rato-3,"Apr 2, 1999",10/10,"This movie is not only about the Holocaust.It is about surviving in a hostile world, that goes past hostile into crazy, with only wit and humor as a weapon.It is about shielding the child you love more than life itself from realizing the unimaginable horrors surrounding it.It is about letting your child inside loose in ""normal"" life and protecting you children from hostility and harm in an ""abnormal"" life.It is about sacrificing oneself for the ones you love.Roberto Benigni made me laugh and cry at the same time.  This film touched me in many ways.  With endless optimism Guido takes on the task of living his own life in a hostile world to say the least. When in a concentration camp with his son he uses stories and games and smiles to keep the HOPE alive.We don't have to SEE the horror around them to FEEL it.  The only time when horror is really shown, it is during a foggy surroundings and looks more like a painting.  Knowing what is there is quite enough.This movie made me think about all the people who did not survive the Holocaust.  Maybe, and hopefully, some of them had their Guido to help them keep their HOPE alive till the end.Bravo Roberto!"
claudemercure,"Nov 7, 2001",1/10,"Despite its unusual approach (it's a holocaust comedy) this is at heart a fatally self-conscious, shamelessly lowest-common-denominator film with the subtlety of a brick to the head.  When he isn't straining to act 'lovable' (actually coming off as obnoxious), Benigni keeps busy pushing every easy emotional button he can think of.  But why should we care?  His romance is never made believable, and the horror of the holocaust is never made real, because the way he edgelessly films it, we might as well be watching a film set in a medium-security prison.  (The movie numbers a grand total of one effective dramatic moment, which is Benigni's artfully handled last scene.)The lowest point in recent Academy Awards history is when Roberto Benigni won best actor for this film (he was up against Nick Nolte, Ian McKellen, Edward Norton and Tom Hanks, all in career-best performances, for god's sake!).If you feel such a strong need to be manipulated that you don't care that the guy doing the manipulating is a shallow egotist, then this movie will suit you just fine."
ritu-69867,"Dec 2, 2019",10/10,"One of the best movies I have watched in recent times. Very touching story, very well presented. The most beautiful thing about the movie was how such a difficult situation was presented to a child."
edwagreen,"Jan 15, 2006",10/10,"A positive outlook on life during such adversity, this is the central theme of the excellent holocaust film ""Life is Beautiful.""Roberto Benigni was voted best actor by the Motion Picture Academy for his portrayal of a Jewish man, who when imprisoned by the Germans during World War 11, tried desperately to rid his young child of fears by making a game out of the holocaust.The film begins with the very funny courtship of Benigni and his wife, who is not Jewish.Horst Buccholz, so young and charming in ""Fanny"" appears as an Italian army official. They years have matured Buccholz. It was sad reading of his passing a few years after this marvelous film came out.The scenery is breath taking and Benigni alternates his feelings in a terrific comedy-drama performance.Just as liberation appears to be imminent, Benigni is shot by the Germans. Unaware of his father's death, the son will carry on in his tradition. His ride on the tank will bring a tear to your eyes.A moving and endearing film, not to be missed."
guidecca-2,"Nov 6, 2008",10/10,I am in agreement that the story is implausible but utterly moving. I sit here and think about Captain's Courageous and would place it in the same category. It will make you cry. What a beautiful story of love and sacrifice. Children are always worth saving and any sacrifice for them is moving. I do not know why there is a minimum number of lines to submit a review of movies on IMDb. That is a change from the original rules. I'm not a film critic and barely find time to write this review. I was very happy to receive help from IMDb in identifying the movie and I am surprised that it was filmed so recently. It deserves 83 ranking and I hope it remains there so that others will get a chance to discover it.
wickedlilfaery,"Oct 25, 2004",10/10,"There are few words that can sum up the sheer beauty and perfection of this film without somehow sounding mediocre. In today's cynical and disbelieving world, Roberto Benigni has taken another cynical and disbelieving era and somehow, emerged with something triumphantly astounding. Never have I seen such an emotionally empowering film. You laugh, you mourn, and in the end, you cry from the overwhelming sense of love and hope that still seems attainable. After watching this movie, I went and hugged every member of my family. You really believe that life is beautiful. The hope and optimism you feel, your tear-streaked face- it's all beautiful. Roberto Benigni, you are beautiful."
Cinemaquebecois,"Sep 11, 1998",10/10,"I will be brief: Benigni has made an instant classic, a masterpiece of humor over the worst drama in the history of the 20th century. With a rhythm à la Chaplin and Keaton, Benigni's tour de force was to keep his enthusiastic story from the beginning till the end. He did it with panache. A TRIUMPH ! 10/10"
drvishnu44,"Dec 1, 2008",10/10,"I made a mistake by not watching this film until now!Everyone must see! A wonderful story and a wonderful action brought such a grace.I think this was one movie, for which there are no ""I Hate it"" comments. So, everyone can get that, how good and important this film was!Roberto was the new Chaplin,and yeah he deserves a Oscar. Of course he got two Oscars (1 for actor, 1 for best foreign film.)This was the story of a Father who is protecting his son in Nazi's Death camp, by being creative! It seems to be a war movie through the eyes of a Charlie Chaplin!If you miss this, you will miss much of romantic drive, much of humour, much of feel! I can say- You will love it!

ntlane,"Nov 19, 1999",7/10,"This film is another in a long line of ""feel good"" European films that get released in the states with much studio hype (usually by Miramax), charm the socks off of people, and win lots of awards (think Il Postino and the Full Monty).  That's a shame.  This film is so simple minded that its almost an insult.  I mean, its good for what it is, but Best Foreign Film?  Best Actor?  Are you kidding me?  Whoopi Goldberg winning the Best Supporting Actress award for Ghost has always been my pick for worst Oscar winner.  Not any more."
themadstork,"Dec 29, 2003",1/10,"There are very few movies, no matter how bad, where I come away personally disliking all those involved.  ""Life is Beautiful"" is one of those movies. Why because beneath the shiny, happy coating ""Life is Beautiful"" embodies a narcisstic and almost nihilistic view of the world; I say this because Begnini et al. are apparently willing to use genocide to infuse a poorly written, badly acted, and sloppily directed movie with dignity it doesn't deserve.  And make no mistake this movie is all three.  The drama is fake, the segments don't flow, the acting sophomoric, the history laughable, and the characters stereotypes at best.  Begnini can do slapstick and there is a funny bit or two, but these add up to nothing and seem positively grotesque in light of what comes later.  This movie is the most banal and manipulative sort of crowd pleaser, the sort that assumes the crowd is composed entirely of idiots, but because it nominally concerns the holocaust otherwise intelligent people are unwilling to call the movies cynical little game for what it is, fearing the -""What you didn't like 'Life is Beautiful?!'  No don't say anything else you don't have a soul,"" or the more common, ""Well go back to your Jerry Bruckheimer movies.""  Well in all honesty that's an insult to Mr. Bruckheimer.  His movies may insult my intelligence, but never to the level this movie did.  At the predictable and overdone ending I remember thinking, ""I know what you want me to do movie, but there's no way I'm buying.""  Worse this movie is an insult to anyone who had to suffer because of the Nazis and their fascist allies.  Watching this movie I'm reminded of how Salem, MA uses historical atrocity as a kitchy tourist draw (going so far as to put witches on broomsticks on the sides of police cars). Begnini uses the holocaust to draw in suckers in the same way.  Group Mr. Begnini with the all those in the holocaust industry who are willing to use the worst atrocity of the 20th century to open wallets and flatter their inflated egos. Beyond being an insult to the victims of National Socialism  this movie is terrible because it crowds out much better movies on the same subject. Everyone chalks in ""Life is Beautiful"" as their art movie of the month and ignores better movies on the holocaust like ""The Ogre,"" ""Invincible,"" or ""Heimat."""
sjtmd,"Feb 7, 1999",N/A,"As a son of Holocaust survivors, I skip movies on this theme.  This is a protective mechanism that I use to avoid painful emotions, but it has denied me the experience of such films as ""Schindler's List"".""Life is Beautiful"", I was told, is not a holocaust film.  It is emotional, but deemed ""safe"". Well, I saw the film, and find myself strongly ambivalent about its message and content. I would love the oppurtunity to ask the creators:  did you simply use the Holocaust as a convenient backdrop to your story? Was it just stage and scenery for the players (much like the opera depicted in the film)?  Will others find similar Holocaust venues to fit their stories?  I don't have the answer.  I personally was hurt by the ""Hogans Heroes"" type story depicted in the second half of the film. I have been told by my own parents of painful yet poignant stories of parent and child in the Holocaust that contrast by their stark reality, to the fairy tale as depicted in the film. As stated at the top, I am ambivalent.  The film serves our children well.  More than any other film I have seen, it shows us, in a way a four year old understands, the absurdity of treating anyone, even ""Visigoths and spiders"", differently than we would want to be treated ourselves.  The acting is impeccable, the music uplifting, and the audience walks out greater for having seen the movie.  I only hope the success of this film does not give others the green light in using a very sad part of history in a way that lessens the memory of those who suffered through it."
Rumples,"Jun 21, 1999",9/10,"This movie is simply brilliant. Casting aside all of the trappings of modern movie-making (special effects, brain-jarring sound, big name stars, bizarre plots and settings, language sex and big explosions) it produces instead a film which captivates audiences because of its simplicity, classy acting and the sheer beauty of its tale. In what may well be the hallmark of a great movie, opinions of LIB are markedly polarised - the number of '1' votes are about equal to the range of 2-6, strongly illustrating that it is difficult to be indifferent to this movie. This is a major difference between LIB and most of what Hollywood churns out where indifference is the only acceptable response. It saddens me that so many people have failed to recognise the charm of this film by choosing to take offence at the way in which the Holocaust was portrayed. I am not Jewish (or Romany, Eastern European, handicapped etc) and would not attempt to presume to tell any of these groups how to react to this portrayal but I can say that I was more moved, more hurt by man's inhumanity towards man, by LIB than I was by Schindler's List or any other Holocaust movie or doco. I, like many others, came out of this film wanting all my friends to go see it. The sub-titles in no way detract from the experience, in fact they are hardly noticeable after a little while. My vote 9/10."
darian_h,"Jun 12, 2002",10/10,"After my first viewing of this movie, it's shot up to the top of my all time favorites. There's nothing to fault with this film, it's flawless. I laughed and I cried.

spottedreptile,"Dec 26, 1999",8/10,"`Life is Beautiful' is a rarity  a simply conceived and executed story about the strength of the human spirit in adversity. It is rare because it manages to deliver a message without beating you about the head with it and getting caught up in its own mission. Neither does it sternly point a finger at the audience which many Hollywood `message' films seem to do these days. Rather, it shows how, even in the conditions of Jewish persecution during the Second World War, people can rise above themselves for the sake of their loved ones. End of message.The film is a delicate balance of humour and pathos, and, unlike many other reviewers, I didn't feel the concentration camps were treated with levity or belittled. The horror is there, but understated. This was how many war victims and sufferers of other atrocities throughout the ages have managed to turn aside the terrible spirit-crushing events they endured  with a gag or a laugh.Roberto Begnini is brilliant, and inhabits his character totally as though born to the part. The romance between him and his `Principesse' is touchingly romantic, and Giorgio Cantarini is terrific as little Joshua.I found this film very satisfying and moving, mostly because it said what it had to without moralizing, making its impact all the more effective."
imran-12,"Oct 12, 2000",10/10,"'Life is beautiful' is one of those films that manages to be outrageously hilarious, and heartbreakingly sad at the same time.

This is one I'll be watching again. And again."
Abby-9,"Mar 20, 1999",9/10,"I put off seeing this ""romance"" because of a basically grumpy temperament. Now I will want to see IL POSTINO as well. Don't want to miss any dimensions of humanity made available through a great and deep comic personality.I'm an older person who first learned of the Nazi concentration camps through documentary footage from the Nuremburg trials shown in my Texas high school.  How to ever recover from this knowledge, much less the actual experience?  Well, to paraphrase Andre Gide, you don't get to the far shore without losing sight of the shore behind you.Roberto Begnini and his fine cast welcome us to the far shore.  Here, the love and care for family and children is far more important than any personal pain, even one's own death.  That the character Guido is capable of clowning for the hidden eyes of the child while being taken away by an armed soldier is a lesson in courage as great as in the great samurai films.The quiet and surprisingly strong character of Dora gives a third point of support to the power of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL.  Her insistence on going with her family to the camp is humbling when you recognize her options and test your own ability to sacrifice any comfort or advantage. The love between these three -- the adoration of the father by the child, the care between the parents and love for their child -- reflects a transcendent reality which is played against brute power in the ongoing battle between Heaven and Hell.How can we endure such pain?  Through comedy, through love . . .And please also credit for depth of situation shown to the gentle old uncle, the Nazi doctor going crazy, the Italian school director easily embracing Fascism as she might embrace any other new educational fad.  Also must credit the patient horse and the kitten.  In SCHINDLER'S LIST (black and white), a touch of color, a little red coat, (thank you Akira Kurosawa -- see HIGH AND LOW) made sharply poignant the loss of a child in the camp. Here, a live kitten looking for the child who cared for it is left with the pile of clothing of the dead children.  Life gone, life remaining.Life IS beautiful . . .  the movie is teaching us.  Learn, the undercurrent of it whispers, and live well.  I'm really grateful for this film."
sly-10,"Jan 12, 1999",9/10,"The story of a man (Guido) who moves to a small Italian town to work for his uncle. Along the way he meets a beautiful ""principessa"" who falls from the sky. He runs into his princess again in the town - he later finds that she works in the local school. He naturally falls for her and invents ways of surprising her - sometimes contrived and simple but funny and romantic nevertheless.He steals her away from her fiance, opens the bookshop he dreamed of and everything seems fine... until 3 months before the end of the 2nd world war - did I mention he was Jewish???He and his son are taken to a prison camp and that's where the movie changes style. Guido is now fighting to keep his son alive. He invents a game for his son that will keep him away from the horrors of the war.Although the horrors were not made obvious by Benigni (why would he when you and I know what happened in WWII) we could see the desperation in Guido to hide the reality from his son so he may survive. I get chills just thinking about it as I write. Subtle in its horror but effective as a tragi-comedy.For those who do not understand Italian there is a point near the end of the film where a ""riddle"" is asked of Guido which I believe was meant as a hint to stay off the trucks."

And Life is Beautiful is a highly deserving addition to this list.Roberto Benigni who acted, co-wrote as well as directed this masterpiece does full justice to the role of Guido Orefice. He is so subtle in his performance, so funny yet being so serious at the same time.He always will be remembered for this role.Dora, played by his real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi did full justice to this role and the chemistry between the lead actors was nothing short of outstanding.The rest of the cast contribute significantly with Joshua, played by Giorgio Cantarini standing out among them. The background score is simple yet terrific and truly deserved its Academy Award.This one was genuinely loved and embraced by one and all, resulting in 3 Academy Awards and many numerous other awards. All in all, a movie that truly deserves all the laurels and recognition it is getting. This is one of those movies where you are definitely going to get moist-eyed and also obtain an experience of a lifetime. Please don't miss this one. Life is really short and of course very BEAUTIFUL."
Delosario-2,"Jul 22, 2007",6/10,"This movie definitely has its moments but overall it is not more than a small charming melodrama which is worth watching but nothing too special.The hyperactive humor of Benigni reminded me of Louis de Funes which I find almost(!) unbearable. The contrast between the horrors of the concentration camp and Guido's effort to pretend it's all a funny game to keep his little son from the truth is quite a bit out of balance. This movie does not do justice to the demise of the prisoners in those camps. I'm sure it was not Benignis intention to show torture, violence and death as Schindler's List but in my opinion this subject does not leave room for extenuation for the sake of a friggin' movie. Overall this film tends to be quite naive (especially at the end)which, again, I think is intentional. Nevertheless, I don't like that at all. With all due respect for Benigni, his craft and talent and his father (who was held captive in Bergen-Belsen) this is playing with fire - in a moral sense. The romantic aspects are very naive too but also quite cute and funny - maybe just because of that naivety.Additionally I'm starting to get uncomfortable with the fact that even modern movies seem to be unable to shake the habit of showing German WW2 soldiers as nothing but fat and/or creepy squallers. But there have been movies far more worse then this one. So it's just a small bellyacher.It's a good movie. Charming and funny but with quite a few weaknesses. It surely would have been better to work on that superficial ""la dolce vita"" atmosphere. The Academy Award is justified but only because of the lack of competition.6/10"
jackasstrange,"Nov 5, 2013",8/10,"'La Vite è Belle' touches very deeply into the concept of meaning of life. It's a study about seeing the beautiful side of the things, doesn't matter the nature of that thing. It looks like a hard theme to put in film, because it's not that easy to convince the viewer to buy such theme. So director Roberto Benigni picked a very controversial and somewhat extreme subject to put this idea in: The Holocaust. Hardly someone would think in a good side of the Holocaust, and certainly it hasn't any. But we can only cheer and appreciate what Benigni tried to do. He dared a lot doing that.And Benigni seems to be really the star in all aspects of this film. His acting was very impressive, it reminded me a bit of the Jerry Lewis performances, but it obviously has much more serious tons than the latter. Being said, the entire cast did a very satisfying performance.The film score(and the soundtrack in general) is perhaps one of the most beautiful that i've heard in a film. Really impressive. And so are the beautiful takes of the city. The scene where it's raining at night and Vito is escorting his 'princess' to her home is a highlight.So, if you are planing to watch this film, do it. 8.4/10"
sing4him28,"Dec 1, 2002",10/10,My daughter rented this movie and recommended that I watch it. She loaned me the tape. I never really appreciated foreign films because of reading all of the sub titles. But I stopped and rewound the tape at certain scenes in order to get the most out of it. I realized that this can not be done in a theater. I was touched by the characters in this film. I highly recommend it. I watched it at a very low time in my life and it picked up my spirits. I hope that it will do the same for others.
matonight,"Jan 24, 2021",10/10,"If you want to have a good movie night, you should watch this piece of art. A tragic part of our history and the most important in our life: family. How a war can be so dramatic, but with some hope!"
Janmom,"Nov 10, 1999",10/10,"Wow. I laughed until my sides ached and tears poured down my face, and I cried tears of sadness. But mostly this movie made me feel and think. I don't think I'll ever view the world the same. This is the best movie I've ever seen -- by far."
Bildo36,"Jul 10, 2002",9/10,"My only regret is that I didn't extract the digit and see this when it was on the big screen.  A film of extraordinary beauty, humour and pathos.Whatever you do, just don't miss it.  And whatever you do, avoid any dubbed versions that have been criminally placed in your video store like the plague."
jmdata,"Jan 28, 1999",9/10,This is the most moving film that I have seen since the Elephant Man.  It is a triumph of the human spirit and the Cinema.  I can't wait to see more of this man's work.
serge-fenenko,"Dec 2, 2002",10/10,"It's hard to believe that somebody could make a comedy about World War II and Holocaust without being cynical or stupid. But Roberto Benigni managed to overwhelm with his mix of horrifying reality and unparalleled optimism. The movie gets directly to your senses from the very first moment and makes you laugh, cry, hate and hope simultaneously.I knew Benigni as a brilliant actor from, for instance, Jim Jarmush's Down by Law, but I didn't know he was such a talented director. To me, La Vita é bella is the best film ever that shows in a very subtle way how the war destroys people's lives, and at the same time proves that the life remains really beautiful."
indigogamer,"Jan 30, 2008",7/10,"I've seen this movie today, and I must say that this film is very good. There are many reasons, and I will name some of them.The story is great and different from other WW2 movies. It is about heroism without action, but with words. A man falls in love with a woman and after some years they have a baby. Unfortunately at that time (1944) they are Jewish, and things turn out very bad. The story tells us that you can put fear away with humor.The acting is very good, and the cast is also very well put together. All actors perform great throughout the whole movie, especially the main character and the little boy.It's a very special film. One you can't find on the screen very often, maybe once a decade. Therefore I recommend it to everybody. Your day will be good after seeing this one, it's full of humor/suffering/sacrifice/happiness.My score 8 out of 10."
pokey-10,"Feb 21, 1999",N/A,"Well, Just the fact that I am writing this review says A LOT about this movie.  I have been going to movies religiously for as long as I can remember, and I have always seen films that I have considered ""greatness"", i.e.: Fargo, Saving Private Ryan.  But this film reached a new plateau within my film criticism rankings.  I am currently studying film in college, and I can't describe to you how this film has changed the way I will forever judge my own work in the future.  This film has some sort of raw human touch, But much different from other ""human touch"" films, I didn't realize I was becoming emotionally involved with the characters.  It just sort of got inside me like a virus and  subconsciously helped me enjoy the movie.The only negative criticism I've read about this cinematic masterpiece is that from people who are angered by the fact that it looks lightly on the holocaust.  It seems that these critics are upset because it doesn't show ""true justice"" on how the nazis tortured the jews. All I have to say to those critics is: Hey, everyone knows the nazis treated the jews like animals, we don't need another movie to remind us! If I had survived the holocaust I would MUCH rather see this movie than one that would bring all the horrible memories back.Also...if your thinking about not seeing this movie because of the subtitles DON'T WORRY.  This is my first subtitled film and everyone told me before I went in that I wouldn't notice them after awhile. And I was like ""yeah right, this is going to suck having to look at the bottom of the screen the whole time"". But it's true!!  I was bothered the first 5 minutes or so because I'm a slow reader and I was having trouble keeping up. But I soon got with the pace. As I was driving home from the theater I thought to myself ""hey, that movie had subtitles"".Well, as this is my first ""review"" of a film ever, I hope it wasn't too bad for everyone to read.  .....anyway, go see ""La Vita è Bella"" !!!!!!!!"
PookiePie13,"Dec 12, 2001",10/10,"La Vita e Bella (Life is Beautiful) is without a doubt one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen, in any language!  The trickery of Roberto Benigni's directing is his ability to make you laugh while you sit and watch horrified, and then manage to keep you from tears until the very end.  At the time I first saw this film, I had yet to see anything nearly as satisfying, and it still stands as one of my favorite films now.  I just need to remember to watch it with tissues."
atiq2510,"Dec 11, 2009",10/10,"While writing the comment on this movie I was just wondering what kind of words I should use for the appraisal of this master piece. I am an Indian and I saw this movie in Hindi dubbing. But the language is not a matter of barrier for such piece of art to communicate the mass. The liveliness of Guido till the end of his life is really inspiring. And the depiction of scenario during 2nd world war is very realistic. The movie starts with fun, comedy along with his friend Feroccio and then his romance mix with fun with Dora. The scenario becomes darker when they are kept in jail but still Mr. Guido keeps the movie alive as well as his son from Nazis. The most touching part comes when Guido is taken by the soldiers to kill and he tries to make his son smile for the last time and his promise to his son for the tank is fulfilled when the US army comes. The movie is a comedy with a hidden tragedy. It's a story of a father, his love for his son and for his wife under the shadow of world and the activities of Nazi during the time. We should also thank Mr. Roberto Benigni for such a beautiful piece of art. The movie has a long lasting effect on the viewers who have to think about the movie and Mr. Guido, the character whom the movies run around. Life is always beautiful for such a person because he makes life beautiful."
kuldeep_ranthambhore,"Oct 4, 2008",10/10,"I have never in my life seen a movie that so truly symbolizes its name and its message. Roberto Benigni - 'The Italian Treasure House' has probably given to his viewers his best. The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring.This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negative things about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make this film, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy and drama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery, and the characters.This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you. After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son. The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie. No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie. The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war. Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles. This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state. Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son. You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh. One can go on forever describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing."
adiolisha,"Sep 17, 2013",10/10,"A Fantastic film where the story telling aspect is the most important element of this film, yes the acting is great and well shot, but ultimately the story is king. We are able to believe in true story telling again. The art is not lost, regardless of how anything is shot, it's all technical and it's another reason to debate something long enough. A Funny film that has many depths of value. Great acting within a surreal environment beautiful scenes that do leave you feeling so good and slightly teary eyed to. Highly recommend this film Life is Beautiful is a wonderful script. I can't recommend the story enough. one will not be disappointed with this film. A wonderful cinema experience."
BillSims28,"Feb 11, 2019",9/10,"This film is frequently written off by commentators as trite and mawkish, or criticised for using comedy to make light of the Holocaust. Admittedly when compared with its counterpart 'Schindler's List', it is positively upbeat, but in reality it balances comedy and drama with considerable skill. I see it as one of the greatest cinematic tragicomedies ever made, comparable to the likes of the masterful 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.The best thing about the film is that it approaches its tragic subject matter from an alternative point of view, doing so with grace and respect. It's so important to be able to view tragedy through a lighter lens in order to move on from it, and if done right (the Coen Brothers do this very well, and Chris Morris' 'Four Lions' is also a great example of it) then comedy can be the best way to do this. 'La Vita è Bella' is one of those few special films that manages to do ths very well, though it maybe could have worked on its denouement just a little more, as the ending feels a tad truncated.This is undoubtedly the Roberto Benigni show: he both directs and writes, whilst delivering an incredibly committed performance as the wonderfully witty Guido Orefice. His barrage of verbosity forms the bulk of the film's tight, often hilarious script, and the first, pre-Holocaust half of this film could easily have been expanded to stand on its own as a riotous romantic comedy. Benigni effortlessly switches from quick-thinking conman to archetypal lovesick Italian sweet-talker, and finally a tireless father who goes to extraordinary lengths to protect the innocence of his son.The rest of the cast is small and tight, with Benigni's wife Nicoletta Braschi delivering a stellar turn as the object of Guido's affection. Giorgio Cantarini, who would later play another tragic son in 'Gladiator', is adorable as the heartwarmingly upbeat child Giosué.Ultimately this moving, finely-crafted work is one of my favourite Holocaust films, though admittedly in a drastically different manner to other greats like 'The Pianist' or 'Die Fälscher'. A must-watch for anyone, though it will certainly not be to everyone's taste. 92/100"

Sandcooler,"Jul 24, 2006",7/10,"I don't really think people could just run around in concentration camps, or have a nap, or joke around for that matter. Seriously, I was surprised that they didn't have a scene with a sack race. Anyway, Guido, a guy who spends the entire movie laughing like an ass, tries to make the best of the situation and tells his son a story about winning a tank when he gets a thousand points. Kids believe the darndest things. This is supposed to be heart-warming, even though it just plain isn't. The writing is just never really good enough.This movie doesn't really have much going for it in the first 100 minutes or so, but the ending is nice. It's really touching and all. Okay, the power gets thrown in the dumpster because a dead character doubles as the narrator, but it's still good. The idea behind this film is Oscar-worthy, but the way it's done is often just boring and Guido's joking isn't that amusing to me. Maybe others can see the humor is not shutting up but I don't. So overall, ""La Vita e Bella"" looks like a missed opportunity."
snackbar,"Nov 11, 1999",1/10,"What starts out as a bad slapstick romantic comedy degenerates into an insulting travesty. The story is about a father who wants to shield his son from the horrors of the concentration camp by pretending its all a game. The prize if they win is a tank - how ludicrous.  At least the beginning was innocuous.  I was not insulted on a religious basis, rather on a human basis.  The Holocaust was one of the worst moments in human history and to see it played for laughs turned my stomach.  And then there is how annoying Benigni is; his presence on the screen is enough to set my teeth on edge. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL doesn't even deserve the one star I have to give it."
Sennical,"May 29, 2002",N/A,"When my eighth grade English teacher showed us Life is Beautiful the Friday before school let out, I had never even heard of it, much less knew what it was about.  Well, after having seen the first forty-five minutes of this movie, I was entranced.  I quickly went home and rented it from the local video store.I finally got around to watching it Saturday night.  It was then that I discovered the absolute beauty of the movie.  I laughed throughout the first part, the sat entranced through the second, both intrigued and horrified at the horrors of the concentration camps.  I sobbed my way through the last ten minutes, then rewound the movie, sat down, and hugged my bewildered dog and cried for another twenty minutes.Life is Beautiful is an unforgettable film.  You quite literally go through every single emotion you are capable of.  Roberto Benigni's acting, through comedic and dramatic moments, is spectacular.Watch this movie.  You won't be disappointed."

I couldn´t believe when Guido arrived at a pile of bodies with the boy sleeping in his arms.How could two governants produce such disgrace ? Why did a people consider themselves superior to another ? This film makes us reflect more and more about questions like these.Reading other comments, I saw that some people think this film made a joke with such subject.

NachoDaddie,"May 20, 1999",9/10,"This is the kind of film that, once you finish it, you're afraid that, because it's subtitled, not many people will see it due to the seemingly inherent laziness of the general viewing public. It's disturbing, because I left this film wanting to tell everyone I knew to go see it immediately. Fortunately, credit was given where it was due in this case, and the film got the sort of exposure that no other foreign film has gotten in my memory (I'm 28.) This is not the best film I've ever seen- that honor is still held by The Godfather. It's not the best foreign film I've ever seen- that would be Kurosawa's ""Ran"". It's not even the best Italian film I've ever seen- I still hold up Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"". But it is, without a doubt, a great film. Begnini has a gift for comedic pathos that was previously the sole possession of the late, great Charlie Chaplin. People who profess a problem with the ""realism"" of the concentration camp need only take two things into account- 1.- Have they ever even seen pictures of newsreels of any camps in Italy? I know I haven't- they were always the Polish ones. 2.- The realistic, accurate depiction of concentration camp life is not the point of this film- if that's what you're after, try ""Holocaust"", ""Sophie's Choice"", or ""Escape From Sobibor"" to name only a few. In this case, the story's the thing- a man who so loved his son, and wanted him to feel safe, is able to convince him that the whole situation in the camp is a game. Take the realistic depiction of the camps and the realistic depiction of the settings with a grain of salt and you'll enjoy the film a whole lot more."
eavgerinos,"Mar 5, 1999",9/10,"Doesn't it feel good to be treated by European cinema with delicacies like this? What an absolute pleasure such films fill your soul with, it feels so nice not to have been cheated by producers who promise heavenly films and deliver nonsense.Benigni is not new in cinema and filming, having directed and written before (e.g. Il Piccolo diavolo (1988) aka The Little Devil (1988)), but it is mainly his comedy he is known of, his characters being utterly silly (on purpose ?) but always satirical and extreme, outspoken and laughable, as well as lovable. Just recall the taxi-driver in Rome in Jim Jarmusch's Night on Earth (1991) or The Little Devil (1988) himself.Yet Benigni never managed to overcome the superficial comedy, the lighthearted one, which was keeping him in the general entertainer level, a kind of clown for the masses. In this rhapsody to life though he steps far ahead, he becomes the advocate of happiness, simplicity, love. He radiates his Italian/Mediterranean spirit of loudly spoken, open-hearted, joyful mood, even in his miserable times he has his own unique way to deliver an open smile.Benigni chose to work on a tough subject, the holocaust, but his intention is not to present his version of the subject, produce another Schindler's List. The holocaust is only his vehicle to express his anti-racist, anti-fascist ideas and bind them up in an all-loving manifesto on enjoying life no matter how it comes. His story starts when his character Guido tries the urbanised way of living in a late 1930's Italian town affected by the rise in popularity of the fascist ideas. Guido remains unaffected by the dark signs and worries not, always finding a way to make things seem funny, satirising every aspect of a strict and collapsing state and public life. He falls in love with the school teacher Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real life wife, who has worked with him in almost all his other films), whose heart he wins through a series of hilarious incidents. The camera meets them again after a few years, married and with a son. They get sent to a concentration camp, but Guido will find again a way to make things seem glad to his little boy's eyes.It's pointless for me to go through the nominations and awards the film has earned (and is going to earn !!!), look at the imdb's website for this. Still, it is the audience which gives the credits to the film, and it was a nice feeling for me to see so content faces when the lights turned on in the theatre I saw the film. Some might accuse Benigni of dealing with a sorrowing matter in a light way. But if you ask me, unlike Spielberg and other directors who narrated stories about the holocaust, Benigni succeeded exorcising it without putting even a single brutality on celluloid, merely telling his audience that life is what you experience and every single one of us has a different perception of reality. If you go to the cinema once a year, this is certainly the film to see this year! Simply UNMISSABLE! It deserves a 9 out of 10."
JatziryG,"May 15, 2025",7/10,"Life is beauty is a comedian/drama and Italian film about the holocaust.The main characters are Guido's family, Dora and Giosue. The film Is about how Guido tried to shield his son from the horrors of the concentration camp.The whole story begins when Guido, a Jewish man, meets Dora when she falls from a farm. Dora was an engaged woman, and of a different economic status. But she ends up marrying Guido and they have their son Giosue and together they open a bookstore.The story takes place during World War II where the Nazis were taking Jews to concentration camps. Guido, his son and his uncle are taken to one of those camps in Germany to Which Dora, not being Jewish, is not taken and cannot do anything, she sacrifices herself by going and not leaving her family alone. While there, they are separated by gender to work and the children are killed, so Guido hides his son and lies to him, telling him that it was a game to win a real tank, that way he does not get scare and does nothing to be discovered. Guido has an escape plan which does not result as he expected."
mheuermann,"Jan 30, 2006",1/10,"Admitively, I'm not a big fan of Benigni and I don't consider his kind of humour as even remotely funny, but what makes this exercise such a truly unbearable experience is that good old Roberto chooses the Holocaust of all things as a gloomy backdrop to make himself shine all the more.Its always a big risk if the same person directs, writes and plays the lead and to my knowledge only Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, Vincent Gallo and Woddy Allen can get away with it. But all of them have some kind of self-deprecating approach. A quality that is completely absent with Roberto Benigni. What makes it all the more annoying is, that most of the people fall for it, as was evident in the cinema when I watched the film.So in order to make himself look good he writes a script that places himself in the middle of some very mean and nasty Nazis. Thankfully he doesn't need to bother with characters as everyone knows that the Nazis are are the epitome of evil anyway. But portraying himself as the tireless adversary of the oppressors isn't quite enough for Benigni. In order to hammer it home to the everyone that he is the good guy, he puts himself in charge of a cute little child, that he has to protect from the trauma of concentration camps. Sometimes this is quite easily done. As the two of them wander aimlessly around the grounds, they happen to come across a huge pile of bodies. We haven't realized this at first cause there was some very spooky fog floating around. Protectively Benini shields the boy's eyes from the unappetizing sight while the music reaches a dramatic crescendo. What a nice guy. This might seem like nitpicking to you but as they were apparently deported to a labour camp and not to an extermination camp, they wouldn't have come across such a sight. But any historic accuracy is secondary to Benigni as long as something gives him another opportunity to make out what a emphatic, altruistic and considerate character he is. Its so unsubtly done, it has to insult anyone with a bit of intelligence.I know, coming up with a comedy set in the Third Reich is always a tricky business but Lubitsch and Chaplin have proved that it can be done. Benigni though fails on all fronts. Some scenes are shamelessly nicked from 'the Great Dictator', in another some raw eggs are placed in a hat and you think that this is so corny and predictable and he can't possible have the villain don the hat (ha ha) and yet he does, and even worse, the audience around me behaved as if this was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. Well, if this is your kind of humour you're in for a real treat."
ExtremeCloseUp,"Jan 17, 2024",N/A,"Most of what happens in the movie is totally unbelievable, but realism isn't the point.It's a fairy tale that shines through the way it is told (for example the outstanding cinematography, transitioning from the beautiful scenery of the first part to the bleak setting of the death camp and of course the iconic music that deservedly won an Oscar) and mostly the power of its message. Hope can break into the darkest corners of the world. If you don't have any guns, you can fight with humour, imagination and, above all, love. Any life is beautiful as long as there's love in it and here we witness one of its purest and most touching forms, the love of a father for his son.Another asset of the movie, arguably its biggest one, is its emotional range. Many people compare Roberto Benigni's performance to Charlie Chaplin and it's easy to why, as he masterfully balances between comedy and tragedy, laughter and tears (by the way, his prisoner number is a tribute to The Great Dictator). This dualism makes the dramatic moments even more intense, nostalgia of the good times makes a dire situation even more hopeless.On a final note, I don't understand why anyone would find it offensive or insulting, the atrocities of the Holocaust come through as clearly as in any other movie with a similar subject matter."
Sai-Ken,"Jun 8, 1999",10/10,"Life is Beautiful is the first movie in years to make me cry, and the first ever that I freely admit.  In addition to it's powerful story, there are hardly any artistic flaws to be found.  Benigni's slapstick feels like homage to others, but his personal charisma (and sheer cuteness) inject it with new life.  The cinematography is excellent, the site gags all work, and even the youngest member of the primary cast was a believable actor.  The story itself?  There are no words for how powerful, even life changing it is.  Pulling you in all directions at once, crushing beauty with atrocity and then injecting joy into the most despairing of conditions, the film manages to raise so many genuine emotions and leave viewers haunted with it's message.And yet, there are legitimate questions raised by it's detractors, who often feel as if the merit of the story is lost by presenting what could be viewed as a too sanitized version of the Holocaust.  As is said in the beginning of the film, the story is a fable, and I view it much as I did the play _The Crucible_.  In _Crucible_, many details of the events in Salem were changed, many to make the tale easier for modern audiences to understand and accept, without being so shocked that more subtle intent is lost.  Though it makes it less respectable as history retold, it does not take away from the powerful moral to be gained. Similarly, in leaving the true horrors of the concentration camps to our imaginations, Life is Beautiful allows us to become involved more strongly with the moral tale and subtle feelings invoked by individual characters and events without bludgeoning us with sheer horror and revulsion.  Holocaust history does demand the most respect of any historic tragedy, and perhaps too much is assumed of the audience's knowledge, but by focusing on a single idealized story this film can influence the heart in ways that the incomprehensible magnitude and surreal horror of the Holocaust often cannot when presented as numbers in a textbook or even the anonymous agony on newsreel.  Personally, I found it to evoke greater revulsion towards the relatively smaller losses and understated horrors then many other likeminded films do towards more accurate portrayals of great atrocity.While not a perfect film, Life is Beautiful is easily one of the best and most powerful ever made when viewed in the proper light, and above all else, its moral shines as a important reminder of how precious- not to mention beautiful, life is."
paulklenk,"Mar 3, 1999",9/10,"You will read many comparison's in these reviews to Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" (1940).This is not a coincidence.  Benigni has described ""Life is Beautiful"" as an homage to Chaplin's film, which he has seen many times.In fact, the number on his prison camp uniform is the same number on Chaplin's uniform in ""Dictator.""I was charmed the first time I saw this movie, and knew of course it was a masterpiece, but on second viewing the film had much more power.  I took my mother, who loved it, and now want to see it again.  A lot of little details can go by if you're not careful.   See it again if you have a chance.Benigni's generous love and affection have such power.  I truly feel sorry for the poor louts who think it is a ""comic treatment"" of the Holocaust, or that it uses the Holocaust as a ""backdrop"" for comedy.  This is simply not the case.I rearranged the letters in ""Life is Beautiful"" to create the following ironic anagram:  ""Lie a bit, if useful."""

ShreedharCharan,"May 21, 2022",9/10,"I had spoilers for this movie, especially the ending was something I completely knew. But when I watched it, I still enjoyed the movie. The way this movie shapes even in the first half is good but story's progression is marvellous in second half.The movie is emotionally powerful, great character design and amazing screenplay. We can feel the condition that people at holocaust might have felt. It is too good to miss out on."
TheDuke-2,"Jun 7, 1999",10/10,"In a time of special effects craziness, this movie shined with a beauty that you would have to see to believe.  Making light of the horrors of the Nazi war camps, was a suttle but very convicing twist that Roberto Benigni did so well.  The love between a family in a the middle of the crisis of WW2 was very touching.  I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age, for it is truly one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking to come out in a long time."

Frank-80,"Aug 1, 2002",1/10,"Words escape me!  Perhaps ludicrous, contrived, insulting come close. There is nothing factual about the depiction of the holocaust in this ridiculous, totally unbelievable mess.  Death camps were not nasty places where people toted weights around, got a little dirty but remained shaven, were able to keep their sons not only hidden but alive and well despite a starvation diet, had access to records, phonographs and loud speakers, could basically move about at will and suffer little more than the inconveniences of a run down boarding house.  This movie claims the camp where our heroes sojourn is a death camp, (not one of the thousands of concentration camps that were located throughout Nazi occupied territories) complete with gas chambers and ovens.  There were only six death camps, all in Poland, and all were dedicated, absolutely dedicated, to the dehumanization unto hideous death of their inmates.  Slow agonizing demise from Zyklon B was the easy part; twenty minutes of choking, while clawing at your throat and eyes and it was over.  The devastating removal of every vestige of humanity through constant beatings, lack of sleep, lack of food and water, lack of any semblance of medical care, torments that ate away at body and spirit over endless days, was the intolerable part.  No one ever spoke to a guard without being shot on the spot.  Guido would not have been taken around a bend to be killed, he would have been shot, or beaten to death, or hanged, publically to display for the other prisoners both his impotence and the Nazi's total control over life itself.  It is absolutely impossible for a boy to have been hidden for a day much less weeks in a death camp.  To depict this living hell as a Stalag full of Schultz's, largely ignoring at least one of the inmates, who gets to clean up and wait tables, with his son, no less, is an insult to every person who has been touched by the real horror of the holocaust. This would have been a great propaganda film for Goebbels to have shown to the Red Cross to show how humane the Nazis really were.  If this was meant to work as some laugh-your-way-through-life's-troubles allegory, then a vehicle more appropriate than the greatest genocide ever perpetrated by man against man should have been chosen as the vehicle.  As it stands this movie is a travesty."
francheval,"Feb 17, 2006",N/A,"I usually don't take time to make reviews about movies I don't like. But this one managed to infuriate me in such a way that for once, I feel I have to make an exception. Now I don't reject as a principle the idea of a comedy about the Holocaust, but mind you, it is a very sensitive subject, so you have to be really talented in order to afford carrying out such a project.I admit the first part of this flick does get some laughs, but not much more so than some easy entertaining comedy that you watch to relax after a long working day. That's not exactly what you call big art. It would be OK if the movie tried to be a parody of a Fellini movie for example. Roberto Benigni is certainly a gifted slapstick actor, but hardly more profound than Jerry Lewis or Louis de Funès. Actually, if I want to laugh my head out, I'd rather watch Mister Bean instead.But sorry, I don't think Benigni can compare to Chaplin, and if you compare this film with ""The Great Dictator"", sorry again, it falls short. First, ""The Great Dictator"" was shot in 1940, and as such, it was obviously much more of a dare and of a statement to make a caricature of Hitler while he was still alive. Secondly, Chaplin knew about Yiddish culture, and the portrayal he made of the Jewish quarter for instance, as a parody, had at least some connection to reality. It is pretty obvious, on the other hand, that Mr Benigni doesn't know much about the subject he is dealing with, and did not care to document himself about it. By the way, Guido Orefice does not sound very Jewish, but it could be translated from Italian as ""Guy Butthole"". No, I'm serious.What is obnoxious from the start is that Benigni seems to be quite self indulgent, naturally convinced that as an accomplished Italian buffoon, he is totally irresistible. He makes a caricatured court to his wife in real life, and it seems to take a few poor jokes and calling her ""My Princess"" so that she falls into his arms. The point of Mr Benigni seems to be more or less that : I am so funny, I am so genial, that I can take the most horrible and the most taboo subject I can find, and it will infallibly become as funny and genial as I am myself. That's as narcissistic as can be. When does Mr Benigni plan to make a comedy about pedophilia?Now, the second part is really hard to take. The concentration camp looks like some severe prison in Switzerland. There were actually no children in concentration camp barracks because they were GASSED right away, and I wonder how long our irresistible Mr Benigni would have lasted in Auschwitz. Probably the Nazis would have thought he was so funny and genial that they would have him perform his laughable tricks while somebody was hanged...Besides, I think lying to children in order to make them believe that life is a bed of roses is a very dubious philosophy. Children are not as stupid as one would like to think, and they generally feel when they're lied to. Transposed into a political context, lying to people in order to make them believe that ""life is beautiful"" has already been done many times.Thanks to Mr Berlusconi who started his career by creating a trash-TV empire, the Italian cinema which used to be one of the most productive in the world collapsed in a mere few years. Here is what remains of it. Bravissimo.The final ""happy ending"", with the kid laughing his head out while he is riding on an American tank with a white star made me so angry I wanted to punch my TV! I don't remember having ever experienced such a feeling before.For those interested in Holocaust comedies, if you can get hold on that, check out ""Train de vie"". It is not the greatest movie, but since Jewish people took part in it, it is already much funnier, much more realistic, and much more respectful. As a long time movie lover, I am genuinely appalled beyond words by the success and recognition Benigni's despicable flick managed to achieve.I don't even want to give this movie a rating."
CMS-5,"Jun 1, 1999",10/10,"LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is perhaps the most wonderful and touching film achievement in the last 10 years.  What a joy it was to see Guido's humour coupled with the subtlety of his heartache for his wife and child.  If you have not seen LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, please do.  At first you may have to adjust to subtitles if you are not used to them, but after a short time into the film, it won't seem any different than a film in English.  This is a tender story with some of the most moving moments in recent film history."

gulsumbasad,"Dec 6, 2023",7/10,"The first 30 minutes were funny, the last 1 hour was very emotional. I really liked the movie, maybe it can be even more emotional when watched by a father. Roberto Bengini licked and swallowed the role of excellent acting. The right people played the role of both father and child. The subject is also very good. It's impossible not to fall in love with the Guido character. But if you say the movie was perfect, it wasn't. For example, the atrocities committed by the Nazis have never been well described, it was terrible in that regard, this is the most glaring mistake of the film. The leading father Guido laughs all the time throughout the film, he does this to make his child believe that what happened was a game, but maybe he could have shed secret tears from his son in a scene, I'm sure he would have been much more emotional then. The role of the mother could also be more active. Finally, the scene that I found wrong is the father making sacrifices throughout the movie, taking care of his son, but at the end, he's not worried about his father at all in the scene where the child hugs his mother, at least he could have asked where my father is. Despite all this, it is a very nice movie that you will be able to watch."
aa4353,"Dec 9, 2007",9/10,"Thank heaven for CDs. My family and I have watched this movie each year for the past two years. We still laugh, we still cry and we still get the message that love and humor are important in life. The father's love for his son and wife needs to be practiced today. The acting is good the directing is great. I do not feel that the actor who plays the son gets enough credit--his lines are delivered so child like (not the disrespectful attitude of children in most movies). This movie is not a documentary. Therefore, those who pan it as treating the holocaust irreverently are watching the movie with different color glasses. Many who have experienced serious injury, disease and war have used humor to endure."

sawaugh,"Dec 7, 2013",10/10,"I recently noticed that I have scored a lot of films extremely high (on IMDb). The first time I had watched these films was many years ago. I thought out of respect to them films I should put finger to keyboard and comment.My comments are: Firstly if you watch this film and it's not a movie that will have a lasting effect on you, then maybe film is not your medium. I suggest this could be the most perfect balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama ever made in film.Secondly can any three words highlight a films content so strangely, Life if beautiful? The focus given to the strength of human nature in adversity but somehow delicately handling the Holocausts content.Thirdly, the film could stand alone on the acting. Roberto Benigni incredible, the doctor who loved puzzles, the wife's portrayal of pure good nature – they could have all won awards.Laugh and cry in the same moments is something that special – this film did it.As a farther in times of stress and panic - Guido is still a role model in the back of my mind years on.

The scenes where he expresses his love towards dora were extraordinary done. Their love crashing at beginning of their meetings was funny tho and scene where she crawls down the table and kisses him was soo lovely. There is also shown how Germans took over human rights and made them slaves. A best life learning movie at 19s can't belive it!

joe-246,"Mar 9, 1999",N/A,"I tried hard not to make comparisons but all the time long I saw the incredible Chaplin in Benigni`s film. The great Chaplin certainly influenced Benigni quite a lot (in acting and directing) and that is probably the reason why I left the movie theater with the strong impression I had already seen that film. ""Life is Beautiful"" reminds me also the old American ""pastry-films"" (like the tv series ""The Three Stooges"") in which things happen because they happen and don`t have to be explained. We all shall, meanwhile, recognize the good photography of the film, but for the rest it is far from deserving an Oscar. Like for best foreign-language film, for instance."
imdbfan-215743,"May 15, 2025",7/10,"Can laughter really exist when things are really, really bad? ""Life Is Beautiful"" is about this question. It's a movie about Guido Orefice, a cool Italian guy who's Jewish, and he uses his smarts and imagination to keep his son safe during a really tough time. It's a mix of funny and sad parts, set during World War II. Life Is Beautiful shows how love and imagination are powerful, even when things are awful.-The movie starts with Guido meeting Dora in Italy, and they have a family. Then, things get really bad when Guido and his son, Giosuè, are sent to a concentration camp. To protect Giosuè, Guido tells him they're playing a game - to win a tank! This change in the story - from funny to sad - makes the movie more emotional. It shows the difference between happy life and the terrible war.Roberto Benigni, who plays Guido, is awesome. He's funny and likeable at first, then you see how desperate he is to protect his son. Nicoletta Braschi (as Dora) is also good; she's strong and caring. Their acting is really believable, which makes the movie even better.Life Is Beautiful"" is about big ideas like love, sacrifice, and how strong people can be. Guido loves his son so much he makes up this big game. The movie is both funny and sad, which is interesting. The funny parts show how crazy the situation is, but it doesn't make the seriousness of the Holocaust less important. It shows that hope is still possible
-""Life Is Beautiful"" isn't just about the Holocaust; it's about how strong the human spirit is. I would totally recommend this movie. It makes you think, and it's very moving. It reminds us that even when things are super dark, people can still find light."
mullymt-1,"May 12, 2000",1/10,"I saw this movie soon after its American release, before the massive wave of buzz set in.  At the time, I remember thinking that America's intelligience level had to be much higher than the level this film speaks to.  I was wrong.  This movie might as well have been directed by Joel Schumacher (who, in my opinion is the worst director in Hollywood)  Pure schlock.  This movie is on the same level of Patch Adams:  cheesy, brainless and horrible.Everything in this film is weak: the script, the pacing, the cinematography, and especially the acting.  Roberto Benigni winning an Oscar is the equivalent of Danielle Steel winning a Nobel Prize in literature. The only point of this movie is to make the viewer cry.If you are interested in a foreign film that shows how the relationship between an doomed father and an unwitting child should be played, watch the Russian film Burnt by the Sun.  This film is just poor."
gorate83,"Feb 25, 2014",10/10,"Sentimental and contrived, Benigni's well-intentioned Holocaust framed may only work as a children's fable. Inexplicably, it won a prize at the 1998 Cannes Festival. Audiences will be laughing hysterically while crying their eyes out. If this is a fantasy, it is probably a compensation we need when facing the reality of history. The film's highlight is one man's battle to keep the ugliness of the world from his innocent son, no matter how ugly the world might be, and in this case that means the death camps of the Nazis. I think you have to give this film credit just for having the guts to address a heavy subject like the Holocaust in the manner done here, which is predominately with a lighthearted tone. That's a big risk, but it mostly pays off here."

I fell short in my words the truth, because everything in this movie is pure art, it is life itself, its pros and cons. And of course, the vile face of the damned wars, that the only thing that has left us has been death and more death.But despite this, an adult, a human, someone like you, like me, avoids at all costs that little boy, see the horror of the world.And that is a beautiful message for all of us, that a person gave even his life to save the innocence of that child who did not understand what was happening at that time.For me, just for gesture, fact, reality, sacrifice, it is always worth seeing this movie."
ellentdouglas,"Aug 27, 2014",9/10,"Roberto Benigni has covered all bases of life in this great film. From laughter, love, happiness, family, sorry, resilience and the power of positive thinking with a creative mind, we watch the story unfold. Throughout the movie the main character, Guido, steals your heart. He shows us the beauty and importance of laughter and love. He teaches us not to give up. He shows what belief in yourself can do when trying to get something you want and in facing difficult situations that are beyond our control. If you are watching the movie with subtitles you become so entrenched in the plot that you forget that you are reading them. This movie moves at a nice pace. Even though the plot changes dramatically the character stays true to his nature. It is no wonder that Benigni won the Academy Award for Best Actor and the film, Best Foreign Film."
EmilieDK,"May 4, 2022",10/10,One of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen even though it is telling a very tough story during WW2 it still shows how life can be beautiful during the must tough conditions.
fan_of_bollywood,"Mar 5, 2008",8/10,"....""When the game's over."" The year is 1939. Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni) is a cocky Italian waiter of Jewish descent, and is bent on winning the heart of Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), a beautiful schoolteacher. To do this he uses his talent for turning up in unexpected places and his witty humour and charm. The entire first part of the film is based along Guido winning over Dora and is played with a comedic feel. It isn't until the latter half where the film becomes truly beautiful.Five years on, Guido and Dora have Giosué (an adorable Giorgio Cantarini), their only son. Their life is peaceful but disturbance arrives when Nazis take away Guido, Giosué and Guido's softly spoken Jewish uncle, Eliseo (Giustino Durano). It is only with difficulty that Dora succeeds in convincing the Nazis to take her, too (even though she still ends up separated from Guido and Giosué). Desperate to shield his son's fragile young mind from the horrors of the Nazi camps, Guido creates a game for Giosué: you gather points for things like staying hidden and following orders. The first person to reach 1,000 points is the winner and receives his very own tank. Naturally, Giosué is happy to play along.However, the illusion becomes harder to maintain as the camp conditions worsen. Giosué's faith in his father sometimes wavers and Guido must be strong for the sake of his son.I'm not going to reveal what happens, but I will say that it will probably stir up a mixture of emotions.When I first heard about this film, I found it hard believe a ""Holocaust comedy"" could be believable or enjoyable. But this film displays a level of dignity and heart which strikes a chord with the viewer. The beautiful chemistry between the three leads is touching, especially that between Guido and Giosué.Benigni's acting strength comes not only from his comedy talents but also the powerful love he is able to show as an actor. Braschi also is wonderful as Dora. After her family is taken away, Dora says to the Nazi officer in a voice both frail and strong: ""My husband and son are on that train. I want to get on that train. Did you hear me? I want to get on that train."" Her gently unrelenting character lends a motherly side to the film But best of all is Cantarini as little Giosué. His wide eyes and expressive face give a different touch to film with a kind of brutal honesty. It is so, so hard to describe the way the film *feels* when he is on screen. You are seeing it from the perspective of both the father, the mother and the innocent and painfully unsuspecting child.Wonderful film---8/10"
jameth15,"Dec 19, 2022",10/10,"This is a great movie. It really got me right in the feels. I have watched it many times, and every time, I'm blown away. I laugh, I cry, I ugly cry, and all the feelings in between. The story revealed to me what it was like back then for families that were torn apart by the Second World War. I have a hard time with subtitles, but this was a well-made movie that was easy to follow. Definitely, it is in my top 5 WWII movies list. It is one of the historically accurate movies about that time period. I find the characters to be very relatable even though we have absolutely nothing in common whatsoever. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a history and WWII Era fanatic."
keenanchris,"Dec 12, 2020",6/10,"A well-intentioned movie that clearly hit the spot with many viewers but left me feeling perplexed. The story was OK but I found the concentration scenes between Guido and his son hard to believe and the comedy aspect of it all old-fashioned and hackneyed and dare I say it, Benigni's performance irritating.Still the sets were nice and it is a pleasant film to watch if you're not expecting much, but the best foreign language film of all time it clearly is not - but good luck to you if you thought it was. You obviously saw something in it that unfortunately went over my head."
TheEmulator23,"Oct 30, 2007",4/10,"I will never understand why this film and the star (Roberto Benigni) were/are so highly praised. This film is mediocre and plain pathetic at what it tried to do. I felt that it was only highly praised because everyone was sooo in love with Benigni and his ridiculous antics! I will never understand how this won any Oscars, or what exactly made this a great film. Now some of my favorite films are those that deal with WWII (""Downfall"" for example) and the Holocaust. (""Schindlers List"" stomps on this.) I appreciate what was trying to be said about the inhumanity of the Holocaust, and the fathers love for his son in keeping the truth from him. I just felt that it was very repetitive and didn't say or do anything that hasn't been said or done before in film. It is still rated in the Top 100 a decade later so there is obviously those that think this is still an excellent film. I would hope that people would watch it again and see if they still feel that this is really one of the best films of all time. I just can't see how this is rated in the Top 250 when there are so many other better films that are just out of it. Doesn't it make you wonder why we have never heard of this film really since? For that matter have we even heard of Roberto Benigni since? I feel that so many of these ratings are because everyone likes HIM so well, and are therefore biased on their ratings."

Roberto Benigni escalates his funny man stature to a different level with his romance in beginning with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife) which makes you laugh your heart out and then he maintains this through out the movie even when his life is at stake to convince his son it's all right and they're playing a game which is very touching and almost makes you cry (And you do at the end).Technically, the film is very well scripted and directed by Benigni himself which garnered him an Oscar nomination for direction which was very well deserved as the sequences of romance and between Giosue and Dora came out very well and Benigni's makeover as a courageous father hellbent on protecting his son and using his sense of humor as a weapon to protect and comfort him is brilliant, it's no Schindler's list but it connects with the audience in it's unique tragicomcical script which leads you to believe there is a hope under those horrific circumstances, the movie is no satire but has a charade of comedy to underlying harsh reality which leaves the audience touched at the end.Overall one the best movies on holocaust and Robert Benigni's masterpiece."
McMurfy,"Oct 18, 2007",9/10,"This movie left a serious impression on me. I told my sister to never marry until you are loved the way the woman was loved in this movie. A true work of genius. I hope if you are considering seeing this for the first time, you go through with it. Very unique and well done.I love the people who bashed it and gave obscure references to ""their"" movie choice. What a bunch of zippers.""No, I didn't like that steak, if you want something really good and meaty you have to try the pot roast, it is so much more thorough and engrossing. You people that like steak have never really known good meat."""
rakibulhasan_2491,"Nov 29, 2013",10/10,"Truly marvelous movie. The work by Roberto Benigni is too good. The acting of the child outstanding. The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war. Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the Nazis psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles. Guido just turns every situation into a possibility. Being so blatant about his love. Comically funny. Attributes to a stand out performance."
sofiberendorf,"Aug 13, 2012",N/A,"This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negative things about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make this film, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy and drama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery, and the characters. This movie is magnificent in every way. Don't miss it!I AGREE WITH THAT REVIEW, this movie is excellent but definitely its impossible to say it is a COMEDY"
Moviefan-24,"Feb 18, 1999",6/10,"I dislike everything in this movie. I hate the story! Some game! As if survival were not difficult enought without the extra added torture that those who command us impose. Those characters should not have had to use up their lives playing that retarded game. Mental patients belong in asylums, not in power. I guess as a homage to good fathers, the movie is somewhat more tolerable. Many children of families with limited means grow up thinking that they are first class citizens thanks to protective fathers that sacrifice to give them that impression. But why should dad have to sacrifice so much?It's a silly movie. I guess they are running out of angles to examine the holocaust from. I know eventually this will happen. It has to.The movie itself is a competent offering. I thought the first ten, fifteen minutes were intolerably boring. It becomes more entertaining with the visually stunning party and street scenes. It certainly doesn't offer much hope for the Guidos of this world. I don't see any reason to nominate this film for Best  Picture."
André-3,"Feb 26, 1999",2/10,"In my view this is an awful film. Cliché ridden, woeful acting, idiotic storyline. Does anybody honestly believe that this otherwise smart kid would continue to believe the stupid story about the point gathering game ? Did we lose something in the subtitles ?This is a totally unfunny comedy (unless one thinks that falling on the floor or getting an egg squashed on one's head is absolutely hilarious. I used to but I haven't for more years than I care to count.)In my view, associating slapstick (and bad slapstick at that) with something as tragic as the holocaust borders on blasphemy. I felt sick in seeing this giggling buffoon prancing around trying to get a laugh in a concentration camp decor.Throughout the presentation, I couldn't make up my mind whether that main actor reminded me more of Jerry Lewis at his worst or of one of the three Stooges, except that the latter comedians did at times succeed in making people of their era laugh. They did not always take for granted that laughter being contagious, all one has to do is giggle intermittently and the laughs will follow.And no, the short scene depicting the bodies does NOT make up for the general lack of sensitivity displayed in the other 99.999% of this movie. In fact, this scene seems totally out of place in the storyline, as if the actor had mistakenly walked off the set. ...As if the ballet dancer had stepped on your toe."
dankeys1,"Jan 6, 2014",10/10,"If you're considering watching this, please do! Don't let the fact that its in Italian put you off! In summary, a perfect feel-good film about the strength of the human spirit that will soften the heart of any viewer and put a massive smile on their face in the process! The contrast between the innocent comedy and the atrocities going on in the background allows for even greater effect. The film is enhanced by fantastic performances from the three main actors/actresses, including the perfect depiction of innocence from the boy, and a perfect performance from Benigni. Alongside the plot which took me to a happy place for the full duration, the film has a beautiful soundtrack which further complements the story."
afarmuhali,"Oct 6, 2024",8/10,"It's a film that totally blew me away. It's a wild mix of humor and heartache that really pulls at your emotions. The way it balances comedy with the harsh realities of life during the Holocaust is just brilliant. I found myself laughing one minute and crying the next, which is a rare feat. The father-son relationship is so beautifully portrayed; you can't help but root for them. It's like a rollercoaster of feelings, and the message about love and hope in the darkest times is incredibly powerful. Sure, some might say it's too sentimental, but honestly, I think it nails the emotional punch. It's unforgettable and deserves all the praise it gets."

Nicoletta Braschi turns in a wonderful performance as a Catholic girl who loves her husband regardless of what religion he practices.At the end it is a must watch movie."

The background music & Photography are exceptional It's about the ultimate love of a man who plays different role in his life as Lover, Husband and Father...I can bet that no one can do this role as best as Roberto Benigni does.All star performances make this visually stunning masterpiece a true film classic...I have seen the movie about 5 times now, and every time I love it more...

oddworld-42982,"Jun 7, 2022",10/10,"The film is very well made and well worth watching. No spoilers, But this is one of the few four movies that have made me cry. It's a heartbreaking, genius, very good movie."
vega101,"Jan 26, 2004",10/10,"Being an avid movie watcher for some time I have become aware of many films that try to portray 'love', with a vast majority falling way short. However, what you have here is a movie of such invention, passion and true spirit that it is almost inconceivable that one man could be the genius behind it all.The start reminded me more of a Peewee Herman film (for those who are familiar) than anything else, with comical humour almost over used. But as this film develops it becomes something so special that I will remember it always. To portray such a simple story so effectively requires genius, which Guido has in abundance. I don't need to say anything in particular about the film as you must watch it, but be rest assured that it will leave you touched in a way that is very rarely achieved in cinema."
Jake-174,"Aug 15, 2002",N/A,"Any movie about the Holocaust must be undertaken with great care. Some may be offended by the humor in ""Life is Beautiful"", and say that the concentration camp is not realistic. But it is important to note that the voice-over narration at the very end tells us that the story is being told through the eyes of Joshua, the son.  His father Guido was able to protect him from the true horrors of the camp, and that is why it is a sanitized, not realistic perspective of his early life. This movie is not primarily about the Holocaust, but rather about the human qualities that can make life beautiful. These include courage, opitmism, a sense of humor, perseverance and the ability to love sacrificially.  One of the best films I have seen."
JCR-4,"Jul 27, 1999",7/10,"I went to see La Vita è bella when it was first released, in Italian, and knew nothing of the plot.  I loved the first half.  Typical Benigni, a clown that tries to win over the charms of a pretty woman (his wife in real life, as usual).  It was the same sort of thing as many of his films, e.g. Johnny Stecchino.  I'd give it a nine for the first half.  But then the second half left me horrified.  I suppose it was meant to.  I wasn't expecting it. While I recognize how well made the film was, I just can't see how you can make a film half comedy and half holocaust.  It was meant to make you laugh and then cry, and so it did, so I guess it was a success from that point of view.  But sorry folks, I'd rather watch Johnny Stecchino when I want to laugh and then Schindler's List when I want to see a harrowing story of the holocaust.  Putting them together for me was in very very very poor taste."
brennanm,"Aug 9, 1999",1/10,"This movie is possibly the most wretched abomination I've ever been forced to endure.  Never was I amused, stimulated, impassioned, engrossed, or even interested.  Divided into two independent halves (which in and of itself isn't necessarily bad), it proceeds to bore and insult the unfortunate viewer with two seperate stories.  The first of these unlikely tales involved a horribly contrived and utterly loathsome tale of a man and a woman falling in love.  Basically, he drags her around the city to various locations where he knows something specific will happen, such as a man tossing a set of keys down from a second story window to a locked-out friend, and she falls in love with him.  Whoopee.  Nothing is done here that hasn't been done a thousand times over in better movies.  The second half amazingly and deftly trumps even the first's diabolical drabness by continuing its utter bore-fest, but then contributing what may be the most insulting, degrading, and unholy storyline ever to grace (or in this case, curse) the screen.  The filmmakers evidently thought it appropriate and amusing to have a good chuckle at the expense of all of those sustained and killed in Nazi concentration camps, as the one in this film is depicted as more of an expensive resort than a death camp.  Of course, there were token scenes that showed a death or two, but never was the horror ever at the focus of the story.  (This may have worked if the picture had anything else going for it, such as a storyline, but sadly such amenities are absent from this stinker.)  I am shocked at the poorness of this movie, and I walked out asking myself something that years of exposure to the supposed decay of society, American pop culture, had never caused me to wonder: ""Is nothing sacred anymore?"""
beries,"Dec 7, 1998",10/10,"I don't remember a movie that has moved me more than LIB. Begnini is an absolute genius for conceiving such a story of passion and the human spirit. It may be cliche to say, but this has Oscar written all over it.The only drawback is the extreme speed of the dialogue, so be prepared keep up with the subtitles."

rollinscal-83,"Oct 3, 2024",9/10,"Great film. Roberto Benigni did a wonderful job playing the character of Guido. I was so impressed to see how nothing was impossible to Guido. His hyper personality got him in trouble all the time, but his spontaneous personality helped him to find quick solutions in a very intelligent way. Guido showed us how he devoted himself to his son, even though they were in a terrible situation. He used humor and jokes to protect his son from minimizing the horrible reality that him and his family were going through at the concentration camp. Even at the most bitter moment he sweetened everyone's and his son's life with a joke or a smile. It was really shocking to me that right before Guido was killed he made sure that his son was safe and he was still joking and smiling even though he knew that he was going to be killed. This movie was made so beautifully that I strongly recommend it to anyone to watch it."
DoriaLavagnino,"May 1, 2023",9/10,"This movie is nostalgic for me, as it reminds me of my late Italian father. I remember watching Roberto Benigni's performance and being reminded of many of the cultural nuances of Italy, and the importance cinema played in many people's life. My dad remembers in the 1940s (maybe late 30s?) my dad saw his first movie King Kong.This film reminds me of the significance the Hollywood mystique had on so many in his era.I would prefer a high-quality film or tv series (I think the best writing is happening in TV right now) over the Reality TV wasteland. This was one of the few films that captivated me from stop to finish."
PureCinema,"Jan 25, 1999",9/10,"Roberto Benigni has done it. The man has restored my faith in movies. 1998 was one of the worst years for movies in a long, long time (with a few notable exceptions)... and along comes ""Life is Beautiful"". I have not seen a filmmaker with Benigni's talent and genius since Charles Chaplin.... in fact, one is often reminded of Chaplin throughout the film.Benigni works with all of the elements here and blends them together in a perfect mixture of drama and comedy. He makes you laugh and he makes you cry. Here's to you Mr. Benigni... for making Cinema beautiful again!"

mike7721,"Nov 14, 2013",10/10,"I really enjoyed this film. I am not fluent in Italian, but I prefer the Italian version with subtitles to the English version. It's really a wonderful story and everything fits together real nice. I very often find that films that are a bit over the top are drawing the audience away from the reality of a the story. While this story may at points be a bit questionable, it's the reasons we write movies and not based all films off of real life (as if this were the invention of lying). I don't not want to give anything away except the fact that this film is certainly one of those that'll make you cry and then say wow. I promise you won't be disappointed...unless you're a nazi."

jul_g,"May 25, 2000",1/10,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only is it appallingly badly directed and boring; not only is the humor and so-called acting amateurish at best; this film is trying to make some points about the Holocaust that are utter lies!Anyone with even a minimal understanding of the Holocaust would have to first of all discount ANY movie which purports to make the subject into a comedy, of all things. I hated the Chaplin movie, ""The Great Dictator,"" for the same reason.But that's not the only problem here. The distortion of reality presented in this movie is abominable. Concentration camps were not sleepaway camps where you could just hide your kids in safety if you were clever enough. I really don't want to go into the horrific details of what concentration camps were really like; I don't think that is appropriate in this forum.Even if it were possible to keep your child hidden away in a camp, I question the legitimacy of making an obviously murderous regime into a silly game of ""points"" to win a tank, just to shield your child from the cruel truth. I am sure that any child in a concentration camp (who would have survived, which was virtually impossible) would have been all too aware of what was really happening. I see the hero's attempt at shielding his child as lying, plain and simple.The thinly-veiled insult contained in this movie is: if only all those poor victims of the Holocaust had only had a sense of humor! Then of course many wouldn't have died, and there would have been so much less suffering. I really hope that anyone reading these lines gets my sarcasm here.But the worst thing about this atrocious movie is the way it has rewritten history. The only other people who are doing that on the subject of World War II are neo-Nazis, I'm afraid."
FeelinComfortabl,"Jan 27, 2004",10/10,"What a wonderful film full of great wit and extreme confidence of happiness. This movie moves one in and out of happiness to a point where one might be confused weather to laugh or cry. This story of a man who goes to great lengths to see the love of his world, to go to great lengths just to make contact and see the people he cares about simply smile. All falling on top of a death that shocks something inside that tears don't begin to roll when you would expect them to but eventually have their way with you when you see this little boy's face light up over something he does not even understand and then the ever so powerful reuniting of the family brings a wonderful climax of emotion. One is only left to think about how their life has been effected by such a powerful personality and their life that follows.  I loved the film and it is one that can be seen over and over again. Love it every time."
Sjohn,"Jun 15, 1999",10/10,"As I wrote to a friend of mine: ""The movie was incredible, beginning as a very old-fashioned funny romance (I mean 1950s old-fashioned, although Roberto Benigni himself is getting Buster Keaton comparisons), and turning into a holocaust movie, and staying a comedy the whole way while just ripping your guts out. Jesus. Don't miss it."""
Inliten,"Dec 24, 2002",10/10,"There's not much to say about 'Life is Beautiful' other than the fact that it is certainly worthy of seeing.  The film is at once hilariously funny and immensely sad.Set against the backdrop of the Holocaust, Benigni's character falls in love.  What ensues is a series of comedic events, all in spite of the blunt truth of World War II.Benigni was certainly worthy of his Oscar, and this film was certainly worthy of its own Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.  It's an inspiring, clever way to depict the events of the Holocaust, without feeling overly cynical or insulting.  That in itself was quite a triumph."
yassir-ya,"Aug 2, 2021",10/10,I love how this movie is simple and great in the same time .
barry-32,"Dec 26, 1998",N/A,"The praise for this forced, strident comedy is puzzling. This film, which is one long wince,  looks like ""Seven Beauties"" as seen through the eyes of Jacques Tati. A serious subject does not a good movie make. Like ""Il Postino"", ""Life is Beautiful"" is another mediocre Italian-movie-for-export. We miss you Federico!"
SnoopyStyle,"Jan 10, 2015",7/10,It's 1939 Italy. Jewish Guido (Roberto Benigni) tries to open a bookstore but he continues to face hurdles with a smile. He falls for the lovely Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). She is engaged to an ambitious government official but she runs off with Guido. They get married and have a son named Joshua. The fascists would catch up to them but Guido would pretend the camp to be a giant game so that he can hide the truth from his son.Roberto Benigni is going for extremely broad comedy here which turns eventually. The movie is always a bit odd to have slapstick comedy while the audience knows perfectly well what is happening. It makes the movie unfunny. The movie is much more compelling as a heartfelt drama.
NoRealityShows4Me,"May 13, 2003",1/10,"When I rented this movie, about 2 years ago, I thought I was going to love it. It already had an Oscar and the ratings on IMDb were very high, so could it not be great? It was a BIG disappointment! I thought `Life Is Beautiful' lacked consistency most of all. It this movie was a Holocaust fairy tale (!?) for everyone to enjoy, it should have ended with the nazis and prisoners dancing and kissing each other, because `love conquers all'. If it was a comedy, I should have laughed more than twice. And if it was realistic, it would have ended sooner and tragically. Fortunately, my family didn't experience the Holocaust, but I have read enough about it and seen enough pictures, that I can never understand how you cannot be offended by this movie. I think a lot of people don't realize how wrong it is to trivialize the Holocaust, because it doesn't seem real to them. Can anybody even imagine a comedy about 9/11? I didn't think so. Maybe 50 years from now, when it doesn't seem so real and tragic.Last week, I watched `Train Of Life', an European co-production about the inhabitants of a small Jewish village in Central Europe who organize a fake deportation train so that they can escape the Nazis and flee to Palestine. The subject seems as unrealistic as LIB's, but the very surprising ending makes the movie brilliant! I absolutely loved `Train Of Life', the story, the acting, the music, the humor, everything about it!I wanted to learn more about Radu Mihaileanu, the Romanian director (a Jew himself) and found an article from ""Le Nouveau Cinema"" (feb.1999), entitled ""Inferno Train"". According to ""Le Nouveau Cinema"", director Radu Mihaileanu, who also wrote the script for ""Train Of Life"" wanted Roberto Benigni for the role of Shlomo, ""the village foul"". He sent the script to Benigni in 1996, but was refused politely. Strangely enough, less than a year later, Benigni was directing his own Holocaust comedy movie! Having trouble with finding financing for his movie in France (because of the delicate subject), Mihaileanu started filming a year later. This delay was more than enough for Benigni and his `La Vita E Bella'. His movie was out in theaters in Italy, during Christmas, while `Train Of Life' was still in editing. Because of the scandal surrounding the 2 movies, Gilles Jacob, the person in charge with the selections for Cannes, refused both. After Miramax bought the rights for `Life Is Beautiful' for 7 million dollars, the movie was finally selected for Cannes! In spite of everything, `Train Of Life' was nominated and won awards (about 9) all over the world. It even won the Audience Award at `Sundance' (tie with `Run Lola Run'). I recommend `Train Of Life' to everybody!"
TheCarlosMarquez,"Jan 3, 2022",10/10,"It has been, by far, one of the best movies I've seen, and one of the best movies in the history.Incredible, without more, that reflects the cruelty of the Holocaust, the love of parents for a child and how horrible the human race can be.I've cried a lot, because this movie is very hard, but it is a masterpiece.One of my favorite movies, without a doubt!!"
A_Voice,"Jan 4, 2014",9/10,"Innocence and courage, sometimes that's what you need to get through some hard times, more importantly, get the one you love through, have a shoulder for them when they need it. It's about love and family.It's the story of a father who uses his humor and his son's innocence to help him get through the Jewish Holocaust. He makes his son believe that it is all part of a game and the winner wins a tank.The first half of the film is actually a rom-com set in the politically strained environment of Italy. Whereas, the second half is set in the concentration camp where Guido tries to protect his son.Critics argue that the film handles a delicate subject matter in a comedic and carefree manner and it might offend a group of people. But it should be understood that that is actually the purpose of the film. What the character of Guido does is present the whole concentration camp as a part of a game to his son, and the viewer. If the actual holocaust was show, it would defy the purpose of the film and take away its innocence. We have Schindler's List for people who want to witness the actual holocaust. This is a different film. It is supposed to depict family love at its best. The film is about optimism and hope.The film being comedic, which manages to bring a smile every now and then, is depressing all of the same. Not only Benigni delivers a superb performance, he has directed it just as well. Barring the occasional goofs by the supporting cast here and there, it's the story that ill stay for you for a long time. The film is perfectly blended with just the right score and beautiful use of ""Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour"".Direction: Strong self direction, might be a little flawed at places but great nevertheless.Screenplay/Story: Extremely good. It handles the controversial and delicate subject matter with utmost ease and delicacy. Strong character development, creates a character that stays with you. Even better executed.Acting: A deserving Oscar for Roberto Benigni. Giorgio Cantarini had the innate innocence required for the character. Rest if the cast was fitting.Music: 'Perfection in simplicity' is the most fitting phrase to describe the subtle score by Nicola Piovani.All in all, a film that stays. A film that can effect you if not change you. A film to be enjoyed with the family."

FilmCriticLalitRao,"Jul 23, 2007",8/10,"""Life is beautiful"",is a film about that brief period of Nazi rule in Italy due to which many ordinary Jewish people had to endure enormous hardships.Although it is a film about Nazism,it is quite different from other films of the Nazi film genre like Schindler's list.It is more of a film about comic romance,laughter,optimism and how to keep one's sanity intact when one finds oneself in a difficult close to death kind of situation. This film ran into trouble as many leading filmmakers protested against what they called ""making mockery of a serious issue like holocaust"".According to Godard it is hard to believe that life could have been beautiful for anyone in a concentration camp.Life is beautiful is divided into 3 parts:carefree life,period of hardships and a harmless game with a kid.Roberto Benigni and his wife excel in all these parts.It is the star kid Giorgio Cantarini who shines in the last part.In a way,it can be said that the film succeeds because of his innocent behavior with which he carries himself through his entire stay with his father."
brianmartialway,"Jan 24, 2013",10/10,First time i viewed this movie I saw it not understanding one word but i laughed cried and understood what was probably been said so i thought 。Well that was a few weeks ago and i have now seen it with English sub titles i was not surprised by the dialogue but more delighted my thoughts were right on track I guess that is why I was laughing and crying。 Of course nothing really compares to having the visuals and dialogue all in one 。 What a great movie this is， OK its not likely to have ever been possible to have taken place in our history as things were very different ，and thats what I love about this movie the fact that it was manufactured in someones head awesome 。Take the ride go with the flow and discover and enjoy this movie for what it is ，make your own opinion 。 My opinion is its a great movie in many aspects Iloved it，
christiansmovies,"Mar 31, 2002",10/10,"Life is Beautiful is a magnificent Motion Picture, and probably one of the best ones ever made. I don't agree with credits who say ""how could you have made a comedy about the holocaust?"" This motion picture is so amazingly crafted and assembled, that when following the story you become a part of the time. This has done more for telling the truth about the period then many other movies. It is just beautiful how that though is just a side story to the main plot, but then in the end completely throws you over and wakes you up. Roberto Benigni is amazingly funny and has managed to create an absolute masterpiece. Full rating for this one, as this is a movie too important to forget."
jep831,"May 26, 2003",N/A,"""An Italian Jew's quick wit and vivid imagination allow him to devise an elaborate plan to save his small son when the family is forced into a Nazi death camp during World War II."" This is the movie in a nutshell, and I wrote it that way precisely as a response to those viewers who apparently found the film either disrespectful or unrealistic. So that you know that I have a clue what I am talking about ... I am a seasoned journalist now writing a book about the Holocaust, and, accordingly, I have read several dozen books and seen several movies on the subject. I saw ""Life Is Beautiful"" for the first time last night on television and think it is one of the best depictions so far. No, no one will EVER make a film on this subject that is totally realistic, because moviegoers literally would be vomiting and fainting in the aisles if they witnessed ALL the horrors that the prisoners were subjected to. But, even so, some 75,000 people (out of millions) DID make it through, often due to strength of character, love for each other and an unquenchable sense of humor such as Guido had. And,therefore the film was, in a very real sense, realistic, and, so, I recommend it highly for viewers ages 15 and up."

Here, after all, is a film which portrays  concentration camps as loosely structured playgrounds, Nazis as inept buffoons, and its hero as a lovable trickster, able to come and go as he pleases. It's ""Hogan's Heroes"" with a violin ending. But let's be fair. It's not the historical inaccuracies alone which make this movie such a shining example of cinematic bull****. Credit must also be given to its shameless sentimentality, bad jokes, shoddy plot, and the flagrant narcissism of its ""creators"".And to my fellow reviewers who maintain that this is not a film about the Holocaust but rather the importance of familial love, I should like to say two things:  One, you're confusing the film's theme with its subject, and two, if Benigni didn't want to make a movie about the Holocaust then perhaps he shouldn't have SITUATED HIS STORY IN A NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP!!"
pfranklin,"Jan 20, 2002",10/10,"Obviously not everyone will find this to be a great film with a most unique perspective of the most horrendous times of the 20th century.  However Roberto Benigni did not create this film for the box office.  He told a story of about the power of the human spirit.  This work will stand by itself as one of the great film perspectives, which reveals the power of the human spirit over the evil and terror.   I'm happy to see so many people who wrote reviews here did in fact find this to be a great work of our time. I saw this film on the big screen in its first release and again on home video and cable.  It's just as powerful in all formats.  For those who love great stories this film is a must see.   This is one of those few films that actually deserve the '10' rating.  This story will make you laugh and cry at the same time.  Not too many stories can do that."
CubsandCulture,"Feb 17, 2020",10/10,"Comedies that use Nazism, WWII and/or the Holocaust as fodder exist in a surprisingly large number. Like how many times has someone made the weird pitch about it being a comedy dealing with Nazis? Apart from this-just from memory-you have JoJo Rabbit, The Great Dictator and various segments in Mel Brooks films (Brooks famously hates this film). Of the ones I have seen I think this one is the best. It somehow manages to be gut-wrenching, honest and hopeful. And funny.I think the keys to the film are two. First the opening, and closing, narration position the film as a fable; the film is meant to be taken on the subtextual or allegorical level. This smooths out the issues over taste as undermines the literalness of the narrative . Second the film, in context correct ways, isn't shy about the actual damaged and human of the Holocaust. The abject horror is mostly confined to 3 sequences-Guido's fate, the fog and the showers-but each are blunt, striking. Guido's fate especially emphasizes the statistical unlikelihood of surviving. (Weirdly, I think the film handles to aspect better than Schindler's List).Add in that the film takes the time to show certain Nazis being Nazis because of a callous indifference not merely foaming at the mouth antisemitism and there is a poignancy to the film that rarely gets put into WWII cinema.This film strikes me as polarizing given its central conceit."

emmyjane,"Jun 25, 1999",10/10,"First of all, I thought this movie was excellent.  I loved every second of it. Second, I'd like to question the reasons behind any person that believed that this movie was a disgrace and portrayed the Holocaust falsely.  This movie was not about the Holocaust.  This movie showed what can happen when a person makes the best out of a terrible situation.  Any person who thought Life Is Beautiful was a misrepresentation of the Holocaust better rethink the whole point of the wonderful movie."
dimitrisalomao,"Mar 17, 2010",9/10,"""Life Is Beautiful"" is not a holocaust movie, although it has some striking scenes that show the precariousness of the camps, it's a movie about how far a person would go to save his own son.The first half of the movie looks like it's made by Chaplin, it's incredibly funny, and shows how brainy the main character is (Watching his plans to ""surprisingly"" meet Dora are priceless). And it's also a love story, and not a bad one. It's hard to find directors that are competent in doing comedy and drama very well, usually they make a good drama, but not so good comedy, or the contrary, but Benigni deserves to be compared to Chaplin in this one, he made me laugh and cry, and there was almost no break between these two emotions.The second half is more about the father/son relationship. What that man went through to protect his son is one of the most beautiful stories i've ever seeing. But all those sad moments merged between funny ones. Benigni's performance is amazingly funny and moving, but what really surprised me about the acting was Giorgio Cantarini as Giosué, I'm not saying he was better than Benigni, but for a kid to make such a big difference in the cast of a movie is rare to see.Verdict: Funny and moving, this is a masterpiece as good , if not better, than Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator""."
Cath-10,"Nov 10, 1998",N/A,"Would ""Life is beautiful"" have had so good reviews, had there not been part of the movie about the holocaust ? I really doubt it. This movie is only a dull comedy that lacks brilliance and is based on rather silly gags. It is also flatly shot. But the real bad part on that movie is that by showing the concentration camnps as it does, it lets the audience think that the Holocaust was not so terrible after all. Begnini shows the concentration camp as if it was the Warsaw ghetto : people are working hard and some die in the process, but the very idea that there were some gas chambers working in order to annihilate millions of people is hardly evoked. The very fact that the little Giuseppe survives with so little trouble is hardly acceptable when one knows how mercilessly children were exterminated. Of course, some passages of the movie are full of emotion, but they are only minutes in a two-hour movie for which Begnini lacks the necessary tact to use such a subject. If I do believe that his intentions were pure and noble when he shot this movie, I hardly appreciate the intense marketing surrounding it. It does lack respect towards such a grave and important matter."
marklv,"Mar 2, 2007",6/10,"I am not one of those who believes this film is great. Good in parts, but certainly not great. What I don't understand is what this film really is supposed to be - is it a comedy or a drama? Or both? Or maybe a children's film? The humour is childish, sentimental and old fashioned, which gives it an odd charm, while we never hear a rude word or see any blood or violence - this is in the middle of WW2! After watching the film in full I felt that this was like a Disney movie from the 1950s or 60s: charming, mildly entertaining, but always shallow. It also implied a long disproved myth that the victims of the holocaust were turned into soap."
GoatPoda,"Feb 2, 1999",1/10,"Life is beautiful, but man is not. I felt strange as I left the theater for this movie, I was impressed by the imagination that poignantly proved that love and the human spirit could conquer all, even during the worst of times. The trouble was that the worst of times was the Holocaust in an Italian concentration camp, and I kept thinking - this is terrible! As time goes on and the Holocaust becomes a thing of history, and as less survivors are alive to remember the travesty that mankind let occur, Benigni is being praised for making a film that DOES trivialize some very serious subject matter. History that is only half a century old. I think the film itself is a noble and creative effort, much like the characters in the film, but the cartoonish depiction of genocide and desperation did not sit well with me. The audience I was with laughed and cried on cue. They were manipulated. Just like the Nazi's were manipulated in Germany. I'm sure Benigni's intentions were noble, but noble intentions don't merit unconditional praise and Academy Awards. Maybe we should feel good for the child that was saved form the horror of his situation, and then maybe we should pity him for his ignorance. I'm not so sure, but I'm not laughing and crying on cue. I didn't hate this film, but I don't understand how one could love it."

mirfaizal,"Feb 14, 2010",9/10,"""Life is Beautiful"" is an unforgettable film. Basically it depicts wherever or whenever in every situation if you are damn bad,you need to enjoy life. It prescribed how much he loved his wife and kid. I love this movie very much. I am sure it is gonna change your life. Thanks a lot to the director Roberto Benigni. I am sure this movie will be loved by all. Roberto Benigni's Life is beautiful (La vita è bella) is a modern fairy tale, as touching and as relevant as the tales collected by the Brothers Grimm to entertain, enchant and ,yes, to scare children over 150 years ago.Thanks Faizal"

It's so wonderful, and touching, and funny, and romantic, and poignant, and sad, and triumphant. What an achievement.

Bravo, Roberto!-EE-"
amol_gh,"Feb 17, 2002",10/10,"On the Valentine Day I had decided firmly to watch this movie and I realized that nothing could prepare me for what I was about to experience even though I knew beforehand that this Roberto Benigni's magnificent creation which was held high by the critics was nominated for the Best Picture along with the much expected and truly great Saving Private Ryan.(The fact that neither of them won as the Best Picture is as disappointing as the fact that Denzel Washington didn't win the Best Leading Actor at the 72nd Academy Awards.Also Raging Bull should have undoubtedly won at 53rd Academy Awards as the Best Picture along with the Best Director.But then this are my PERSONAL opinions and are hinted at NO ONE in particular.) As far this movie is concerned Roberto Benigni has done a great job as the director and as well as an actor. This is the movie where we find out that under circumstance of crisis an ordinary being like Orifice can get transformed into a Godly being in order to protect his loved ones.(Here, the wife and the son.) Its in this movie that one learns the importance of will power.(Remember the 'hat-exchange' scene? Or the 'dog near the box' scene? Or the scene in which a real,true tank arrives which the son considers to be his first prize?) This is the movie where one learns that its us who should be in control of our emotions and not vice versa.(Remember the scene where Orifice is carried away for execution? Watch his facial expressions and the way he walks in order to mask his sadness and fear in front of his son.) Its in this movie that one learns the great principle of OPTIMISM.(Remember all the scenes where Orifice keeps telling his son that they are playing a game where they have to score bonus marks and if he expresses even his desire for food(hunger) there will be substraction of marks?They were actually suffering extreme conditions in the concentration camp for being a Jew.) Even though I usually don't prefer to give ranks to my Personal choice of 25 Movies of All Time, this is an exception and this movie gets the Rank One. Even ahead of Crimson Tide(1995),Terminator 2:Judgment Day(1991),Se7en(1995), Kramer Vs Kramer(1979)and Usual Suspects,The(1995).Truly the Best.(had won the golden statuette for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards)"
grossmusic,"Dec 9, 2007",10/10,"I now must put this at the top of my all-time favorites. It is haunting me. I missed the first minutes, stumbling upon it in the wee hours during an insomniac induced channel surf. It was not subtitled - rather it was very well dubbed (by the original actors I believe). After watching it, with out-loud laughter and crying to lull me to sleep, I dreamt about the lead character & his good humor spirit, imagining that I was somehow wrapped up in a life that called upon such great human dignity.We cry and laugh at a lot of films. We dream about them. We invite them stay in our memories for decades. But only a few impact our spirit so profoundly, leaving us wanting to improve our own lives so that we can have a measure of the quality of character we have witnessed - experienced.Rob Roy (honor), Braveheart (freedom), and now LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (joy) are the most impacting movies ever made."
robertoarg,"Jul 19, 2009",9/10,"For me, the movie is divided in two parts, the first is a little silly (when R. Begnini meets Dora), some non - sense situations, but since he and Dora have a son, what happens next it's really really good, it's impossible not involving with the plot since that moment. The performance of the R.Begnini and the child can't be better. Dora is great too, except for the situation of the car when R.Begnini surprises her in her boyfriend's car, her expression is very poor, except for that, her performance is excellent. The character of R. Begnini is a smart man who does everything for the people he loves. If the first part were shorter (20 minutes less), it would be a 10/10 for me."
snoopy-23,"Feb 10, 1999",N/A,"I hated this film for so many reasons I do not really know where to begin. I am sick reading reviews that claim Roberto Benigni as the new Chaplin. Chaplin this man is not. Slapstick is a bit like ballet, it is either really good or painfully bad, and this movie was painfully bad. I am not a snob when it comes to humor but some of the scenes were so ridiculously mediocre and rigid that it took me all my patience not to vomit (as a previous reviewer claimed to accomplish after watching Schindlers list).Furthermore, I am sick of people saying...""well it was just the portrayal of the Holocaust as a child would have seen it"". What nonsense. Why would a child see the horrors and mindless brutality of a concentration camp any differently than an adult? The reality was that women and children were immediately separated from the men and often marched straight to the gas chamber. To suggest that someone could just hide a child under their bed for the duration of the war is ludicrous. The character Guido was able to strut around the camp like he was on some kind of a vacation, mocking his German guards as you would an incompetent schoolteacher. The German guards were portrayed as the proverbial straight guys and the butt of a joke that I could never fathom.Maybe I am missing something here but anyone who left this film with a warm fuzzy feeling is profoundly ignorant. I do not agree with the many reviews that say ""if you want the real story watch Shindlers list"" or ""this is a fine example of the spirit of man in the face of adversity"". This is an example of nothing more than a poorly constructed comic farce that uses the Holocaust as a backdrop. The Holocaust was about the brutal mass subjugation and extermination of six million people. It should never be portrayed as anything less, and in this film it was.  The Holocaust should never be used as a comic platform for a father and son bonding farce."
SamLowry-2,"Mar 17, 1999",6/10,"I can't figure out the fascination with this highly overrated film. The first hour is delightful, then we are asked to believe some quite outlandish behavior in the concentration camps. Would ""Guido"" really risk his life to play a song on the PA system? It doesn't make sense to take this risk, in light of his efforts to save his son (which also fall short of believability.) I often am able to suspend my logic in favor of a romantic choice by a character. It is, after all, the movies. But is doesn't even work on that level, since so much time is dedicated to his single vision: save the boy from death or reality! There is no fear of the camp or even death in the film. So, Benigni's character's actions don't have a base in reality. Thus, we cannot feel compassion for the moment, even if we understand that we should feel it. It's the fault of the script and the director, who don't recognize that most of the audience would like the lead to be BOTH smart and charming, to be BOTH brave and funny, to be BOTH egocentric and understanding of others. Benigni's character comes off as a silly goof who doesn't see the poignancy of his own dilemma...so the movie-goer may miss it as well."
rx_biller,"Aug 20, 2020",10/10,"It is a depurated work of direction, production and acting, and it shows that Roberto Benigni, influenced by master directors like Vittorio de Sica, recreated a beautiful story, with an intense message and an extraordinary life lesson. It is imperative to mention Benigni's wife Nicoletta Braschi's acting, for it also resemblance a clear influence of master actresses like Giulietta Masina, and proving that words are not always necessary to captivate the audience, and deliver the intention of the director to touch hearts and change life."
juancho-2,"Mar 14, 1999",10/10,"La vita è bella is the cinema masterwork of the nineties.  Beautifully scored, photographed, directed and acted, it manages to make you laugh without being ridiculous, it manages to make you cry without being corn.  It is so perfectly balanced, it does not indulge in any excesses.  It shows us at the same time the monstrosity and sweetness of man without having to fall in details we have seen a hundred times.  It deals with extremes, yet it is both subtle and true; that is where its magic lies, and that is what this movie is: pure magic. Roberto Benigni will forever be remembered for this magical moment in time."

I wasn't prepared for dubbing or the era of the movie.I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I came around to appreciate the storyline. Here was a man intent on maintaining his optimism, love of life and appreciation of all the good things he was surrounded by.The holocaust story was inevitable, as you saw the inference towards the Jews, but it was so secondary to the eternal quest for this man to keep his wife and child happy, safe a reassured in circumstances I could never imagine.It truly was a lovely, positive, wonderful story, and I would never imagine saying that about any film involving the Holocaust. Forgive my happy review amongst the terror of what occurred. The director, actors and all involved did an excellent job. Congratulations to you all, and thank you."

Col-3,"Nov 20, 1999",7/10,"I think I must be in the very small majority of people that neither loved nor hated this movie. In many ways it was skillfully made and well acted. However, the first half of the movie felt like a wacky romantic comedy with an Italian slant. The second half of the movie, however, is set in (of all places) a Nazi death camp. I happen to believe that if you're going to set a movie in the midst of one of the most terrible parts of history, you want to have something say and to do it very carefully. This movie fails in this, I feel. The message of the movie is very trite: ""The human spirit can triumph over any adversity"" might be a good summary. Rather than being uplifting, though, I found the implausible caperings of Guido and the credulity of his son to be ghoulish and disturbing in a way I doubt was intended by the filmmakers. I'm afraid I can't go along with the premise that the horror of Auschwitz could be covered up with some clever lies and a silly walk.However, I must stress that the movie is artfully made and contains some memorable scenes. The mountain of corpses in the mist was almost as creepy as Guido's final conversation with his friend, the good Doktor Lessing.La Vite e Bella is certainly worth a look; it is, however, neither profound nor historically valuable."
lspaiser,"Feb 11, 2010",2/10,"In spite of its ""message"" about the human spirit I did not feel this movie worked. I'm sorry to rebuff those who thought it was great including my favorite movie critic but I don't think the ""message"" in a movie make it rise above its trappings. If it doesn't look real to me it fails as a movie no matter how lofty it's message.I didn't like it and here is why: This movie tries to be a lot of things it is not. At first it felt like Fellini – crazy Italians! But it is not.Then it tries to be Phillie de Broca in ""King of Hearts."" But it is not.And don't forget ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin."" which is about Italians during the war but takes place in Greece and is apparently a true story.High ratings for all of the above – but alas not ""Life is Beautiful."" It's a sad story but the whole thing feels like a stage set which it is. Especially the prison camp which is too small and clean to be what it represents.If you want to see a dark comedy about Nazis watch ""King of Hearts"" again. At least it is funny.Or, if you want to get the message watch ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin."" After all, this is not a stage play; it is cinema, in a world where ""Avatar"" will win Academy Awards this year.This movie also has all the hallmarks of a soap opera.Who dies and who lives and why ""and guess who shows up at the end"" is one for the classic soaps."

Artimidor,"Feb 28, 2012",10/10,"Question: Is there any conceivable way at all to combine the holocaust with comedy and get laughs out of it? Well, not really I'd say, not without completely sacrificing the unspeakable horrors the concept of organized mass murder stands for. One shouldn't even try. If you look closer at Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" you will see that such an attempt isn't actually made either in this film. It's not about ridiculing Nazis, confronting them with their own absurdities or pretend to go along with their ideas to make the underlying idiocy apparent. This is just a means. Rather the film creates a parallel, carefree world alongside the horrific reality of the Nazis, which is upheld by the central character Guido (played by Benigni himself), a clown at heart. All this in order to keep up the illusion of a perfect world for his son Giosué in the face of impending doom. ""Ah, the train ride was no good,"" the father admits to his son when they arrive at the concentration camp. ""When we go back we take the bus. I'll tell them!"" And when young Giosué wants to quit what Guido has convinced him to be just a game, his father is the first one to head out: ""We're in the lead now, but well, we won't get the big prize then. Too bad."" And suddenly Giosué reconsiders.Roberto Benigni undoubtedly is a brilliant comedian. He's unforgettable e.g. in Jim Jarmusch's ""Night on Earth"" as a crazy cab driver to name just one example, but unfortunately his talent is often wasted in various light comedies. Great opportunities arise rarely for comedians, but Benigni grabbed this one and put all his heart into it, as director and actor. Contrasting his slapstick humor with the stark, painful reality of the Nazi's final solution to the Jew problem is daring, risky and extremely difficult to pull off. Thanks, Roberto Benigni, for giving the impossible a try. Highest recommendations!"
Billie Holiday,"May 3, 2002",10/10,"This is such a wonderful movie! One of my favorites! The love story between Guido and Dora is so much different from all what have been done before and this terrible war is so well related. But what I like the most is the story of Giosué (Cantarini is perfect in that role!)who is stuck in this worldwide event, too big for a little boy, and his father who explains it like a big game....it's amazing! Just one thing to say: Benigni is a genius!"

(Your wife will almost certainly understand.) Rarely if ever has a film poured out such bittersweet poignancy, such depth of emotion, such an ability to pull at the heartstrings.Utterly enchanting, Life Is Beautiful captures the triumph of one man's will over disaster. It is by turns comic, by turns tragic, with a resilience which inspires faith in humankind.Foreign films are, of course, normally rubbish. But this one bucks the trend in such spectacular fashion as to reclassify the genre."

meccano,"Apr 30, 2004",N/A,"General views of film expressed herein.  No specific plot points are discussed.I respect that Mr. Benigni got his film made the way that he wanted.  A true auteur piece in having secured financing for this film that he wrote, directed and stared in.  Of course, that doesn't make it a good film. Frankly, I have little respect for LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and all the attention that it received. The only entertaining thing to come out of this film for me was Ray Romano (I think) on SNL doing a take off of Roberto Benigni at the Academy Awards.  I think that he accurately portrayed him as the annoying starved for attention court jester that he is.If I were Nicoletta Braschi's Dora in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL I would have had Roberto Benigni's Guido arrested and a restraining order placed against him early on in the story.  His character goes on the top of my list of bothersome people portraying even more irritating characters. It is mind-boggling that American audiences embraced this actor that they had so clearly rejected five years prior in THE SON OF THE PINK PANTHER that featured Benigni as the same yuck-it-up persona (albeit with a French accent).A great Italian film with a lovable child character (that also plays very well to American audiences) is CINEMA PARADISIO.  SCHELIEDLER'S LIST is a ""wholly unforgettable"" movie about the ""triumph of the human spirit in the wake of the Holocaust.""  A real life story of a war torn family is the incredible and ironic EUROPA, EUROPA (HITLERJUNGE SALOMON).  It's the story of a Jewish boy separated from his family and taken in by Germans only to become a Nazi youth.  Comedy is clearly an element that CAN be included in stories of human drama; the 1962 Czech film THE SHOP ON MAIN STREET (OBCHOD NA KORZE) is a thoughtful film that succeeds in every way that Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL fails.  LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is along the lines of TV's Hogan's Heroes but much less entertaining.If you ever had any doubts about what went on in Nazi Concentration Camps, the French documentary NIGHT AND FOG (NUIT ET BROUILLARD) will shock you back to reality. The images of dead humans stockpiled and bulldozed into a ditches should give you something to think about after you get past the sight of human skin hides being used for Nazi lampshades.  Whoever said reality is much scary than fiction wasn't kidding. This infamous film from 1955 shot on the site of Auschwitz is only 30 minutes long, but it is the LONGEST half hour of film you will ever see.  Those who want to rewrite or white wash Holocaust history are clearly deluded in the face of reality.While the financial success of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL did NOT spawn a rush a Holocaust inspired comedies, there was at least one film that must have been helped by its success.  JAKOB THE LIAR is a Robin Williams vanity piece; an Americanized remake of the Academy Award nominated East German film and well regarded book of the same title.  It is a film that ultimately fails in the same way LIFE does with the caveat that Williams' performance is surprisingly restrained.The success of LIFE did get Benigni the backing he needed to make his next tour de force, a live action version of PINOCCHIO. The film turned out to be Italy's most expensive film ever made but was a major flop in the US.  Benigni's popularity has, for the most part, since faded out of the American consciousness."
moritzes,"Jan 30, 2000",1/10,"A nasty little bit of Holocaust revisionism, one wonders whether anyone who liked this film actually thought about it.  Sure, Benigni is winsomely charming, but what is he trying to say here?  That the concentration camps were not so bad, or at least survivable if one kept one's head or tried a little humor?  The film trivializes the deaths of 6 million, while letting everyone else breath a little easier for not having to face, even at the big screen's remove, the completely dehumanizing horror that was Hitler's death machine.  If you think ""Life is Beautiful"" is sweet or uplifting, I invite you to watch ""The Last Days,"" the Spielberg-produced documentary of Holocaust survivors, or even to see ""Schindler's List"" again.  There was nothing sweet about it."

bedazzle,"Jun 28, 2002",10/10,"The first time I saw this movie I didn't remember the references to Schopenhauer, but now I've read said philosopher and was thinking about the point in using him in this movie. At first it seems like a mistake. After all, Schopenhauer is of the major philosophers, the most pessimistic. So it's strange to have him portrayed positively in such an optimistic movie. I think the movie is reinterpreting his philosophy from an optimistic perspective. Reinterpretation is a strong part of all classic works. For example, Virginia Woolfe has a crazy man interpret Shakespeare as being a misanthrope in 'Mrs. Dalloway.' Basically, Schopenhauer says that humans are conditioned by evolution to choose life over everything horrible that could happen, and that we have no choice but to obey. 'Life is Beautiful' takes this reality to be a positive. Really, it's an affirmation of the inherent goodness of life. So I think the Schopenhauer references work perfectly here."
Seneschal118,"Jan 30, 2008",10/10,"First of all, a brief summary of the film(without spoiling the plot): Roberto Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish man who moves to Arezzo with his brother. With the help of his humour, some daring and quite a lot of luck, he wins over a Nicoletta Braschi's character, a schoolteacher. Five years later, he and his son are taken to a concentration camp, but his wife successfully manages to persuade the Nazis to let her in too.La Vita è Bella is on of those rare films that has the quality to make you laugh and to make you cry within its two hour runtime. Its starts as a romantic comedy(with some very funny gags) but ends as a wartime drama; a fact that may send viewers into confusion, but ,personally, I enjoyed it. The fact that it is in Italian didn't put me off at all.The calibre of the acting is superb, particularly that of Roberto Benigni in the lead role and that of the young child actor, Giorgio Cantarini.The music compliments the bittersweet tone of the film excellently, as does the contrasting vibrant cinematography at the start and then the dull grey concentration camp at the end.Overall, a stunning performance from Benigni not just as an actor but as a director and scriptwriter as well. I think that he thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar, and was unlucky to lose in the best director and best script categories. I have not seen Shakespeare in Love, the film which La Vita è Bella lost to in the best picture category, but judging by the standard of this film, I'm not sure whether it deserved it or not.Having looked at some of the other reviews for this film, I have been shocked to see that many people don't even like it. For those who say it is not a true depiction of the nazi camp, then I say that they are right but this is not meant to be a film just about the harshness of the holocaust, but a film primarily about Roberto Benigni's relationship with his son. The humour I leave up to you, but I personally found it very enjoyable."

Martin_G,"Oct 30, 1998",N/A,"This is the best film I have seen in a long time. Don't be put off by anything you have heard, or because you think ""it's impossible to laugh at the Holocaust""... This film asserts the power of love, life, and humour in the face of unimaginable adversity. It's *not* a realistic film, but it's a real tragedy - narrated in comic mode. It's gentle, amusing, and touching. Folk were weeping at the end, and I nearly was myself. I went unwillingly to see it (because I *hated* Benigni's The Monster), but I'll see it again soon."

jack_onthenet,"Jul 20, 2004",1/10,"I don't see any point in this film. Life IS beautiful, but in this film it's no life nor beautiful, just a boring slapstick.Simply the idea of putting comedy and holocaust together doesn't mean they are put together. Everything in this film is far-fetched and overdone, even without novelty. The scene the protagonist broadcasts to his wife in concentration camp -- It's a crude fake out of the real beautiful scene from The Shawshank Redemption (1994).And this guy, Roberto Benigni, this guy is a clown without a spirit. I've seen several movies he made, each and every one sucks. Somebody says he is ""Italian Chaplin"". Sorry, he's no par with Chaplin in an way. A clown with a spirit is with a crown, a clown without a spirit is just a clown."

My opinion that film is one the best structured film,it looks like a fantasy film but every scene have a meaning and purpose throughtout the events that's why we can not think it is kind of fantasy film. The flow of the movie was never stop and i can not escape from screen."
amraampk,"Jun 5, 2009",10/10,"I consider this is perhaps the best movie in any foreign language i have seen yet. Its plot is so gripping and inspiring you wont believe till the end. The performance by Italian actor Roberto benggini was so superb. The whole film is full of humorous jokes and moves. In reality he was trying to just try to divert the attention of his loved ones from the cruelties , desperation and sadness of life. The most impressive is the way he be fools his son that when they are caught in the web of Holocaust administered by Nazi Germans , he tells him and other folks that this is just a game , the won who scores most points in it will emerge as victorious and the prize is brand new tank. I loved the way really never let his son know what is going on in his surrounding and saves him from the pain , sadness and disappointment about the future. I think such films can motivate us very much about the way of living our lives. I recommend it highly to watch. If you are not moved by watching it then i am quite sorry about you but it will one day impress you one day if you watch it again at least. Master piece for ever."
Inches_72,"Dec 16, 2003",9/10,"While some may complain that Life is Beautiful does not portray death camps in the appropriate level of detail or realism, the simple fact is: Life is Beautiful is not intending to be a faultlessly accurate portrayal of concentration camps in World War II Germany. It could also be pointed out that very few (if not none) contemporary movies can even come close to fully portraying the horrors endured by Jewish, Polish, and Gypsy people in such camps.That said, the film itself needs to be addressed. Life is Beautiful follows one idealistic and offbeat Jewish man's life, love, and experiences when the Germans take he and his family. The central plotline is this man (played sensitively by Roberto Beninini, who also wrote and directed the movie) trying to keep his son alive and sane in the camp. In this way, the film sometimes reminded me of Hogan's Heroes, with a Jewish man in place of the American soldiers- with the Nazis being the butt of jokes and generally being outsmarted by Bennini.But to say this piece is a fairy tale or a comedy far from the truth, while it is true that the movie never really approaches the real horror of a concentration camp- that is not to say that it is a happy movie. It is feel good, I'll give it that, but you will cry during the movie. Perhaps it is the fairytale quality that makes such loss all the more powerful, and when you consider a lot of this movie is focused around a confused and naive child, it is actually powerfully done. By 'glossing over' the horrors (as a child undoubtedly could), the inevitability of loss is made so much more painful.This movie was, and still is, one of the finest movies I've had the pleasure of watching. The subtitles are a minor issue, but easily overlooked. Simply put, Life is Beautiful is one of the few emotionally driven movies to be acknowledged as real cinema in recent years.See if you liked: Big Fish, The Devil's Arithmetic, The Green Mile. Strengths: Has the viewer's emotions on a string, excellent music. Weaknesses: Lacks realism and subtitles can be distracting,"
franco-10,"Apr 23, 1999",10/10,"This is a film of contrasts, making it very easy to see just how dark the darkness can be.  The attempt by a death camp inmate to paint his family's incarceration brightly for his son to protect him from the darkness, serves to emphasize by contrast just how horrible these events really were.I felt even greater aversion and disgust for the depth of the horrors of WWII from this movie than I did from ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". And yet, I found my self laughing at Begnini's translation of the threats and rules of the Nazi camp guard into a sugar-coated tale that his son could believe in. I had discovered the breadth Benigni's comic genius from watching ""Johnny Stecchino"", and now believe that his potential for dramatic work is just as vast."
arpitjawa,"Aug 14, 2009",9/10,"I just can't get this amazing film out of my thoughts and have decided to write this brief review in the hope that I can move on...""Life is Beautiful"" is an unforgettable film. Absolutely unforgettable. This was the 1st film whose DVD screening on my laptop got a standing ovation. I still remember being so overwhelmed, that by the time it ended I was crying. Not sobbing. but crying. It's amazing how this piece of fiction could so meaningfully influence my thoughts & emotions. The story, although totally implausible, is uplifting and depressing at the same time. Please see it for yourself & have a box of tissues handy. I can go on forever describing the inherent beauty of this movie, but will never be able to capture all of it in writing. I simply can't recommend it enough. Roberto Benigni's masterpiece is a true classic. No wonder it's a top contender for the best film I've ever seen."
Sparrowmaniac,"May 12, 2005",9/10,"One of the amazing movies that I've seen in a long time.....Everyone recommended this movie to me, but I was pessimistic... But after watching the movie, I have to say that it is truly a masterpiece.... It doesn't show the effects of the holocausts or the brutal torture suffered by the Jews, although there are brief references about it, but the most marvelous thing about it is the fact that the entire thing is brought about in a beautiful manner with full of laughs.... The beauty of the script and screenplay, makes it amazing.... It portrays, the importance of family ties, and the love of a father for a son... The love which ultimately leads to sacrificing his own life for the welfare of his wife and son...."
acetylcholinenjoyer,"Sep 14, 2010",10/10,"""Life is Beautiful"" is one of the best movies ever made: It is so emotional, deep and powerful, that is hard to not love this film.Roberto Beningni makes here the best performance of his entire career, the movie balances very well the comedy, the drama and the romance with very convincing performances and a great script.I do'n't think this movie is overrated, in fact, I think that it is completely underrated, it was easily much better than that overrated and boring mess called ""Titanic"", which was a pretty bad film, that didn't deserve to win the Academy Award for best movie (Okay, I have to admit that I loved ""Avatar"", but that was a much better film, also it didn't have the annoying Kate Winslet) This movie was wonderful, it deserves more appreciation and recognition."
Doylenf,"Dec 1, 2006",8/10,"If someone had told me that a genuinely moving story of a Jewish father and son who end up in a German concentration camp could manage to sustain such an artful blend of humor and tragedy, I wouldn't believe them. Then again, think of the popular success Americans have seen on TV in the shape of the enormously successful comedy HOGAN'S HEROES which takes place in a prison camp. Or the bittersweet irony of Billy Wilder's STALAG 17 with its blend of comedy and drama.But what ROBERTO BENIGNI has accomplished here surpasses all expectations on just how extraordinary this sort of material can be when executed with such wit, wisdom and humor and--even more importantly--without offending anyone with such controversial subject matter.The first part of the film is full of abundant humor as it chronicles the romance of the Jewish man and his sweetheart. Midway the tone of the film shifts to a darker element as the man, his wife and the young son are placed in a concentration camp. The husband is so determined that his son will be shielded from the stark realities around them that he pretends it's all a game. Benigni is a man of such irrepressible spirit that it makes the film's ending even more poignant.He deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar in '97 and the film itself was voted Best Foreign Film. The delightful score by Nicola Piovani won still another Oscar.Summing up: A fable, delightfully written and produced with an unforgettable performance by Roberto Benigni. Who can forget his joy on Oscar night when he bounded over the tops of seats to reach the stage and accept his Oscar?"
Dockelektro,"Mar 26, 2003",7/10,"In spite of having taken the world by storm with this tale of a father who tries to hide the horrors of the holocaust to his son, there is a serious flaw that affects the tone and the overall sensation of the movie to more demanding viewers: after all, is this movie a comedy or a drama? Because Benigni doesn't seem to grasp an overall tone and the structure ends up being erratic, with some great laughs and some serious dramatic moments, and some moments in between that don't allow the viewer to know if they will laugh or not. But don't let my review cast a shadow over this movie, since its idea is genius, and one of those projects only Roberto Benigni would grasp."
Pro Jury,"Sep 20, 2003",1/10,"It is difficult to watch this problem-ridden film.  The lead actor often mouths the dialog of the kid as the little kid speaks his lines.  Whenever the two speak with each other face to face, the man is mouthing the words as the little kid speaks.As the German officer and waiter attempt to secretly speak with each other in crowded rooms, their body language and darting over-the-shoulder glances REEK of guilty activity.  A flashing neon sign over two 6-year-olds as they try to steel mom's cookies as she is at the nearby stove stirring the soup. Come on, with a room full of high functioning adults, EVERYONE would notice their dumb behavior.The first half of the film contains little more than over-acted clowning. In the second half, nothing plays true.  What this movie needed was some self-aware sarcasm, some winking sign of intelligence.The camera work is all right.  However, the background music used seemed lifted from carnival rides."
weatherwatch,"Apr 23, 2003",9/10,"Contains some detailed informationRoberto Benigni definitely grabs attention in the late 1990s Italian film, `La Vita è bella,' known in English as `Life is Beautiful.'  In addition to directing and writing, Benigni is the main star of the film.The film can be said to be composed of two main parts-the first is pure comedy to the point of absurdity, and the second is dead serious with a touch of comedy.  At first, the comedy that Benigni uses seems as if he is trying to showcase his own talents.  But the comedy is put to good use during the second half of the film as Benigni, who plays Guido Orefice, must use comedy and imagination to protect his son, Joshua, from the horrors of being confined in a Nazi concentration camp.  The two parts of the film also highlight two different time periods-the first part takes place in the 1930s, while the second part occurs around 1945. Although hints of anti-Jewish sentiment appear in the first part of the film, the majority of the first part is focused on living life in a spontaneous way.  For example, at the very beginning of the film, Guido finds himself in a car without breaks, flying through the countryside until the car goes off the side of the road near a small farm.  While at the farm, a lady falls out of the barn on top of him, to which he replies, `What kind of place is this? It's beautiful: Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky! I'm moving here!'  During the rest of the first half of the movie, Guido keeps running into `Principessa,' the name he gives Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). Many of the `unexpected' meetings between the two are planned by Guido. Some film critics love `Life is Beautiful' while others are disappointed or even offended by the film.  Roger Ebert is a good example of a critic who enjoyed the film: '`Life Is Beautiful' is not about Nazis and Fascists, but about the human spirit.  It is about rescuing whatever is good and hopeful from the wreckage of dreams.  About hope for the future.  About the necessary human conviction, or delusion, that things will be better for our children than they are right now.'  I give this movie a 9 out of 10."
Fifidou,"Dec 18, 2004",10/10,"It's something rather difficult, that can offend the jews if it is not done with enough tact. In this case, this is perfect : All the situations are so sweet and Roberto Begnini and Nicoletta Braschi make us feeling both the joy and the pain of the characters that this becomes one of the best movie ever. This movie is a profoundly humane story, because this is the simple story of a man, who fall in love of woman who is engaged, and then succeeds, and when the bad times comes, uses all his courage to protect his child from the reality of a concentration camp. In this movie, I find the character of the doctor very interesting : He's a man who loves riddles and in his job sends people to the chamber gas, and I love the way Begnini draws his personality."
totospot,"Jul 27, 2003",10/10,This is such a great movie. It was well put together and the actors/actresses are wonderful especially Nicoletta Braschi. It took a lot of guts to make a comedy movie on the holocaust but this definitely worked and it was done very tastefully. I watch it often and try to get others to watch it too.
kiki-13,"Jul 5, 2003",8/10,"I thought the film was wonderful, although at times it was difficult to sit through.  I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry.  Most  of the times I cringed.  Most people were offended by the film's approach to the holocaust. Now that we look back on that time...... it is understandable that we are horrified.   But, how did the people really cope at that time?  How did they make it through day in and  day out. I think that the film vividly shows us the spirit of the human soul. And yes, at times it is our imagination, which includes humor that helps us make it through."
pfeinman,"Aug 21, 2003",10/10,"The most bittersweet of all movies. You wished that Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami had written it so that he would have overcome the German and killed him instead of being slain. But life is not that way. And why didn't he solve that final riddle for Dr. Lessing (Horst Buchholz). That would have been a fitting alternative for salvation through the good doctor.All in all a touching story done with great style and humor. The acting being superb by all in the cast. Still waiting for Benigni to find himself. Giorgio Cantarini as Joshua was unbelievably effective.""Pinocchio"" certainly was not a fitting followup."

This is the reason that I love this movie and furthermore it is the reason this is my favorite movie that I have ever seen.

petarmatic,"Mar 16, 2015",7/10,"I had fun watching this film, but I was not so extraordinarily impressed as other people did about the whole project. I guess because Holocaust is so overly done that even a cute comedy/tragedy can look same as the other films made about the subject.Yes, acting is excellent, and the plot is interestingly imagined, that it really makes it very interesting to watch, but I simply was not so impressed as other people were.I recommend that you watch this film if you did not already, I guess in 1999/2000 everybody had to, it was that type of film and year.We will remember as Mr. Benini was jumping all over the chairs as he made his way to receive his Oscar."
gurghi-2,"Jul 3, 2000",4/10,"(SPOILERS ahead!)""It's not supposed to be realistic! We already know how horrible the Holocaust was.""The above is a direct quote from another user comment. I beg to differ (what, so now we're going to show how hilarious and heartwarming it is?). No movie, or the sum of every documentary, reel of footage, essay, book, novel, etc. could possibly convey the horror of the Holocaust.The first half was moderately amusing, but I was moved neither to laughter or tears by any moment (and in retrospect the first half seems to have been calculated to engender goodwill for the second) in the film. I wanted to be affected by it, and fully expected to appreciate it, in no small part because it came highly recommended to me by a very good friend whose taste usually coincides with mine. But I cannot chalk this film up as a mere disappointment.The dramatist who attempts to muck around with the details of the Holocaust fights a particularly uphill battle, given how acquainted we are with it and its magnitude both in numbers and scope. That said, I have no qualms with dramatic license, provided that it is employed consciously and conscientiously. But ""Life Is Beautiful"" is not only unsuccessful but willfully negligent in these respects. (For starters, during WWII Italian Jews remained in Italy...)Factual errors could be ignored had the film been set in a more surreal or fanciful context, but it isn't; details are handled in a slipshod fashion when they're handled at all. And so I couldn't ignore my incredulity at the 'hiding' of the child, that not a single inmate spoke German, etc. ad nauseam.Many times have I heard the protest ""I could never watch 'Schindler's List', I couldn't bear it."" And I respect that. But in the next breath, the same person will often be heard singing the praises of this movie, and that to me is disturbing. The portrayal of the camp conditions alone amounts to a sugarcoating of the Holocaust, making it easier for the viewer to watch; perhaps it SHOULD be difficult, don't you think?But not in Benigni's version- his character even dies off-screen. By pulling its punches, the film is neither as sad nor as funny as it wants to be.The 'hope' offered up in ""Life Is Beautiful"" is really just of the standard Hollywood variety, will and imagination triumphing despite the most dire of circumstances. I don't have a problem with such sentiment, I just want a movie to *earn* it, and like so many popcorn pictures, ""Life Is Beautiful"" doesn't succeed, despite its unlikely setting. My suspicion is that if the film had originated in Tinseltown, critics would not have been so kind and audiences not nearly so enraptured. You gotta hand it to Benigni, the conceit of the movie is a great ploy and he's got some chutzpah for even attempting it.Could redemption be found in the midst of such atrocities and suffering? I believe so, but the kind suggested in ""Life Is Beautiful"" is false and fleeting, evaporating as soon as the kid stops fawning over the tank and wonders ""Where's dad?"" (Some have proposed that this makes the film an absurdist masterpiece, but any irony is far from intended- hence the bland, affirming title, the smiling faces on the posters, and the sunny first half.) A father's sacrificial love makes for a more-than-worthy premise for a film, but it is taken to shallow lengths here.Perhaps this wouldn't be so damaging if Benigni had not decided to co-opt for his movie what is arguably the most despicable and well-documented event in human history. The examination and implications of an event like the Holocaust should never cease, but I don't hold out much hope for our ability to avoid more like it, not if ""Life Is Beautiful"" and the overall reaction to it is indicative of our ability to prevent such monstrosities just by force of historical memory. How quickly we forget.(There were two things about the movie I liked: the transition in the greenhouse, and the relationship between Guido and his hoped-for, riddling savior.)I am impressed by Mr. Benigni's irrepressible optimism- impressed and annoyed, frankly -but he can't get by on charm this time."

vanessacogorno,"Mar 2, 2019",9/10,"A very touching film with a dose of humour which makes a bit lighter the tragic experience of a Jewish Italian family during the second world war. This is not the classic portrait of a world war film. It goes beyond dead, concentration camps and cruelty. It shows what parents are capable of doing for saving their children of traumatising memories."
bhelpful,"Dec 9, 2007",10/10,"Author Viktor E Frankl would have loved this film. His book ""Man's Search for Meaning"" (at least the second half of his book) came to life in Guido's character (Roberto Benigni). The film's segment in a concentration camp actualizes what Frankl attributes to his own survival in a Nazi concentration camp, i.e. his own choosing of the way that things affected him, rather than letting the Nazi's dictate that choice for him. What Guido (Roberto Benigni) did in the concentration camp is what Frankl would have have advised him to do and Guido did it very well. This strategy proved especially beneficial for his 5 year old son, Giorgio.The film is very upbeat and loving, especially in it's first hour which makes no mention of the holocaust or prison camps. Evenso, the uplifting spirit of Guido continues into the camp, with him continually finding ways to show his love there for his wife and son. He's always looking for ways to make things better, never giving into depression in what was clearly a depressing environment. He certainly made the best of a very bad situation.Frankl's memoir of survival (in the second half of his book) really came to life through Guido in a way that Frankl could never have imagined, but which was done very touchingly, none the less. Although Frankl's book is very serious material, I found it to be remarkably complemented by this film."

Rupe-5,"Apr 7, 1999",10/10,"I just have to add my own two cents in here about this amazing experience of a film.One: It was a fable and those who thought that it was an unrealistic approach to the horrors of Nazi Germany tend to tell me that they didn't know it was mean to be a fable. They missed where that was stated in the very first part of the film.Two: Some say film didn't deal with the profound evilness of the concentration camps? A number of people that I talked to didn't even remember the scene where Benigni and his sleeping son happened upon the hill of bodies through what was thought to be fog, which turned out to be smoke from the furnaces. Maybe without that scene, one could've made some argument that the film didn't deal with the inhumanity of it all. With that scene it made it all clear what it was all about.I could barely speak when the film was over....."
rw-bcra,"Apr 24, 2006",10/10,"Over the years we have all seen Holocaust films and TV documentary's, read harrowing Holocaust History books and by using our imaginations we have slept in the barracks, spit out the food offered, and walked in striped prisoner clothing the degrading camp streets of Auschwitz- Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sorbibor, Dachau and Mauthausen. We need to remember that there was 2700 concentration camps, most of which, Chelmno and Gross Rosen for instance, no one remembers today.Whilst watching this wonderful film Life is Beautiful, we ourselves become Jews, we instinctively identify with camp people of all races and deep down we know we would not have survived the camps, perhaps most of us would not want to survive such inhumane and incomprehensible treatment. So, let's imagine we did survive the camps, if we did then hopefully Life would be beautiful. So it goes without saying that we have a duty especially if we have not been in a concentration camp to see that it is beautiful for us and for all others within our family circle and orbit. And this is for me the humanitarian message contained in this great film - to make life beautiful for all.It is without a top 10 Classic film, there's no police chases, no street-smart gangsters, no blonde molls, no letters of transit, or aeroplanes to Lisbon and freedom, but it contains pathos, real life true-isms we cannot not ignore, and a hero who rides a bike and laughs. I understand the actress who played our hero's wife is in fact his real life wife, which is rather touching, if only we all had a wife like her. The acting, lighting and filming are first rate, and without doubt it is the film of the decade, and in 50 years time it will have a huge audience. If you have it on a video then save it, this film and anything connected to it, including old posters, will one day fetch thousands on Ebay and at Sothebys auctions.One personal regret ""I wish I had been involved with the production, the tea boy observer perhaps, and whoever wrote the script and placed it on the screen for us all to enjoy is a genius. Thank you to all who worked on this film, thank you for allowing your world and your unique Italian humour to touch our lives. Thank you for telling us that Life is Beautiful.E Wilson, Leeds, UK."
john_mathon,"Aug 21, 2014",10/10,"I saw this movie in the theater and always remembered it as an amazing movie that was incredibly funny and inspirational. I saw it again today and was as moved and impressed more in every aspect. The casting is perfection. The story is perfection. The acting was perfection. I don't see how you could make a better movie. I laughed. I cried. I hated and I loved. This movie is quintessential Italian and it is true to the horror of the Nazi beliefs and the the horror of all dictatorial regimes. It shows courage in the face of unbelievable hate and it is passionate love story. It is a remarkable movie in every respect.So, was it true to the horrors of Nazi Germany? I have no idea. I am guessing not. The movie does not in any way make light or dismiss the Nazis or their fanatical hatred. In fact it is a central element of creating the tension for the movie and the protagonist.Frankly, I think every human being would be better by seeing this movie. Either you would just laugh and not get into any deeper meaning or you would be inspired to live your life more passionately with love for every human being."
lcartei,"Jun 5, 2002",N/A,"This little anecdote well describes the film.I hate crying. I never cry on principle. I wouldn't cry if my old neighbour was run over while crossing the road or my boss had a heart attack. If my next door shop ran out of my favourite sweets, or if Clinton declared World War III, I wouldn't cry.But I was in tears after watching Life is Beautiful. The only thing I could think of was how stupid I would look when the lights would be on. But when the lights went on, I saw a panorama of white tissues wiping off the tears of the desperate spectators. We were all crying like babies. Kids, daddies and grannies, they all seemed about to commit suicide.Life is Beautiful is a universal movie, able to move anybody's heart. And this is because it's a love-story between a father and his child, it's an emotional journey through the atrocities of the Holocaust, it's a ray of joy and hope that fights against human wickedness.The plot is basic: an Italian-Jewish family is deported to a labour camp during World War II. Here, all sorts of atrocities happen. The extraordinary thing about the film, that makes it different from Schindler's List, for instance, is that these atrocities never really affect the child. His father, played by director and Oscar winner Roberto Benigni, tries in every way to prevent his son from realizing the truth. He in fact tells him that the camp is like a big playground and that they both have to work hard to get points in order to win a big tank. The child, so deluded, can somehow bear the painful situation.The film is not a description of the Holocaust. Rather, it's the experience of the Holocaust seen through the eyes of a child who thinks it's all a game. The movie is not disrespectful towards Jews or the Holocaust, it is, on the contrary, all pervaded with sentiment and compassion. It's the tragedy of two human beings that are dying and still manage to keep their hopes and dreams alive.Life is Beautiful is a film that makes you cry as well as makes you smile. And laugh. The energy of the two protagonists coincides with their capacity to fight, to see a reason to live, a reason to laugh, to have a moment of carefree joy, despite the labour, despite the menace of death, despite the inevitability.Three Oscars won for Best Foreign Film, Best Actor and Best Original Score. Best film of the year and the best film I have seen in my life."
Better_Sith_Than_Sorry,"Jul 5, 2018",6/10,"I am in the minority on this one, given the current 8.6 rating and its ranking at #26 all-time (!), but I have two major issues with ""Life is Beautiful"" that hold me back from joining others and proclaiming it a classic.Plot in a nutshell: A cartoonish man in WWII Italy wins the heart of a local beauty (after much effort). Years later he is sent to a 'death camp' where he tries to shield his young son from the horrors that surely await them both.Issue #1: Maybe it's just me, but isn't Roberto Benigni's character Guido highly annoying? Let's recap - early in the film, we see him - uninvited - creepily and unnecessarily sucking on the leg of a woman he doesn't know (to extract 'wasp poison' he says); he is constantly trying to steal another man's hat (because it's better than his, apparently); he steals the school inspector's ribbon and then impersonates him at the local elementary school, where (because he doesn't know what to say when he's asked to give a speech) he strips down to his underwear in front of the children....need I go on? To put it bluntly, Guido is NOT an endearing character, at all. He is a bit of a creep and a petty thief and he talks too much, with nothing near the charm of Chaplin's ""Tramp,"" to whom he's been compared here by some. I don't get it. I was immediately turned off by his antics and never was able to warm up to him as the film wore on.Issue #2: The scenes in the death camp can only be described as fantasy. In fact, the entire film should be labeled as fantasy, because what we are shown is so far removed from reality it can't be categorized as anything else. Maybe I would have embraced it more had I known this going in, but I did not. Example: 
 one of the early camp scenes, where Guido gets a hold of the camp loudspeaker and broadcasts a message to his wife, and somehow is not caught or punished for this? In reality he would have been shot ON THE SPOT and that would have been the end of this film. There are numerous similar instances of completely unrealistic and imaginary situations in the camp to move the plot along......yet we are supposed to become immersed in what is going on, knowing full well none of it could have possibly happened this way? Yeah I just can't do that.Having said all of this, you CAN sense the connection father and son have, it's palpable, it's real. And you want to believe that the father would indeed try anything to save his family, up to and including sacrificing himself if he has to. The film does convey that quite effectively, and because of that, it has some merit. I just don't find it to be 'one of the greatest films ever' like many other people seemingly do. In essence it's a feel-good fantasy set in one of the worst imaginable nightmares of human history. In direct opposition to the feeling of this film, and a much more accurate representation of how the camps affected the people interned in them, I'll provide a quote from Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel's book ""Night"": ""Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends. Everyone lives and dies for himself alone.""6/10. Light-hearted tale of survival set in a place where hope for most people had long since disappeared. Would I watch again? (Y/N): Probably not."

coniberguecio,"Nov 5, 2022",10/10,"I usually don't crey whit movies, but I cried literally at every second of this movie, how the father loved the mother like if nothing else was important, and the mother did the same thing, she didn't care about him being a Jewish, she loved him anyways.When they were taken to the concentration camp, it was just super hard to watch, how this people made the kid go, even tho he wasn't a Jewish, just because his father was. The mother, who wasn't a Jewish, or anything against the nazis, she asked them to take to the concentration camp just because she couldn't live with the fact that all her family was going, even her child, but she wasn't. Just for them to be separated between boys and girls.All the things and game that the father made up so his son wouldn't be sad, or scared, how he managed to make his son happy during most of the movie time.I dont consider this like an spoiler because I didn't said that much, so if you haven't seen the movie, please see it, it's gonna make you cry, defently, but it will be worth it."
fakie00,"Jun 5, 2019",10/10,A moving mixture of terrifying drama and comical situations in a respectful manner of story telling. A very very narrow ridge and a rollercoaster of feelings. A masterpiece.
MrskiViletic,"Feb 7, 2019",10/10,"Life is Beautiful is a one of a kind movie. It manages to balance humor, drama, fantasy and tragedy effortlessly while always maintaining the respect to the victims of WWII concentration camps. Definitely one of my favorite movies ever and a film that should be considered a must watch."
victorscarelli,"Aug 12, 2019",10/10,"This film is special in many ways. A great sample of love, perfet amount of comedy that made me laugh all the way, but also it doesn't idealize the reality, going in the opposite direction of hollywood movies."
Comet-5,"May 24, 2003",10/10,"This is my favorite film of all times.  It demonstrates the power of love even under the most devastating of circumstances;  the lengths to which a parent will go to protect his child from an overwhelming truth and the imagination it takes to carry this off.  It is absolutely hilarious in parts and incredibly sad in others. The first half and second half are beautifully balanced.  The acting is superb, and the music very evocative, haunting and jaunty as well.  After it was over I was silent for a long time just feeling the experience and thinking about what I had just witnessed.  It brings home the depth (and breadth) of the holocaust by focusing on its effects on one family. I lost over twenty members of my mother's family including my grandparents.  I think this film is a fitting memorial to them"

sllovejoy,"Sep 13, 2001",N/A,"I already commented, but I've been thinking more...As far as I'm concerned, true hope is knowing the truth and knowing that things can get better.  What I saw the father offering his child in this movie was not hope, but denial and delusion.It might work for small things, like ""Aw, how cute, that rabbit fell asleep on the shoulder of the road"".  But this was ridiculous to me.And the lie was even too lame to make sense...  like even a little kid would believe that all those people were being starved and beaten and worse, all because they wanted to win a tank???OH, yeah, I forgot - we didn't see anyone getting starved or beaten.  But that's a whole other argument."
TheMovieDiorama,"Aug 10, 2019",6/10,"La vita è bella. Benigni's audacious dramatic comedy that substitutes the frequently utilised depressing perspective of the Holocaust for a well-intentioned lighter tone. As with most revered classics, my initial approach is one filled with trepidation. The thought of my opinion being placed in the minority forces me to produce a defensive essay rather than a balanced review, at the possibility of being attacked. Unfortunately for Benigni, I disliked an entire half of his ""masterful"" feature, and was left perplexed as to how it crumbled into emotional manipulation for the sake of entertainment. A Jewish waiter finds the love of his life and starts a new family with her, only for their happiness to be abruptly interrupted when they are taken to a concentration camp.To make light of such a horrific period of time is a brave decision. The cynics will view it as a piece of hyperbolic propaganda with pivotal moments of history being re-written in order to drain audiences of their happiness. Others will analyse this drama and overtly praise its unique perspective for accessibility, offering an obvious thematic premise, that being the retaining of optimism during times when humanity has exceeded a certain level of darkness. However theorising a concept and actually realising it are two very different hurdles. Just as different as the two halves that narratively create this feature.The first and more superior half, is a romantic comedy that relishes in conveying a whimsical aesthetic for the fantastical injection of genuine character development that will instantly grant a smile to every viewer. Benigni's visual flair, reminiscent that of the legendary Charlie Chaplin, provides irreverent slapstick humour that suits the hyperactive performance that he infamously portrayed, instantly making him utterly adorable. Whether it be Guido accidentally storing eggs in his hat (a recipe for disaster if you ask me...) or bumbling around as a waiter. His contagious personality is enough to shine an optimistic light in the darkest of corridors, and that's partly due to the screenplay. A noteworthy series of events, once Guido picks up Dora from the opera theatre, that leads his character into a serendipitously magical direction, is a prime example of writing that emitted a loveable quality. The combination of the script with Benigni's performance, and his solid direction for the first half, had me laughing out loud on multiple occasions. With a glisten in my eye in the hope that this would be a new masterpiece. Sadly, not to be.After a masterfully edited transition that sees us jump forward two/three years, our characters are now in the midst of the Holocaust. Jewish civilians are subjugated to poor treatment before being rallied up and transported to concentration camps. Yet Benigni maintains his level of comedy during this period of time, for the sake of his adolescent son who knows no different. As well-intentioned and delicately crafted as this tone was, it came across as highly insensitive and deceitfully manipulative. Various scenes, in particular the German translation segment, had me sink into my seat with a level of uncomfortableness. It didn't sit right with me in the slightest. The emotional connection with these characters dissipated instantly as soon as they were pushed onto the train, and that's mostly due to Benigni's insistence in conveying an overly ambitious optimistic perspective.The more poignant moments of devastation unfazed me due to the bombastic buffoonery that felt misguided. The heartfelt character development that preceded the second half diminished to establish the scattershot exploration of concentration camp regime. And then, as soon as the supposed ""gut punch"" occurs, it's instantly forgotten about when an American tank arrives to save the day (historically incorrect by the way). It concludes on an appropriate quote regarding life and sacrifice, but at that point it's a little too late when all emotional investment is still lingering around in Italy. Atleast Piovani's score is consistently amazing throughout, capturing that Italian Renaissance aura.It is regretful that I end this review with a shade of disappointment. Whilst technically astute and harnessing a heart of gold, the jarring second half emerges as exploitative rather than entertainment. A dire shame considering how wholesome the first half was. But praise must be given to Benigni for ambitiously conveying a wave of optimism, his personality certainly is infectious. I mean just look at that Academy Awards speech!"
reve-2,"Apr 21, 2000",1/10,"If this movie had been made in America it would have received much more objective criticism. But, for some reason, many film watchers think that they must automatically heap praise upon any foreign made movie because it's the ""in"" thing to do. I am not surprised by all of the undeserved superlatives and ridiculous ""10"" votes given to this mediocre film. This movie is watchable but that's about it. The storyline is so implausible and unrealistic that it should be labeled as ""fantasy"". All of the syrupy comments about the great ""love"" shown by the father are laughable."
jordathan,"Jun 11, 2008",10/10,"many have criticized this movie of its ""unbelievability"" and ""unacceptable"" use of humor in telling a tale set in a Holocaust setting.but, as the beginning lets us know...it is a fable. and it is a beautiful one at that.like all good fables, it has the classic characters: the peasant, the poet, the princess, the wise man, the villain, and the child. like all good fables, it is filled with both joy and sadness. Benigni's concept of making a comedy about the Holocaust was a daring and interesting avenue to explore the courage and hope of the inhabitants of the Nazi concentration camps, one not explored in other excellent Holocaust films like Schindler's List or the Pianist.everything about this movie is great: the acting, the storytelling, cinematography, musical score. the first half is such a great setup for the second half, and the ending...makes me cry just to THINK about it.i love movies as literature and entertainment, but this is one of the few films i have ever seen that actually CHANGED my life after i had seen it. it really made me better appreciate the little joys and subtle beauties of life.if you go into this film expecting a dark and stark realistic portrayal of the Holocaust, you'll probably be let down. that's not what it is. it's a fable. go into it with open mind and open heart and let it sweep you away with its magic."
paul2001sw-1,"May 23, 2004",8/10,"Roberto Benigni, the Italian Chaplin, has made, in 'Life is Beautiful', a comedy about the holocaust.  Which first begs the question: is it acceptable to do such a thing?  To which the answer must be ""yes"".  Often the best (and most unsettling) comedy is the blackest, in which the intertwining of the funny and the tragic makes us consider afresh the absurdity of life and death.  And the holocaust, sadly, was horrific precisely because by the fact that it happened it proved that such events do fall within the range of human behaviour. If, in remembering the holocaust, we can only do so with solemnity, we put it in a mausoleum outside of the rest of human experience; and are thereby less, not more, likely to understand and remember.But this leads onto a second question: is it possible to make a comedy about the holocaust (or at any rate a good one)?  Here the sheer scale of the awfulness makes a positive answer harder to give: for such a film to work, the comedy must be commensurate with the tragedy; and this perhaps cannot be done.  An earlier (and brilliant) film of Benigni's, 'Johnny Stecchino', poked fun at gangsters: but even then, it was working with stereotyped gangsters as depicted in movies, not at real murderers extinguishing human life.  With the holocaust, there is no such get outs: few have even dared make straight movies about this subject.The first half of 'Life is Beautiful' is a classic Benigni romp, poking some gentle fun at the less extreme excesses of Italian fascism as it proceeds. It's silly but good, a story of inescapable charm.  But in the second half, the scene moves to somewhere like Auschwicz, and the film becomes more problematic.  The idea (of a man who uses humour to save his son, and himself, from confronting the true horror of his situation) has some merit but is ultimately not sustainable in the face of reality.  So the film has to tone down reality.  Benigni is treated rather better than the average Auschwicz inmate (the film nowhere implies just how low the survival rate was); his fellow prisoners are shown as faceless zombies (distancing us when they do get killed); while when the subject of mass murder is directly addressed, the film inevitably slumps into mawkishness.  There are still some good gags, and occasionally some telling moments (particularly those involving a ""humane"" doctor who Beningi befriends); but overall the setting rings false.  The film might have achieved more poignancy and realism had it been set in a pre-deportation Jewish ghetto: by going all the way to the death camps, it overplays its hand.'Life is Beautiful' is still a funny and original film; but actually less brave than you might at first think."
rcaccio,"Mar 1, 1999",10/10,"After having read all of the comments here, I don't want to seem redundant with my praise. Having rated it a ten myself, I must say that I heartily agree with all the superlatives mentioned by so many others...and yet, all of it taken together still doesn't seem to do justice to the film. For me, the comparison to Chaplin is right on the money, this film stands right next to `City Lights' for its `laugh out loud' comedy, and its `hurts so bad', but joyous, tears. The final frames of both films are absolutely devastating, although for far different reasons. And both films are the product of each one's singular vision, which is what makes `La Vita e Bella' such a refreshing change from the `by the numbers', focus group driven style of contemporary American films - like you can imagine some Hollywood bigwigs getting behind a storyline like this! (What! No special effects! No sex! No violence! No Cursing! No teen appeal! No old TV sitcom rip offs! - you get the idea. I doubt that this film's whole budget could have kept the `Titanic' crew on set for more than a day.)  In my humble opinion, this is by far the best picture of the year, but I doubt that it will win much more than token `Oscars', which is as it should be. The Academy Awards are Hollywood's self congratulatory party, and this understated, haunting, lyrical,  and profoundly moving gem stands in opposition to all of Hollywood's recent excesses. As for me, I'll take `Life is Beautiful' over a dozen `Titanic's' any day."
pulpficat,"Sep 21, 2023",9/10,"In Life Is Beautiful, the cinematic canvas unfurls a story that is as tender as the strokes of an artist's brush on a delicate masterpiece. Set against the backdrop of World War II, this film weaves together laughter and tears, ultimately enveloping you in a warm embrace.Guido, portrayed by the enchanting Roberto Benigni, is the film's radiant heart. His playful spirit and unshakable optimism are like a sunbeam on a cloudy day, illuminating the lives of those around him. Guido's boundless love for his son, Giosuè, is a testament to the enduring power of a parent's devotion. He shields Giosuè from the harsh reality of a concentration camp by weaving an intricate web of imagination and storytelling, where every day becomes a game, every rule a challenge, and every hardship a test of their resilience. Guido crafts a world for his son within the confines of a concentration camp. His unyielding determination to shield Giosuè from the horrors of reality is both heart-wrenching and heartwarming.In the midst of the darkest of circumstances, Guido's unwavering determination to preserve his son's innocence is a poignant reminder of the indomitable human spirit that is both heart-wrenching and heartwarming. His antics in the camp, from translating the commands of the guards into a comical language to his uproarious attempts to win a tank, infuse the harsh reality of war with a whimsical outlook on life, reminding us that even in the bleakest of times, there is room for laughter.Life Is Beautiful is a film that dances between laughter and tears, much like the fleeting moments of joy and sorrow in our own lives. It captures the essence of love's ability to transcend the harshest realities. The cinematography is a visual delight, with scenes that linger on the beauty of human connection, even in the bleakest of circumstances. It is bathed in warm hues and framed with poetic precision, paints a picture of hope in the midst of despair. The evocative score by Nicola Piovani is a gentle caress to the senses, guiding us through moments of joy and sorrow.The film's bittersweet conclusion is a testament to the enduring impact of love, humor, and hope. It reminds us that life's beauty can be found in the simplest of gestures and the profound bonds we forge with those we hold dear.In essence, Life Is Beautiful is a cinematic masterpiece that encourages us to find joy in the everyday, cherish the bonds we share, and celebrate the resilience of the human spirit. It invites us to dance with life, finding beauty in the most unexpected corners of our existence. It is a poignant reminder that even in the face of unimaginable adversity, love and laughter prevail."

paulclaassen,"Nov 8, 2019",8/10,"'Life is Beautiful' is a heart wrenching drama disguised as a comedy. Wow, this was awesome!Roberto Begnini is excellent as Guido, the most lovable con artist you will ever meet. The film uses interesting and unique dialogue that is actually really funny. At times Roberto comes across as the Italian version of Mr Bean. He simply is excellent.The first half of the film sets up Guido's character and the people he cares about, and its so easy to love them. Around the halfway mark, the film takes an unexpected, dramatic turn. Despite the deep and sad theme, they manage to keep the film lighthearted thanks to Guido's attempts to fool his son into thinking the harsh reality is actually part of a game. To my knowledge, this is the first ever for a film to take this approach on serious matters like war and the horrors against Jews. One could argue that it is no laughing matter, but I believe this was not their intention. It simply is a dreary situation viewed through the eyes of a happy-go-lucky dad trying to protect his son, and trying to remain calm regardless of the odds.By the time the film reaches the final moments, it is truly heart wrenching. I never thought a comedy could be this heartbreaking! You simply have to see it to believe it. (Similar to the Korean film 'Miracle in Cell No. 7). This is a gem of a movie!"
Mario64,"Aug 7, 2002",6/10,"Life is Beautiful is a good movie, I just can't understand its increadable high praise by people. The first part of the movie, dealing with coming of love between the couple, was fairly delightful, even if it being kind of corny. The second half is not worse than the first, but not really better than it either. Benini's character convinces his son that their just in a game when their actually in a concentration camp. That worked for a little bit but after a while it got kind of sappy. You keep wondering if it's actually going to do more harm to the kid than good.The movie has it's funny moments, and it's warm hearted moments, but I really can't call it a great movie. Benini's performance is good, but I kind of think the only reason he won best actor was for people to see a guy jumping over chairs and acting crazy. I give it a 7 out of 10."
dgmyers,"Jun 8, 1999",1/10,"Only the naive and ignorant will find this film charming. Those who know anything about the Holocaust will see it for what it is--a lie that desecrates the memory of six million dead.Under the Nazis, six million Jews died for no other reason than that they were Jewish. This invests the fact of their Jewishness with transcendent importance. In ""Life Is Beautiful,"" however, Roberto Benigni's character Guido is Jewish only because the film announces that he is. His Jewishness has no other significance; it is not the affirmation of anything; it is a manipulative plot device. Guido's goodness is not attributed to his being Jewish--that is something to be dispensed with quickly, as if it were an embarrassment.And so Benigni ends up treating the Jews very little differently than the Nazis. For one thing, he shamefully misrepresents the reality of the Nazis' Konzentrationlagers. A Jew would have been murdered for any ONE of the acts of defiance that Guido gets away with. Benigni's film turns the real danger and real violence and real death of the Holocaust into something like a Roadrunner cartoon in which Wile E. Coyote never really suffers or dies. But this is a lie: under the Nazis, the Jews suffered and died. They did not get away with carefree acts of defiance.What is more, the mass of Jews in the camp in which Guido and his son are imprisoned are treated as nothing more than the faceless and nameless background to Benigni's disgusting clowning. They are given no more individuation--no more personhood and uniqueness--than they were by the Nazis themselves.""Life Is Beautiful"" is an obscene exploitation of enormity and sorrow."

This Academy Award Winning flick is certainly one of the most engrossing, captivating gem of a movie. Benigni did everything in this film. He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night. There is that much raw energy in this film.This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you. After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son. The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie. Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy. Sure, the film is clearly comedic, but nevertheless it manages to very effectively communicate the tremendous losses suffered in the Nazi concentration camps and has scenes at least as intense as any scene in Schindler's List."
