NpMoviez,"May 30, 2018",10/10,"I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other ""popular"" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with ""Memento"" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of ""Memento"" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full ""interchange"" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more ""wrong"" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most ""complex"" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+""."
ccthemovieman-1,"Sep 29, 2008",10/10,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!"
Surecure,"Oct 21, 2006",8/10,"The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.Told in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.With a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.In the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across."
iohefy-2,"Oct 16, 2006",9/10,"I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed."
DICK STEEL,"Oct 20, 2006",10/10,"I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy)  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge  magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting  the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession,  revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty  assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience,  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction  that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of  sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of  grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for  survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so  fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in,  without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You  just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours,  you don't feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection -  what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in  general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you  absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's  movies?"
UrbanFilmCritic,"Oct 19, 2006",N/A,What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist. A unique plot with an amazing cast--any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Christian Bale was amazing in one of his rare cockney performances. We already know from Kate and Leopold how well Hugh Jackman plays a distinguished English gent. He's absolutely priceless. Is there any point in discussing Sir Michael Caine? He brings polish to the movie.This is the kind of flick that you can discuss for weeks after. The plot is so detailed and complete and open to interpretation. My friend and I have been discussing various nuances of this film for the past 3 weeks. It definitely stays with you.
Faisala,"Oct 22, 2006",10/10,"I have to say this is one of the best movies i have seen this year, i was not expecting it to be that good. There's twist after twist, and when you think there is no more, there will be. Great performances and ever better plot. I highly recommend this movie to all ages.New idea for a movie, and they succeeded it at it greatly. It will have you thinking every time you see a magician on TV!i had to give this movie a 10/10, and i only have 4 movies that i would rate that way in my life time. If there is anything you do this year, make it a trip to watch this movie!I hope you enjoy it as much as i did."
benm-41751,"Feb 13, 2018",7/10,"This movie is very engaging and intriguing. You are presented with a complete mess of scenes which go back and forth through time and are needlessly confusing, yet the core story and the characters were compelling enough to keep me interested and paying attention. The cinematography, the sound, the acting, and the visual elements are all perfectly in place, and overall its very entertaining.My only concern is that the film prevents itself from achieving greatness by relying heavily on a very cheap, shallow plot element. It becomes science fiction, which is fine but a bit strange after spending so long convincing me the characters are real. This is something I find with all of Nolan's movies, that they present themselves as being mysterious and secretive but fall a little flat if you apply any brain power to them.Still, I think this movie is worth watching if you're looking for something a little suspenseful, a little creepy, and very entertaining. Maybe the movie's ultimate goal is the same as a magician's, as said in the movie: that one moment where the audience is in awe and disbelief."
Flagrant-Baronessa,"Dec 27, 2006",9/10,"Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.The final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.The prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige' of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a ""gotcha""-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.Our two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.With Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).9 out of 10"
Julia-Dempster,"Oct 20, 2006",10/10,This was the best movie I have seen in at least the past two years. Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 dollars or so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hors of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can see the twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still left wondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to own this on DVD.
auuwws,"Feb 17, 2021",9/10,"Great movie and best movie I've seen directed by Christopher Nolan. The story of the movie was great and I did not expect the end. Most of the film's characters were excellent, and Tesla's appearance in the film was excellent. The acting was excellent, especially from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale who were dazzling in the film, the film embodies the period of the end of the nineteenth century, a great film."
gavin6942,"Oct 28, 2006",10/10,"Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see ""the prestige"".I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see ""Batman Begins"") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.Hugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than ""Labrynth"" would have you believe.The visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen. And I was going along with the ride the whole time.If you see one film from 2006, see ""The Departed"". But if you see two, ""The Prestige"" better be on your list."
Kirpianuscus,"Jan 26, 2016",N/A,"a film about magic at different levels. the magic as art. the magic as axis of life. art as only way to survive. beautiful, mysterious, ambiguous and almost impeccable. in fact, brilliant job. and this status is result of delicate-precise mixture of acting, impeccable story, splendid atmosphere and the feeling than competition escapes from the screen. a seductive detail - David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, a role who gives to film a special flavor. at first sigh, story of a cruel fight for success. or a portrait of manipulation art. in fact, fresco of a time. and one of admirable roles for Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman."
ElMaruecan82,"May 25, 2018",7/10,"There are many kinds of magic: wizardry à la 'Harry Potter', illusions or hallucinations, or entertaining shows: mediums, rabbits in top-hats, women sawed in half, bag-content guessing, magic cards etc.Speaking of cards, Christopher Nolan's ""Prestige"", made between two 'Batman' movies, lays its cards at the first voice-over monologue where we immediately recognize Michael Caine's smooth voice. It's about the third kind of magic and provides the three structural rules of an act: it starts with the Pledge: you show something normal then the Turn, you make it do something extraordinary... but there's an element of expectation and the higher your reputation goes, the more sophisticated the public. In fact, there's got to be something unpredictable, so it all comes down to the Prestige, the trick no one sees coming and will earn magicians applauses and guess what? prestige.Then, the least you can expect from the film is to follow these three rules even in the loosest possible way if it means wowing you with a spectacular surprise. And given that it's a Nolan film about the deadly art of illusion, much more opening with the killing of a magician, the imprisonment of his rival whom everything accuses, your twist-radar is set from the start, so not any twist will do. Whatever the prestige will be, if it's not venturing in the realm of feasibility, something will have been missed. We're dealing with magic after all, not fantasy, not sci-fi. I insist on the sci-fi element because the film opens with some electrical contraption that shakes its credibility from the start until a reassuring trap door shows and we can let a sight of relief go.French called electricity a Fairy so it all makes sense that magicians would use it as a device for generating illusion, just like rivals Edison and Tesla were perceived as wizards. After all, it's also established that magic is about what you see and what you don't and the use of lights and darkness is integral to the act. Still, I didn't like that machine. It felt incongruous and weird in a period drama and I was afraid Nolan would end up inserting some Batman-like device. And when he said in the ""making of"" video that he wanted to portray magic according to his personal vision of film-making, I thought ""no kidding?"", I'm pretty sure everyone got the parallel, especially when magical acts use special effects worthy of a Spielberg film.So Nolan gets a little carried away at the end while the first two acts of the movie had really gotten me involved, I mean the escalating rivalry between the two magicians Alfred Bowden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and their attempts to destroy one's act or find one's secret. What Nolan got right is that the rivalry mostly works as a foil to plunge us in the world of magic and know all the tricks. After all, that's the greatest thrill about magic, seeing how it works. For instance, the way a magician puts a dove in a cage and then flattens it to magically making the dove reappear under a handkerchief always made me scratch my head... but in this Dickensian universe where there's no pity for little children, why should there for innocent animals?The trigger of the rivalry also helps to understand how one of the most famous magic tricks, the ""escape from the tank water"" that made Houdini's reputation, is indirectly explained. Working as false audience members, Bowden and Angier are assigned to tie the magician's pretty assistant (Piper Perabo), one of them makes the kind of knot that doesn't leave any chance for the poor girl, who happens to be the other's wife. We gather that from then, it's personal. Another pivotal moment occurs when one conceives his masterpiece, an act that consists on getting in a door and coming out of another. He calls it ""The Transported Man"", for us, it looks like teleportation and it justifies why the rival is devoured by jealousy, although Caine's character can only see one explanation: there must be a double.At that point of the review, it's impossible to go further without spoiling the film. It's engaging enough to make you forget there's a twist but it's not spoiling the film to say that there's a twist, since it's the essence of magic. You've got to wow the audience with a surprise at the end. With the seemingly death of a character right at the start of the film, the battle to know everyone's tricks and the existence of a double, anyone could reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. But you know Nolan has more than a trick in his sleeve and that's both a blessing and a curse. Granted anticipations are to be toyed a little to be emotionally rewarded, all he had to do was working on the narrative structure to make what we know first a more effective reveal or a shock.Instead of that, Nolan relied on a far fetched revelation combined with an implementation that destroyed the whole atmosphere built throughout the film. From the start, we follow magicians who are dedicated to their passion, which is good, but the escalation toward sadism and some ends-justifying-the-means means made their whole approach to their art debatable, leaving no room for sympathy. In this cruel battle of wits, women are reduced to disposable pawns (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen would get more dimensional roles in a certain Woody Allen's movie).The first two acts, we can call them 'pledges' and 'turns' are great but then the film goes downhill. One thing for sure, I hated that Tesla Machine, and no offense to David Bowie, but Tesla was quite a handsome fellow whom I doubt spoke with such a heavy British accent. Nolan wanted his film-making to echo magic, but he let the reverse thing operate."
orko_dutta,"Jul 13, 2019",8/10,The final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances. I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique.
harrylosborne,"May 9, 2021",7/10,"The first time I watched ""The Prestige"", I didn't think anything of it whatsoever. However, on reflection, I think it's a film to be taken with a pinch of salt, and not just when regarding the magic.This movie suffers from two main characters having the thickest plot armour imaginable - making all of their encounters feel inconsequential. This is a fairly severe oversight in an otherwise robust film that does provide intrigue, but still lacks on a fundamental level.Nolan is one to weave as complex a tale as he can, and here is no different. Starting with a dramatic but unexplained death, the story plots the rivalry between two pioneering magicians: one who prizes showmanship and theatrics, and the other who reveres the art above all else. I prefer Hugh Jackman's performance to Christian Bale's (not something I would normally say), but Bale's feels a bit too abrasive and cynical even for the character design.What lost me a bit was the whole Nikola Tesla arc, where Nolan tries bridging the gap between illusion and reality. It's all a bit clunky, and whilst I don't particularly see why David Bowie was brought in for the role, I don't see anyone else doing much more with the material either.The music is fairly minor in the story (not orchestrated by the usual Hans Zimmer), so doesn't elevate the film like in most of Nolan's other projects. Stylistically, there is a faithfulness to 19th century London; period attire is par for the course, but there is a decent finesse to the whole endeavour. The scenes in the USA are the best looking parts, as the scenery across the pond gives a little more scope for artistic license.Mercifully, Nolan does leave most of the chronology alone, allowing a more rigid story to be told. Towards the end, I did begin to feel a greater sense of attachment - the conflict between the protagonists is palpable - but the romance aspects felt contrived and just like plot padding. I was invested in the finale, and there certainly are dramatic twists and turns, but in my opinion, they require you to accept some flawed storytelling tactics.""The Prestige"" is definitely not one of Nolan's best: whilst it does exhibit shades of what makes his masterpieces so powerful, it also struggles with hurdles that even basic stories should be practically immune to.Invulnerability breaks immersion, and is one of the issues I had with ""Tenet"" 15 years later. That alone inhibits this movie from ascending into hallowed ground, condemning it to just being a worthwhile watch."
layla_silver7,"Feb 11, 2024",10/10,"The Prestige is about rival magicians trying to ""out-illusion"" each other with the ultimate magic trick. But really, you are the one who feels like you are being tricked. This film has plot twists from start to finish, and each one is even more shocking than the last. By the end, you will want to rewatch it 100 times to follow along with all the tricks. It is the kind of film that you will not want to miss a single second of, so you don't miss anything. The real magician of this film is Christopher Nolan, who created a deceptive story, a visually amazing film, and got an amazing cast to bring the illusion to life."
Geri_Ivanova,"Jun 7, 2015",9/10,"Long ago I watched The Prestige and The Illusionist in the same weekend. Comparisons are odious but it is inevitable for me to think of the second when talking about the first. You want to know why, keep reading.Magic is present in everybody's childhood, but it is something we lose, as we get older, in part because there are not many movies about magic to watch when you grow up. But if you want to turn the clock back and feel excited about how magicians perform tricks and get some answers about ""how it is possible"" or ""what's the trick"", lucky you because there are two movies which will definitely satisfy your curiosity.Both movies take place in England at the end of the XIX century. They not only have in common their genre, drama-mystery but also a fantastic cast. Edward Norton' remarkable portrayal of Eisenheim in The Illusionist is as memorable as Hugh Jackman and Christian Bales's in the Prestige. The appealing special effects, the convincing costumes and the compelling dialogue; you will enjoy these movies from the beginning to the end.Although there are several similarities between the two movies their plots are quite different. The Illusionist is, without a doubt, a much more romantic interpretation of the life of a magician. The Prestige, on the other hand portrays the rivalry between two magicians where revenge is the main feeling. The second movie is, indeed, more action-packed but no less moving than The Illusionist.These two must sees will trap you and will carry you to an enjoyable world full of magic. But if you really love cinema and good stories the one I highly recommended to you is the Illusionist."

jock185,"Oct 21, 2006",10/10,"i'll keep this shorti loved it, i knew i it would be great simply from the cast and the director. i wasn't expecting it to be quite this dark but i loved every minute of it and was happy it was done this way. Nolen does a great job of setting up the ending of this movie to keep you guessing how it would be done. I guessed some of it but was surprised by other parts. I thought Andy Serkis and David Bowe were great. After seeing it at the late showing i had trouble sleeping b/c i was still trying to replay the movie in my mind to understand all the twists and turns.Great Movie, a must see"
AkashWatching,"Jul 6, 2019",10/10,You don't need to know anything but Christopher Nolan made the movie and that's the bottom line!
behzodmusurmonqulov,"Sep 27, 2024",7/10,"I don't know why, but I am little bit bored watching this movie, but everything is good. I love background soundtrack album by David Julyan. That suits a lot to the movie. Actors are perfect. They are chosen right. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman played very well. Christopher Nolan is just genius making this movie. Movie is unpredictable. Even so, I think I wasted my time. This movie is not my type. But of course, my review is subjective, I believe you will love this, it will become your fauvorite. In short, just watch movie yourself and rate. I would rate 7/10. But it is too low for the movie. I would go 7.5 if possible."
ma-cortes,"Dec 9, 2008",8/10,"This enjoyable and fresh story about intense rivalry among magicians is set in turn-of-the last century, London.Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) his wife Julie McCullough(Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden(admirable Christian Bale) are friends and magician's assistants.

Both become prestigious magicians and get mutual envy. Magician Robert sees the Borden's transportation show and he becomes obsessed with his magic trick. They battle each other for their magic tricks and Robert attempts disclose the secret about disappearance from his contender with fateful results.This splendid movie is stunning in many aspects and blends appropriately various genres: the lush romantic period piece during nineteenth century Victorian Era, mystery thriller and fantasy.The picture gets it all : suspense, mystery drama, star crossed lovers,plot twists, murders,tragedy and supernatural illusions . Featuring an excellent casting, as main actors, Jackman, Bale, Johansson as eclectic secondaries, Caine,David Bowie,Andie Serkis and Rebecca Hall.Luxurious attention to period detail in brilliant costumes and spectacular production design . Beautifully and mesmerizing cinematography by Wally Pfister. Intriguing and evocative musical score by David Julyan. The motion picture is perfectly directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia,Memento,Batman begins, Dark night¨. At the same time was made another film(2006)with similar theme titled 'The illusionist'by Neal Burger with Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel which also achieved much success. Rating : Above average, it was throughly amusing and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think. The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work,it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final."
cogleone,"Jul 18, 2007",10/10,"Every so often I see a film that I get addicted to. As soon as I watch it in the cinema I know I'm going to buy it the day it comes out on DVD.Well The Prestige is the latest of these. This film gets better and better with each viewing. Hugh Jackman should have won many awards for his role. People say ""Oscar"" but there are better awards out there than that, the Oscars are about as representative of what's the ""very best"" as the IMDb's Top 250 list is.People have told me that they predicted the end, well that's their funeral, I never clicked until it was revealed for me, so I got much more value for my money.Christopher Nolan is a master. Even though he seems quite humourless in his DVD extra interviews. He makes extremely entertaining films that are well cast and superbly executed, just as the Prestige is.All those who never liked the film should be rounded up in a field and used for crazed scientific experiments, we could use Tesla!"
claudio_carvalho,"Apr 28, 2007",9/10,"In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his beloved wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.""The Prestige"" is a great tale of rivalry, obsession, revenge and sacrifice. The unpredictable screenplay has many twists, disclosing unusual situations and hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. Christopher Nolan, after the masterpiece ""Memento"", offers another excellent movie for the cinema lovers, better and better than the Oscar winner ""The Departed"". The amazing dispute between the outstanding Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is supported by the extraordinary Michael Caine and a wonderful cinematography. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Grande Truque"" (""The Great Trick"")"
titibiti2,"Oct 27, 2019",10/10,"This movie is beyond brilliant. I never payed that much attention to it the first two or three times I watched it on TV, but god, oh god, is it worth watching again! Every time! And now, when I finally sat down to watch it, I realized how much I had missed. I think it's one of the greatest movies ever created. Packed with subtle references, The Prestige itself is a magic trick and indeed, you have to watch closely. And when you do, you find yourself compelled by the seemingly harmless passion of the artist that is soon revealed to be a dangerous obsession which shows to what lengths a person is willing to go to and what sacrifices he's willing to make to be greater than his rivals and to be the very best he can."
ceeingred13,"Feb 29, 2012",10/10,"This movie was truly a game-changer for me. I initially saw it simply because I enjoyed some members of the cast so much (Bale, Caine, Bowie), but I left the theatre in awe. It is such a well-written, layered, intense, character driven story on par with Faustus or Jekyll and Hyde in terms of characters that are overly driven by their obsessions. It invites you to watch in the first lines of dialogue and from that point forward, you hardly have a choice. One of Nolan's strengths is that he doesn't shy away from difficult stories to tell. None of the characters are entirely likable. It's hard to pick someone to root for, but that is one of the things that makes them so human. Jackman and Bale are both fine actors that attack their roles with tremendous capability and Rebecca Hall is one of the best discoveries I've had in movies. Even Johansson, who is easily the weakest link, was used sparingly and didn't detract from the movie. The plot is fascinating and leads to an immensely satisfying ending. I can't watch this enough times."
Horror-yo,"May 18, 2016",6/10,"Christopher Nolan, the co-writer/director, loves to over-complicate his films a lot, especially in his twists in the endings, and counts on the simplicity of the masses to get confused and be called a genius despite failing to deliver in his films' ultimate goals: the twists at the end, because most of his films rely on those heavily to be given any meaning or quality at all. In this fairly long-running drama, Bale (as usual) and Jackman produce high quality performances, and special credit given to Bale's wife in the film and David Bowie (who can really act !); in an otherwise strong cinematography flick. The main issue is that the film builds up a great momentum, with lots of twists and turns, but as we're held in suspense for the grande finale at the end, lots of if not everything that's been mounted before seems to crumble as we discover the truth unfolded in the dying, yes *dying*, moments of this disappointment. It's like the end discredits everything that's been building for long chunks of Nolan produce, like the film shoots itself in the foot (or in the head ?). Too bad. This feels like a great, but it surely isn't."
artistgp,"Feb 23, 2012",10/10,"I continue to be blown away at how fantastic this film is. It is executed with extreme precision. Every aspect of the film, all the way from visuals to the character development, is masterful.I'm not sure how it fared awards wise upon its release, but it should have racked up quite a few. The story is wonderfully layered, the acting is superb, the directed is spectacular, etc. I can't find anything about this film that I would change.Congratulations to the entire team that put this project together. I consider it one of the best films of all time.If you have the opportunity I strongly urge that you check this film out. I think you'll be glad you did."
sj_elliott,"Nov 20, 2006",4/10,"I love a film that doesn't spoonfeed the plot and the story and the interest in it to the audience. This one takes you along if you are smart enough to go and if you are not so dumbed down by most entertainment that you can stay steadily involved.I wanted to love it to death...it has everything I think a film should have, including a wonderfully rich atmosphere, a great cast and excellent direction. Through most of it, it dares the audience to be intelligent and to have an attention span longer than a fruit fly. It had all the makings of a great film, but I kept looking for (and longing for) the greatness to impact me. It never did.It fell flat for me by the end. I really didn't care about any of them by then. I wasn't even sure I cared about the little girl. I certainly didn't care how anyone did any of the illusions; I was sick to death of their obsession with each other and just wanted them to move on already. Although there would be no film without it, it all seemed to be 'too much trouble to go through' and obsession is about getting caught up in it...for me, I couldn't get caught up in itnor could I quite get their obsession. Although Iam a big fan of the long, thinking person's film, I have to say I thought it dragged on and on by the end and I just wanted it over. It definitely did not leave me wanting more. I just wanted different.I had paid attention all along, I was impressed with the film and thought the acting, the cinematography and the direction were all superb. Even though some of the twists seem unnecessary, I thought many were brilliant and I kept trying to will myself to care about it, to care about them, but I didn't.It was a very good film in a detached sort of ""viewing art"" way but as far as feeling ""wow""'d by the end, not so much."
diligentdrool,"Jan 22, 2013",9/10,"One of my most favourite films ever; 'The Prestige' is Christopher Nolan's most fascinating and engrossing film to date, pipping 'Memento' and 'Dark Knight', for me. The story of two rival magicians with a tragic history linking them, trying to outshine one another and the mysteries surrounding makes the premise of a magical two hour narrative.There ARE holes in this movie and the story is not as compact as some other Nolan films; having a few weak moments. But this is where the genius of Nolan comes in - he makes it work completely, despite those problems - which is why I rate this movie as one of his best directed films.This film doesn't have the heavy-handedness of 'Inception' (which is overrated IMO), isn't too clever for its own good (again, like 'Inception' and 'Memento' to an extend though I think the latter is Nolan's strongest in terms of sheer narrative brilliance)or the slightly impersonal feel of 'Insomnia' (a great film nonetheless; an underrated Nolan film I think). It is, in my opinion, the right mix of entertainment and quality. You will just not get bored with this film - in fact, I was left wanting more!The acting in the film is flawless and is what makes the film such a compelling watch. The entire cast is brilliant, without exception, from Rebecca Hall to Scarlett Johansson to Michael Caine. As the two rival protagonist magicians, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem to go one better that the other with each passing scene. Ultimately, it is Jackman who shines more as Robert Angier though. As the mentally distraught, obsessive but consummate showman, he pretty much steals the show from perhaps an actor who may, in retrospect, be superior in sheer acting quality.In a nutshell, 'The Prestige' is unlike any other Nolan movie. The sheer ""watchability"" value of 'The Prestige' beats the other Nolan movies blue and black. I have watched it four times completely; I enjoy it more and more each time. Without doubt, my favourite Nolan movie.Watch it; it is truly magical."
lee_eisenberg,"Dec 29, 2008",8/10,"In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in ""The Prestige"". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot, like ""Memento""; one-upmanship, like ""Insomnia""; the question of morality, like in ""The Dark Knight"". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all, I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are ""The Illusionist"" and ""Scoop"" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson)."
adudewhoiscool,"Mar 18, 2007",10/10,"In a modern age where most films are either: remakes, sequels, or prequels it is nice to be able to view a modern day original film. Yes, it is an adaptation, from a book, but many viewers will probably not know that until they actually begin to watch the movie, like this reviewer. Rolling Stone magazine (as printed on the DVD cover) said it best, ""You want to see it again the second it is over."" Christopher Nolan, who last directed one of the best comic book movie adaptations, in ""Batman Begins,"" does it again with ""The Prestige.""""The Prestige"" is based on a book, of the same title, that was written by Christopher Priest. The story is about two magicians who have been rivals to each other ever since the day they met and throughout the course of time, each of them tries to gain an advantage over the other. Eventually the friendly rivalry becomes an obsession. Their obsessions over trying to discover how the other does the trick, or how to upstage that trick, could turn into something that would kill one another.First things first, this reviewer will not make any comparisons to the other magic movie, ""The Illusionist."" What this reviewer will talk about is the plot. The story is fantastic. You cannot help but stay alert, and throughout the film you want to know what will happen next. There are many twists and turns to the plot, which will make you say, ""How did I not catch that?"" There is a quote in the movie that is used frequently, ""Are you watching closely?"" You need to be paying close attention in order to catch all of the various twists throughout the film.Besides all of the various twists, the acting was also fantastic. Hugh Jackman was a big surprise success as Rupert Angier. Christian Bale is always good and the trend continued as Alfred Borden. Michael Cane as always was great as Cutter. Scarlett Johansson was also very good as Olivia Wenscombe. Even David Bowie and Andy Serkis popped up as Nikola Tesla and Alley.Overall, there is not much to complain about. If you are looking for a movie about magic with a hint of science fiction, you should enjoy this. If you enjoy Christopher Nolan films, you should see this movie. If you enjoy movies in general, you should see this film. It is a shame this movie did not win any academy awards. ""The Prestige"" is recommended!"
AlsExGal,"Feb 10, 2019",10/10,"... but I guess that is really beside the point.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look
ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his ""catch the bullet"" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up
to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - ""Brilliant"".Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film."
Lemons4722,"Jun 20, 2025",9/10,"This movie had everything you could want to make it thought provoking, compelling, and emotional.Acting: the actors did an incredible job portraying different emotions such as anger, sadness, fear, and more. They worked well together and really built their characters well.Storyline: the idea for this movie is creative, unique, interesting, and thought provoking. It is unlike anything before it and most likely will never be repeated. The storytelling uses both SHOCKING plot twists and symbolism to form a story worth watching over and over again.Monologues: the monologues are well written, and once again thought provoking. They don't feel overdone or dramatic at all, but rather genuine and intellectually stimulating.Visuals: another wonderful thing about this movie is the costumes, sets, and all the things that work together to make it visually stunning.Complexity: what can describe this movie but the word 'nuance.' All the characters have flaws and human nature is portrayed in a nuanced light. The ending also is complex, leaving no questions about the plot but a LOT of questions about humanity and character.This movie shocked me. It was a perfect execution of an amazing idea. Worth watching over and over."
mike_76,"Oct 28, 2006",9/10,"What sets Nolan and this film apart is the content of this film, not the acting (the only weakness being the Scarlett Johannsons accent, which is easily overlooked) and not even so much the story (which is also quite good). The story is okay, but what really took my breath away was the atmosphere (much like in Memento). He creates the perfect atmosphere for his movies, his style is brilliant. The shots are just gorgeous. In my opinion he is leading the charge in giving movie-goers a different experience; watching a Christopher Nolan film is a hugely different and a much more absorbing experience than nearly any other director. Well, for me anyway, obviously the experience is a hugely subjective thing.This film is special. There are no real good guys, no real bad guys, just human struggles with that hedging of the supernatural that really gets you thinking. His films are not perfect in that they don't fit molds or answer all the questions. That is what makes this film special, it draws you in and really makes you question things; important things.However, the important thing is that it is a truly absorbing experience, what more can you ask of a film?"
cavadoro222,"Oct 13, 2011",10/10,"If you think this film is mediocre or just a ""period piece"" then you have to think again because the true depth of this plot cannot be realized without watching repeatedly.I have watched it through several times and still can't tell if the Michael Caine character was the true mastermind.This screenplay could play in any time or place, even with unknown actors, and still generate eternal wonder.Too many directors rely on gratuitous violence, expensive action sequences, big name actors and grandiose sets/CGI to wow the viewers Christopher Nolan is an unmitigated genius and doesn't need any of those tricks."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Aug 13, 2023",10/10,"Magicians Alfred Borden and Robert Angier were once friends, but following an accidental death, the pair are determined to outshine, when ultimately destroy one another.It's a dizzying, dazzling, complex mystery, it may need a rewatch, as there's so much happening, it may be a little hard to keep up with all that's happening in front of you, but there's no denying, this is a captivating film.One of the best lineups imaginable, headliners Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both tremendous, two genuine legends, both at the top of their game. The supporting cast of Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie are all spot on.So many great and memorable moments, I think the scenes of Alfred and Robert upstaging one another were possibly the best bits of the film.The special effects are quite something, I'm watching this seventeen years in, and it still looks amazing. The make up department did a tremendous job here.Terrific visuals in general, great costumes and sets compliment the amazing location work.It remains a terrific movie.10/10."

kosmasp,"Oct 19, 2010",10/10,"I really don't know where to start. The great production design, the fabulous acting, the great cinematography, the superb writing, the awesome directing ... I really don't know. But I do know, that this is another Nolan movie. Which kinda is a trademark or became one for me. That is why the number one movie I was looking forward in 2010, was ""Inception"".But I will get into that other movie on its own page. If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created, it's almost impossible, that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies, that have substance.Maybe Insomnia is his ""weakest"" movie (if you count the reception it got) and ""Following"" was just a student film, but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again, I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning. You have to make up your own mind ... start with this mind-boggling or with any other of his movies ... Repeated viewing is almost necessary! And you will most likely want to anyway!"

Both characters were utterly demonic."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 16, 2024",10/10,"Christopher Nolan's *The Prestige* is a spellbinding exploration of ambition, obsession, and the lengths to which we go for greatness. Set in the late 19th century, the film follows two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), who are locked in a fierce competition to create the ultimate stage illusion.Nolan's masterful direction, coupled with a sharp and layered screenplay, draws the audience into a world filled with illusion and secrets. As the narrative unfolds, the film delves deep into the personal sacrifices each magician makes in their quest for supremacy, revealing the darker side of ambition and the complexities of duality. Themes of obsession and sacrifice are woven seamlessly throughout the story, keeping viewers engaged until the very last reveal.Jackman and Bale deliver stunning performances, infusing their characters with depth, passion, and an unsettling intensity that mirrors their rivalry. The supporting cast, including Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson, adds richness to the narrative, further enhancing the film's depth.Visually, *The Prestige* is a feast for the eyes, with its atmospheric cinematography and period-appropriate set designs that transport viewers into the world of Victorian magic. The film's editing is particularly noteworthy, masterfully juxtaposing timelines in a way that heightens suspense and intrigue.With its intricate storytelling and haunting score by David Julyan, *The Prestige* is not only a compelling tale of rivalry but also a meditation on the fine line between illusion and reality. The film leaves audiences pondering long after the credits roll, making it a must-see for fans of thought-provoking cinema and thrilling narratives."

ajaws4ever,"Oct 30, 2006",10/10,"The Prestige is awesome! You have not seen a better movie in years! Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine are going to win some awards, let me tell you. And so is the screenplay. It's completely astonishing! The whole movie is!Robert Angier (Jackman) and his assistant, John Cutter (Caine), are into magic. Robert is the illusionist, and John is his assistant with building and testing illusions. When a man picks two volunteers to tie a woman (Robert's wife) to bind her in ropes so she cannot possibly escape the water cage (like one of Houdini's escape tricks), it all gets interesting. The two volunteers were Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Bale), who didn't even know each other until that day where that woman -- who was Angier's wife -- drowned in the water cage all because Alfred Borden tied the knot in the assistant's hands wrong. She couldn't slip out of the knot. She died.Now Robert is angry. He shoots Alfred's hand later on in the movie, losing two of his fingers. Now, they are fighting at each other, not physically, just apart. THE TRANSPORTING MAN ILLUSION is a wonderful illusion that Alfred Borden made up, and now Robert is trying to steal his secret. He has become obsessed. So, he makes it better. BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH! JUST SEE THE MOVIE!Oh, and for those who pay attention to music in movies, you'll be disappointed. There's not much music to pay attention to. There's just some violins and other orchestral instruments here and there and occasionally there's a, ""BOOM"" of a timpani when you're supposed to be shocked or surprised at something.Sorry if I gave too much away, just PLEASE agree with my comment. I don't get any people who agree with my comments.

EricBosarge,"Oct 30, 2006",9/10,"Now this was a movie that made you stop and think and then think again, and then go buy a ticket to watch again and think. Most of the people in the audience looked stupefied at the end of this flick. No greater tribute can be given for a movie based on magicians, magic, and science fiction. This is every magicians dream and to do it through the cinema is quite a trick in itself. The performances are excellent and Christian Bale as always is the character in life and breathe. Hugh Jackman is so turning out to be more than an eye catcher and can act in the most excellent and gentlemanly fashion. Michael Caine.......when don't you turn in an awesome performance. Scarlett Johanson does an excellent job and surrounded by such thundering performances, how can she not excel in the pouted way of hers and it is put most excellently to use in this movie. Take the rabbit out of the hat and take a bow, this was definitely a magic trick of a movie."
Chickenhawk2002,"Nov 17, 2006",9/10,"This film seems to have polarised IMDb posters like no other for a while.I don't know if it is a trick (sic) of time but the posts at the top of this list seem to love it and the posts at the bottom hate it. Is this due to having had time to think about it before commenting? In my case no. I came out of the theatre thinking what a good film, but by the morning, what a great film.The mere fact that it plays on the mind, and requires a lot of thought to see some of the holes (yes there are some but not as clearly dismissed as in some other films)gives an indication of the impact it had on me.I had to laugh at the comments over the accents and ""mumbling"". It's called English. It is not ""American English"". I don't criticise American actors for talking in American accents, so please don't do the same to my native tongue.My only advice here is go and see it for yourself if you have not already.

federicaboldrini1984,"Oct 18, 2006",6/10,"""The Prestige"" has everything a film need to be great: two lead actors named Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, for the first time together, a supporting cast including Micheal Caine and Scarlett Johansonn - I felt Johansonn was kind of useless here, though - and the direction of acclaimed Christopher Nolan. Still, it's ultimately unconvincing. Probably it will do big bucks, but don't be fooled by the current 8.5/ 10 user rating: the film's no masterpiece. Sure, it has its high points: great production values, with wonderful costumes and a gorgeous art direction - which succeeded in creating the visionary, sci-fi Victorian age that ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" tried in vain to create with massive digital effects in 2003 - . Most of the performances are strong; the best, in my opinion, is Jackman's. Bale is just a step lower. What didn't convince me is the script. It use a series of cross flashbacks which didn't always work well. The plot, very convoluted, is sometimes repetitive. The ""surpise ending"" is not that big surprise if you have paid attention. Even if its atmosphere of is definitely dark, with some brutal scenes, the Prestige is nothing other than a magic trick played to the audience: it will entertain you for a while, but will leave you nothing much. Maybe's my fault, but I was expecting much more. My rating is 6/10"

TheDentist,"Oct 21, 2008",10/10,"The Prestige, is a film about love, friendship, rivalry, competition, and magic. The film is Christian Bale (Borden) and Hugh Jackman (Angier) who are friends and become enemies as they compete with each other for a number of reasons.Christopher Nolan, the director is perfect for this film, he creates an atmosphere perfect for every scene, will his leads act throughout this atmosphere like it's their own creation. Wally Pfister, director of cinematography should have won an Oscar for this, exaggeration? Watch the film yourself.I can guarantee that you will love this film.

virindra,"Jul 6, 2025",10/10,"The Prestige, directed by Christopher Nolan, tells the mesmerizing story of two young magician, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) ,who start as stage assistants to a second-rate magician, but both dream of headlining their own shows... no matter the cost.What begins as ambition quickly spirals into obsession. After the tragic death of Angier's wife during a stage trick, Angier blames Borden and sets out for revenge. That revenge comes at a painful price, literally, when Borden loses two fingers in a sabotaged act. From there, the rivalry escalates, ruthless and consuming, unraveling both men's lives.The narrative jumps back and forth in time, slowly revealing what drove them, and those around them, to the brink. We see the psychological toll on Borden's wife, leading to her tragic end. And ultimately, Angier frames Borden for murder. Every twist pulls you deeper, until the final reveal leaves you breathless.One of the film's best illusions? David Bowie, brilliantly cast as Nikola Tesla, almost hidden in plain sight. The entire cast shines, though I found Scarlett Johansson's role a bit less impactful than the rest. Jackman and Bale are extraordinary; not just stars in the sky, but supernovas, burning bright with intensity and nuance.With its intricate storytelling, emotional depth, and powerful performances, The Prestige is the full package. It's a story about obsession, sacrifice, identity... and the ultimate question: are these magicians performing for their audience, or for themselves?Christopher Nolan doesn't just direct this film, he orchestrates it like a grand illusion. And I, for one, was completely spellbound.Applause to everyone who made this masterpiece possible. Well done."

ARJANISTAN_IV,"Feb 8, 2025",10/10,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Watching it a second time with a friend I remembered how great of a movie it is. Screenplay, acting, directing, story, etc. I can't think of anything bad about the movie. The twists were amazing. I can't believe this movie never got an Oscar. Christopher Nolan is a genius and yet he only ever won an Oscar for Oppenheimer. The Prestige is better and was only nominated twice. Bale, Jackman, Caine, all amazing performances! Best I've ever seen! You need to watch this movie. It will make your head spin, the twists will have you on edge. The rivalry between these two brilliant yet petty magicians will have you biting your nails!"
exoticoof,"Jun 29, 2025",10/10,"Firstly, why does no one talk about this when Nolan is brought up? This might be his best (maybe Dark Knight is better, not sure). When movies are set in the late 19th century, it ends up being corny. It doesn't here because the characters are so interesting.There are so many plot twists. I thought after one or two, Nolan would stop but he didn't. And no damn plot holes are really left. Maybe questions as to what follows the events of the film, but the ending is so good that I wouldn't want it to show that much.The cast is superb. Christian Bale is basically known at this point for dedicating himself to roles, and this one is no different (albeit a bit less intense). Hugh Jackman does a great job of playing a very intense and obsessed character. Michael Caine is showing up to play what he does best; a sidekick. Scarlett Johannsen has less screentime than the rest, but still kills it in her role of *insert certain spoiler here*.With a runtime of almost 150 minutes, you would think it dulls. Nope. I was glued to the screen at all times. What a shame that this goes unnoticed (partially because a similar film came out after this called ""The Illusionist"" which is not nearly as amazing.Overall, this was damn incredible. If I get 5 likes, I will continue reviewing and this will not be a one off. I am a 16-yo aspiring music critic, but I also love movies."
SrBreton,"Oct 7, 2025",10/10,"""The Prestige"" was absolutely mind-blowing from start to finish. Christopher Nolan once again proves he knows how to play with the audience's mind, making you believe you understand everything-until you realize it was all a trick right in front of you. The tiny clues scattered throughout are genius, and when everything finally comes together, it's pure shock and admiration.I loved how it combines obsession, rivalry, and sacrifice with such precise storytelling that nothing feels wasted. The performances by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale perfectly match the tone-intense and layered. I honestly have no complaints; it's a brilliant, intelligent, and flawlessly directed film. Nolan does it again, and this time with a trick worthy of a standing ovation."
Galina_movie_fan,"Jul 18, 2007",6/10,"""It is inhuman to be so cold"", says one of the film's characters, and that's what ""The Prestige"" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as ""Memento"" meets ""Rashômon"" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked. I prefer ""The Illusionist"" that was released the same year -there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there."
Sanjeev-902,"Jul 23, 2025",10/10,"I just finished watching The Prestige and... wow. I don't even know where to start. This isn't just a movie about magic - it is magic.Christopher Nolan really knows how to mess with your mind. The story keeps you guessing the whole time. Every scene has layers, and by the time you reach the ending, your jaw is just on the floor. I had to pause and say, ""Wait, WHAT?!""Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were both insanely good. Their rivalry felt so personal, so intense, that I almost forgot I was watching a movie. And the themes - obsession, sacrifice, illusion - they hit hard. Like, how far would you go for greatness?Also, David Bowie as Tesla? Absolute legend move.This film didn't just entertain me - it made me think.

ChristopherNolanFan,"Nov 28, 2008",10/10,"Christopher Nolan takes on a Sci-Fi film with a touch of magic as he directs ""The Prestige"". An impressive cast star in it with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in the leads; and Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie supporting as the film plays with the viewer's mind more than any movie has since Nolan's ""Memento"". The use of normal linear plot setting along with flashbacks and flashbacks in flashbacks are what help to accomplish such a perplexing work of genius.Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are rival magicians in an end-of-the-nineteenth-century London. Borden develops a new trick which frustrates Angier and compels him to do things which are almost inconceivable to find out his secret. Cutter (Caine), Angier's illusion creator, insists that Borden uses a double where Borden goes in through one door and the double comes out the other; much to Angier's disbelief, he vows to find out Borden's method and use it to improve his own act.""The Prestige"" is yet another astonishing and remarkable film from the fantastically skillful Christopher Nolan which propels the viewer on a ride through the dark hearts of two men. A solid film from a solid director with a solid cast is reason enough to check this masterpiece out. Upon, multiple viewings the film unravels more and more to reveal its true genius inside and out, highly recommended."
v-16461-59391,"May 25, 2023",8/10,"This is a story without a winner. Because whether it is the absolute worship of success or the inability to give up on hatred, it is destined that this game will never die, the soul will never dissipate, until one party pays a fatal price.Fatal is never magic, fatal is always the darkness of the human heart who does everything to succeed.The setting of the film is in the Victorian era, which not only brings in exquisite and complex costumes, gorgeous and flashy stage backgrounds, and bizarre and psychedelic stories, but also creates an illusion of a distant distance - that is, the restlessness and loss of the human heart that only existed in that era, and now in civilized society, we are rational, restrained, sober, and disdainful.As the old magician said, ""People all hope to be deceived, even for a moment.On our path to success, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, we will not break our souls into pieces or make choices that are both beautiful and gloomy, right?People all hope to be deceived, even for a moment."
Rob_Mck32,"Aug 23, 2025",10/10,"My personal favourite Christopher Nolan movie, this was an exiting battle between two magicians who wanted to be great that escalated throughout the film and ending with not one, but TWO, of cinema's greatest plot twists.Jackman, bale and Johnson were incredible as always as was the trusty Michael Caine. The metaphors, clues and Easter Eggs hidden throughout The Prestige are smart and great on rewatch."
cgtam,"Sep 25, 2023",7/10,"Enjoyable film IF viewer ignores obvious plot flaws. Hugh Jackman is born in ""top class"" in England, meaning he would speak, & have an affluent aura during this time period. He would be forced to act, speak, eat & posses the mannerism of a low class working peasant, which would be exhausting and a magic act in itself.The other big flaw is Bale's double & all prosthetics he wears as disguises. Caine's character is a master & experienced ""magician engineer"" who creates doubles. How can Caine & Hugh NOT see all the fake disguises on Bale's secret double, especially after capturing & interrogating him? Hollywood mission impossible style facial make up wasn't invented yet. Even if modern disguises were used, in real life, one can spot such disguises, especially bc they're BOTH magicians. Viewer gets to see plethora of facial fake parts in Bale's home, & they look truly fake. Last, Caine switching allegiance because he sees the truth at the end- Jackman has so much $$ & freedom due to his birthright, he could have kept his secret from Caine & the ending would've been very different.Acting is excellent from entire cast. If one can not dwell on obvious plot flaws, this film is enjoyable & rewatchable."

baidan,"Dec 14, 2006",7/10,"What can I say, wow! I almost missed this movie in theaters. I looked at number of reviews and got a sense that this movie is about obsessed magician revivals, and how important professional life to those who care. Yesterday, while rearranging my Netflix queue I noticed to my surprise that movie is one of 250 best rated movies. So after short research I found one theater where movie was still playing. Movie certainly was worth the effort. It is somewhat similar to ""Usual Suspects"", but better since, I can much easily associate myself with magician then with criminal. I tracked at least three nested stories, it has absolutely unexpected ending, and movie is very logical if you analyze it afterward. Scarlett Johansson acting was average but other actors just took me there. I believed every word. If you can still catch it in a theater, go, and if not happy DVD viewing."
orkunyasa,"May 17, 2019",10/10,Thid movie is my favorite movie. This movie change my life.
MovieAddict2016,"Nov 6, 2006",10/10,"""The Prestige"" got some bad reviews early on, and at one point it was listed on RottenTomatoes.com with less than 30% fresh rating. I went to see it, as a result, with mixed expectations. On one hand, I think Christian Bale is the next great method actor and I firmly believe Christopher Nolan is on the pathway to really carving out a name for himself in Hollywood (beyond the fanboy audiences). He's still being advertised as ""The Director of Memento and Batman Begins"" but soon it will just be ""From Director Christopher Nolan.""As for the film? Exceptional. Inventive, unique and twisted. Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career-making performances. It's by far Jackman's best performance on film (in a serious role) and one of Bale's best, which is saying a lot. This guy can do anything. It's amazing to see him in ""The Machinist"" a few weeks ago and then turn around and see him here. Within the past year alone he's moved up many ranks in my book. (Of course, I don't have a book. But if I did...)The film is dark, and its blend of reality with sudden fantasy may throw some viewers off. But I don't think it's a cop-out, as some people have claimed. It's just Nolan's style. Batman incorporated many different genres and themes that one wouldn't necessarily expect from, of all things, a Batman film - and here The Prestige delivers some magical material that I didn't see coming. Even knowing the ending ahead of time (after it was ruined by an ignorant IMDb user who thought it would be funny to spam people with the ending), it still came as a shock in delivery.What I finally felt so satisfied with was the film's direction, acting and character development. With a lesser director it could have easily been a lame exercise in style over substance and a flashy, gimmicky ending. Nolan elevates it and the two lead performances are really engaging. It works as a morality tale as well as an intense character study that has you alternately rooting for both men to succeed. And the film changes perceptions of past events so often that by the end you're kind of sitting there, shocked that it's played out so vastly different than what was expected.Chilling, gripping movie. Had me consistently engaged from beginning to end, and I'd say in some ways it's the most well-made Nolan film yet."
crusherro,"Jan 28, 2007",10/10,"Depicting the story of two magicians, who develop a rivalry that eventually turns out into a true war, ""The Prestige"" is a movie that keeps you connected all throughout its two hours. Some people said about it that sometimes the action tends to be boring, but I consider exactly the opposite: I didn't have the time to get bored, due to the very well-written story. The actors are amazing: Hugh Jackman - charming yet sometimes scary, as we know him, and Christan Bale, more lively but equally ""strong"" as in Batman Begins, are the two rival magicians. Their act is sustained by Michael Caine, as their mentor, and Scarlett Johansson. I didn't go to this movie expecting much, but after having seen it, I can say without any doubt that this is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time, and I strongly recommend it. It's a film to savor and to feel (and eventually maybe to love)!"
matt-2177,"Nov 21, 2006",10/10,"Quite simply, THE best movie of the year (closely followed by Rian Johnson's Brick). Intelligent, witty, excellently shot (a superb mix of breathtaking pans and establishing shots and very involving hand-held/steadi shots), with the finest actor of a generation (Caine) and very likely his successor (Bale).No spoilers here, as unlike Memento,The Prestige's tricks can be worked out before they are revealed, and audiences will have great fun doing so. This is a tale of rival Victorian magicians, whose obsessions lead each into darker and darker places as Jackman's Angier seeks revenge for the death of his wife, and Bale's Borden looks to prove himself the better of the two magicians. Even without the mystery, twists and turns, this story is an excellent character study, something that carries the picture and at times supersedes the mystery and science fiction elements of the plot.Like Memento, it has a non-linear narrative, though not such an extreme one...the narrative is played out in three stages, like the magic tricks within it - first the pledge, then the turn, finally the prestige. It can be followed easily enough by anybody with a decent attention span, and reaps great rewards for those who follow it closely enough to try and fathom its mysteries. As with magic, the trick is not what has been done, but HOW it has been accomplished.Nolan is fast proving himself (along with David Lynch) the master of non-linear narrative film-making. His movies put the non-linear pretenders in their place (you know who you are), and shows that, even in this age of mass-consumption and dumbing down, movie audiences can be allowed to think, and don't need everything spelled out for them.Can't wait for Oscars night, if this doesn't walk home with a few (Nolan particularly, Bale and Caine) then there is NO JUSTICE!!!"
mgm-43,"Jul 5, 2007",8/10,"If all you read are some of the other comments here, you might think  ""The Prestige"" is a cheat and a disappointment. And maybe if you are  watching it with a superficial mindset, it is. But if you really pay  attention, and delve into the many layers of story, you will see the  movie as so much better than that.  Two magicians rival to be the best, and this movie takes you through  many years of that rivalry, along with the resulting jealousy, anger,  betrayal, and ethic and moral dilemma. Oh, and did I mention death,  disfigurement, and deception? The performances are gripping, and the  production is stunning, creating a believable setting that draws you  into the story. I did experience some moments of confusion when the  time lines jumped into the past or present a bit abruptly. But in the  end, most questions will be answered. It's important to remember,  though, that the most compelling question is not what was real and what  was deception, but rather, how far do you allow yourself to go to prove  you're the best?"
pantera1,"Feb 12, 2007",9/10,"Antici..................................pation!( With apologies to the Rocky Horror etc,etc.)The Prestige is the third act in a magic show where the magic is presented. (The first two are called the pledge and the turn)The basic premise is of two magicians at the end of the 19th Century who become mortal enemies over a woman. And, as important, their rivalry in search of the greatest magic trick. And naturally the dilemma of what you can lose when you want to win, damn the consequences.The protagonists are superbly played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, ably supported by Michael Caine and assisted by Scarlet (why her, again?) Johannssen.Bale who was the boy in the exquisite EMPIRE OF THE SUN (9/10) and, of course, the not so personable anti-hero in American PSYCHO (8/10) as well as the latest Batman incarnation, is growing into his roles. He is on the cusp of A list status and thoroughly deserves it.This film is like an exotic buffet; exquisitely crafted, beautifully presented with oddities and interests available throughout. Moody and electric, it captures the time and era beautifully. It is another feather in the amazing Christopher (MEMENTO (9/10) Nolan's cap. He's become a name director that you can trust with your hard-earned moolah.Especially interesting in reality was the whole story of the Edison/Tesla feud which was only touched on here. Tesla was basically the person who invented AC current and then was shafted by Edison. Watch for an interesting cameo appearance here. And Andy (gollum) Serkis in a non-digitized role.THE PRESTIGE was really magic."
onona,"Nov 28, 2006",10/10,"Truly the most original and stylish film I have seen in many long months, The Prestige is simultaneously intriguing, shocking, dramatic and dark. It's so refreshing to see a film like this amidst the rest of the rubbish that Hollywood tends to churn out at this time of the year.Beautifully shot, the film is visually stunning. The actors performances are all fantastic as well, and it's great to see Jackman in an unusually dark role - watching his obsession take over him slowly until he turns into a very unpleasant character was an interesting departure from his usual roles. Bale delivers a great performance as well.I won't expand on the storyline as many here have already done that, suffice to say that although they deviated somewhat from the original books storyline, the films ending is nevertheless well-crafted and executed.Definitely one to purchase for the DVD collection! A must-see."
fatmaninatrenchcoat,"Jan 27, 2007",10/10,"I've been a fan of Nolan for a long time, ever since Memento. He has the ability to create mood and deep, well rounded characters better than almost anyone in the thriller genre, ever. For my money, only Hitchcock was better. And the Prestige was something worthy of the Master himself. Its is a dark, twisty, surreal film that truly goes unexpected places. Nothing is what it seems. And Nolan manages to pull of the twists, turns and surprises expertly, never once make a jump in logic that you don't take with him without question. The acting is phenomenal, Bale, Jackman and Caine are all excellent. But it is Jackman who owns this film. Between this and The Fountain (which I still don't know if I liked or not) he has really come into his own as an actor. Its a shame he was completely ignored at awards time this year. Towards the end of the year, there were some truly great films, but this is unquestionably the best. Its a well paced, thoughtful, intricate thriller that is better written than almost anything I have seen in years. Nolan is one of the most talented directors of his generation, something he continues to prove film after film. Howmany of todays ""franchise"" directors take a break in the middle of a superhero franchise to make a moody, dark period thriller about dueling magicians? The man is a master, only a notch below Hitchcock himself, and this film is his masterwork, so far."
protektr,"Oct 20, 2006",9/10,"""The Prestige"" is the kind of movie you wish will come after sitting through 25 other bad movies. Simply put, this is the best drama I've seen all year. Set in the late 1800's in (mostly) London, the film is about two rival magicians who continually ""one up"" another on magic acts. The film stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine. Caine plays the mentor of both magicians. The movie is shot out of order and sort of begins with the end. But just when you think you know how the movie really ends, it throws you for a huge twist. I won't divulge into the plot because if I do I'll spoil a lot of it. Let me just say this: I've seen so many movies that very, very few of them are able to surprise me at the end. This is one of those few movies. I was caught completely off guard with the final twist.In the first hour of the film I quickly realized that this movie is NOT the movie you've seen advertised in theaters and on TV. The trailer makes Bale out to have real magical powers and Jackman out to be the copycat magician. As it turns out, neither is true. (That is NOT a spoiler). This is quickly realized within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The trailer's deception left a sour taste in my mouth, but by the end of the movie you soon figure out why the film's trailer was so deceptive; it's all part of the magic. I can only surmise the trailer was so deceptive because they simply didn't want to give away juicy plot details and spoilers. And I'm glad for it! Normally I despise a film when it's misrepresented in a trailer, but by the end of the movie I had forgotten all about the stupid trailer.The performances were all very, very strong. However, it's Christian Bale that shines in this film. This is probably his strongest performance yet. (The 2nd strongest being his manic role in ""The Machinist."") That's right folks, he was nothing in Batman Begins compared to this movie. Anyways, don't be surprised if he gets some sort of nod from the Academy or the Globes for his role in this.This is the movie that ""The Illusionist"" tried to be. If you were left disappointed with ""The Illusionist"" (as I was), you owe it to yourself to see this magic movie. You'll be happy you did."

But, after all, aren't all the boxes part of the first one?When you wake up in the morning, you look at yourself in the mirror in front of you. This movie adds another mirror, behind your back. And then the pictures of you in the mirror become more and more; you don't have to turn back. But, after all, aren't all the pictures showing just one face?You've got a hundred-dollar bill in your wallet. This movie just turns it into five dollars'. Then into one's. And then into coins. But, after all, haven't you got one hundred dollars?At the beginning this movie is simple, ordinary, like an anonymous box, like your picture in the mirror, like an hundred-dollar bill. But then the best of all the living directors, Christopher Nolan, adds one, then two, then three more little things, and everything becomes faster, darker, deeper. And at the end you can just clap your hands: after all, isn't it just a movie?"

All of the surprises were genuine and I really had to think about what was going on. That's rare for me, and I like David Lynch.This was just such an effective film in terms of sophisticated entertainment. Not a film to miss. I don't want to say anymore because I could very well ruin something for you, which is not something I want to do. Just see it, and when you do, go into it blind and without any preconceived notions.

tuMrsBatman,"Mar 23, 2007",10/10,"If I could be granted one wish it would be that I could give The Prestige an 11 rating. It's an outstanding movie, far from anything you've ever seen. At first, my only motives for seeing this movie were seeing it with this kid I liked and because I'm madly in love with Christian Bale. I didn't pay much attention to my date. I was completely entranced by this movie. Normally I can detect upcoming plot twists and foreshadowing gives everything away to me. But in The Prestige... it's an exceptionally excellent plot. I was terribly surprised... not that it was terrible... it was exciting. The acting is superb. Absolutely and powerfully believable. I get very into things, like books, video games, and especially movies. Watching this movie got rather intense. The effects are amazing. It's a bit of a fairy tale but it seems so real. As someone put it, The Prestige is ""storytelling at it's best."" I concur, 100%. I am making a list of movies you must see before you die. The Prestige is definitely on it. This is hands-down, thumbs-up, one of the best movies I have ever seen and I'm exceptionally proud to call myself a fan of Christian Bale and The Prestige."
rwgrider,"Feb 23, 2007",10/10,"I rarely sit down to write a review for a film I have seen, but this movie is well worth my time.I have seen it three times, and honestly have thoroughly enjoyed it all three times. I have seen hundreds upon hundreds of movies, and I cannot at the moment think of another I can say this about.So what is it about the prestige? Is it the BEST story? Is it the BEST acting? Is it the BEST cinematography? I would say the answer to these three questions is probably no, not BEST, but very very good. When a film can succeed in such a way on so many levels, it makes a lasting impression. The Prestige is definitely this type of movie, and one of the most entertaining I've ever seen.The acting is marvelous. Maybe nothing Oscar worthy, but this movie didn't call for that type of role. Christian Bale is perfectly mysterious, Hugh Jackman is spot on as a revenge seeking widower, and Michael Caine adds exactly the right support to bring it all together.The cinematography and art direction really give this movie the mood it needs to be memorable. You will be sucked in to its mystery, and each scene will keep you on the brink of illusion and reality.Christopher Nolan's touch of teeter tottering timelines may frustrate the casual viewer, but it will challenge and entertain those who are ready to tackle the secrets of the film. You will be guessing and guessing, hoping for that home run of an ending, and trust me...it's a grand slam. You will not be disappointed. Better than Memento.But what is it that takes this from a great movie to a masterpiece? For me it was the sounds. The mysterious score added wonder to all the right moments, making this more than a movie, but an experience that I will look forward to being a part of again and again.Every element was there, every aspect executed in superb fashion. A 10 if there ever could be one. Movie-making magic!"
ExpendableMan,"Mar 18, 2007",9/10,"When Christopher Nolan decided not to make the follow up to Batman Begins in order to concentrate on this, my reaction could be gauged as somewhere between disappointment and pathetic, howling cries of grief and anguish as I wept fanboy tears of despair. However, upon seeing it, I am definitely glad he did because The Prestige is one of the most enjoyable films from 2006 I've seen: a twisty turny epic about two rival magicians in Victorian era London trying to out do each other with more twists than a contortionists convention.The story revolves around two men: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), former friends turned bitter enemies after a tragic accident during one of their shows. Angier is the showman of the two, a good magician blessed with the fact he's got natural charisma practically gushing out of his ears. Borden on the other hand is a man brimming over with skill and invention, but has a rather dull personality compared to his rival. Constantly trying to outdo one another, Angier discovers that Borden has invented a new illusion called The Transported Man and becomes obsessed with discovering his secrets. Unable to do so, he creates his own version and sets in motion a spiralling chain of events that can only lead to the destruction of them both...From out of this premise, Nolan creates an engrossing and highly enjoyable film. Jackman and Bale quite rightly burn up the screen, with Bale in particular going a long way towards justifying his reputation as one of the finest actors of his generation. There's a very strong emphasis on the spectacle of the magic industry as well, so to watch the two men performing their tricks is a riveting experience, not least of all when Angier perfects his version of the Transported Man and winds up travelling to the other side of a vast theatre in the space of two seconds. As with all magic, half the fun is trying to figure out how they do it, the other half is not knowing.Unlike real life magic shows however, it's not all fun and games because for all it's showboating, The Prestige is still a very dark movie. Angry young men have always been strongly characterised in Nolan's movies and Angier and Borden are no exceptions. They are both sympathetic, realistic and detestable in equal measure, each man getting multi faceted characterisations to the extent that it's difficult to know which one to root for. The only downside of this is that the rest of the cast, with the exception of Michael Caine's venerable old master, don't get such loving time devoted to them. Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah in particular is a very sad character, worthy of a lot more screen time given Hall's fantastic performance.Thankfully though, this is the only real complaint about the entire movie and isn't quite so noticeable on the first viewing when you get swept up in the duo's battle of wits amidst the fantastically recreated Victorian London. This confirms Nolan's reputation as one of the most talented storytellers in Hollywood today and is another glowing addition to his already impressive resume. And if the attraction of two men locked in a complex and vicious cycle of revenge isn't enough to justify a viewing...well, it also has Scarlet Johansson waltzing around in a skimpy corset. Try and resist it now."
mjg32,"Mar 16, 2007",10/10,"The Prestige is one of the best films I've ever seen. It is totally unique, keeps you gripped throughout and the plot is so clever and original. You don't see many films about magicians, maybe thats why I found this to be so interesting, and I doubt we'll ever see a better one. The film is not really about magic though. It is about obsession. It is about deception. By the end, Robert Angier (Jackman) is a magician for totally different reasons than when he started, and I think this quote shows his obsession not just to be a better magician than Borden (Bale), but to make Borden crash and burn.""I need to know his secret."" ""Why?"" ""So I can do it better.""By the end, it is difficult to tell who you are supposed to be rooting for, because both main characters aren't exactly good guys, and I think this makes the film very unique. It is not about good triumphing over evil, rather it is about how you can get so caught up in one thing that it rules the rest of your life, and the dangers of becoming obsessed.The acting in the film is superb. If you went to see a professional magician, you'd see the showmanship and antics that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman perform in The Prestige. The special effects are fantastic, as are the illusions that are performed. Michael Caine is, as always, brilliant. He is still proving to be one of the best supporting actors in the business. Scarlett Johansson is also excellent.Christopher Nolan's direction is, obviously, brilliant. This is a fantasy film, and he has still made it look completely real. I also think his screenplay for all of his films, especially this one, is the best by anybody. Never does he just put things in front of you to watch. The non-chronological order he uses means that as you go along, any questions you may have are answered along the way, and this makes for a wonderful cinematic experience. I think this sets his films apart from other directors'. In summary, I think it's safe to say that Christopher Nolan is the real magician here."
vic_vector,"May 21, 2007",10/10,"I totally enjoyed this film from beginning to end. The acting, costumes, and locations were superb. Funny, the only other movie I've enjoyed as much this year was ""The Illusionist"". (Pick a card, any card....) I've always been interested in the life and times of Nikola Tesla. This movie was a great tribute to this misunderstood, brilliant scientist. Yes, just like time-travel scenarios, this film makes you think but not enough to give you a brain cramp. It's twists and turns rival the most demanding road rally track and will keep you involved the whole time. Not too many films do that for me anymore. It's a terrific way to spend 130 minutes. Be sure to have plenty of popcorn on hand."
voltavas,"Jan 26, 2007",9/10,"When The Illusionist ended, it felt like there just wasn't enough of the theme. Just how perfect was this movie? Period piece, great cinematography, great editing, colors, contrasts, actors, script, plot, revelation and it was all about a turn of the century magician. Here's an era that hasn't been explored much in Cinema. It got a 5 outta 5 from this reviewer.The Prestige gathers Batman Begins' two stars, Christian Bale and Michael Caine and thankfully forgot to include the dreadful Katie Holmes. So with the perfect trifecta of players known to work well together, Nolan adds another player, Hugh Jackman, aka The Wolverine. But the superb actor roster does not end here. Andy Serkis of Gollum fame plays the eccentric assistant to the even more eccentric real-world historical figure, Tesla, played by the best actor to play such freaks, and a true Rock God, David Bowie, who is barely recognizable in the his first scenes. And of course the feminine presence is filled by current Thinking Man's Goddess, Scarlett Johansson as the lovely assistant to our dueling magicians. You see the story isn't plain, it's quite complicated.Two aspiring magicians, are hired as crowd plants for the star magician's tricks that involve the use of spectators. Here's the setup. We have an aging magician touring around Europe and his trustee engineer Cutter, or ingénieur, as he tells the court, played by Michael Caine, brilliantly of course. There's of course the lovely assistant who happens to be the wife of crowd plant, Robert Angier (Jackman). During the preparation for the water tank escape, it is Angier's job to tie her legs and Alfred Borden's (Bale) responsibility to tie her hands. On one fateful evening, even after being told not to use certain not, Borden does so. The assistant unable to escape drowns in the tank. This drives a rift between Angier and Borden and in sue turns them into rivals; a vindictive rivalry that goes beyond the ends of science, physics and ethics.At first we see the sides of both magicians trying to pick up the remains after the tragedy. But always watchful of each other they will endlessly pursue the crippling of the other's life and career as magicians. Whether it's ruining the act or even using real ammunition during a bullet catching trick. There's nothing one won't do to one-up his adversary. When Borden comes up with The Transported Man, a trick where he seemingly enters a placard and comes out another one on the stage, within the time it takes for a ball to bounce; Angier is haunted with this astonishing trick which he can't seem to reproduce without using an actor as a double. This very trick begins the downward spiral into madness both men will experience. Angier's interpretation of the act is exposed by a disguised Borden. The event leaves a humiliated Angier with a very broken leg and with an empty theater.This leads him to sequester Borden's assistant for ransom. The demanded ransom is the key word to decrypt Borden's stolen magic trick book. This key, which is of course trickery, leads Angier to Colorado Springs to meet the eccentric Tesla facing hostilities from his own personal rival, Thomas Edison. This is where we learn about obsession and how it drives men like Tesla and Angier. Tesla believes he has created a teleportation device. But it has a few bugs that need working out. But Angier' is too eager to spend his fortune acquiring this device to bring his career back to greatness and finally defeat his nemesis, Borden.For those who don't know about Tesla, he is considered to have invented the 20th century. He created wireless communication in 1893 and Alternative Current (AC) and was the object of utmost frustration and competition to the better known Edison. Tesla was considered mad by some for theories about science-fiction worthy concepts, like a global wireless telecommunications network. Yeah he sure was wacky huh? Now I won't say much more about The Prestige's story line simply because it would ruin the fun. But be assured that this movie is great and parallels the brilliance that was The Illusionist but with the slight difference, that The Transported Man isn't a trick. And there are many, many twists in the storyline that may or may not be expected but only add to the complexity and richness of the story.Every little detail in the environment is taken care of as much as possible to transport the viewer into this magical world. Nothing is spared to make the storytelling as real and believable as possible, even in its most fantastical moments. Every major actor in this movie gives Oscar worthy performances. Not just one of them, but all of them. Nolan cannot go unnoticed this year for the best movie statuette, best writing, and best direction.If someone can reinvent intelligent cinema, it's a man like Nolan. He's proved it time after time. Memento, Batman Begins and now The Prestige.I will end this review here, for fear of revealing too much of its secrets. It would be like taking off the icing and leaving you with the cake. This movie must be seen by anyone who loves cinema that isn't packed with Hollywoodisms, clichés, gratuitous fireballs and puerile sexiness. If you haven't figured it out yet, The Prestige gets 5 abracadabras outta 5."
Vishal_s_kumar,"Aug 18, 2009",9/10,"When Christopher Nolan made his debut into American cinemas with Memento, film-lovers witnessed the first rumblings of a creative genius who brought innovation and artistic flair to theaters with his unique visual and narrative style. Since that time, I've eagerly awaited each of his subsequent films with the hope that his unique cinematic style would continue to develop. I haven't been disappointed. In 2005, Mr. Nolan directed what many fans believe to be, arguably, the best of the Batman films, finding both critical and box-office success. As a surprise to those expecting a sequel to Batman Begins, Mr. Nolan has instead produced a subtly staggering film about personal and professional rivalry between two magicians. The Prestige finds Mr. Nolan again in top form and re-teaming with his Batman Begins star, Christian Bale.The Prestige is an extremely complex film surrounding the conflict, jealousy and vengefulness that haunts two rival magicians. The story is told in a skewed timeline not unlike Memento. If anything, The Prestige's timeline is more intricate as the story shifts between several viewpoints and jumps around in time throughout the film. While this might sound confusing, this complex narrative never loses the viewer's attention or makes the movie less enjoyable. The multi-faceted approach instead pulled me in completely. It is one of my favorite films. As far as plot is concerned, I think it is best to omit most of The Prestige's details from this review as it relies heavily on numerous plot twists and surprises. I'd hate to ruin that for anyone. Suffice it to say, I found the subplot involving famed inventor Nikola Tesla to be a story-telling masterstroke. For those of you familiar with the inventions of Tesla, his involvement in the plot will be a definite highlight. It's also worthwhile to note that The Prestige has incredible replay value. This is a film that demands repeat viewings and delivers more surprises and depth with each look."

marcoottogalli,"Feb 15, 2025",10/10,"Probably the most underrated film of all time.Until 2 years ago I had never heard of it, and now it is among my favorite films.Here in Italy almost no one knows this movie and yet it is an absurd thriller.Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine are spectacular, Nolan's non-linear narrative makes everything more captivating and compelling and furthermore, the surprise ending is truly one of the best plot twists in the history of cinema, perhaps the greatest along with Shutter Island.The element that makes this film so unique is its theatricality.Film that deserved some Oscars.If you don't love The Prestige you don't like the genre or you didn't watched It closely."
denise-882-139023,"Oct 8, 2022",10/10,"This a favourite film of mine. Unusual premise, unusual characters, yes, as I said, quirky.All the actors give a fine performance.It is a revenge film to end all revenge films.A film about the exploits of magicians, may not sound promising.Would be creepy films based on vaudeville acts are usually about ventriloquists and their maniacal dummies, think ""Dead of Night"" with Michael Redgrave.This film is full of obsession and seething hatred, which ultimately damages love, sanity and people. Overall, it is a fairly dark film, one well worth persevering with.Given it is a film about magicians there are plenty of twists. The title of the film ""The Prestige"" relates to the final twist of a magic trick."
Young211,"Sep 29, 2019",10/10,Nolan has dropped the obsessive stage magicians fiction of back in 19C London an absolutely stunning way.Exquisite supporting characters and props are delivering the fiction more believable. The Prestige shows the genius way to develop characters in a critical situation. The Prestige is the most entertaining but masterpiece of magician film of all time.
Jdidalot,"Aug 5, 2012",9/10,"After watching the newest Nolan's film: The Dark Knight Rises, a real let down, I had to remind myself how good of a director Mr. Christopher Nolan is. I watched for the 4th time the Prestige.Contrary to Following and Memento, you do not know until the end that there is something more than what you see Until the end!. And then you watch it again and notice all the clues. It's one of these plots which seems so simple but as in magic tricks, nothing is what it seems.It's a great screen play of Christopher Priest's novel. The cast is incredible and Christian Bale needs to be congratulated for his versatility.Mr. Nolan did it again and the illusion is great. I was wondering how he could out do Following and Memento and he pulled one over my eyesagain.No, I won't tell you the plot because other people already did that and if I was to tell you more I would be spoiling the movie for you. Let's just say that I would have hated to have missed watching such a great movie. Please, enjoy it and know that you won't be disappointed.In fact, you will remember the Prestige for quite a while."
shortstuff-3,"Oct 30, 2006",6/10,"After seeing the movie, I was surprised by the number of 8, 9, and 10 stars that people gave it, saying things like it was ""the best movie of the year"". I must disagree. This is a movie worth watching for entertainment's sake, since individual aspects of the movie are top notch, but overall I would leave movie of the year to something like The Departed instead.Pro's:1) Very good acting2) Unique plot3) Nice effects, especially when you see how magic ""really"" gets done4) Believable characters -you definitely empathize with both main characters, despite their treachery5) Extremely tight plot. It brings to mind the Harry Potter books, actually - every little detail is important and plays a role. Things that you are think are periphery turn out to lead you to the conclusion. Good foreshadowingCon's:1) So, so so predictable. I was shocked that people were surprised by the ending2) Inconsistent idea. This movie tried to be about two things. It wanted to be about the plot twist/rivalry, but it also had a theme in the age-old ""is there magic"" question. As stated in the previews and other reviews, there're some surreal sci-fi aspects to the movie. This was very disappointing.3) There are a few irritating inconsistencies that just make it hard to suspend belief and get into the movie. I won't put any spoilers here - but suffice it to say the movie lost cohesiveness in anything involving sci fi or the final twist.4) The flash-forward flash-back nature of the story telling did not add anything to the mystery of the story - it just leaves you irritated and confused for the first 20 minutes (who is reading whose diary again? Is this before or after the last thing that happened? etc)All in all, the plot was very well constructed and the idea was great. In general the acting was good and it was well directed. It was just missing that extra ""oomph"" that turns and interesting movie into a fabulous one. There was something a little too predictable about all of the plot twists, and something a little inconsistent about the theme of the movie that prevented me from really praising it."
TheMirrorVision,"Oct 27, 2006",10/10,"I have long been a fan of Christopher Nolan's Memento and Batman Begins, so I was expecting very much from this film. Not only were my expectations met, they were surpassed. The genius of this film tied in with the subtle nuances of cinematography and signature Nolanisms (voice overs) created a masterful work truly worthy of the title The Prestige. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Andy Serkis, David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson all performed wonderfully with each actor fully melded with their on-screen persona.Once again Nolan is a master of time and he uses this to a great advantage in a similar fashion to Memento.Without a doubt, this movie is recommended with two thumbs way up. Missing this spectacle would be very unfortunate."
mindtricks,"Feb 25, 2021",7/10,I don't know why this movie has such a high score. The movie is ok but there are much better films that have lower scores.
krocheav,"Jan 7, 2021",3/10,"Such a fuss has been made of this movie that I expected something out-of-the-box, and for anyone willing to believe the unbelievable it might even seem so. It's another example of how movie goers and makers have embraced the format of 'Style over Substance'. Everything about the story is so far-fetched and unbelievable that most of the time it's simply not worth even considering the outcomes. It's presented as if its fiction-fact, then swings into ridiculous science-fiction. IE; Human Cloning in the 1890's!If it weren't for some reasonably convincing performances from the leads, stylish art direction and production design, moody lighting and cinematography (except for some unsteady hand-held sections) this production would have fallen over in a heap. As it is, it holds its own based on stylish looks smothered in over-done smoke and mirrors camouflage. Many seem to go for this style and bluster but some will come away feeling cheated and taken for fools (and not in any sort of a good way), it doesn't do to think too much about this type of superficial writing. Characters are bleak and over-the-top nasty, not leaving much (if anything) to admire."
tim-410,"Aug 24, 2009",10/10,"If the script for The Prestige was found in Shakespeare's house, it would credibly be accepted as his work. It is firmly based in period facts, and goes beyond them. It has the gorgeous talent of allegory, appealing to all, and to each at different levels. If you follow them all, the movie will bring a shiver to your spine when, as layers of reality, each as real as the next, are peeled away in this shrewed screen play, revealing men and man, women and woman, tragedy and joy.So many fragments of the story mirror others: wife's and partners and girl-friends and Daedalus-like science... yet the film holds them all clear in mind. The film itself is finely crafted: gorgeous detailed sets reward the eye, and multiple viewings.The casting is perfect: Bale at his driven, rather than simply raging best. Jackman, so brilliantly failed and jealous, Scarlet and Rebecca hall, in a partnership completely distinct from VIcky Cristina, but which must surely have alerted Woody Allen's eye.David Bowie is perfect and his own fame helps convey Tesla's own struggle with being ahead of his time. The presence of Andy Serkis (You MUST see him in Einstein and Eddington) is becoming a code for must-see movie.This is, simply, one of the best movies of the decade."
mark0687,"Oct 28, 2006",10/10,"WOW! It's been a long time since we've seen a decent film that excels in almost all aspects. Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Acting, to name a few, were all just amazing. Then again after Memento and Batman Begins...could we've expected anything less from ace director Christopher Nolan. The Prestige keeps you guessing throughout the movie and alternates the role of 'good guy' and 'bad guy' between the two protagonists with such subtlety that by the end you're not biased to one or the other character, rather, you understand where each of them is coming from. A strong story and good acting by both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman make this film even more gripping. Scarlet Johanssen puts in her two cents...but is overshadowed by the male leads. I must say...one of the best films I've seen! 10/10"
shraik-2,"Jan 12, 2007",10/10,"All I really want to say is that Christopher Nolan is The King of the little details in modern cinema. And the mixture of talent and perfectionism in this film/guy is close to frightening. So watch very very close (to be read as: ""Watch the movie AT LEAST one more time"") and you will be deeply and utterly rewarded. Another thing is the brilliant cast. Kudos to everyone involved but the three big names are these of Caine, Bale and Jackman (in that order). Phenomenaly presented witty screenplay, with unexpected twists and some really fresh humour. But make no mistake, this is not a comedy, the jokes will only make you feel a little bit more cosy. What you will also experience is a masterly Nolan-blend between reality and mysticism.Thousand thumbs up for a genius at play! 10/10"
nickmesafilms,"Jun 2, 2011",10/10,"Christopher Nolan, the master of tricking the mind, comes back with his biggest hit since ""Memento"". ""The Prestige"" takes place in the Victorian era, where two rival magicians battle it out for each other's magic secrets, to create a more better magic trick, which will soon lead to serious consequences. The movie leads into unexpected moments, serious flashbacks, and edge-on-your-seat thrills. This film really tricked up my mind really well. There were many scenes in the movie that lead to twists and turns later on. Christopher Nolan is the only person that has a mind to trick the audience, and has a power to make a difficult puzzle of a movie that entertains audiences, and make them watch it over and over to understand the concept. The effects are glorious, the performances were superb, the music is dark, the film editing is super, the art direction is superb and the cinematography is golden. With a brilliant cast portrayed by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, & David Bowie, a mind-bending script by the Nolan Brothers, and a powerful plot containing twists and turns, ""The Prestige"" is a marvelous Nolan masterpiece, and it never disappoints! ""The Prestige"", in my review, ""A mind-bending puzzle that's fun to watch again and again""."
demon-drifter,"Jan 31, 2007",10/10,"It is not often that we are given the privilege to see a truly original story, not a remake with different faces and effects but instead a unique tale. It is a regular complaint by movie enthusiasts that the business is dominated by copied or reworked story lines. This film has consistently pushed the boundaries just as the Matrix did when it was first released. Not many movies can boast such a debate over the tiny details or the implications of the actions of each character. When the machine is first seen in its detail, the ruthlessness of Angier is truly discovered. While movies such as the Sixth Day attempt to debate the ethics of such a device, The Prestige simply uses it to highlight the greed and burning ambition of a man. This movie is very complex in its themes and plot and it is encouraging to see a film that forces the viewer to think and review the storyline again and again to try and determine the truth. Is it not also ironic that while we the viewers are attempting to seek the truth, so the characters are seeking to disillusion us, just like a magic act. We are forced, in a sense, into volunteering for the magician which shows us in the end how incredibly well thought out this storyline really is. Cutter seems to sum it all up for us - 'Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled.'"
travisbickle76-1,"Oct 16, 2007",N/A,"At one point in the film, Hugh Jackman's character says ""That was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen."" I walked out of the theater thinking the same goddamn thing! This whole movie is just one big trick that the filmmakers have pulled on you, and by the time it's over, you'll realize that you just spent a couple bucks on a huge, two-hour magic trick. This may be my favorite movie ever. Just when you think you know what's going on, something else happens! It is very, very complicated stuff. There are flashbacks upon flashbacks, and it may be a little difficult to follow. Acting a key element in this film, and it's mostly great. Christian Bale carries it all on his shoulders, as he truly is the ""Prestige"" to the film's great rick, which I will not reveal. Hugh Jackman is good as the magician who grows mad with power, but Bale far surpasses him. Michael Caine is as memorable as always, but he's essentially playing a harsher version of the character he played in ""Batman Begins"". One of the best performances comes from Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife, who becomes confused and depressed after he loses his former glory. Scarlett Johannson isn't really offered much to work with but she does have a few memorable moments. The films final twists and turns will leave you so shocked that you realize everything you were going to say you hated about the movie, you now love. See this magic trick. It's very dark and depressing stuff, but you know that you want to be fooled."
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"May 6, 2007",7/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningLondon, the turn of the Century. Magic is where the money is, turning the crowds out in their droves. And the top magicians of the times are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale.) They are rivals, but friendly rivals, engaging in a healthy sense of competition with each other. But Borden publicly denounces the tiredness of Angier repeatedly churning out the same crowd-pleasing tricks and demands something new. So they team up to pull off an idea of Borden's together, with tragic results. Angier's wife is killed and, blaming Borden, they become bitter rivals. But when Borden comes up with a new and innovative idea that wows the crowds, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to unwork it. So obsessed, bitterness, betrayal and murder become par for the course.Director Nolan seems obsessed with becoming Britain's answer to M Night Shyamalan with his high-concept sort of movies. He's doing a better job of it of late, that's for sure, and with the next Batman movie out soon, he's going to get the most commercial drive. But in between he's managed to make The Prestige, which will be unforgettable but not because it's great.Well, it's quite a good movie, if you can follow it, which I'm not sure many will be able to. This is such a complicated and multi-layered story that you'll be scratching your head more than once while it runs. But that, of course, actually makes it all the more intelligent, and you can't complain about that.The title, by the way, refers to the final act of the magic act, which Michael Caine's character guides us through in the early stages of the film. As he's stated before, he only acts for the joy of it these days without commanding a hefty fee, but there's nothing wrong with his performance here. He's just the start of the supporting cast, which also includes Andy Serkis and a surprise appearance from musician David Bowie.A good film, then, but maybe a bit too complicated and off-puttingly so for some viewers. #241 in the IMDb Top 250 is pushing it a bit. ***"

diac228,"Mar 13, 2007",6/10,"In a magic trick it usually consists of a hook, line, and sinker. The magician presents the scenario, proves its impossibility, and then defies the odds. How the trick is pulled off, magicians usually don't reveal. In movie-making however, it doesn't quite work in the same fashion. If you present a film that raises questions and the end of the final act does not answer them, then you have yourself a panned and wildly criticized film. The only kinds of questions that can remain unanswered are that which bare little importance to the main plot itself. Tarantino mastered this, by giving unanswered questions to almost all his films (Best example: Briefcase in Pulp Fiction). The Prestige however, suffers awfully from being unable to answer important questions. While the movie itself is entertaining, albeit a bit long, it fails to wrap up the story the way really good films do, like its rival 2006 magician hit The Illusionist. The hook and line are bearable to watch, but the sinker fails to satisfy. While it did give its nice twists and turns, The Prestige does not leave a satisfying finish.Rivalries can be very ugly. Take the Yankees-Red Sox, Bears-Packers, Canada-United States, Tupac-B.I.G., and Coke-Pepsi as pure examples. Some can be friendly, some can result in tension, and others result in worse. In the case of The Prestige, we have two magicians ready to kill each other if the opportunity was given. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rival magicians that are so hell-bent on figuring out the other's latest tricks and amazing acts that they will put their families, even their lives on the line. Meanwhile, Cutter (Michael Caine) is in the middle of it all, trying to end the foolish rivalry before it escalates into something more. Throughout the film you see each person gain the upper hand in terms of skills, success, and happiness more than once, but like a seesaw it goes back and forth until the final moments.Handling this grim and dark tale of competition is an all-star cast, an accomplished director, and David Bowie? Anyways, Christopher Nolan, who has been acclaimed as one of the better current directors out there, directs this film with a technique that mixes the choppy Memento and the dark Batman Begins. Using darker colors, longer shots to portray emotion, and hints and clues throughout, Nolan is certainly the right man to tackle this story because of its non-linear course. He does a much better job here than in Batman Begins in terms of serving a gloomy atmosphere and dim tone. Also involved in the writing, the Nolan brothers did a good job hiding the secrets from the audience, but also stretched the plot a bit too long, when it could have easily been a much shorter film. Perhaps it was because they wanted to foreshadow the ending on multiple instances? Perhaps because providing more content would give the ending a bit more closure? Nonetheless, not everything seen in the first two acts was actually necessary.At least we have some fine acting to help move the story along. Hugh Jackman removes the claws and does a superb job as a broken, bitter magician whose better days left him after circumstances beyond his control. Michael Caine tops Jackman with his portrayal as the magician not taking sides in the entire case, even when loves are on the line. David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson were good, but a bit underused. Christian Bale on the other hand, didn't provide as much effort here as in previous performances like in Batman Begins, The Machinist, among others.Pacing of the movie is its ultimate strength and its ultimate weakness. In a non-linear film, moving too fast would be confusing and make the viewer more lost than a blind drunk man in a mirror maze. Once again, citing Pulp Fiction as an example, the modern masterpiece clocks in at over 140 minutes, is slow-paced, and yet remains astoundingly entertaining and fun because it is so rich in content and detail. The Prestige on the other hand doesn't quite dazzle and entertain the way Pulp Fiction, Memento, Fight Club, and other non-linear movies do. With a phenomenal amount of dialogue and little action, the true fun of the film comes within its mysteries, its questions raised.Yet exactly like what would happen if the television show Lost abruptly ended, The Prestige does not answer all the questions, even when the credits roll. As the film progresses and the plot becomes thicker and the tensions and stakes raises, a lot of details raise questions about the who, the where, the why, and especially the how. Nolan was good at teasing the audience and leaving the bait, but failed to go for the kill when he really should've. He did not wrap up the story in a nice bow, or in a fashion that would leave the average viewer fulfilled. The Illusionist followed a similar pattern of leaving clues to the grand finale, except the ending answered all that needed to be answer. With questions that could result in several different answers, each of them potentially changing major themes in the movie itself, answers were more than necessary here and it was not delivered.Bottom Line: The Prestige is a dark, twisting movie that doesn't seem to find its course, and while it keeps the audience in check, it leads to an abrupt dead end with many questions hanging around. The direction was great, the casting was wonderful, and the cinematography was outstanding, but something in the writing was lacking--seemed to be missing. Then, to make things a bit more disappointing comes the final act, which may leave some viewers pleased, but may leave others scratching their heads. If you want all answers revealed, you are in for a major disillusionment."
buiger,"Jan 6, 2008",3/10,"I totally agree with Berardinelli on this one. He sums the movie up marvelously when he describes it as: ""The Prestige is cold, and Nolan crafts a storyline that is more complicated than necessary"". And that is exactly the point, the film is so complicated it is almost impossible to follow, it doesn't make much sense, and is therefore not interesting for the viewer. It is also cold, without feelings, thus leaving the spectator indifferent to the proceedings or the final outcome.Subsequently, it doesn't matter any more that the movie is well crafted, in some instances well acted (especially Michael Caine), none of these things can change the viewers' overall sensation of disappointment in watching this film. On a last note, I do not believe the picture deserved any of the two nominations it received; just think about it, this film received a Nomination for best Cinematography and 'Curse of the Golden Flower' didn't...? I really fail to understand what they are thinking over at the Academy sometimes..."
FlaviusAetius,"Nov 4, 2006",10/10,"From what I read about The Prestige in the paper, I was expecting an exciting, entertaining little movie from one of my favorite directors starring three of my favorite actors. So, rather casually, I drove up to a nearby theater with one of my friends to see it. I didn't expect a cinematic tour de force, but I suspected I would at least enjoy the experience.I can happily say it was the most pleasant surprise of my life. My mind was utterly blown by the dark, beautifully crafted masterpiece that seized control of my senses and not for a moment let go. The plot involves two magicians, Alfred Borden(Christian Bale), and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman), who were once partners but are flung down paths of revenge by a tragic event that may or may not have been an accident. From this relatively simple base, the movie spirals down into the abyss of obsession, competition, and plain hatred in a manner that will keep you guessing towards the end. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale give magnificent performances, aided by a strong supporting cast including Michael Caine and David Bowie(!) Nolan's brilliant directing and Jackman's masterful acting shed light on Angier's obsession that eventually consumes his live, as he desperately seeks to unravel the mystery enshrouding his rival's ultimate act, 'The Transported Man.' The answer to the enigma will drop your jaw and send a cold shiver down your spine. The twists and turns in the deliciously convoluted plot are quite natural, not at all like the cheap gimmickry abounding in the works of M. Night Shymalan.Staged like an enormous magic trick, The Prestige keeps you guessing and, more importantly, questioning. I couldn't stop thinking about what I had seen for several days after I left the theater. The Prestige easily stands as one of the best movies of 2006. I sincerely hope it is given some serious consideration for some Oscars. In my mind, only Zhang Yimou's 'Hero' strikes me as a better movie."" Are you watching closely?"""
Ian-Broomey-2002,"Mar 8, 2021",9/10,"I've found this to be one of Nolans most entertaining and rewatchable movies. Two magicians start out as friends but develop a dangerous rivalry. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both phenomenal, amazing performances and a believable rivalry. The pacing is flawless, every scene and beat hits brilliantly and makes this a great and entertaining experience. The supporting cast all deliver, Nolan still can't write women, Bowie, Caine and Serkis pick up the slack easily. Whilst Nolan has become much more of a High concept director, often with stunning set pieces, with this he tells a basic story, with plenty of genuinely unexpected twists and stylish direction and cinematography. This shows the brilliant storytelling, which Nolan has mastered."
sweetemotion2,"Nov 25, 2006",10/10,"I was fortunate that this movie was still playing at three theaters in my area this week. With junk like Santa Clause 3 and The Return in the theaters, I wanted something that looked truly stimulating.I wasn't disappointed.The Prestige is quite possibly one of the best films of the year. For starters, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Hugh Jackman perform magnificently, and will keep your eyes riveted to the screen. David Bowie was a nice surprise, and the recipient of a makeup job so convincing that my brother and I almost disbelieved it was he. Piper Perabo and Rebecca Hall are very convincing. Scarlett Johansson's performance is somewhat flat, but she makes up for it with sex appeal and flair.Apart from the acting, the effects, sets, and ambiance of this film make for an excellent period piece. I was particularly enamored with the scenes in Colorado Springs. Simply spectacular.I will reiterate the conclusions of the aforementioned writers. This movie is a magic trick unto itself, with the magnificent writing and twist of plot.You too, won't be disappointed if you go to see it. Leave Santa Clause 3, Deja Vu, Bobby, Borat, and Flushed Away in the theaters. If you can get out to see The Prestige, it is well worth it."
Gordon-11,"Nov 15, 2006",N/A,"This film is about the unscrupulous rivalry between two magicians, who tried to do everything to be better than the other.I have already heard that it is a very good film before I saw the film. Indeed, the film has not disappointed me. This is the best film I have seen in a long time! First of all, the plot is excellent. A story about magic is in itself intriguing. Coupled with a lot of very unexpected and unimaginable and yet realistic twists, this film leaves you surprised until the very end. There are many chilling moments, and many moments where the viewers are made to fidget in their seat because of immense suspense. When everything was unveiled and demystified in the end, I was in astonishment of the outstanding quality of the film.The character development is excellent. The viewers can all understand the cause of the rivalry, and we can all relate and sympathise with he characters.Acting is great. The set designs are visually attractive and nostalgic, and it can easily be seen that a lot of effort has been put into this."
rupinder_shahi,"Feb 24, 2008",10/10,"i just saw this movie last night and let me tell you, this movie had me guessing the whole time because usually you could predict the plot of the move but not this time,twist over twist over twist... this is one of the few movies ever made the keep on shocking you, also the ending is probably better than any movie from 2000-present and no lie. some people say that there is no hero but once you see this movie, you will understand because greed, pride and obsession are the key factors so if you miss the movies that have a bang for your buck, this is will no doubt leave you wanting more action-10/10 plot-10/10 effects/visuals-10/10 overall- best movie in last 10 years (no lie)"

ARTaylor,"Oct 21, 2006",8/10,"The Pledge:Christopher Nolan, the brilliant man who brought us Memento and Batman Begins and soon The Dark Knight, brings us The Prestige. Starring Hugh Jackman, Wolverine from the X-Men movies and soon to have his own film, and Christian Bale, Batman in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. The movie is about two rival magicians Rupert and Alfred, Jackman and Bale respectively.The Turn:Their rivalry is something more than two competitors. It becomes about revenge. Eventually one of them discovers an amazing trick. Soon the other becomes obsessed with finding the secret. Everything he does becomes about finding the secret to the first trick. Later he finds an even better trick. A trick so astounding that not even the man who builds most of the tricks can understand it.The Prestige:Trusts are broken. Loyalties are tested. Loves are lost. Watch the movie carefully. This one requires you to pay attention and follow along. The movie is told in a non-linear format, even more so than Memento. There are subtle clues in almost every scene. This is no movie to text-message, make out, talk with friends, or even go to the bathroom during. Each and every scene helps to build to this mystery of what's going on. Missing one scene means certain confusion. It's not something you can half pay attention to. Even if you do pay attention you might just have to see it again just to see all the build up to the final trick.The Response:Amazing. Though if you found Memento confusing you may want to skip this one. But if you're a Christopher Nolan fan or always like a good mystery you will be sure to enjoy this one. Enjoy this one while you can. Movies with this level of excitement do not come around too often."
albertgorgy,"May 16, 2017",10/10,amazing movie you have to watch it to the last second i never get bored during this film they show the reality of the magic with an entertainment and some adventure through it with an excellent cast you need to keep thinking for the first 90 minutes what is happening?! and how it happens?! you will start to understand everything in the last five minutes and see how everything is so easily even if your mind complicate it!!!!
saeedmilani,"Aug 2, 2019",10/10,"Thanks to the cast of this great film, hand in hand, thank you to Mr. Nolan for making this masterpiece really one of the best I have ever watched, so much fun!
The magician shows you something, then seizes it, and finally reappears, and his art is reappearing, not sequestrating."
DenimChicken,"Jun 14, 2007",10/10,"When I first saw the DVD cover for this film I was immediately drawn to buying it due to a combination of factors; Christopher Nolan to me is a great director with Momento a piece of art as far as I am concerned. I also consider Batman Begins to be the best of all the Batman films so far, maybe even the best comic book film so far. Christian Bale I also consider to be a fine actor and almost all his performances so far (which I have seen) have been the best I have seen for his age.I was not disappointed, my high expectations were met and at no point during the film did I become bored, the story moved along swiftly and the film did not rely on stereotypical portrayals of the period, Nolan actually made the period feel fresh.Christian Bale as usual gives a stellar performance and Jackman holds his weight as the supporting lead. I was not entirely convinced by Scarlett Johannson as she seemed quite wooden (and pouts her way through the film) in a role that relied on her looks, a special mention should go to David Bowie who was excellent and will hopefully appear in more serious acting roles.Overall greatly entertaining, not too confusing and deeply engaging."
veenusav,"May 29, 2017",8/10,"A historical story line which demands a lot of attention to detail and art. Selection of the best in the class cast. Fantasy with realistic touch with scientists as characters. Salute you .. director. you did it well.I have a different view point for a certain point. I believe to keep the essence of the story 'importance of keeping secrets', you could have taken another mystical point to conclude the story. Like the live characters do not able to find out the secrecy even at the climax. May be for a commercial success of the movie, after that point, you could have indicated some points to the audience. Anyway the villain character's reactions to his false beliefs could not be captured then. But I believe, a person who sacrificed friendship & love (and many others..I cannot be a spoiler here!) will not do this at certain point to prove something to person who is no longer important to him.once again.. I salute you sir... a brilliant topic and a good canvas."
anagagnon,"Jan 25, 2021",7/10,"Honestly, I think I would need to watch it again to tell you whether I think it's a good movie or not. Of course, it's filled with such amazing actors and I really liked the mystery all along, but the thing is I think it is way too long. Although, I recommend it."

ganeshg21-1,"Dec 2, 2006",10/10,"The name of the movie. It says it all. Its a classic movie. Its pure class. I was spellbound by the flawless direction. The screenplay is perfect. The music, the background, the story. It was all so well knit together. Kudos to the director. I was not a big fan of either Christan bale or Hugh Jakcman..But, that has changed. These two go about their business like they are thorough professionals. I wish the movie had done better. Its a strongly recommended movie for anyone. WOW..WHAT A MOVIE!! I just had to say it again..one of my ALL TIME FAVS. I did go to see it with no expectation. I was contemplating watching another movie since I had not heard enough about this one. But, I am glad my friends came up with the idea to see this one. I paid 10 bucks to see it since it was an upperclass theater. But, I am not complaining at all. Would have paid a lot more to see it..GO watch it before any other movie.."
matteveland95,"Jan 4, 2022",10/10,"What a story. An engaging and developed timeline of conflict and drama and event. A brilliant film overall. The direction, the execution- simply a masterpiece of layered emotion.One of my favorite films for many years and only on this viewing have I recognized it's special place as a 10/10 for me. From nine to ten since my first viewing in 2013 and many subsequent viewings to today. Nolan's masterpiece."
wolcottalexander,"Aug 7, 2021",9/10,"It doesn't rely on special effects at all so it does not age in the slightest. Just a unique story with excellent writing, professional directing, and wonderful acting from an all-star cast, which never gets old. This was a great movie when it came out 15 years ago, is a great movie now, and will be a great movie 30 years from now too. My only knock is that it requires some intentional ""suspension of disbelief"" in a few spots in order to make it work, but otherwise it's perfect. It is so good that it merits multiple viewings and I still look forward to watching it again. I put it in league with ""The Sixth Sense"" where the first time you watch it is superb but you have to watch it at least twice in order to really appreciate how good it is."
John_Truby,"Jan 7, 2010",N/A,"Using advanced storytelling techniques (see the Advanced Screen writing Class and the Masterpiece Software) is probably the single best way to set yourself apart from the Hollywood screen writing crowd. But this approach is extremely challenging as well, and if you aren't careful you can weaken the very story you are trying to showcase.In their story of competing magicians, the writers of The Prestige use a double storyteller. While not uncommon in a medium like the novel, this advanced technique is extremely rare in mainstream Hollywood film. Structurally a double storyteller creates two equal main characters. When you have virtually unlimited amount of time to explore character (as in a novel), this isn't a problem. But in the relatively short two-hour time period you have in a Hollywood movie, it's a huge problem.If you add the advanced technique of making both characters unsympathetic, you compound the problem even further. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, characters don't have to be sympathetic. But they do have to be compelling. By cross-cutting between two main characters in the time a writer normally has to define one, these writers make both of their heroes superficial and opaque.The great strength of The Prestige is the plot. But ironically, that simply highlights the fatal weakness of the story. This film about slight of hand and trickery has plenty of slight of hand and trickery in its plot. But without the proper character work, it's all just pulling strings. By being extra complicated, the mechanics of the plot actually become more, not less, obvious. The audience pulls back and notices they are watching a movie.Instead of showing us how clever they are, these talented writers show us how they have failed in the first job of the writer, to make the audience care.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"
aayushkhulal,"Nov 1, 2019",10/10,Christopher Nolan has yet again proved that he is one of the greatest movie directors of all time but I think this might just be his best work.I couldn't find a single flaw in the movie. I tried to nitpick was much as I could but I just couldn't. The movie hot do good that I literally started laughing by how good the film truly was. This film is a must for any film lover and don't miss out on this perfection.
lesleyharris30,"Aug 19, 2016",7/10,"The Prestige is a good movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a bizarre journey as we follow the lives of two competing magicians who go through extreme lengths to exceed the other. Things begin to heat up quite fast, with some very bizarre twists and turns throughout, showcasing the complications these magicians go through to make everything appear magic.However. I felt the plot dives deeper than it really should have, there are some very absurd moments and the exaggeration took me out of the movie a bit.I also found the tone far too dark, it should have been a more light hearted look at the dedication of magicians, instead of going as far as to bring teleportation, cloning and suicide in to the story. While it can feel a bit pretentious, The Prestige is a really unique movie, worth the watch if you are looking for a good mystery.Two magicians begin to feud after one performs the ultimate trick, teleportation.Best Performance: Christian Bale"
sddavis63,"Jun 23, 2009",5/10,"I found the most interesting part of this movie to be the behind the scenes look at some of the tricks used by illusionists and magicians. The broader story has great potential. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival illusionists in late 19th century London, whose rivalry goes beyond just a fun competition and becomes dangerously obsessive with ultimately tragic results. All that sounds pretty good, and both Jackman and Bale were solid in their roles as Angier and Borden respectively, as was Michael Caine as Cutter, Angeirs' assistant. Spoiling the story somewhat for me was a sort of mini-subplot about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Edison is never depicted in the movie, while Tesla is played by David Bowie of all people. That rivalry was very real of course but dissolves into a bit of a farce here, as Tesla has supposedly invented some sort of teleportation device that Angier wants to use in his show. A simple and obsessive rivalry would have been quite sufficient without that dive into sci-fi silliness. I also have to say that while the movie certainly had its strong points, for the most part the story just didn't take hold of me. I found it a little long and slow-paced at times, and in the last 15-20 minutes there just seemed to be too many twists and turns happening, which again took away from the story's credibility. In the end, my reaction was that this was OK, but nothing more. 5/10"
tburke85,"May 16, 2009",9/10,"The Prestige is an entertaining thriller from writer/director Christpher Nothan the man behind films like Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. The Prestige is about two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden whose friendship turns into an intense rivalry that leads them on a life long battle for supremacy. Hugh Jackman stars as Angier and Christian Bale plays Borden who also worked with Nolan on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Jackman and Bale are great in their roles portraying men who are driven to be the greatest magician in the world. Michael Caine is fantastic as always playing Cutter a man who builds and constructs illusion tricks. Scarlet Johannssan is strikingly beautiful as both Angier's and Borden's lover assistant Olivia. She brings a lot to the small role she does have in the film. David Bowie also does a solid job with his role as brilliant scientist Nikola Tesla. The rest of the cast including Piper Perabo as Angier's wife Julia, Rebecca Hall as Bordens wife Sarah, and Andy Serkis as Telsa's friend Allie are believable in their supporting roles. Director Christopher Nolan does a great job with the period setting and the mood of the film. Even with a running time of 130 minutes the film is never slow which helps draw the audience into the story. The plot for the most part is complex but never complicated but does require a couple of viewings to full understand what the movie was all about. From the twists and turns to the superb acting The Prestige is an entertaining thriller that is sure to please anyone looking for a good film to watch."
dolenraug,"Oct 22, 2006",8/10,"I went to this movie not completely sure what to expect. I knew it was directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) and starred Christian Bale (Batman Begins, American Psycho), Hugh Jackman (X-Men 1, 2, and 3), and Michael Caine (Batman Begins). I knew it was about magicians. I knew it looked cool as hell. This movie blew away all expectations. The acting was first rate and the direction, par for Christopher Nolan, was superb. This movie will definitely exercise your mind with more twists and turns than all of M. Night's combined. The quest for fame and one-upping a rival becomes an obsession that makes for a riveting piece of entertainment. Only Christopher Nolan could undertake such a complicated storyline and deliver it so perfectly. Definitely worth the seven bucks and two hours spent."
Nucliomaniac,"Aug 18, 2007",10/10,"Its surprising how a movie about 2 magicians actually managed to reach a producers table, but I am glad it did.""The prestige"" comes like a breath of fresh air, considering the mediocre fare, us moviegoers are being served these days and as usual Christopher Nolan doesn't disappoint. Christopher is quite deftly carving a name for himself among the best directors of this generation and has followed phenomenal movies such as Memento and Batman Begins with another masterpiece. There are not many directors who can boast of having their last 3 movies in the IMDb top 250 list.The movie takes on an unusual tale of the story of 2 magicians and weaves a poignant drama around it. Full of suspense and mystery. Without revealing too much, I would implore all you viewers to give this movie a dekko, and you will not be disappointed. If the suspense of Memento intrigued you, if the dark and poignant drama of ""Batman begins"" thrilled you, then The Presitge, will take over and take you to a world of envy, jealousy, suspense, drama and yes .. prestige.Enjoy!"
panic-station,"Jan 27, 2013",9/10,"Christopher Nolan's The Prestige tells the story of two rival magicians, Borden (Bale) and Angier (Jackman). The two battle over deceiving and outsmarting each other as they try to be the better magician. Spanning several years and often jumping backwards and forwards in time, The Prestige is a beautiful, brooding tale about obsession and how far it can and shouldn't go.Being one of Christopher Nolan's more modest films (being made between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and on nowhere near a larger scale), The Prestige is one of those films that only those who pay attention understand it's true greatness. With a typical Nolan-esque cast (Christian Bale, Michael Caine), the film is setup for quality cinema and does not disappoint. From start to finish you are fixated and deprived of attachment to the world around you much like Borden and Angier as you too do not want to miss any of the films trickery.One of the best things I like about The Prestige is how it deceives the viewer just as a magician would to their own audience. 'Are you watching closely?' a line which is repeated throughout The Prestige hints at the films very own nature. 'You want to be fooled,"" the last lines of the film as uttered by the legendary Michael Caine, leave the viewer in a bewildered state as they reconsider what they have just seen.The cinematography is grand. DOP Wally Pfister who has worked on all of Nolan's films I believe, deserves just as much credit as the director himself. From the dark and electrifying theaters to the eerie Colorado Mountains, The Prestige looks fantastic.Having seen the film several times and enjoyed each viewing as much as the next, The Prestige continues to amaze me. It truly is a mesmerizing and brilliant film which just cannot go unseen by anyone."
amyfaerie,"Jan 21, 2007",10/10,"A wonderful movie with a twist to beat all twists . . . everything I'd expect from the Nolans. I swear, I audibly gasped in the theater when the final reveal happened.Christian Bale is amazing and believable, and although I'm not usually a Hugh Jackman fan, I was even impressed with his performance. Creepy and dark, this movie is one of those films you just can pay close enough attention to--I can't imagine anyone having it figured out before the movie lets you in on its secret. I think that ""The Illusionist"" stole some of this film's thunder, and it's a shame--that film was nowhere near the masterpiece that this film is. I am waiting for this film to come out on DVD, just so I can watch it a few more times, being able to (hopefully) listen to the Nolans' commentary track."
mr-newyorker91,"Aug 29, 2011",10/10,"The movie is astonishingly good. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time guessing what was behind this ""Transported Man"" trick. I had my own guess, but it turns out I was fooled along with others. The plot is very sophisticated, almost flawless and with the appropriately woven science-fiction scenes. 19th century London being on the edge of new ""electrified"" era was shown perfectly well, all the costumes matched the time, as well as the exteriors. The actors did a good job depicting their characters, especially I would like to point out the performance of Christian Bale.The movie is fully complete, doesn't require a sequel. Such movies are a very rare thing and are definitely must-watch!10 out of 10!"

finding-something,"Nov 12, 2006",9/10,"Typically, if there is a book and then a movie, the book is the better by far. Enter Christopher Nolan, and this is no longer the case.As two friends' different philosophies on magic set tensions in motion, it is a tragic death that forever puts a wedge between them. A rivalry ensues between the more penetrating Borden (Bale) and the showman Angiers (Jackman). With three different time lines moving all at once through most of the movie, there's really never a moment's boredom. This storytelling is efficient and compelling.There is enough foreshadowing throughout the movie to make one giddy. I loved how Nolan chose to focus much more on Borden's personal life than Priest did in the novel. All of the developing back story is gone, but what is gained is worth it in my opinion. Borden's wife, played by Rebecca Hall, was an unexpected treat. She certainly out-performed the other female lead. . .At times, the movie was a little too enunciated, my reason for giving it a 9 and not a 10. Just a little more faith in the audience, especially at the very end, would have been nice.As always, Bale was perfect. Cane was able to really shine as well, especially when reprimanding Angier at the end of the movie. A real surprise though was Hugh Jackman. Of X-Men and Kate and Leopald fame, I was more than worried for his quality of performance in this movie. Thankfully, there was never any reason to be, however. It wasn't till the very end when perhaps he was just a little too over the top (and he kind of earns it) that I thought, ""Wait, that's Hugh Jackman. Oh dear, good for him."" Never for a second was I ever tempted to think of Wolverine or elevators.Splendid entertainment."
AMichaelL,"Jan 11, 2012",10/10,"Yes, TDK was unbelievably awesome. Yes, Inception was original and awesome. No, neither of them is Nolan's masterpiece (to date). That title belongs to The Prestige, at least in my opinion. Featuring an amazing pairing of Jackman and Bale, and the hot off of critical failure Insomnia, Nolan's movie scorches from the beginning. Putting Tesla in as a historical anchor was pure brilliance, and with the aid of Tesla technology most of the illusions they pulled off could easily be done, even the shocking ending(s). Therefore, despite what some might say, this is all entirely realistic.In fact, I think Nolan would be smart to re-visit Tesla and do a biopic, because there are few people as insanely weird and full of pure genius, in history, as Tesla was.On the surface, this is a simple magician versus magician period piece, but it slowly evolves into a battle of wit between two incredibly driven men. The twists in this movie, the first time viewing, are nearly impossible to predict (unlike Inception/TDK), and everything comes together perfectly. One of the most under-rated movies, ever."
De_Priester,"Jan 28, 2007",10/10,"I watched this movie and not only was I totally surprised with the ending it kept me thinking about it over and over. This movie is without a doubt something to remember, something to shock you and something to keep you wondering. Not only does this movie show you an amazing story it keeps you wondering what side to pick and it makes you change sides over and over. At the end who was wrong and who was right? You be the judge while watching this movie. Great actors, great story, beautiful and very detailed scenery, a bit of history, a bit of drama and everything else you'd desire from a movie. Enjoy this movie and be sure to recommend it."
puneet2004,"Jan 16, 2007",9/10,"A very different setting, a very different story of the art of magic and illusions makes the movie a classic. Bale and Jackman fight it out for the top spot in the theatrical worlds of magic and trickery. And they weave a spell of magic doing so. i was spellbound in the entire movie, drawn into making hypothesis of how each trick was being performed, and they managed to trick me every step of the way. Both actors are geniuses and deliver a powerful presence on-screen. The dialogs are good, performances great but what makes the flick stand apart from the rest is the imaginative storyline that made me sit the entire movie, moth agape. In the end, when the truth is revealed, one is left speechless. words don't do justice to the film. A must see for all. A slow movie, but that adds to the beauty of it. A definite 9/10."
SoutheastUK,"Jul 14, 2007",10/10,"Despite the similarities and the release timing, this movie is very different from ""The Illusionist"" in that it is more of a character study into very obsessive individuals as well as an adventurous, exciting and intriguing example of what film-makers can achieve if they really try.The performances are outstanding, the storyline complex enough to keep you guessing till the end. There are some really quite clever plot twists and surprises.Im happy to say that I didn't ""work it out"" until the various revelations.Very well made and thoroughly enjoyable; a thinking persons film."
The_Right-Brained_Reviewer,"Feb 18, 2024",7/10,"Very good movie with Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and Christopher Nolan at the helm. The film moves at a brisk pace, and kept me gripped to my seat. One of Christopher Nolan's better offerings, it's definitely worth watching for its incredible entertainment value. That said, the central characters' penchant for mischief and murder came off as cold and unnatural given their occupation. Beyond that bit of criticism, I would recommend watching this movie. I'm just not in a hurry to watch it twice like I was with Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, also starring Christian Bale and Michael Caine."
albimary,"Jan 15, 2007",10/10,"this movie is excellent... the story is outstanding and the plot full of twists, yet there are plenty of perfectly fitting clues during the movie... acting is good too and the late 19th century setting is detailed and intriguing...While undoubtedly entertaining ""the prestige"" gives you a chance to think about the endless conflict between lies and truth or fiction and reality, stage roles and real life managing at the same time not to judge the characters and leaving to the audience the freedom to decide where good and evil (if any) stand...a ""must see"" for everyone, thought it would be wise to note that during the movie appear a few scenes that while not truly violent might be quite upsetting for a young public..."
oliviag89,"Oct 19, 2006",8/10,"After watching 3 of Christopher Nolan's shows, I really have a high expectation of this movie. In addition to the great director, the cast selection is superb as well. Well, thankfully I'm not disappointed by this movie.""The Prestige"" is filled with twists and turns. I think how you see the twists and turns will affect what you think of the movie eventually. Some people will be fascinated by them (like me), while others won't. Well, the story can be basically summarized to two themes, Deceit and Obsession. I thought Nolan chooses a great way to present the story. Though the back and forth narration may confused some people, I thought it really works well for the movie, teasing audience to figure out how the story really goes. I feel that the type of flashbacks here is different from those used in Nolan's ""Insomnia"" and ""Memento"", though they are effective for their respective movies.I watched the show with some book spoilers in mind. To those who had read the book, well, the story is rather different from the book. The ending especially. The movie does not mention about the descendants of the Magicians at all.Hugh Jackman's and Christian Bale's acting are amazing. One supporting actor which I think stands out is David Bowie's Nikola Tesla. His charisma really makes his character interesting.Like other Nolan's movies, this movie is visually stunning. You won't be disappointed by its cinematography.Despite being a great movie, I don't think that this movie will be one of the major contenders for Oscar. The genre doesn't really suit well with Oscar type of movies.Nevertheless, in my opinion, this movie is one of the best movies this year, and is definitely a must watch."
DonFishies,"Oct 20, 2006",8/10,"I was stoked to see The Prestige from the moment it first began gaining buzz. Hugh Jackman. Christian Bale. Scarlett Johansson. Michael Caine. Christopher Nolan. It just had the marks for something great, and the trailers only continued to perpetuate this ideally amazing film. While the film does deliver in many instances, I cannot help but feel that it was anywhere near as good as I could have imagined. Whether I hyped it up far too much or not, is up to interpretation.It is the late 1800s, and magicians are the key theatrical acts in London. Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are two up-and-comers who work together, and then instantly turn into rivals after a particularly devastating incident early in their careers. What follows is a tale of both men finding a means of one-upping each other at every turn, whether it be physically sabotaging the other person's act, using the sexy assistant Olivia (Johansson) to help get secret information, or gaining help from the even more secretive ""wizard"" Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, in a rare film appearance).The thing about the film is that you have to pay attention at all times. It has moments where the film feels speedy, and others where it feels downright slow. But no matter what, something integral is always happening. Despite it being told in a particularly bizarre narrative structure (the present flashbacking to the past flashbacking even further into the past, and then back again), the film follows the key three-part magic act sequence (which any trailer fan should probably already know about). The film suffers here because it does not really stay consistent with the direction it wants to go in, and becomes a bit confusing and inane as a result. It may be a bit of a struggle to grasp the structure at first, but slowly becomes more easily accessible. At times it works strongly, but in others, it just feels like it wants to toy with the audience and do nothing else. We know every little detail matters, but should the material not be a little more solidified than it is? A bit of extra padding and focus here could have helped greatly.Being a period piece, you can see the great care and devotion taken to ensure that the film looks like it is occurring at the turn of the twentieth century. It may be dark, but there is just enough light to shine through and make everything all the more colourful. The costumes are all lavishly gorgeous, as are the backdrops and set pieces. It feels distinctive and authentic, but not to the point of being overkill. The score is just about perfect, and the editing really helps to act as the drive of the film. The great British accents are all highly in tune with the rest of the feeling of the film as well, even from the American actors.Jackman and Bale are excellent in their respective roles. Right from the start, you can tell these two are steering towards destruction, and as their characters slowly move into becoming downright evil, it becomes even more of a pleasure for the audience to watch. They play off each other well in their scenes together, and their presences are downright smoldering. These young actors really show off their chops, and show off the deeper range that only a few select modern actors can even pray to be able to show. While I really enjoy Jackman as an actor, I cannot help but realize this is one of his deepest roles yet. He's very striking in the role, but at times you can see that this is one of his first real attempts at doing so. Bale on the other hand, can add this right next to his already brooding library of ranged works (his most astonishing being his turn in American Psycho), and looks like he is right at home with the material. I know they probably will not get recognition during the awards season, but I can only hope this is a taste of things to come from both of them.Caine is great as the wise manager character that he has perfected over the years, and Bowie's small performance is practically intoxicating. He does not play the character up too much, but he plays it with just the right amount of intensity demanded. He is complemented by Andy Serkis, who thankfully plays a real-life character and not one made totally out of CGI. It was something different to actually see him literally acting, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it be just as good, if not better, than his CGI-work. Although they only have so much they can do, the three main female characters, Johansson, Piper Perabo, and newcomer Rebecca Hall all perform excellently, and work well off their co-stars. I would have liked to have seen a bit more material being used by these three, but they really stand up well against their much more heavily used male co-stars.Inevitably, the comparison to this year's ""other magician"" film, Neil Burger's The Illusionist, must come up, and thankfully, it works at about the same level. They both have strong acting (although the female acting is far superior here), a good storyline, and beautiful sets. If anything, The Prestige feels like it wants to accomplish more than it can handle. Thankfully, it does not become too overbearing, but some of the confusion the film generates really does detract from it.Although not as good as Memento or Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan has added another strong film to his short resume, and continues to prove his worth in Hollywood. I can only hope that the audience does not get too overly distracted by the film's structure problems, and can truly appreciate this all-around great film.8/10."
rustyspoons9229,"Sep 11, 2012",10/10,"Watching a movie ten times is stupid. Unless, of course, that movie is The Prestige. When my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to watch it again, I was more than happy to acquiesce. You may be wondering how someone's attention could be held after watching a movie so many times. It can be summed up, quite simply, by the fact that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director. He manages to take a movie that has one of the most simple themes and build an intricate plot around it. The movie focuses on the competition between two magicians as they each strive for supreme success. Along the way, they each face the hardships of death and the slow decline into obsession with their work. In one of the most influential scenes of the movie, one of the characters is begged to give up his quest for greatness because it will only bring him sorrow. He, of course, does not heed this warning, but I will not go deeper into that to avoid spoilers. Along with the way Christopher Nolan developed a brilliant plot, he did an incredible job of casting his roles. Hugh Jackman plays one of the magicians, Robert Angier, and Christian Bale was cast as his competitor, Alfred Borden. Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie each contribute vital side characters and stories. Ultimately, this movie was created to get your mind thinking in ways that are very far outside of the box. There are some supernatural events, yet it is easy to relate to certain characters in the film. One of my girlfriend's complaints was that she did not know who she was supposed to like in the movie, but I think that was Nolan's purpose. He wanted the viewer to look at the film from all perspectives and not be fixated on just one of them. I don't even like writing a review for this movie because it is one that almost needs to be entered with a completely open mind."
fifalisajustin,"Jun 9, 2020",N/A,It is a bit disappointing. I would rather spend ny time elsewhere
marshallonfilm_,"May 21, 2020",7/10,"What might audiences find when peeking behind the curtain on this vaudeville act? A tense period piece, maybe a transcontinental thriller or perhaps a meditation on movie magic? This dense turn-of-the-century tale is all of those and more, proving Christopher Nolan to be a Hollywood heavy-hitter way back in 2006, and captivating audiences with its spell-binding and complex method for nearly two decades. Assembling his A-team of now-celebrated collaborators for this study on stage sleight-of-hand, such as cinematographer Wally Pfister and production designer Nathan Crowley, the British director is in true command of his craft for the film's somewhat-bloated 130 minutes, at times confounding and confusing viewers due in no small part to its marquee misdirection and sluggish pace. Leading lads Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale steal the show in dual roles as duelling magicians across three acts, daring audiences to sympathise with each protagonist as they pursue Faustian-like pacts with deadly consequences. Michael Caine and David Bowie are deserving of much praise, but sadly Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson find their talents wasted in under-written roles, did someone say dead wife trope? One-upmanship, pride and obsession are the name of the game during the pledge, turn and eponymous prestige, but the film flounders as it covers far too much thematic territory for its own good, and refuses to settle for any singular focus. Peeling back its layers reveals a fractal filmmaking style, trademark elliptical editing and marvellous use of mise en abyme, all of which would be improved in later Nolan features, yet this experience does demand your attention and encourage repeat viewings where keen eyes hope to spot every trick. Abracadabra.7/10 black cats and top hats."
jlind0,"Oct 22, 2006",9/10,"I did something tonight that I have never done before. I saw a first run movie, twice in the same weekend. I can't remember the last time I've seen two first run movies in the same weekend (I suspect it was in high school), I do remember the last time I saw the same movie twice in theaters (Memento).As everyone who knows me know, I'm a serious Christopher Nolan fan. Ever since I saw Memento I've been hailing him as the second coming of Alfred Hitchcock, and have the full expectation that when his career is said and done he will be universally recognized certainly as the greatest director of his time, possibly of all time. Greatness is often achieved by making a single innovation in your craft and repeating it with increasingly mastering execution. No one has ever used non-sequential time lines as effectively as Nolan did with Memento, and my one reservation about his place in Hollywood history has been that that style could never be as masterfully used in another film again... that his second work could never be equaled, let alone surpassed.The Prestige has reinforced my confidence in my initial assessment. The flash backs he used in Begins showed that he has an understanding of the technique that is unrivaled, however the use of it was not nearly as complex as it was in his early works. Prestige more follows his first work, The Following's, use of non-sequential time than Memento's in that the ordering of the scenes is very complex, by far his most complex yet. Not only are the scenes ostensibly randomly arranged, but also in parallel following the thoughts of two men at the same time. But of course the arrangement is not random, the order is there specifically to misdirect the audience... much like the magicians in the film do when performing their tricks.But it goes beyond misdirection, the scenes themselves are very powerful imagery investigating guilt, sacrifice and obsession... but the time line adds to that as well. Following seemed to use this style to add to the suspense and give the audience a little puzzle to figure out, Memento used them to do all that and force the audience to feel like the protagonist, The Prestige uses it to do everything that Memento did only the protagonist is not on screen, it is audience. With ever twist and turn you feel the mystique of a magic show, scratching your head not at how anything particular on screen happened, but how the story could come together like it does.The most amazing thing is I still can't figure out how Nolan does it, the emotions Memento and Prestige invoke when seeing them for the first time is pure ecstasy, I know of nothing that can do the same. When its over you wish you could forget everything you just saw and watch it again just to feel that way again and again. But then you watch it again anyhow, because it was so phenomenal with the expectation of not being nearly as good as the first time, and you see all the little things you missed the first time around and just marvel at the mastery of it all and get a chance to look back into the crowd and watch their jaws drop as pieces of the puzzle fall into place.9/10: Not quite Memento but close. My only misgiving is was I was I had the puzzle together enough to see the big picture about half way through the film, although I know only one person thus far who has had the same experience. Expect to see lots of 10's on this one, they're well deserved."
davidallenxyz,"Jun 20, 2024",7/10,"I don't think it is a spoiler in any way to say that this film contains multiple twists. It's about magic after all, and what is magic beyond an elaborate ""twist""?But I happened to work out the twists before they are revealed to the audience - and once you've seen them, you realise that director Christopher Nolan is hiding them in plain sight.Without the impact of the big reveal - the ""prestige"" as the film calls it - you are left with a high quality period-fantasy production with some good performances (Jackman, Caine, Hall), some average ones (Johansson), and some weak ones (Christian Bale hamming it up as usual, David Bowie disappointingly reserved).It is a good film but I suspect it is only great for an audience that ""wants to be fooled""."
imdb-88-13600,"Aug 23, 2014",4/10,"A film about magicians, and of course magicians make a business tricking people. Usually, though, the audience doesn't figure out the trick, and that's why it works.Unfortunately here the trick is laid bare and it makes the whole thoroughly disappointing. There is much more promised than delivered, and I find it hard to recommend to anyone.Part of the disappointment is that it could have been so much more. The premise is interesting, the characters start out interesting... as is, though, it needs a major rewrite.Sorry."
damionstein,"Oct 21, 2006",10/10,"This movie is truly excellent. For some reason this website is full of negative comments on films. The people behind the writing and directing of this film are the same people that made Memento. The acting is superb. The twists are very well done. The trailers don't give away what the movie is about and you are kept on the edge of your seat until the final scene. If you have read any reviews from people that said that they couldn't follow the plot or are unsure as to what the true ending meant or anything to do with confusion in the plot they are people that need to go back and watch the movie again. This plot is very intelligent, but when you pay attention - the pay off is grand. Brilliant film making, I look forward to seeing this movie again. This is the best film I have seen this year and the fact that I feel so strong about it is why I came to this website to write about it."
myakatherine,"Mar 3, 2007",10/10,"Those reviewers who give The Prestige low marks don't appreciate Christopher Nolan's talents and couldn't keep up mentally with the movie's direction. Christopher Nolan is indeed the best director in the mystery genre and creating wonderful plot twists with deep character development.The Prestige will keep you guessing from beginning towards the end. About 99.9% of movies that I watch, I guess at every turn what will happen but this movie will kept me wondering until the end... The acting is superb as Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are pitted against each other as rival magicians. I'm unable to see any other actors other than Bale and Jackman in the characters they played. Excellent casting with the rest of the supporting actors; Michael Caine, Scarlett, Bowie....Must see!"
Diana_Prince,"Oct 23, 2006",9/10,"""The Prestige"" is by far one of the best films I have seen in recent months. The actors pulled together a finely written script, and the directing was seamless. Many movies throw in ""plot fillers"" just to make up time or fill in some blank space due to lack of...something - but Christopher Nolan not only tied all the loose ends together, he threw in far more than normal and still managed to clean it up by the time the credits rolled. Yes, it makes you think, but it also makes you 'feel' the movie itself. Jackman and Bale played their roles to a ""T"" and I can't speak highly enough of them. And of course Michael Caine was brilliant. I've never been a big fan of Johansson, but I feel she really did pull this character from the pages of the script and make her real. Piper Parabo was also a fully dimensional character...a big step up from Violet Sanford.Two days later and this movie is still running through my mind in vivid images. Excellent."

cosmic_quest,"Nov 20, 2006",N/A,"'The Prestige' is a classy thriller that appeals to an intelligent audience and is effortlessly one of the best films of the year. Set against the backdrop of a very authentic Victorian London, the film sees two magicians, rich toff Robert Angier and working class Alfred Borden, determined to make their mark in their expertise of thrilling their audiences. But their friendly rivalry descends into bitter, obsessive feud when Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife and relations between them sour to a life-threatening extent.The acting in this film is exemplary but then you expect no better considering the actors involved. Christian Bale plays the cool, reserved Borden who maintains his control in contrast to Hugh Jackman's the volatile Angier, a man whose hatred has turned him from suave to almost unhinged in his fanatical need to trump his rival. Michael Caine brings a calm, maturity to the film as Angier's loyal friend Cutter while relative newcomer Rebecca Hall gives an affecting performance as Borden's loving but increasingly bewildered wife.The setting of 'The Prestige' has clearly been put together with love. Victorian London is flawless in depiction, giving the eerie atmosphere of the darker era where there was a sharp divide between rich and poor, the working class were relegated to slums and jails were hellish. The costumes were wonderful in design, especially some of Angier's suits which do well in enhancing Jackman's aristocratic role.The actual plot is filled to the brim with twists and turns that should satisfy any mystery-lover. Sci-fi fans may piece the puzzle together quicker than those left hanging until the end but this should not put anyone off since what really makes the story is the interplay between Borden and Angier. The animosity-- largely kindled by grief, guilt and masculine arrogance-- is fascinating to see how far two men, who could have had successful lives were there not this feud, go in their pursuit to 'beat' the other. Caine's character Cutter offers nice input in showing how far can one man stand back and watch it all happen before he is forced to intervene. There is also a very interesting ethical debate raised, that I won't reveal in deference to those who haven't watched the film.This masterpiece is highly recommended to those bored of conventional, run-of-the-mill blockbusters and want something deeper for a change."
mikestarwars,"Oct 21, 2006",9/10,"The Prestige was an incredibly deep and twisted film. The plot is fairly hard to follow and for I while I would think things like ""is this the past or the present"" but soon I realized that it didn't really matter what it was, because in the end everything comes together. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing, right up until the last seconds of the film. These last few seconds will make you say ""Wow, I get it now"" and you will realize that Innocent scenes earlier in the film have significant importance. The special effects are great and the acting is very well done. The movie draws many parallels with another recently released ""magician"" film - The Illusionist, but the action and intensity of The Prestige makes for a more exciting and enjoyable experience. A backstage view of how some magic tricks are done also adds to the enjoyment. Highly recommended, definitely worth the price of admission."
alexsnower,"Jul 6, 2021",7/10,I liked The Prestige but this is seriously higher rated than Citizen Kane? The Prestige wasn't even the best movie the year it came out. Citizen Kane is on top of every list. These ratings need to be overhauled. The prestige is solid though but a 7.7 or something would be a lot more reasonable.
laurapacino,"Jun 12, 2018",5/10,After reading the reviews had high hopes but to be honest very disappointed. Good cast and well acted but the twists and turns never really happened.... I had already guessed the outcome and you don't have to be a genius!
lagriff05,"Jun 8, 2008",10/10,"A lot of words come to mind upon seeing this again, and amongst them are ""brilliant,"" ""devastating,"" ""masterful"" and ""diabolical."" The Prestige, for those so shamefully uninitiated, is a pretty much completely perfect film, taking the viewer down a dark, twisted road of revenge, lies and deceit as two former friends destroy each other.There isn't a whole lot wrong with this, and when I said back in March that The Illusionist was better than this, I must not have remember just how good this was. The acting is spot-on, with Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and co. becoming completely submerged in their roles, and the plot is wrapped in a thick, foggy sense of mysticism and intrigue, with parts of it mixed and matched accordingly to build up a level of dramatic tension that most movies couldn't dream of possessing. It grows higher and higher, like Jack's beanstalk, until the ending, which will floor you like no other film has since The Shawshank Redemption or Requiem for a Dream. The Prestige, when you look back, will take something out of you that can't be so easily replaced. My highest recommendation."
sssssstar,"Jul 20, 2007",9/10,"It's a long time since I saw a film where I was so hooked on the story. The Prestige has a plot so full of twists and turns it merits several viewings - and even then there will be arguments over who did what - but I can honestly say that it is so engrossing that I enjoyed every minute of it again and again. What I really admire is the way everything - every word spoken, every action - was linked throughout the story. Nothing is wasted.I have seen the film criticised for being too cold and calculating. Maybe some of the characters come across in this way, but this isn't a film that wears it's heart on it's sleeve. It's not a romance. I think it goes deeper than that and asks questions about life and what we think are prepared to sacrifice."

loccomotive2000,"Jun 18, 2007",8/10,"The Prestige sees two rivaling magicians, Borden and Angier, in an intensive battle of wits that goes so far that their lives at stake. The two are portrayed by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman who deliver powerful performances, supported by an excellent cast of Michael Caine, Andy Serkis and, guess who, yep, David Bowie.Director Chris Nolan again shows his trademark by going back and forth the storyline as the film progresses, much as he's done with the critically-acclaimed Memento and Batman Begins, which, through his skillful execution, is used to tremendous effect. With involvement from his brother, Jonathan Nolan, the duo are able to recreate the suspense and complexity as shown in Memento, intriguing the audience as they are brought deeper and deeper into the story.This is story-telling at its finest. With a tremendous twist ending that ties up the knots neatly but also leaves out some tiny loose ends, the movie is satisfying but will make you sit through the credits, thinking you might have missed something..."

muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 18, 2025",7/10,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is a spellbinding and intricate puzzle box of a film that left me utterly captivated. It tells the story of two rival magicians in late 19th-century London, whose professional competition devolves into an obsessive and destructive feud. What I found most fascinating was the film's structure, which mirrors a three-act magic trick: the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige. This clever narrative device keeps the audience constantly off-balance, questioning every character's motive and every twist in the plot. The performances by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are sensational; they fully embody the obsessive, bitter rivalry, each pushing the other to more extreme and dangerous lengths. The film is a dark and complex examination of obsession, sacrifice, and the lengths people will go for their art. It's a psychological thriller as much as it is a period drama, and its final reveal is a masterful twist that requires a rewatch to fully appreciate the clues laid out from the beginning. Nolan's direction is precise and elegant, weaving a story that is as mesmerizing as the magic tricks themselves.Worth the Watch? Absolutely. ""The Prestige"" is a brilliantly crafted psychological thriller that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging. It's a film that demands your full attention and rewards it with a satisfying and unforgettable conclusion."
MeloDee,"Apr 18, 2007",10/10,"The trailers for The Prestige carefully concealed it as a light-hearted film about a magician- nothing more, nothing less.I did not expect the dark, deep, and involving film that played out after I popped in my DVD.The opening lines, narrated by Michael Caine who plays the patron magician ""Cutter"", are a big key to understanding the movie. Cutter explains that there are three important parts to a magic trick- the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Throughout the movie you will see how this law applies, as the ""secrets"" to some of the tricks are revealed.The second part of the beginning of the movie follows. We see Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) trapped in a water-filled glass tank below stage, struggling to get out. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) goes underneath the stage and discovers him there. The movie then skips ahead to a trial, in which Alfred Borden is being charged for the murder of Robert Angier- he evidently drowned to death in the tank. Alfred Borden is found guilty of murder and sentenced to die.A rich lord sends a messenger stating that he will take care of Borden's young daughter in exchange for the secret to Borden's greatest trick. The messenger is also sent to give Borden Angier's diary.That, is how our story really begins. We see through the point of view of Robert Angier as Borden reads through the diary.Robert Angier and Alfred Borden worked together underneath Cutter, until a tragic accident caused them to go their separate ways. Some time after they separated, Alfred Borden released an amazing trick. Angier, consumed with jealousy, did everything inside his power to find the secret to the trick. In fact, he began to doubt that it was a trick at all, but rather ""true magic. He was in constant competition with Borden, always trying to outdo him as a magician.Hugh Jackman does an excellent job in portraying Angier's passions, delusions, and melancholy. He completely blew me away with its vibrant showing of his true talent in this movie. After seeing the X-men films, I was almost certain that he was trapped as Wolverine, but when you watch this movie you will think absolutely nothing of Wolverine and absolutely everything of Robert Angier.Christian Bale, as always, was also excellent. I have not seen an actor so diverse, so adept at playing a variety of completely different roles in as long since perhaps Johnny Depp. Yet Christian Bale even outshines Johnny in that department. You will be reminded as little of him as Batman as you will of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. He truly put on the character and he put him on with brilliance.The entire movie is a mystery up to the very end. We do not know if perhaps the rivalry did get out of control and Borden murdered Angier, or if Borden's magic is real and not just another clever illusion. What I can tell you, however, is that the conclusion will shock you, and you will be talking about, and thinking about the movie for long after the credits roll."
thebumswillalwayslose,"Nov 13, 2006",9/10,"After some of the reviews this film was receiving from the popular press i was quite reticent in going to see it, my major motivation for going was namely the direction of Christopher Nolan and the extremely accomplished acting of Christian Bale, however after i finished watching this film i was nothing but shocked, amazed and truly humbled by one of the greatest pieces of film-making i have seen in rather a long time.I would like to start my review by saying this film is NOT and i repeat NOT about the revelation of the trick and how it was achieved. I have read some rather snooty and sniping comments levelled at this film and how they state that they saw the twist coming from a mile off....that is the point, there are enough clues throughout the film to show the spectator what is going to happen and Nolan does not hide these facts, they are there for a reason and i will not give the true reason away, all i will say is that if you know what makes Psycho and the Usual Suspects such masterpieces then you will know why The Prestige is a film of such ilk.Not only does this film have such a strong story it also sets itself in such a believable period of time, no expense is spared on the set design, the cinematography and editing has all the hallmarks and contemporary feel of a Nolan film, however it adds a haunting and almost tangible feel of impending dread throughout. The immediacy of the film meant as a spectator i was never left flagging and i was shocked to realise that this film was 2 hours and 20 plus minutes long as it felt i had barely sat in my seat before the credits rolled at the end, such the power of this film is that it felt that i had been on a journey with the main protagonists and came out of it a different person.My one concern of this film was the performance of Scarlett Johannsen. I am aware that she is in the film as part of the exposition, however she is that bad and her abilities are that wooden that i still sit here in amazement in how she can still get work in Hollywood, however that is just a small point and thankfully her part is limited.In conclusion i feel that this film will be misinterpreted a lot and if you you like your twists in the Saw or Seven vein (good films that they are) then i feel that you will be left disappointed, however if you want to see a masterpiece of film technique and true grandiose themes then The Prestige will be for you, I watched it closely and i got the point...so the question is did you?"
ali_a87,"Nov 4, 2006",10/10,"The movie, if to be described in a single word, is unbelievable, with the word taken in it's utmost literal sense. Christopher Nolan does his magic on the novel written by Christopher Priest in 1995, and brings it to life in a way no one could have accomplished. With his ability to use flashbacks and mixing the past with the present, Mr.Nolan makes those watching the movie, his audience. The Pledge is simple, two magicians; Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) are set to out-do one another. But it seems as if every step the movie takes is The Turn of the whole trick and you must ask yourself, are you watching closely?. The Prestige is where you will be left mesmerized and trying to connect the dots.At times, it may seem as if the movie is moving too fast or if it's too hard to grasp but believe me, when the final curtain is drawn, you will know everything."
paulayre,"Nov 17, 2006",10/10,"All I will say, is that if you get to the ending and are disappointed, you've missed the the prestige of the movie itself.This is the most incredible case of pulling the wool over an audiences eyes I've ever experienced... If you don't know what I'm talking about, you don't get the movies crowing achievement... you've been deceived by the movie.A hint that doesn't spoiler: There isn't a single piece of science fiction in the movie... Rethink it..The acting is absolutely superb, and there are moments of superior skill shown by both Bale and Jackman, especially once you have seen the movie and understand it's plot.It is a movie that will leave you gasping... If you get it"
hickoryvalleygirl,"Jan 14, 2007",10/10,"The movie was wonderful. It kept me guessing until the very end and when the movie was over I want to see it again. I didn't even recognize David Bowie, who plays Tesla. It was a creepy movie and at times I had to close my eyes. This movie isn't suitable for young children under 13. It involves drowning, shooting and chopping off parts of the body. It has some scary parts, but my 11 year old brother was fine. I would only recommend children that young go if they are mature enough to handle the scary parts. Parents, go see the movie next and then judge to see if it is suitable for your children. Teens, this movie is made for you."
marc_crimson,"Nov 6, 2006",9/10,"I had been anticipating this movie ever since it was announced it would be at the helm of Christopher Nolan and written by his brother Jonathan (me, being a big fan of Memento), and became even more excited when i first saw the trailer. It looked serious, moody ,dark and just plain interesting.Upon seeing it a week ago, i wasn't let down. At all.I don't need to write down the whole damn summary for this movie, many others have already done that.If you haven't seen this already, i'll just say that your in for a thrilling, dark, sad, violent,complex and enormously satisfying heck of a movie.The thing is just very well acted through. Bale and Jackman are good as they normally are, and they aren't presented as one-note characters as i've read elsewhere. Their characters have motives for their actions, no matter how unjustified and cruel they are, and it doesn't make it seem like we should pity them for that, no, both guys almost hit the bottom of morality here. Michael Caine does a standard role for him here as the Angier's assistant, but he brings his usual charm and his always good acting chops. Perabo and Johanssen are beauties to behold,and both do a good job, though their roles are minor, especially Scarlett's. Hall is good too, and carries a shocking and very sad aspect of the film very well. And David Bowie as Tesla is one of the coolest cameos,ever.The movie itself may be confusing, as it uses misdirection to present situations out of chronological order, but it's never too confusing, you get the time to organize every situation in time for the finale. The only grip i had with the movie, at least at first, was that it started very slowly and took it's damned sweet time on every minor event, and you might loose some of the initial interest or excitement you had.But at least 45 min. into it, it sets itself on overdrive and never lets you go.Oh, and it looks bad ass. The production values are utterly amazing.Just go see it, forget about infamously obvious twist ending, just let yourself in, put your butt cheeks in the damn seat and let the film surprise you and, well, entertain you."
hectormatamoros,"May 21, 2007",10/10,"What a movie, it's really one of the best movies i have ever watched. It took to me about 5 hours to finished it, i reversed it many times to try to understand. It deserve an Oscar, there's no more, I LOVE ""THE PRESTIGE"". It is very helpful to get comments of many people who likes movies, I watched it around 3 weeks ago and i have not finished to understand all points, there is a lot of magic. After I red several comments i will watch again, I really want to watch again, maybe this time i will be able to discover all secrets. Thanks to Nolan's for this movie, it makes feel that ""good movies"" does not finish yet.I am from Mexico, regards"
JoeJames76,"Jan 24, 2007",9/10,"It's always nice to see a director-actor duo collaborate in successive projects, especially when they can be removed from the massive studio work situation that surrounds a film like Batman Begins, which is where we find Nolan and Bale, filling in time between Bat films. A subsequent pairing allows the director and actor to further their relationship and speak in a kind of shorthand, bringing their collaboration to new heights. Think of Scorcese-DeNiro and Scorcese-DiCaprio, or Spike Lee-Denzel Washington for examples of this.The term relationship is key, as The Prestige centers around the relationships the characters have with each other and what is perceived as their connective tissue plays both within and beyond the film. The audience is placed in a very strategic position of both knower and seeker of knowledge, and like a good magic trick, it is what we perceive and expect that will equally guide us and trick us towards the final act, or what is referred to in magic circles, as ""The Prestige"".Nolan's previous work (Memento, Following, Insomnia) has built upon his manipulation of audience engagement with film texts, and tweaking our sophisticated knowledge as viewers in such a way that our work as an audience helps propel the film as we are forced to guess, then second guess our preconceived notions of where his films are headed. Without recognizing our intelligence as an audience, the film would have no place to go.The psychology of Nolan's films are like that of a masterful storyteller, akin to Robertson Davies' Fifth Business set of novels. The make up and structure of the medium, whether it is writing or film-making, or magic tricks, is key to the enjoyment of the medium's content. We are well aware as we watch The Prestige, how the film unfolds in three acts, exactly as the magic pieces are described in the film. It is both a pleasure to behold on a story level, as well as a film level. Technically, it is parlaying exactly what it is being mystically told as the plot develops. This movie is a classic example why film schools exist.Without giving too much away, this film is a pleasure on many levels, and worth subsequent viewings to fully appreciate and explore. The cast is perfect, as Bale and Jackman play two anti-heroes, whose sides we can easily assume or oppose, depending on how one reads the film and the characters' motives. Johansson plays a wonderful femme fatale, who we never can quite trust. Is she part of the illusion, or the only source of truth? Where does Caine's character's loyalties lie? His performance may perhaps be the best of the bunch, another testament to how prior work with a director leads to greater performances in their own ability to work in shorthand with each other.If you can't tell by my tongue tied review, this film has volumes to speak about. Another thought provoking piece to add to Nolan's young but impressive resume.Grade: A"
billion_mucks,"Nov 20, 2007",9/10,"""The Prestige"" will keep you guessing what's coming next. It's one of those movies you just want to know the answer straight away but still beg for more clues. It's exciting, twisted, smart and well written. See it.In the world of illusion, Borden and Angier will become enemies after one of their tricks goes incredibly wrong. Their rivalry will go past any limit, reaching further to accomplish the best trick and reveal all of their enemy's secret.Thanks to Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman, the basic duel that is drawn throughout the film is stunningly acted and enigmatic, with classy gestures and smooth performance of dialogs. Christopher Nolan revives the era with delicious decorations and use of dampened tones, which gives the film an intense and pushy aura. The rivals are primarily interested in the ""living"" on the act, where the best trick is to deceive the audience into inflicting doubts to them and carrying them away from the truth.Michael's Caine character (who does a great role also) states that the magic is formed by three parts: the turn, which presents ordinary things to attract the audience, the pledge to transform this into something extraordinary and the prestige; the most important act, to blow them away.It's end is clever and has many levels to understand it. It will all fall as a puzzle. The film, as it should, shields a fantastic Prestige. A turn of the table that will leave you gasping and clapping.Watch it, it's a nice puzzle to watch being solved. Just let the magic flow."
proft,"Jun 27, 2007",10/10,"The film is brilliant, but its brilliance is also it's greatest downfall. It's a film for the awakened, but a sleeping pill for the already sleepy. To appreciate the film is to already be aware of certain facts, or to have faith in certain schools of thought, primarily the possibility of time travel.Tesla was a genius. A scientific prophet maybe. He claimed that concepts for many of his inventions simply appeared to him in his mind's eye or in a dream. A long explanation of Tesla's life could be made by somebody with sufficient knowledge, which I don't have. But I do have faith - that he was a man who knew things that have changed and will continue to change the world and the way that we think.The film is a truth puzzle. To understand the film, is to understand that there are concepts and ideas that have been repressed from us, to be free from the fear of uncertainty, and to embrace the vast pool of possibility and discovery that is humanity's gift. The film addresses the two polar characteristics of man - his ability to be logical, and his ability to be emotional - and merges them into a mutually exclusive relationship. That is, one cannot exist without the other.For those who are at odds with the film - the prestige of our lives is the discovery of truth, and I encourage those who wish to understand it's message. Hell, it's worth it. I love this film, and the passion put into it by the actors and other artists. It defines the age we live in, and is an elaborate and magnificent portrait of our collective soul in this modern age."
ten-thousand-marbles,"Dec 28, 2021",7/10,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but it's not all it's cracked up to be. Performances and the story were good but the ending was very so so. My biggest issue was with Christian Bale. Between his heavy accent and frequent mumbling, it was a strain to hear what he was saying. Project. Annunciate."
moviegeek310,"Oct 23, 2006",9/10,"If you compare the book to the movie, the book is actually better. A month before ""The Prestige"" was released I started reading Christopher Priest's award winning book of the same name. I was totally engrossed in it, not only was it a page turner, but it also was an extremely fun read. Not once did I think, ""Oh wow, this is getting boring,"" like most books I read. I was even thinking of writing a review of it because it was so well written, but instead I'll tell you now, READ IT! The book was extremely different from the film, director Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins) took a lot of liberties. But since the two are so different I won't compare them anymore, I'll just talk about the movie.Magicians Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are the best of friends until Borden accidentally kills Angier's wife during a magic show. They part ways, but Angier is suddenly obsessed with taking revenge on Borden. He sabotages one of Borden's shows and ends up wounding him. Now Borden wants revenge. What follows is a series of one-upmanship between the two rivals.Jackman and Bale are brilliant as always, showing the madness of these characters and their need for revenge. Michael Caine plays a mentor-like character named Cutter with a strong cockney accent, and does amazing. The other actors; Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie, are all noteworthy holding their own against the great acting chops of Jackman, Bale, and Caine. One thing that confused me though, it is never really explained why they go to such lengths to hurt the other, when it was an accident to begin with. This was explained in the book, but not in the film. Everything else though was masterfully crafted, and well explained. The cinematography, the somewhat grainy look, the dark and sometimes humorous approach of the film are all trademarks of Chris Nolan. He showed he could direct with ""Batman Begins"" which also starred Bale and Caine- and he has shown it again with ""The Prestige"". It is a fun film, with plenty of twists and turns, and is a great way to spend a Saturday night. Oh, and if you didn't catch my drift before, read the book as well. I give ""The Prestige"" 9 out of 10. It is rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images."
CineCritic2517,"Feb 18, 2007",5/10,"Like memento, here we have a relative simple story which by telling it either backward or through bits and pieces is supposed to become interesting. On the whole of course that never works for those with an imagination larger than that of an amoeba or for those that have seen the formulaic twist in already way too many predecessors.In the case of Prestige, to my surprise, there wasn't even a twist to speak of which really didn't matter much because the movie became drying paint already so much earlier, albeit in a nice shade of the colour blue.The story of Prestige is practically non-existent. But by telling it by means of flashbacks, tiresomely revealing spoon-fed bits of it, the plot and intrigue unfolds. Fast paced editing to throw in some confusion for good measure and some fake beards and fancy dress-up to, i guess, try to confuse the viewer on who was who and more importantly; when. Yet, as more and more of the story unravels, the more obvious it becomes that there isn't a story but more a collection of dreary facts.In the ""Usual Suspects"" for example, there was actually a compelling story unraveling while the writers worked their way towards the twist. Prestige only had some repetitive drama and therefore relied soly on the twist itself. Alas, many spotted the twist some 10 minutes into the film and it was hardly an earth-shattering twist anyway. I found no chemistry between the key-players and Bale and Jackman just lack any charisma whatsoever in their role (the keyword is magical showmenship, something they both lacked) and are therefore miscasted. Think i'm being harsh? Imagine either one of them playing the role of Eisenheim or Leopold, both charismatic characters/actors in The Illusionist.. I rest my case...The performances in Prestige were on par but the script was just too monotonous on too many occasions. On an even more annoyed note: Bowie was unrecognizable, Johanssen reduced to the human equivalent of a tittybar and Sir Cain to be honest, failed to impress but may have done this on purpose as a lesson learned from his literally outstanding performance in Children of Men. Another highly overrated film from 2006 in which his performance painfully made the acting of practically anyone else a complete joke.The cinematography in Prestige, though suiting the story and time in which it was set, was relentlessly dark which really was eye-candy but on the other hand didn't help the many plodding and derivative scenes.The only thing that made the movie endurable was the fine female company I was with, which provided the necessary distraction which made me miss some key-scenes which offered a bit of challenge to work it all out.I guess Nolan just isn't my kind of storyteller and his rather one-tracked stories not my cup of tea.4/10"
sallym12,"Jun 30, 2008",9/10,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece of epic proportions. Director Nolan gives us one of his best directing jobs.This movie contains everything from romance to pity, and power to poverty.Both Jackman and Bale play amazing characters. Bale is power hungry individual who stops at nothing short of owning and controlling everything in the world.This movie portrays the feelings and emotions of guilt and punishment.What is a great story and gripping account of what happens when dreams turn into nightmares.This is so much better than 'The Illusionist'I also love the lack of profanity."
gallae,"Apr 15, 2008",10/10,"I've just watched The Prestige and thoroughly enjoyed it.I've always had a fascination for stage and street magic - not so much to ""figure out the tricks"", but with an appreciation of the combination, of stagecraft, misdirection, and sleight of hand. The great magicians aren't remembered for ""clever tricks"" - rather, for the overall entertainment, for the illusion.And this film is perfect for all that. There is a mystery to it (in fact, at least two mysteries), but the clues to each are telegraphed all throughout the film, in plain sight. You have to watch and be alert.I figured out one of the mysteries in the middle of the film, but was still fascinated by how it was done. I think this is the same thrill I get when I'm watching a film about con artists (or a good episode of the old Mission Impossible), because what is shown is not always what is.And as this film explains, it's not how such things are done that matters (because once it's explained, no one cares any more), rather, it's that creation of illusion so that we have ""mystery"", that does."
liveweaver,"Apr 20, 2008",10/10,"i start by giving it ..nothing less than 10 ......it deserves it ...anywaythis movies is scripted beautifully,has a sense of mystery and clever too because it has to cover many sub plots also,and the writer is ..more than successful in achieving it.The dialogs and the cinematography of the scenes with long shots is fabulous in all senses.The story takes away the show by some extraordinary twists and turns and a strange flow of its own kind.And apart form the huge twists one after another,they are stated in such manner that people can also believe them at the time they come crashing there brains....!!Coming from one of the best directors today ..The Prestige is indeed prestigious,and by far one of the greats of all time ..and deserves a place at least higher to No Country For Old Men..in the 250 chart.At last i recommend it strongly to....own a DVD of this movie...if you like content full films of any kind ........you will not be disappointed at all.....sit back...and let the magic fascinate you ....... and you will leave with long lasting effects ..of disbelieve and pleasure ..........hats off or this one ...."
RoweJangles,"Oct 21, 2006",10/10,"I am very picky when it comes to movies, and I also like all genres. My favorite genre is a psychological thriller. Having said that this movie just blew my mind. In most movies I can figure out the ending well before the movie is over this one I could not, I was still trying to figure it out after the movie was over. This is the type of movie that as soon as you finish seeing it you will want to see it again. This is a type of movie that you must pay attention throughout the entire film. I was one the edge of my seat and my friend next to me was scratching his head and stomping his feet with excitement after the film was over. I would recommend this film to everyone and especially to those who are into psychological thrillers. This film has Oscar written all over it."
MrBoMzIMDb,"Sep 8, 2025",7/10,"Christopher Nolan's The Prestige is often hailed as one of the finest examples of narrative trickery in modern cinema, but on closer inspection, its reputation feels a bit overrated. While undeniably stylish and clever, the film occasionally sacrifices depth for the sake of spectacle, leaving it more of a cinematic puzzle than an emotionally fulfilling story.The plot follows two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), whose escalating obsession with outdoing one another spirals into betrayal, sacrifice, and tragedy. The themes-obsession, identity, and the cost of greatness-are rich and compelling, yet the execution leans heavily on the mechanics of twists rather than fully developing the emotional resonance behind them.The performances are strong, with Bale delivering a layered portrayal of Borden's complexities and Jackman capturing Angier's charismatic ambition. Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson add gravitas and nuance, though their roles sometimes feel underutilized. Nolan's direction is meticulous, and the muted color palette and period detail enhance the sense of bleak obsession. However, the storytelling's reliance on narrative gimmicks can feel distancing, making the emotional payoff less satisfying than it promises to be.Where The Prestige succeeds is in its atmosphere and its ability to immerse viewers in the world of illusion and deception. Where it falters is in delivering a truly profound human story beneath the layers of narrative sleight of hand. The final reveal, while clever, lacks the emotional weight to make the journey feel completely worthwhile.In conclusion, The Prestige is an intelligent and well-constructed film, but not quite the masterpiece it is often considered to be.Rating: 7/10 - Stylish and intriguing, but ultimately more trick than substance."
frnz_drakon,"Nov 4, 2006",10/10,"Christopher Nolan has directed excellent movies before. There's always a great deal of mystery in his films. This is no exception. Just like in Memento, in the Prestige he uses a fractured time line, giving the necessary information of the future for you to keep wondering how it got there, but he saves the secret for the last minutes.This film is about two magicians who, having been friends and co-workers, begin a rivalry that will eventually destroy them. Magicians are famous for tricking the public into believing something that's not real. Well, that's exactly what Nolan achieves with his script. It's so meticulously thought that it's almost perfect. If you add that to the acting of Bale, Jackman and the other cast members (Caine, Johanssen, Bowie), a romantic sideline and the sci-fi touch, you get one of the best movies in the decade. No doubt about that."
dingoberserk,"Dec 22, 2006",2/10,"When I left the cinema after watching 'The Prestige', I tried to make head or tail of its storyline and eventually had to give up. This movie is a hotchpotch of unclear situations, flashbacks, mysterious allusions to the extent that in the end nothing makes much sense. Some of the comments on this website did help clarify a number of issues, but in the end the tortuous plot and the all-too-frequent twists and turns had me throw in the towel. It is to be regretted that, in order to ensure the success (?) of a movie, film directors have to resort to irritating 'postmodern' techniques requiring an above-average IQ and a PhD in cinema studies. Oh, for the simplicity and directness of 'Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs'! Among the many unresolved issues, one detail continues to exercise my mind: what is the significance of the small red ball which continues to be thrown at some of the characters and is then thrown back to the sender?"
zhyarTheChosen,"Sep 9, 2019",8/10,I love nolan movies it just give you the different type of story for movies
pyrocitor,"Oct 21, 2006",10/10,"2006 has certainly been the year for very similar movies being released in pairs. First both Hollywoodland and The Black Dahlia slunk onto mainstream screens, both having almost identical plots set in the same time frame. Then came Infamous, another take on the Truman Capote story, which won Philip Seymour Hoffman the best actor academy award last year. And now, the theme of deception and magic seems to have infiltrated the screens, with the emergence of The Illusionist, starring Edward Norton, and... Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, detailing the story of two rival magicians constantly competing to upstage the other, their deadly game reaching increasingly higher stakes.Although comparisons between The Illusionist and Prestige may seem inevitable, safe to say that both are very strong films with admittably incredibly similar plot lines, but in terms of a superior, in areas where Illusionist stumbles, The Prestige seems only to soar, seeming to surpass all audience expectations. Just when the audience feels like they have figured out every last trick The Prestige has to offer, Nolan pitches them a new handful to wrack their brains over. Rather than getting caught up and getting lost in this convoluted structure, the film seems to revel in it, each twist seeming to only improve the quality and intrigue of the film.It's a testament to Christopher Nolan's incredible skill as a director and writer that he has shown such a run of success in film-making, having had arguably nothing less than a hit thus far, starting with his barely financed but incredibly successful thriller Momento, all the way to last year's incredibly well made Batman Begins, one of the strongest superhero films to date. Nolan seems to really thrive on unusual plot structures, showing a tendency to start the film right before the end of the story, then flashback throughout the course of the film, with occasional jumps back and forth in the storyline to keep the viewers watching closely. (Batman Begins also used this exact structure) It also goes without saying that Nolan retains his usual eye for costumes and set design, and the Victorian age has never looked so sumptuous as under the eyes of Nolan. He is without a doubt one of the most innovating and interesting directors around these days, and we can only hope a Batman sequel is indeed in the cards for him.Another major aspect in which The Prestige surpasses all potential peers is in the phenomenal cast. If such a cast has been assembled anytime of late, it is unlikely it was to such powerful effect, as each cast member contributes a simply wonderful performance to an already astonishing film. The casting of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale alongside each other is already enough to provoke mouth watering in about 98% of the population, whether admiring them for talent, looks, or the prospect of Wolverine and Batman sparring off. Either way, they are easily the acting standouts, and both deliver Oscar nomination worthy performances endowed with incredible charisma and skill. (Jackman comes across as the stronger, seeming a bit more emotionally genuine, but it's debatable as to which is the more acclaim worthy as they both deliver such sublime performances) Michael Caine is a classy and brilliant touch as the engineer Cutter, and a rare appearance from David Bowie as electrical inventor Nikola Tesla is a perfect piece of casting, as Bowie's appearance in the film seems to rival that of his character: elusive, exciting and and mysterious. Scarlett Johansson delivers a fine performance as Jackman's character's stage hand, despite several cringe-worthy slips of her Cockney accent, and Rebecca Hall has a somewhat repetitive role to deal with as Bale's character's wife, but still gives a great performance in the end. And of course, it's always great to see the vastly underrated Andy Serkis give yet another top notch performance as Tesla's assistant.All in all, The Prestige is an incredibly classy and powerful film event - packed with more twists and turns than any viewer, no matter how clever would be able to predict, and fueled with an astonishing cast giving wonderful performances, headed all the while by careful yet powerful writing and directing, on the part of Nolan, who can seem to do no wrong. We can only hope that more movies of this caliber come to theaters soon, as The Prestige is one of the most interesting, genuinely gripping and entertaining thrillers in recent film history.-9.5/10"

blanche-2,"Mar 14, 2010",9/10,"Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson star in ""The Prestige"" a 2006 film directed by Christopher Nolan.Jackman and Bale play Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, magicians in turn of the century London. The story is told in flashback until close to the end of the film. Angier and Borden start out as friends and colleagues, working as a magician's assistant. Tragedy strikes, and they become mortal enemies. Each becomes famous as a magician, and when Borden performs the ultimate illusion, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to find out how he did it and becomes determined to top it.This is an excellent film that will have you with your jaw on the ground at the end. In my own case I had to go back and re-watch the ending. This isn't a movie you can watch and zone out - the plot requires active following, as Nolan switches points of view between Angier and Borden, and skips from the past to the present. However, he does it with a master's skill. The other interesting thing about the film is the bad guy/good guy concept, which he turns upside down and inside out.""The Prestige"" captures the atmosphere of 19th century London perfectly. All of the actors - and the casting is superb - are in top form, with Caine giving an steady performance as the old magician who tries to keep Angier grounded and David Bowie as the mysterious Nikola Tesla. Jackman and Bale are well-matched as adversaries - both volatile and ambitious, driven men.Like a magician, Nolan distracts the viewer with one thing and then pulls a rabbit out of the hat. Sheer brilliance.You'll want to see this movie again. Highly recommended."
dbborroughs,"Nov 3, 2006",9/10,"The second magic related stories to be released in just over a month.Christopher Nolan has constructed an elaborate puzzle box of a movie thats a really good thriller. This is the story of two magicians who attempt to out do each other. The hatred is the result of a tragedy that happened years before on stage. Told in a series of flashbacks the film is a search for the secret of each man's version of the teleported man.Superbly acted, this is one of the rare recent films where the actors, even when big stars like Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine completely disappear into their roles. Its clear why everyone was involved with this film because everyone gets real meaty roles. David Bowie appears as Nikola Tesla and has the best role he's yet to appear in. You really must see this film for the actors if nothing else.You have noticed that I'm rather light on details and thats intentional. This is the sort of movie that is best taken on its face value. You'll want to see the twists and turns of its plot for yourself and not have them spoiled by reviewers and friends who feel the need to tell you too much about the story. What Nolan has constructed is a complex little thrill ride. What I will tell you is that he does play fair, in the end you will know all.For me this is going to require a second or third viewing. Its one of those movies where I'm in love with the construction of the film so much that I have to see it again to see if the thing is as good on an emotional level, I think it is but I'm still distracted by the ""sparklies"" of the box.Go see this film if you like good twisty stories with more than a hint of real magic in them."
jon.h.ochiai,"Oct 22, 2006",10/10,"Before Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) travels to Colorado to find scientist Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), Cutter (Michael Caine), magician mentor, tells Angier, ""Obsession is the game of young men"" In Director and Writer Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" obsession spirals into deadly rivalry. The Prestige refers to the Third Act of a magic trick. In Act One: The Pledge shows the ordinary. In Act Two: The Turn, the ordinary becomes extraordinary. In Act Three: The Prestige, the twist occurs and we see something shocking. Writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's ""The Prestige"", based on Christopher Priest's novel, embodies these three acts. The third act of ""The Prestige"" is a shocking surprise. While watching ""The Prestige"" I guessed half of the twist, but not everything, and was completely mesmerized by the end. ""The Prestige"" starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is an engrossing dark tale of revenge that is one of the year's best.I had read that Priest's novel had an innovative narrative style where the story is retold by the rival magicians Angier and Borden, wherein the truth is revealed. Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan unveil a captivating yarn through exchanged diariessee the movie. We are clued in from the on set, when Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) instructs us, ""Watch closely"" In the beginning Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale) are young magicians under the tutelage of Cutter (Caine). Angier's beautiful wife Julia (Piper Perabo) is a magician's assistant. However, in a magic trick turned fatal, Angier and Borden transform into enemies obsessed with revenge. Their obsession escalates into apparent murder. ""The Prestige"" perfectly casts with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Jackman and Bale are among the screen's most powerful actors. It is interesting and not coincidence that Jackman and Bale have achieved acclaims playing superheroes: Jackman as Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" movies; Bale as Batman in ""Batman Begins"". However, there are no heroes in ""The Prestige"". Director Nolan brilliantly leverages their contrasting styles and intensity. Tony Winner Jackman plays the brilliant showman Angier, who is talented, but smart enough to sense that Borden may be the more gifted magician. His hatred for Borden is boundless, even dismissing his assistant and lover Olivia (very good Scarlett Johansson) to discover Borden's secrets. Borden (Bale) is the brooding pure student of magiche has the eye. Borden marries Sarah (Rebecca Hall), and they eventually have a daughter Jess (cute Sammantha Mahurin). However, good woman Sarah suffers in the relationship of secrets. Borden becomes a star with his ""Transported Man"" trick. The jealous Angier believes that Borden is performing true magic. After several twists and turns, Angier is convinced that his own quest for 'true magic' lies with Nikola Tesla (Bowie), the Father of Magnetism. The true magic he seeks is apparently, science.Christopher Nolan (""Memento"", ""Batman Begins"") infuses a sense of wonder and tragedy in his dark tale. Ultimately, his ""The Prestige"" is about the cost of losing one's soul on the path of vengeance and fame. Hugh Jackman is simply powerful. As Angier he is a man whose life takes a dark turn, and becomes obsessed discarding almost all of his humanity. Jackman's intensity and vulnerability make Angier's quest sympathetic, but never enrolling. Jackman is masterful and charismatic in this balancing act. He has a commanding presence and voice. His performance is Oscar worthy. Equally powerful is Christian Bale as the conversely internalized Borden. His Borden is the consummate magician, always creating. Bale's intense understated performance hints at the anger and drive just below the surface. Jackman and Bale have an amazing screen partnership that is a paradox of styles. The scenes where both discover that they have been betrayed are stunning. Michael Caine is awesome as usual. Here he wonderfully floats between the two leads. His final alliance is a complete surprise. David Bowie is absolutely great as Nikola Tesla, a completely original character.Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is an unsettling tale of revenge and deadly rivalry. Nolan navigates many twists and turns arriving upon an electrifying surprise in this story of all consuming obsession. Jackman and Bale each give their best performance in Nolan's parable of forfeited souls. ""The Prestige"" is one of the year's best movies."
moonspinner55,"Mar 19, 2009",6/10,"In 1890s London, two magicians--once protégés of the same aging illusionist--consistently undercut each other on and off the stage, reveling in the one-upmanship; Hugh Jackman has the show business flair, while rough-hewn toughie Christian Bale is more intent on conquering the intricacies of unexplainable magic. Using rather obvious ploys (like phony beards and wigs, not to mention Scarlett Johansson as an assistant/secret agent), they each work as much on sabotaging the other's latest success as developing their own skills. This fantastic tale, directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan from the novel by Christopher Priest, might have bowled us over with a few cunning twists; unfortunately, the baffling screenplay reminds one more of H. G. Wells than ""Sleuth"", coming up with a bag of tricks so far-fetched it removes the film's core of inherent reality. The film is remarkably well-dressed and crafted, although the jumpy editing at the start (darting around in time before settling into a more conventional mode of storytelling) is rather a nuisance. The acting is solid throughout, even as the plot-gimmicks become more and more ridiculous, leading to a depressing and flat conclusion. **1/2 from ****"
preppy-3,"Apr 15, 2008",10/10,Drama about two magicians in England in the 1800s--Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). They perform together and Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) is accidentally killed during an act--or maybe not. Angier blames Borden--Borden denies it. They then start competing acts and try to sabotage each other--and things get deadlier and the stakes higher.This was a box office bomb and that's a shame. It is a little too long and it keeps you guessing--that's why people probably stayed away. This isn't a movie you can relax with--you have to pay strict attention to figure out what's going on. The movie has many ingenious twists and turns and constantly keeps pulling the rug out from under you. You always think you know where it's going--but then it veers off completely in another direction. Some people hate challenging films like this but I was fascinated. The acting is just superb across the board. Jackman and Bale have never been better--they come tearing out of the movie at you. Even the supporting roles are well done. Michael Caine (playing sort of a Greek chorus) pops up and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are also very strong. And wait till you see David Bowie as Tesla! Also the direction by Christopher Nolan just adds to the film immensely. He was one of the co-writers so he knows what he wants.Ingenious drama--beautifully acted and directed and full of twists and turns. One of the best movies of 2006. A definite must-see!
Jonny_Numb,"Nov 14, 2006",6/10,"Man, what a great movie...until the last 5 minutes.""The Prestige"" is a film that makes even the most jaded non-believer stare in awe at feats of magic. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rivals in the aforementioned field, and develop an acid antagonism when Borden 'accidentally' allows Angier's wife to die suspended in a tank of water. Their vengeance soars on a level both personal and professional, with each vying for the other's popularity, women, and magical secrets. At the core of this is a trick of which no one knows the key--titled 'The Transported Man,' it entails Borden teleporting himself from one place to another; Angier meets up with eccentric electro-magician Tesla (David Bowie), who seems to hold the answer.Director Chrisopher Nolan, who surprised us with ""Memento"" and rejuvenated the ailing ""Batman"" franchise, gives us another worthy, highly entertaining film poised for greatness...until the last 5 minutes. In his remake of ""Insomnia,"" Nolan's characters became slavish victims to the plot, and the same happens at the end of ""The Prestige."" After bobbing and weaving in a multitude of directions and keeping us guessing AND fully invested in the characters, it betrays our trust completely and leaves us with the sour notion that everything that happened in the preceding 2 hours didn't matter all that much.In a movie that pushes the figurative and literal limits of trickery, it seems like a low-brow deception for Nolan to leave us with the last-minute twists that would be more at home in the ""Saw"" series. Bale, Michael Caine, and Jackman (giving his best performance yet) are so strong--and their dispositions so absorbing--that the ending feels like the sort of dishonest fraud we'd get from a Three-Card Monte dealer. Yes, despite the maddening contrivances, ""The Prestige""'s twists DO make sense--but I felt the characters deserved a more sincere, straight-faced coda.In ""Secret Window,"" Johnny Depp told us: ""The most important part is the ending...and this one is very good."" Too bad the same can't be said for ""The Prestige,"" a movie that is so passionately bound for greatness that its last-minute deceptions make the disappointment that much greater."
The_Void,"Jun 21, 2007",8/10,"The Prestige is quality modern film-making at its very best. Christopher Nolan has proved himself to be a director to watch after his successful reinvention of the Batman series, and now this film; different in theme and tone to Batman, and for my money, much better! The brilliance of this film comes from many different areas - the acting performances and the professionalism of the film shown throughout go a long way towards ensuring that The Prestige is an excellent film, but really it is the story that makes this one stand out. The film is based on a novel by Christopher Priest and focuses on magicians in nineteenth century London. Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are magicians and friends working as assistants to another successful magician. Their friendship turns sour, however, when Alfred makes a mistake that leads to the death of Robert's girlfriend on stage. This leads to a fierce rivalry between the two magicians, and after each one sabotages the others' magic show; the rivalry takes a new turn as they battle to see who can carry out the greatest magic trick...The plot doesn't develop linearly, rather Christopher Nolan chops and changes the exact point in the story where the film is running from, and this works really well as everything always feels fresh and inventive and Christopher Nolan is clearly a director capable of handling this sort of feat. The Prestige features an all star cast, and all perform excellently. The male leads are obviously the main standout. Christian Bale has really proved what a great actor he can be over the past couple of years, and his performance here still works despite the fact that he sounds a lot like Grant Mitchell from Eastenders. Hugh Jackman is good also and he gets to show more of himself than he did in the X-Men films, while the likes of Michael Caine and David Bowie fill out the supporting cast. The cinematography on display is absolutely fantastic, and the film does an extremely good job of recreating nineteenth century London. The special effects are good also, and the scenes involving Tesla's machine are all standouts. It all boils down to a terrific and suitably mystifying conclusion and overall, I really recommend that everyone takes the time to see this film. The Prestige really is one of the best modern films I've seen in years."
devillogs,"Sep 7, 2019",9/10,Had to watch two times to fully understand the film truly remarkable
Dmaloy1992,"Mar 11, 2007",10/10,"I have been a rather large fan of Christopher Nolan's work, (Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia...) and The Prestige is no exception. It is extremely well directed and very well written. The acting is mostly amazing! I never though Hugh Jackman could do such a good job acting. And Christian Bale... Great! I was told about this movie from a friend of mine, and when he told me about it, I was really pessimistic about going to see it... Boy, was I wrong. I was expecting a movie that was long, boring, and just hard to watch... Take it from me, this movie is none of those three things. I definitely believe that this movie deserves its spot in the top 250. I even think it should be brought down into the low 100s, if not the high 90s. THis movie has made a spot in my top 5, and I really think this is one of very few modern-day masterpieces."
the-evil-cult,"Dec 19, 2006",10/10,"I went to this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. Only about one in eight seats in the theater were taken, not that many. Most of the people in the audience seemed young.The movie starts off ordinarily. The first half is a series of events. The movie jumps from one time period to another. Many scenes left me scratching my head. A magic trick consists of three stages: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Like a magic trick the movie started out ordinary. Borden and Angier are two magicians in deep rivalry. They go to great lengths to sabotage the other's work. It got to the point where every time they were performing a magic trick on stage I would anticipate something would go wrong. Many of these tricks involved guns and axes, so I was preparing myself for something very loud and shocking.After about halfway through the rather ordinary story of rivalry turns interesting as the two magicians read their diaries. But still I felt disoriented and didn't fully grasp everything. Towards the end though, everything made sense, and the plot fell together. It is a very complex and very shocking story. It is not just the plot that was excellent. The film seemed to have a lot to say in terms of themes. I won't give away too much but at the end the little girl Jess watches the magic trick that involves the little bird disappearing. She's amazed by it. She may want to know how the trick is done but once you realize how it is done it's probably not a good idea to tell her. Essentially the world is simple, cold, cynical, and miserable, but these tricks give happiness because they suggest this is not so. This deception is not isolated to simple magic tricks. The vanishing bird trick is analogous to what happens to the magicians. Some people will go to great lengths for an art.I enjoyed this film not just for its plot. I started to think that deception is just in the magic shows. They are not just in the characters and their lives. They are everywhere. It watched this movie six days before Christmas and in many ways Santa Clause is a magic trick, a deception. But it's more than that. I look at the football fans in stadiums and wonder whether they are just individuals proud of their teams or country or whether they are just totally deceived by marketers. In my life pretty much everything that gave me happiness turned out to be quite simple, quite pessimistic in reality, whether it's religion, family, or love. There is no magic, just science. There is no emotion, just biochemistry. No country, just politics. No morality, just power. Like the vanishing bird trick, you just don't want to know how it's done.Now when I spoke to people after the movie most of them didn't mention these ideas to me. They were too busy asking me about the mechanics of the plot, who was who, why this happened, and so on. But I think if you plan to watch the movie you should focus on more than what happened on screen. Try to infer certain concepts from the film and relate these to what you already know from experience in your own life. You may be quite surprised.The movie probably shouldn't be seen by small children. One reason is because of the on-screen deaths that occur."
ahmadsmalik7,"Aug 10, 2022",N/A,"The movie leaves you gasping for breath act after act, with its spectacular twists and characters that crave superiority over each other, revenge and most importantly, fame. The emotional conflicts for both the main characters are the main reasons for their respective character arcs and their acting really exceeds expectations. This is a classic Nolan film right from his signature non-linear storytelling down to his jaw dropping twists and mind bending ending that really elevate this movie. A 9 only because of Scarlett Johanssen's character and her unnecessarily revealing clothing but a masterpiece otherwise."
giaele,"Jan 20, 2007",10/10,"Nolan's last haunting masterpiece is an impressive allegory about ambition, sacrifice, arrogance, obsession, titanic effort to go beyond natural limits and to challenge God. Nietzsche ""Ubermensch"" concept is embodied in the fight between these two Victorian-Age magicians, as well as the conflict between science and wizardry, instinct and rationality, respect of the rules and compulsive intention to go beyond good and evil. When you go out of the cinema, you think about the inner sense of this movie again, and again, and again... Great emotions, great plot (a sort of Greek tragedy!), great meta-reflection about perception, theories of mind, and psychological blindness: a great movie. Abracadabra!"
genemorrissey,"May 18, 2017",9/10,"This is an amazing film. Its a film that makes want to see it again instantly after you've first seen it, partly cause you want to see if everything makes sense, and also cause of how spectacular it is. One of the things I loved about this film was that it never felt like either Huge Jackman's or Christian Bale's character was more important than the other. Both of them are equally as interesting and well performed. The way Christopher Nolan doesn't tell the story in in a typical way and instead decided to jump back and forth from different parts in the story was a genius move. He did it in a way so that it was confusing but never too confusing, how he managed to do that is beyond me. It also never focused too much on the actually magic and was always about the rival between Huge Jackman and Christian Bale. All the performances are great as well. the only bad thing was Scarlett Johansson's British accent which was pretty awful."
PrEdt0r,"Sep 12, 2019",10/10,"I am so lucky man to see this movie last night
The end scene was the greatest one for me ever"
nightcrawlerspike,"Jul 24, 2007",8/10,"It attracts you at first because it treats a subject everyone likes: magic and its secrets. But then, from the start, you see the plot quickly thicken. Writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has already proved his brilliance with Memento, plays with the timing of the story yet again by skillfully shuffling four different periods in the storyline, and adds an exciting pace by revealing a new twist with every step, so you never get used to anything or bored. The performances are dead-on and the actors very well cast indeed. A little too long, but it pays to see it all through. You want to have some fun? Try to figure out what happens next. The movie will by far exceed your expectations. Very entertaining indeed.By the way, Tesla existed in real life, though I seriously doubt he built all the things shown in the movie."
cararoche,"Aug 27, 2019",10/10,"This film was fantastic! So exciting, you never knew what was going to happen and it was so cool because it was magic! Other films followed this one, dealing in magic makers, their crews, their tricks and turns and I love them all. As many more films like this you make, that is how many billions of dollars you can make from them. We love MAGIC! We love the teams formed to create magnificent illusions. Bring it on!"
theurchin,"Jul 10, 2007",10/10,"now now now Mr. Nolan is the master director of these times is not an unknown thing. anyone doubts it pls watch prestige. watch it again and watch it again, try to find faults if u can, there are none. the performances are goood very gooood. Hugh Jackman and Christian bale just kick ass and convince you that they are the characters. the beauty of this movie is the script. the camera work is so cool and profound that you will feel that you are in every frame of the movie, right there watching it happen in front of you. it does get a bit slow in the middle but the end makes up for it this movie talks about rivalry gone wrong wholly wrong. rivalry is good but once it comes to the stage of rivalry Jackman and Bale have in this movie u just know something bad is gonna happen and shows what competition can do to completely normal people. flawless and wow mazing it will leave u stunned this is one film, after watching i was left stunned, never has a movie done that to me. the end will just take u by surprise and make you hail Nolan as the king of the present age. watch it."
rather_plump,"Mar 6, 2008",10/10,"First of all it really has to be said that Christian Bale is a god amongst men, at least in front of a camera. He always seems to deliver an intense performance on an intense script, and I'm talking without fail. If you've seen American Psycho, Batman Begins, or Equilibrium will understand that Bale almost always ends up playing a serious and obsessive character. This movie is no exception. Bale portrays a magician who ends up in a serious and life threatening rivalry with another magician, played by Hugh Jackman. Now that wasn't a particularly compelling description but I really don't want to ruin anything for you. Hugh Jackman actually delivers an uncharacteristically good performance in this movie, he easily matched Bale. It really was perfect casting. So I haven't really described the storyline but that little sentence earlier is all I'm willing to say because this movie has an amazing twist which I don't want to ruin. All I will say is ""complete dedication to your art..."" 10 stars no question!"
