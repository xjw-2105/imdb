Xstal,"Sep 30, 2020",9/10,"Absolutely crammed full of future references to all of your favourite science fiction feature films, series, books, comics and video games. There's also quite a lot rooted in the current world of science non-fiction with the age of automation and robots concurrently being consumed by A.I. and Machine Learning. You could squeeze gene editing in as well if you have the imagination.I saw a clean restored version and spent a lot of time wishing I was consuming the experience in a cinema as a result. Ambitious, visionary and epic in its making - seldom can any film lay claim to having such huge influence. It must have been quite breathtaking for the paying public of the day, in their time away from the grindstone, to encounter such an alien and yet metaphorically familiar world, as the one they encountered here."
ignatz928,"Apr 25, 2005",9/10,"Technically speaking, I have seen this Fritz Lang silent sci-fi before, but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it. I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the 80s. The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images, the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear. Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis, I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it. So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie. The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable, apocalyptic fantasy, and religious allegory. It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers, who toil in the depths tending the machines, and the upper classes, who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers. The hero, the idle, pampered son of the city's supervisor Joh Fredersen, changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria, the Madonna of the workers. His father, meanwhile, is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang, who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings. One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didn't see. In addition to restoring scenes to the film, the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version. With these changes, the story becomes much clearer, particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis. Perhaps most importantly, a whole new subplot is added involving the hero's dead mother Hel, who was loved by both his father and Rotwang. With this clarification of the back-story, the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer. In some ways it recalls the family back-story of the Star Wars movies. Of course, the real strength of Metropolis isn't the story, which is pretty silly and probably wouldn't have worked in anything but a silent film, but its amazing visuals, which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to 2001 and Blade Runner. Actually, though in most respects silent films now look primitive, one area in which they have the edge over modern film-making is in their frequently grandiose production design. Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world. The models of the city's towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a 1920s film. Even beyond the expansive production design and (for the time) special effects, Lang's visuals are all consistently inventive. The robot Maria provides some of the movie's most iconic images, including her transformation into a human being. In a later scene, she performs for upper-class men in a nightclub, and as she performs a striptease that in 1920s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent, the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs. A sign of Lang's visual lavishness, and the studio's, that he doesn't hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a character's state of mind. For instance, when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines, he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idol's head into which the workers are being sacrificed. At another point, while he's sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral. When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers, she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs. labor parable, and Lang gives us spectacular images of the tower's construction and fall. In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and over-literal, but they're what silent cinema does best -tell a story without the advantage- or obstacle- of dialogue. The story is a little slow to start, but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that I've seen. In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction, Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films, as the workers riot and sabotage the machines, endangering the entire city. Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than 20 years."
ACitizenCalledKane,"Dec 3, 2004",8/10,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film. You can see it's influence in films such as Star Wars, The Matrix, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, Blade Runner, and countless others. Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available, the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear. The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were, in some cases, phenomenal. I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie. It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is 77 years old, because a lot has happened in film since then. Yet, if you look at the basic elements of this movie - its story, characters, artwork, cinematography, etc., I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late 1920's. Also, take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this. The performances and set designs are going to be over the top. That was part of the style. Metropolis may not be for everyone, but, for those willing to read between the lines, this film still has a lot to offer!"
Bockharn,"Mar 13, 2004",10/10,"I doubt that I'd ever seen anything resembling a ""complete"" version of METROPOLIS before, though certain of its scenes were familiar to me, if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keaton's HEAVEN (1987).  In any case, whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration.  I expected to be distracted by the restoration's technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences, but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it.  As ""exaggerated"" as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards, some performances, such as the Master of the city, are amazingly nuanced and layered, and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone. The meticulous design of the film, the unerring camera placement and Lang's muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking. I'd thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity (""important"" = ""dull"") but now I've come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been."
Anonymous_Maxine,"Feb 16, 2001",10/10,"Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the 1920s? Sure, some science fiction movies are huge today, such as George Lucas' latest goofy Star Wars movie, but in 1926, Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then. And sure enough, we went right ahead living the way we were living, the population got bigger and more crowded, and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis.The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society (Metropolis) was run by his father, John Frederson, the master of Metropolis. He lives in a Pleasure Garden' high above the level of the workers', and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father, given the terrible conditions under which they live and work. Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines, showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic, sinister looking machine. The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts, as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devil-looking monster.  After countless workers are consumed by it (no wonder this was Hitler's favorite film), they are immediately replaced by other workers, who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements. If some of these scenes, men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured, and the rest of the workers keep right on working, hardly even noticing.The way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film, as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions. When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines, Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable, but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city. This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny, and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated. `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups' is a saying that doesn't necessarily only apply to stupid people, as Metropolis suggests. Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue, and the result is still compelling today. The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways (except that the two films can hardly be compared)  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least. An excellent film, Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten."
PIST-OFF,"Apr 24, 1999",9/10,"Silent movies are not for everyone. Neither are subtitles. Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece. One of the biggest productions of its time, Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared. But what Metropolis really has is orginality. This German-Expressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future (modern) city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern sci-fi. Star Wars's C-3PO was based on Bridgette Helm's robot. Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis look-a-like cities. This is a very good movie. It's too bad most movies don't have its originality."
The_Film_Cricket,"May 30, 2004",N/A,"We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born. The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given. The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upper-class and operated by slave-like poor. The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens. The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God. The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan. These elements can be found in this film's ancestors 'Frankenstein', 'Batman', 'Gattaca' and the cities of 'Blade Runner', 'Star Wars' and 'The Fifth Element'. All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Lang's work.'Metropolis' has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made, certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes. After its success in 1927 the film has had an uneasy time. It's pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre. One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring. Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in 1927. Unless a lost version surfaces (as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentino's 1922 film 'Beyond the Rocks') the complete work my never be seen again. The restored version released on DVD in 2001 was based on a digital restoration at 2K resolution from all available sources. It's the best version that I've seen and I would highly recommend that one if you haven't seen the film. The worst is a 1994 print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration, the film in grainy and difficult to see, it doesn't even have a soundtrack. I call that one the worst because I'm still a little ambivalent about the 1984 restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting (good), sound effects (not so good) and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy, Freddy Mercury, Bonnie Tyler, Adam Ant and Pat Benatar (yuck!).Those who study the film (myself included) find the story impenetrable. Some films you can easily decipher but 'Metropolis' has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that it's hard to pin it down as a whole. Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the film's chaotic nature. It takes place in the future (restored versions offer title cards that suggest that it's the year 2000 but I don't go by that) in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers (the Gothic, sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry). The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives, dancing in their penthouses and spending their money. The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine. Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step. They don't so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses' slaves building his pyramids. The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another. One person that isn't ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his office.His son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the worker's children. Curious, he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there. The woman is Maria, a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be found.Freder uncovers a plot by Rotwang, the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms. This leads to the film's most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs. Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzy.Then all Hell breaks loose, but the rest I must leave to you to discover.Lang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou. In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film (and therefore less successful), the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not. He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers. At one point Freder, disguised as a worker, witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen. Another suggests an odd device, a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around it's edge. The machine doesn't seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless day.The film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism, astonishing in its use of light and shadow. One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in. Another brilliant moment comes with Maria's erotic dance as the men gawk, the camera filled with their moist eyes. This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home video.Other moments have deeper resonance. There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves. Walking to work they march with their heads down, dressed in uniforms and caps. It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps. There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler. More obvious are Lang's biblical references. The rise of the city parallels Maria's retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel. The giant pentagram in Rotwang's lab as he plays God. The breathtaking image of the plague-bringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe. The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself. There is even a Christ-like quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakers.These elements and images are brought to the film because of Lang's insistence on no less then absolute perfection. He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster, working his cast and crew like a dictator. He cast some 20,000 extras (1500 of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone) and worked them from morning till night. The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold. Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night. Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times, once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with him.I could go on and on, this film all great films invite lengthy discussions. It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways, as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over. But when you get down to it the best way to view 'Metropolis' is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of it's time, Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad."
claudio_carvalho,"Jan 26, 2006",10/10,"In the future, the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes: the workers, who live in the underground below the machines level, and the dominant class that lives on the surface. The workers are controlled by their leader Maria (Brigitte Helm), who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers, since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles. Maria meets Freder Fredersen (Gustav Fröhlich), the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen (Alfred Abel), in a meeting of the workers, and they fall in love for each other. Meanwhile, Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis, and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate them.""Metropolis"" is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes. When ""Metropolis"" was shot, it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history, with socialist movements around the world. Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides, showing that they need each other. I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in 1927, with very primitive cameras and equipment. The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York. The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role, and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Metropolis""Note: On 05 March 2019, I saw this film again on Blu-Ray.Note: On 26 January 2024, I saw this masterpiece again."
Coventry,"Aug 25, 2005",8/10,"Fritz Lang's groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema. How can a movie that'll soon turn 80 years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages. The world has been divided into two main categories: thinkers & workers! If you belong to the first category, you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if you're a worker, your life isn't worth a penny, and you're doomed to perilous labor underground. The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil, so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself. It's essential viewing, anyway! ""Metropolis"" is a very demanding film-experience and definitely not always entertaining. But, as it is often the case with silent-cinema classics, the respect and admiration you'll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoyment-aspect. Fritz' brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to re-create a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines. Many supposedly 'restored' versions have been released over the years (in 1984 and 2002, for example) but the 1926-version is still the finest in my opinion, even though that one already isn't as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it. ""Metropolis"" perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Blade Runner"" owe their existence (or at least their power) to it."
cartman_1337,"May 12, 1999",10/10,"This must be one of the greatest movies of all time. I found myself almost in a state of shock during the whole movie. Everything was perfect. The story was great, the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimension.I don't think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one. Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects. Sure they look good, but it's no big deal making them. Back in 1926 computers weren't even invented yet, all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing. And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie, it's impossible not to get impressed. Huge buildings, explosions, flooding, picture phones (however did he come up with the very idea?), transformation sequences, robots and so on. No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one. Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects, but they don't even come close.Then you have the filming. Everything is perfect. The use of body language is tremendous, the light setting perfect, everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera. I've never been witness to such a treat in filming other places.And the story!!! Perfect in every detail. Intriguing, exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders. No wonder Hitler liked this movie...I don't know how the original music of the film was, but the new music for the restored 139 minute version I saw was really good and moodseting.All in all. This is one of the most perfect movies of all time, and it deserves anything it can get. Never has a 10/10 been as secure as for this movie..."
Igenlode Wordsmith,"Apr 17, 2006",6/10,"One definitely can't fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Lang's vision, even if, as always with depictions of the future, there are a few forgivable blind spots. (The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the 1920s, as are the flying-machines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrow's rulers, unlike their exotic leisure wear, doesn't appear to have advanced one iota!)H.G.Wells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour, and as a piece of coherent science fiction it's certainly as lacking as he claimed. The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task, and there is no explanation of how this society functions, how it evolved or how it is sustained, let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral. But Wells' own futuristic film, ""Things to Come"", conceived in direct riposte to Lang's 'unscientific' approach, is tedious and talky as a result, didactic in its heavy-footed philosophy and explanations, and lacking in artistic vision: ""Metropolis"" may be 'soft' SF, but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinema.I am not, however, impressed by it as a film. Masterpiece of Modernism it may be -- but great design and special effects can't save today's big-budget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot, and they don't save this one. Ironically, I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered: reading through the IMDb pages, I see well-meaning comments like ""Great -- when you consider how primitive cinema was in 1927"" and ""once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence..."" It wasn't -- and it doesn't!As silent films go, this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious, marred by clumsy acting, tendentious titles and overwrought gestures. By the late 1920s, cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime: in Lang's case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice, but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostrom's ""The Wind"" or ""The Scarlet Letter"", Asquith's ""Underground"" or ""Shooting Stars"", and Murnau's ""Sunrise"", the film comes across as ten years behind the times. The problem is not necessarily with the actors -- Brigitte Helm, as has been observed, does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters -- but with the direction and pacing.We saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didn't always seem to fit too well, with pops, jumps and awkward silences, but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material, or to problems in the projection booth when running a newly-arrived print for the first time. However, the painstaking summary of the various 'missing scenes' only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editing-down in the first place! To take a single example: where the edited version conveys Freder's sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers' long-awaited 'mediator' via the simple juxtaposition of three shots -- the shift-change whistle announcing the meeting, the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off -- the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking length...It is interesting to see how it was done, but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement, and by and large I didn't feel that what was omitted had been any great loss. In fact, frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points, such as Rotwang's pursuit of Maria through the catacombs. She screams, and runs, and screams, and runs, and is pursued by a searchlight effect; it's clever, self-consciously clever, the first couple of times, but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature. Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers, culminating in the infamous 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'-style ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero, which raised giggles, in a hitherto serious and respectful audience, with which I couldn't help but sympathise.This is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it -- not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals. But it's all surface and no substance: the characters act arbitrarily, the plot is subservient to the Message, the pacing is like treacle, the story-telling technique is primitive, and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects. I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition. This is not cinema as I love it -- it's innovative, it may be Art, but as an actual film it's only a poor shadow."
AlsExGal,"Jul 5, 2019",10/10,"... and the story is worth paying attention! It is just about a perfect silent film experience. It is the story of a two-tiered society. Above ground, a modern city, with most of the young people immersed in decadent behavior and leisure, because all of the machines, below ground, do the work. Joh Fredersen is the architect of the city, and must be some kind of strongman, because if he fires you the result is you are sent to live ""in the depths"", below the city, with the workers. The workers have an existence so bleak that they trudge together in some kind of synchronized slouched shuffle as the shift changes among those tied to the giant machines. Even those getting off for the shift show no joy. It is almost prescient of concentration camp occupants a decade or so later .Freder, Joh Fredersen's son, has life change for him when Maria, a beauiful young prophetess, emerges from the depths with the children of the workers' city and mentions that these young men playing above are their brothers. He wants to learn all he can about the workers below, and does not share dad's indifference at their fate. Worried about the prophetess perhaps inciting the workers to rebel, and worried about his son's over concern for and curiosity about the workers, Joh Fredersen goes to consult the inventor Rottwang.This is his first mistake, because Rottwang hates Joh Fredersen, and he's quite open about it. Apparently ""Hel"", Fredersen's wife, once belonged to Rottwang, but married Fredersen and died giving birth to Freder. Forgive and forget are just not in Rottwang's vocabulary, and to prove it he has a giant statue, a kind of tomb erected in his home to her memory. So when Fredersen asks for Rottwang's help to destroy the faith that Freder and the workers have in Maria, he shouldn't be so sure that this isn't a plan to destroy Fredersen instead, and yet Fredersen stupidly trusts him.Let me just say that my husband likes few silent films, but he'll sit down and watch Metropolis every time because the sets are so engrossing. Such symbolism goes on here. ""Maria"" must be an analog of the Virgin Mary. There are references to one of the machines when it boils over and explodes as ""Moloch"" the god to which human beings were sacrificed by being thrown into a raging fire. When Maria appears in the catacombs below the workers' city, it appears to be some kind of makeshift chapel with three crosses on one side and two crosses in the middle. Why five crosses? Then when Maria talks about the Tower of Babel she turns it into some kind of lesson on mistreated and abused labor. And then there is a reference to ""Babylon the Great"" in such a way as I think Saint John never intended. And on it goes.With this being a little more than a decade out from WWII, I couldn't help but wonder what happened to these German actors and actresses. Brigette Helm, who played Maria, lived a long life, but the coming of sound and the take over of the German film industry by the government caused her to retreat to Switzerland, where she lived until 1996 at age 90. Alfred Abel, who played Joh Frederson, died in Berlin in 1937. Gustav Frohlich, who played Freder, lived until age 85 in 1987. He served in the German army during the war, and he was banned from acting from 1941-1943 because of a dust up he had with Joseph Goebbels over Frohlich's girlfriend at the time.I'd highly recommend this for a bewildering plot and eye popping art design."
ccthemovieman-1,"Aug 7, 2008",7/10,"For its time, this movie has stunning visuals, kind of Kubrick-esqe in appearance, especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work. It's very strange, with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombies.The set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention. This really has a futuristic look. I thought the visuals were fascinating. This was ""German expressionist"" filmwork at its height, I would think. Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession. This wasn't his first effort but, I think this might have been the film that put him ""on the map,"" so to speak. Several years later, he gained a lot more fame with ""M."" At any rate, with the photography, sets and overall Flash Gordon-type sci-fi look, this must have been a real eye-opener to movies viewers 80 years ago. I still think they look very cool today. The music was also very dramatic, at least in this restored 5.1 surround sound restoration DVD, put out by Klino.Obviously, the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm, who plays ""Maria"" and her evil clone. She is something else! I also appreciated Klino's explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together. They did an outstanding job. I wouldn't attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD, which looks pretty darn good.This is a ""worker"" story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers, who do their thing beneath the earth in ""Metropolis."" Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots. If someone gets hurt, they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombie-like human. Of course, people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion. That's history, from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today, so that's part of this story, too. I won't say more to ruin it.I don't want to mislead people on one major point: today's audiences watching this. Few people in 2008 watch silent movies. To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is, obviously, asking a lot. I had to break this up into several viewings, myself, but that's okay. I still enjoyed it.....but it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through. You have to be a student of film, or a big film buff, to watch this....but those people will be rewarded. Over 250 reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer, or at least take a look. Now that this restored version is available, check it out!"
BaronBl00d,"Feb 1, 2000",N/A,"Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made.  Its scope, its reach, its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by today's standards of film-making.  Seen in context of its premier in 1927, Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history.  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great, and in particular, Metropolis.  A great film is one that stirs the imagination, leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever, forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life, and achieves a kind of immortality.  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria.  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings, halluciatory scenes, and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope, most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions.  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria.  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual, as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups.  Lastly, Metropolis has stood the test of time.  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre.  The story itself is simple,a Biblical allegory, about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen.  The film is anything but simple.  It is immense, and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us."
Birwin,"Dec 18, 1998",10/10,"I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie. This is without a doubt the best sci-fi movie I've ever seen! Let me explain my position. We have all seen modern sci-fi movies, and argued over which is the best ever made, but those film makers have high speed film and computers. Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in 1925, and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film, as well as just good fun for everyone. The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold."
F Gwynplaine MacIntyre,"Jun 24, 2010",10/10,"'Metropolis' is my all-time favourite movie, so I've saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb. I've enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies I've seen, but now I'm moving on to other passions.Although written by Fritz Lang's wife Thea von Harbou, 'Metropolis' was originally Lang's idea: he was inspired by the sight of New York's skyscrapers when he sailed to America in 1925. During his American trip, he visited the set of 'The Phantom of the Opera' and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasn't filmed.Despite its epic power, 'Metropolis' makes very little sense. The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen, so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father (not son) of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwang's crude little cottage the only pre-Fredersen building that wasn't demolished during the construction of this city? (Von Harbou's very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it.) How and why did Rotwang's high-tech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers, some of the plot's incoherence can be blamed on missing footage, particularly in American prints. The distributors for this film's original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles. A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel, who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder. This unseen woman's name could not easily be changed for the American version, due to a couple of shots of her memorial, engraved with the Teutonic name HEL. Apparently, Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this word's similarity to 'Hell', so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movie.The real-life drama on the set of 'Metropolis' must've been quite interesting in itself. Mad scientist Rotwang (alias Doctor Strangeglove) is played by actor Rudolf Klein-Rogge, who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang, the mastermind of this film. In 'Metropolis', Rotwang's wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis. I'd love to know how Klein-Rogge felt about the fact that his real-life marital (and sexual) situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie ... and I wonder how Klein-Rogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as well.Most astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of 'Metropolis' was actually built to scale, with just a couple of miniatures.Trivia tidbit: actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flat-chested, and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix. A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume. I learnt this more than 20 years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the film.For all its flaws, 'Metropolis' will always be my favourite movie. I've enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb. The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies. Well, you can't win 'em all.Nitrate film stock doesn't last forever, and all good things come to a happy ending. This is my last review here. I'll keep watching movies, but other passions are important to me as well. Thank you, IMDb, and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews. I will happily rate 'Metropolis' a full 10 out of 10."
elicopperman,"Jan 30, 2019",8/10,"Whenever people are asked what they consider to be revolutionary and historically significant in terms of classic cinema, one answer that frequently comes up is Metropolis, and it's not hard to see why. In addition to being a very impressive technical achievement for its time, the film is well known as the very first feature-length sci fi film. While it wasn't met with a very warm reception upon its release (not to mention having been cut since then), it has made a massive impact over the decades for its biting allegory and themes of purity mixed in with knowledge and strength.Set in a futuristic urban dystopia, high class city planner Joh Fredersen lives in the Tower of Babel around the prestigious city, which is atop its underground equivalent filled with workers who manage the machinery that support it. The actual story revolves around Joh's son Freder and the holy figure Maria trying to overcome the major split between the two parts. Director Fritz Lang and writer Thea von Harbou develop the film's plot through world building, as it's made clear from the start that the workers of the surface-level power plant toil with the equipment tirelessly year by year. Satirically, the workers are the clocks controlled by the ringleader Frederson. In a way, the film lets the viewers think about the societal differences between individuals and power without spoon-feeding the message as much as showcasing it through distinctive nations.Admittedly, the film doesn't really develop the characters outside of their basic tropes and goals, but they're by no means bad. If anything, they're meant more to guide the events of the different classes throughout the story's progression. Freder knows all the wrong doings of tampering with technology, therefore he wishes there to be a proper balance between the thinkers and the builders, hence why he adores Maria so much. Speaking of Maria, she is the saintly guide to the workers looking for hope, but her purity comes at a price of the mad scientist Rotwag who builds a robot to replicate his loved one Hel (who ended up becoming Freder's mother). Without spoiling much, let's just say that what he does to Maria really causes the film to get suspenseful. The remaining cast are mainly easily manipulated individuals looking for the right voice to lead them.But of course, the feature's visual style is timelessly breathtaking. Most of the special effects were huge innovations at a time of severe technological limitations, and some even work as substance depending on some given scenes (like the mythos behind the Tower of Babel). Many of the contraptions and backdrops have clearly inspired the likes of Blade Runner, Futurama and even Batman over the years, mainly through the gothic architect and abstract landscapes. Admittedly, a lot of the acting is really over the top by today's standards, but that's more attributed to the dynamic gestural performances commonplace back in the day. That, and many scenes do kind of drag on a bit for their own good. However, the narrative and message are meant to be told through these elaborate sets and melodramatic performances to gain the necessary emotional resonance for such an ambitious project like this.In conclusion, Metropolis is a prime example of how something can stand the test of time through technical brilliance and emotional resonance based on a political allegory. It's funny how Fritz Lang believed this film to be the prediction of how the future would be perceived back in the 1920s, because it's not too far off from today. Technology is a great usage and all, but all the amazing knowledge and manual labor in the world are nothing without the necessary negotiating in case one spirals out of control, something that many corporations these days fail to realize. If you are yet to check this film out, definitely feel free to do so to remind yourself how important it is to maintain order around advanced infrastructure."
Fella_shibby,"Apr 27, 2021",10/10,"I first saw this in the early 90s.Revisited the 148 mins restored version recently.The special effects, set designs, the futuristic cityscape with the skyscrapers, the aerial roads, the catacombs, the cathedral, Rotwang's house, the long stairs, the rooftops, the scary demonic statues, etc.Man, this movie still amazes me and i am in awe of this movie.Indeed it is the granddaddy n mother of all science fiction movies.The chase n fight on the roof of the cathedral, i can just imagine the tension it must have created on audiences' minds 94 years back.The hallucination scene where the machine is the temple of Moloch and the workers are being fed to it, creepy enuff.The false Maria as the whore of Babylon, riding on the back of a many-headed dragon is wonderfully done."
oOoBarracuda,"Jan 6, 2016",9/10,"It didn't take Metropolis long to reach a mammoth level in cinema. The film actually surely surpassed this description upon its creation, as the cost of production was more than any film at the time and included thousands of extras. The genius that is Fritz Lang shone through in this epic. The effects utilized in this film far surpassed their time and would prove to be a grandiose enjoyment for the audience for years to come. Never let anyone tell you a silent film cannot be absolutely captivating and stunning, as Metropolis proves both of these assertions to be blatantly false.Thrown into a world full of cityscapes and advanced machinery, the audience quickly figures out that they are in a seemingly utopian future, in the city of Metropolis. The city's founder, Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) acts as a God-like figure overlooking the city and the means of its production and continuation. His son, Freder, becomes captivated by a woman he meets in the city below. He soon learns to find out that the person of his desire, Maria (Brigitte Helm), is a member of the working class. Living amongst the wealthy society, Freder was completely oblivious to life among the poor working class, living below the city. He then becomes shocked and quite saddened to learn that his father is responsible for the conditions of the working class. In what spawns a duel between loyalty and love, Freder devotes himself to reaching common ground between the wealthy and the working poor. Someone must mediate between the members of society that think of action for the city, and the working class that bring those thoughts to fruition; Freder is just the person for the job.A technical wonder for its time and beyond, Metropolis remains fixed in its astonishing effects. The scene in which Maria captivates the men of Metropolis is incredible. The juxtaposition between the collage of eyes, men's faces, and the dancing Maria was chilling. Just as powerful as this scene are the many in which the audience gets a view of just how many people are involved in this film. Seeing the droves of individuals racing around on screen is mind boggling to say the least. All of these technical feats culminate with Maria's transformation to machine. The visuals that Lang uses throughout the film are incredible, not just in a ""for 1927"" way either. The widely regarded first feature-length science fiction film, Metropolis is one to visit again and again, even today, for sci-fi fans.Riddled with heavy concepts throughout the entire film, Metropolis deals with social hierarchy, revolt, and capitalism, among many other ideas. Without trying, one can appreciate the stark difference in class between the citizens of Metropolis. For the wealthy above ground, they live a carefree life, completely oblivious to those working beneath the city desperately trying to sustain themselves. Freder himself, heir to the city's founder, had no idea what people endured to preserve the city and all of its technology. Once the workers realize how different they live compared to the wealthy elite, revolt becomes a possibility. It seems, even beneath the differences among the two classes, neither wants to do the other harm. The workers are driven to revolt to make fair society rather than harm the wealthy members of it. The film also makes a stark claim about capitalism, that it should be both desired and feared. Citizens should desire capitalism because it will guarantee the city in which they live will be sustained by a working class that will never leave their position. Security is a benefit that it seems only capitalism can provide to a collection of citizens. Capitalism should also be feared as a means to keep workers from reaching their potential and creating a disconnection between the workers from the rest of society. This time of constant menial work also alienates the workers from what they are doing daily resulting in spirits that are never tapped. One could spend a lifetime discussing the conceptions within Metropolis, as it remains a beautifully intense film that should be required viewing for anyone living among other people.I find it interesting that H.G. Wells quoted Metropolis as being ""quite the silliest film"" because much of it reminded me, and seemed to be inspired from, his own work The Time Machine. Both tell the story of a dystopian future, advanced technology and its flaws, and the dangers of class separatism. For whatever the reason, and it would have to be a good one, Wells didn't enjoy this film. Everyone has that prerogative; I quite enjoyed the film, and had fun seeing my first silent movie epic. I would recommend this as required viewing for citizens and Fritz Lang fans alike. Luckily, that should cover just about everybody."
tyson-hunsaker,"Nov 20, 2017",10/10,"""Metropolis"" is Fritz Lang's masterpiece of science-fiction that delves into a highly metaphorical futuristic story of two divided classes and a man caught in between them. A film devoted to ideas and themes, richly rooted in religion and fantasy, ""Metropolis"" is a haunting and emotionally powerful experience that's impossible to forget. This is one to study for the ages and every film fan should find and cherish.Time hasn't been kind to this extraordinary film. After years of different versions, KINO International released a ""complete"" version of the film which included lost and damaged footage essential to the plot of the story. Thanks to their outstanding restoration of the film, we get to experience ""Metropolis"" in mostly all of its cinematic and artistic glory. The images and story feel more striking than ever before and the unapologetic approach Fritz Lang took in creating this masterpiece is what makes this movie stand far out above other science-fiction films.The film itself has a dream-like trance with hypnotic editing that when dream sequences are actually happening, you wonder what truth is really being presented on screen. This works to the film's advantage by allowing the audience to completely feel the majesty and horror of the future. ""Metropolis"" immerses the audience with not only excellent technical techniques, but the brilliant art direction and production design. Viewing the film in 2017, one still wonders exactly how particular effects were achieved. Thankfully, we get sucked into this world and its story so effortlessly, we have no time to wonder how we're seeing what we're seeing. We simply enjoy the movie magic.With clear direction, strong performances, and unforgettable visuals, ""Metropolis"" couldn't be more recommended. If the ""complete"" version is available, it's well worth the extra runtime to grasp the entire story. ""Metropolis"" is a cinematic masterpiece; pure and simple."
Doylenf,"Jan 14, 2007",7/10,"The first great sci-fi film is still amazing for the sets and special effects--primitive as they may seem to day's fans--especially if viewed in the sort of pristine print seen on TCM these days.German expressionism is in full swing from the opening scene of workers reporting for a shift change in the city of the 21st century before switching to the opulent world above where men enjoy a playboy existence devoid of work and concentrating on play. There's such intensity to the surreal images on screen that it defies your ability to turn away--in other words, director Lang knows how to hook you into the story from the very start.It's not the story that's significant here. The startling special effects and costumes and images of a mechanized society are what capture the attention immediately. The main story has the young man abandoning his life of luxury to join the oppressed workers that he observes caught in a mighty explosion--and wanting to do something by joining the workers in the depths.Pretty heavy-going at times and the acting is strictly from silent screen technique--very melodramatic with broad gestures. The plot takes an interesting turn when the inventor is instructed to give the Machine-Man the image of the girl--whom the manager's son has fallen in love with. The manager is still bitter because his son has joined the oppressed workers. This leads to all sorts of mayhem among the workers climaxing in some of the most astonishing set pieces ever conceived at this time in German film-making.An extraordinary viewing experience, original in concept and dazzling in execution. A memorable performance by BRIGITTE HELM, especially as the mechanized Maria."
panchodh_12,"Oct 2, 2015",9/10,"Long live modern cinema. No matter how revolutionary the avant-garde movement was for art as a whole, the modernists' true medium, was definitely, the last, seventh art. Metropolis captures perfectly the zeitgeist of its moment: the Weimar's republic contradictions and overlapping between Marxist ideas, Christian references and a futuristic faith in the machines. The way these interplay is astonishing, because the final result is as relevant to today's reality as it was to that of the inter-war period. We still have segregated cities; we still have enslaved proletarians in East Asia building iPhones for a few; violent revolution is still not the answer. And I find very curious how the movie, despite its socialist claims, depicts the workers as an irrational crowd, easily manipulated by pretty much anyone with a tiny bit of agency. And the relation Man-Machine is never completely resolved: are they evil? are they a tool for exploitation? are they the basis of our survival?What also makes me marvel is that this movie is from the time before the stock market crash; before Hitler. The camera techniques, the special effects (!), the massive amount of extras, have nothing to envy those of today's blockbuster. The plot situations that rise up in this movie, have become way too recognizable tropes over the course of the century. The evil double, the fight on the rooftop, the water rising scene, the artificial hand, the wrongdoer who later sacrifices himself, the damsel in distress... Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas these past ninety years. And yet Metropolis has bits that resemble nothing I ever saw, and completely blew my mind; above all the dancing scene at the end of the Intermezzo, which is probably among the best movie scenes in history, full stop.Metropolis is, therefore, a virtuous combination, between a movie that fully captures the zeitgeist of the avant-garde time, while at the same time being a timeless piece that is relevant to today's world and can be enjoyed by today's audience as much as the audience it was intended too. Few movies deserve as much to be on the podium of greatest movies of all time."
Manya086,"Oct 21, 2015",9/10,"First of all, I don't consider myself a silent film fan. Actually, I never really seen a silent film until METROPOLIS, unless you count THE ARTIST. Like most people, my first impression would be that silent films are boring. But I was wrong...METROPOLIS took me completely by surprise. I was impressed at how advance the special effects are. The set design of the city is fantastic, looks very similar to something you would seen in Sci-Fi films today. The story is original with a powerful message. Though the performances of the actors are a bit over the top, which I suppose is to be expected in silent films. Also some lost parts of the film were recovered and restored, so the transitions of different qualities throughout is a bit distracting.Overall, METROPOLIS is a great film ahead of its time. Though, I must admit it is a little hard to sit through; I myself ended up stopping it occasionally, it is a good 2 hours long."
Phenryss,"Mar 12, 2003",10/10,"Very simply put, this is a masterpiece.  Fritz Lang's vision has affected everyone from Dark City to Star Wars to Madonna and Queen Music Videos.  If it were not for this movie there would be no C-3PO!!  George Lucas has often said that the robot Maria in Metropolis was the inspiration for the visual of C-3PO...The visuals and use of light and shadows make this a very interesting movie. Unfortunately there is no ONE version of this film as it was butchered by each country that showed it.  Parts of it are lost forever.  Kino Video has done a wonderful restoration recently and it should be in every film buff's library!"
palfreyman,"Aug 26, 2002",10/10,"Just saw the restored version at the Castro in SF - the perfect venue for a phenomenal film.  So many confusing points were cleared up by this careful reconstruction of a film that never should have been cut up for any reason. I'd already seen Metropolis a couple of times and found it fascinating but muddled; this version, on the big screen in glorious black-and-white with its original soundtrack, is electrifying. Although the acting (particularly Freder) is stylized almost to the point of unintentional hilarity, for the most part the performances are gorgeous - Brigitte Helm is astonishing, playing two roles as the sprirtual Maria and her feral, hypersexed robot-double."
Abdulxoxo,"Aug 9, 2024",6/10,"Metropolis is undeniably a landmark in cinematic history, watching it, I couldn't help but appreciate the craftsmanship that went into creating such a visually stunning piece of cinema. It's clear that Metropolis laid the groundwork for the science fiction genre, with its dystopian themes and its exploration of class struggles resonating even today. However, despite its visual brilliance, I found myself struggling with the film's narrative. The story, while ambitious, often feels convoluted and heavy-handed. The plot meanders through a series of melodramatic twists that, at times, feel more like a vehicle for the film's visual spectacle than a coherent story. Characters, particularly the leads, come across as archetypal rather than fully fleshed out, which made it difficult for me to fully engage with their journeys. The pacing is another challenge, with scenes that linger longer than necessary, making the film feel overly drawn out.While I respect Metropolis for its historical significance and its role in shaping the future of cinema, I can't ignore the fact that it can be a difficult watch. Its themes, though relevant, are delivered in a manner that can feel preachy, and the film's length only exacerbates this issue."
Marcyph3r,"Mar 10, 2020",9/10,"German filmmaking during the Weimar Republic never seems to stop being amazing, astonishing... this time it's Lang, whose extravagance I had marvelled at when watching his Nibelungen (1924) duology.But this is something else entirely. No classic Germanic folk story, no, this is science fiction, distopian fiction and simply incredible filmmaking.The scale, the ambition, the effects, the cinematography, the tension, the way it feels astonishingly modern in parts... it is all very exciting and impressive.It might be a tad too long, especially the final act got a bit ridiculous. But perhaps it is a fool's errand to expect a Fritz Lang movie to not go all the way. It certainly does, and we have to thank the man for his ambition and innovation.Some fun over the top acting, especially enjoyed seeing Rufolf Klein-Rogge again, after his role in Dr. Mabuse."
Zoopansick,"Jul 1, 2003",7/10,"First of all Metropolis is at it's best when you watch it with the right score (music).  Stay away from the ""MTV version"" that music is awful and doesn't do justice to the movie.  I recommend the newest version on DVD with an attempted recreation of the original score, though that would be next to impossilbe because in the days of silent films the score was provided in the theater live.  Anyways I think that many people have a hard time getting used to black and white films let alone silent ones (speaking of people in my generation), so this movie can't be judged harshly or unfairly on those 2 prerequisites.  If you watch Metropolis with an open mind you will be blown away.  It's a science fiction movie that effectively deals with themes of class, politics, and religion.  The sets and design are amazing to me, because the film was made in 1927 and in fact it's creation almost brankrupted the studio (UFA) which funded it.  The imagery is what Lang is a master at and even if you watch the crummy MTV version you have to appreciate the symbolism and at the very least the sets and imagery.  This movie has made a profound influence on Blade Runner, Star Wars, the Matrix, and many other sci-fi movies that are themselves highly influential. Without Metropolis I doubt any of those movies would have come out the way they did.  In fact I think it's highly suspect if they would have been made at all, especially Blade Runner or the Matrix.  NOTHING was like Metropolis before it's creation and even years after it's creation it stands as unique. I think for it's style and imagery alone it can be considered one of the most important movies ever.  It's story isn't the best, but this is a must see for any movie buff.  Once you watch it, you may be surprised at how many films actually ""borrow"" from it.Zoopansick"
Otoboke,"Jun 6, 2016",N/A,"Nearing 90 years since its initial release back in 1927, there probably isn't much left to say about Metropolis that hasn't already been repeated in countless other reviews and articles. Nevertheless, I am compelled to chip in with the roar and recommend the film to anyone who somehow hasn't gotten around to giving it a shot. Having recently viewed the latest Masters of Cinema BluRay, I cannot overstate the importance of watching the movie from a reputable source. My original viewing was somewhere close to a decade ago on a cheap public domain DVD that left me somewhat bewildered to the film's adornment. Ten years on however and I'm a convert thanks to the great efforts of those involved with restoring the film as close to its former glory as possible. Finally, I will conclude by echoing the praises of many others. Between the glorious photography, hugely elaborate sets, bombastic original score and epic storyline there lies a madman, Fritz Lang. Perfectionist to a fault, he somewhat unknowingly created one of the great silent epics of all time and the rest is history."
TheMovieDiorama,"Feb 25, 2019",9/10,"The grandfather of science-fiction. The film that single-handedly pioneered a genre. Just, impressive. I've been waiting a good few years to watch this German expressionistic silent film, and the time has finally come. With 150 minutes being recovered and mostly restored from the 153 minute original runtime, this was the closest to the full cut I was ever going to get. Fritz Lang not only implanted his views on authoritarianism and capitalism, but he crafted and adapted a film revolving around the idea of social justice. Revolutionary back in 1927, and yet still thematically important today.The son of the ""head"" of Metropolis decides to switch his lifestyle and work as a ""hand"" in the underground working city, to which he quickly falls in love with an innocent woman who gives insight into faithful readings. During this time, an inventor builds a man-machine and chooses to lead the workers into revolution by destroying the very city they have been working on.Much like the film itself, the city is bustling with themes and social injustice. A class system where workers must work every day underground whilst the wealthy enjoy the endless possibilities of knowledge, entertainment and everything else the gargantuan city has to offer. Fritz Lang takes a traditional romance and develops it during a period of economic struggle and freedom deprivation. His technical prowess and inventiveness when directing all these characters is what makes Metropolis timeless (and one heck of an experience).For a silent film, there was a considerable amount of personality being shown through exaggerated arm-flailing performances. Fröhlich, with his questionable attire, commands the film through his naivety. Abel on the other hand acts as the manifestation of autocratic authority, with a frown that will haunt your dreams. But it's Helm, presenting us with a dual performance, who goes full arm-flailing. Encapsulating the fragility of Christianity when she's Maria, but quickly shifting to psychotic revolutionist when transformed to the ""Man-Machine"". What intrigued me the most was the neutral state these characters resided within. The Man-Machine, whilst attempting to create social justice through worker's revolt, did so in a method that would become a detriment to everyone. Through authoritative order, it created uncontrollable chaos. Conversely, Fredersen overlooks a futuristic cityscape deprived of a democratic system, but does so for what he believed was the best for his people.The ""head"" and ""hands"" of society must come together through a mediator that understands both parties, the ""heart"". This thematic message comes full circle during its concluding minutes, which unfortunately was my main criticism for the film. Lang conveyed this heavy-handedly, as if the audience were unable to depict this metaphor for themselves. Considering the expertise and masterclass in production design that preceded this, it was somewhat a slap in the face. Speaking of production design, this sci-fi flick features some of the best stage sets available at the time. From layered cut outs illustrating the complexity of the city's infrastructure to beastly machines that act as the heart of civilisation. Lang naturally gives grandeur to his production. He also includes gothic structures, in particular a stoic cathedral, to represent the need for history and its importance in a world advancing with technology. This goes without saying the connotations of Christianity, especially a dream-like scene involving the seven deadly sins.The restoration of the film itself was stunning, and holds up well to this day. I believe one scene involving an inventor being overthrown by Fredersen is still missing, and so consequently the film felt jarring for one moment. However I am unable to criticise this. A few plot conveniences here and there and an overall lacking of title cards, but small nitpicks.Metropolis has attained a rare achievement. It has stood the test of time, not just with its technological ingenuity, but with its coherent themes of society. This may just be Fritz Lang's masterpiece, and deservedly so."
ctowyi,"Jan 14, 2016",10/10,"36000 extras, 200000 costumes, over 500 70-storey miniature skyscrapers - Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Filming took place in 1925 at a cost of approximately 5 million Reichsmarks, making it the most expensive film ever made up to that point. However it opened in 1927 to mixed reactions and barely made 75000 Reichsmarks. Because of its long running-time of over 150 minutes and the inclusion of footage which censors found questionable, Metropolis was butchered substantially after its German premiere, and large portions of the film went missing over the subsequent decades. In 2008 a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in Argentina. After a long restoration process, the film was 95% restored.Even though I considered myself a modest cinephile, I seldom venture out of my comfort zone of contemporary films. I blame this on one night at the uni when I was ""treated"" to a silent film - Sergei Eisenstein's Strike (1925). The movie was fine but there was no soundtrack to speak of and it was a torture to watch without even music. Since then I stayed away from films of the Silent Era; that is until Metropolis. Without even watching the film, some of the images have become iconic and have seared into my consciousness.So feeling adventurous I put in the blu-ray and OMG time came to a standstill. This is most definitely a sci-fi masterpiece on so many levels, misunderstood in its time, but revered in modern times. You can immediately see how Metropolis' dystopian cityscape as curtains has influenced countless films like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) and Luc Besson's The Fifth Element (1997). I can even see MTV videos belonging to Madonna and Lady Gaga borrowing cinematic elements from Metropolis unabashedly. Even ""carved in stone"" looks and mannerisms of mad scientist-villain complete with crazy laboratory has its birthplace here. The magnificent set-designs are unheard of in its time. Each miniature vehicle is moved a millimeter at a time and a single shot taken. Purportedly, 8 days of work for 10 seconds of film! I love ogling at the Avantgarde architecture. Each building structure tells a different story. Tell me you don't see Blade Runner in this.I will dispense with a detailed synopsis which you can easily glean from elsewhere. The story in a nutshell is set in a futuristic dystopian city where there exist two classes of people - the pampered citizens who live on the surface in luxury and the worker slaves of the underground who live to work and work to live. Along will come a lady named Maria and a love-smitten young man named Freder who will be the eventual bridge of reconciliation between these two disparate races.There are some weird and absurd transitions between scenes and by today's standards one would cry mawkish and maudlin in an instance. But I couldn't be bothered because the visuals are breathtakingly amazing. I could easily harken back to 1927 and I knew I was seeing all these stupendous visual effects and cinematic flair for the first time. It's kind of like sitting in the cinema in 1977 watching Star Wars: A New Hope. One can hardly get to feel that awe-inspiring feeling nowadays when the super-computers are capable of doing anything on the big screen. With Metropolis I was seeing the birthplace of the visionary future city, the humongous crowd pandemonium scenes, the robot (which inspired the look of C3-PO), the destruction of cities, the magnificent flooding, the visual telephonic machines (now you know where they came from), and so on. Several times I had to stop and ponder how the heck did Fritz Lang shoot the scenes (the only time I did that in the whole of 2015 was Mad Max: Fury Road) of puny human beings encompassed within gigantic monolithic structures, like did Lang actually build high walls just to create that running scene. Later I discovered that this unique visual effect was the work of Eugene Schufftan. He created what is known as the Schufftan process whereby human actors can be in the same frame with a miniature, a technique that was most recently used by Peter Jackson in his Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. These days most filmmakers use green screen composite shots for that, but what Schufftan has achieved is nothing short of stunning. There are also a few noteworthy cinematographic sequences that caught me in a state of jaw-dropping wow. For example, the chase scene involving the mad scientist chasing Maria through the catacombs, and shafts of light worked like knives stabbing at the poor damsel.I love Metropolis's huge ambition. Lang wasn't content with just a Good versus Evil story, he was creating a visual world so striking that you will be lost in the themes of love, Messianic revelation, dubious democracy and the corruption of Science and industry if one is not careful. The strong religious overtones and political allegory pulsate with authority as actors go through Kabuki theatrical poses. This is a masterpiece that has been so influential for generations of film narratives and in creating a bleak futuristic city. I highly recommend the blu-ray (the 50-minute documentary within it is also a must-watch). Be awashed by the original 1927 score by Gottfried Huppertz, performed by the Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra, Berlin and presented in DTS-HD MA 5.1. Simply ravishing and marvelous. Watching Metropolis feels like a time-bending experience in which Lang's 1927 and my 2016 became one time and one place."
trashgang,"Sep 28, 2015",10/10,"A masterpiece that's all I can say. Go figure out how they did all the effects back then. Editing wasn't what we see nowadays and CGI wasn't done of course so it had to be done all in-camera or layer on layer for special effects.German expressionism on it's best. Finally since a few years full uncut after finding the reel in Buenos Aires in really bad conditions. It shows in the full uncut but it doesn't bother. just seen it finally on Blu Ray it's worth picking up. Not only for the restoration but for the flick itself of course. Just see the settings how wonderful they were. What even surprised me was that in the beginning one dancer is showing her breasts and that for 1927! Even the main lead Brigitte Helm transformed into the robot goes dirty dancing. One of the last silent movies made, it was in the same year that The Jazz Singer came out with sound.Even clocking in way over 2 hours not one minute did it bore me. Cult classic that did stand the time and is still actual.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 5/5 Comedy 0/5"
Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Dec 16, 2016",10/10,"Metropolis is almost 90 years old to this day. Fritz Lang gave what is arguably the most important film of the silent era with Metropolis. It was the first ever science-fiction feature film when it was made in 1927, and what's also notable is that the film remained partially lost for many years. Thanks to Kino International and film-archivists who discovered a 16mm print in Argentina, combining it with Australian and New Zealand prints of the movie (among other pre-existing positives from Germany, etc.), Metropolis was 95% restored to its original state.Now, Metropolis: The Restored Cut is a masterpiece of classic cinema that is bold, gorgeous, and very to-the-point with its man-in-the-machine subtext and premise. Its story of classicism is timeless and the set pieces, ranging from the city itself to the reveal of the maschinenmensch (machine-human) this film has many memorable moments. Its stylized landscape shows off the many beauties of German Expressionism in its purest form, and it complements the story being told.Without this film, there would be no Blade Runner, no 2001: A Space Odyssey, no Star Wars, and definitely no Terminator films. Metropolis is the genesis of modern science fiction cinema, plain and simple. It has been miraculously preserved through the ages since its release and will continue to influence future generations decades from now.Metropolis is a rich, memorable and honest science fiction film that expresses ideas of one's place in modern society perfectly; and that a little perspective is all it takes to make great changes happen.Please watch this film when you can. The science fiction genre's inheritance of this film's influence should be reason enough to give it a go."
carljessieson,"Mar 30, 2015",9/10,"First of all, I just love this movie. It blows me away every time I watch it. Filled with awesome shots and angles, and the special effects are just outstanding. So many facets of this film shocked me just because I did not expect them to be in a film from this time. The techniques and styles that I thought were more modern, results of decades of filmmaking, are actually born from this time. The models of the city, the machines, everything, was spectacular. The sets were so grand and stylized, absolutely stunning. The style of this film is breathtaking. This is my favorite film of the Expressionist era. Characteristics of other Expressionist films that I felt were too dramatic were just right in Metropolis. The acting was just right, not too over-dramatic. There were still moments of arms flailing, eyes bulging, and random, intimate, somewhat forceful embraces, but generally the performances were perfect. I love the way the underground workers performed so uniformly in their exhaustion, despair, and hope, waning hope. Maria's performance was particularly stellar to me. The make-up, the hair, use of lights and shadows, and the set design indicative of Expressionism were all excellent.A stellar story! Noticed a couple impossibly fast jumps in plot but that's something I'm seeing in every film I watch from this era. Definitely a movie with a message. Don't 100% agree with the overall moral of the film, but I was pleased by a lot of the films bits of wisdom and poetry. I think this is an incredibly important film on class differences and separation, and the exploitation of the lower class by CEOs with fat wallets and cold hearts- still applicable and hugely important in 2015. The conclusion was more tame and dreamy than it should have been, in my opinion. Nonetheless, it was an incredibly innovative and creative way to show a cultural issue. The first true science fiction epic, made in a medium that was relatively new- wow, this was an enormous endeavor and it was handled like a real visionary. Imagine taking a relatively new art form and doing things so innovative that they're still used and still impressive one hundred years later! The imagination of this filmmaker is absolutely astonishing. I am so impressed with the artistry of this film. The metaphorical sequences were a huge treat, oh man, I love that stuff. The scene with the statue of the seven sins is definitely going on my list of favorite film scenes ever. No doubt. The score is so exciting and ominous, powerful and epic, very good at conveying at setting the mood and conveying the feelings of the characters/moment.Such an important story, told in such an amazing way- allegorical, but universally applicable, a voice for the people against injustice, a portrait of greed and corruption, the seemingly subjective value of human life, and the price some must pay, sacrificing their lives and dissolving into sweat and dirt for the benefit of the undeserving, unappreciative upper class. Truly an amazing cinematic feat.9/10 Bye love you"
Philipp_Flersheim,"Mar 4, 2022",6/10,"I struggled for a a long while and reconsidered several times but eventually decided to rate 'Metropolis' 6 stars rather than 7 or more. The film is far from perfect and has at least three aspects I disliked quite intensely. First, the acting. I am no longer a novice where silent films are concerned and I realise of course that actors on silent film had to make a stronger effort to make emotions visible than when sound became available. But what the ensemble (mainly Brigitte Helm, Alfred Abel, Gustav Fröhlich and Rudolf Klein-Rogge) give us here is too much of a good thing. Every facial expression and every gesture is exaggerated to an extent that is really disturbing. The exception is Helm, whose attempts to look mean and nasty in her role as mechanical Maria (watch her face!) come across as unintentionally funny. You may argue that overacting is part of the much-admired expressionist style of the film. Perhaps. But that does not make it good. Other silent films, earlier and later ones, achieved great effects without such exaggerations. They are far more palatable.The second thing I disliked is the metaphoric message: 'The heart has to be mediator between the hand and the brain' (my translation; I watched the film with German title cards). If you think this through it is nonsense. It claims that workers and capitalists just need to connect at an emotional level (the heart!); then everything is fine. That's hogwash; things don't work like that and never did. What 'Metropolis' gives us is social kitsch of the worst kind - something contemporary reviewers noted and rightly ridiculed. H. G. Wells (no stranger to science fiction) commented, 'I have recently seen the silliest film. I do not believe it would be possible to make one sillier'. He had a point.The last thing I disliked is that 'Metropolis' takes a long long time to hit its stride. It is only when the inventor reveals his machine woman and gives her the appearance of Maria that things get interesting. That is 1 hour and 15 minutes into the film. Until then what is on offer is boredom. Cultured boredom, but still. I had really expected a bit more suspense from a film by Fritz Lang.Now that I have got the irritating stuff out of the way, there was a lot about 'Metropolis' I found admirable. The photography is stunning. The buildings, the sets and camera angles. The way the machine woman comes alive would have looked good in a much younger film. There are many things the picture did and showed for the first time ever - things that have by now become staple features of science fiction. The upshot is: Lang's film owes its importance and reputation to its influence on later, better movies rather than to its own quality. In itself, it is deeply flawed - and generally overrated."
Nothinggrandproductions,"Sep 10, 2013",4/10,"I really hate it when I don't enjoy a classic film. I really want to enjoy it but I just can't. I want to understand some people's love for it, but I just can't. Metropolis falls under this category. An unbearably slow film, (I watched the restoration which is over 2 hours longthat may have been a bad idea) that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them. It is the year 2026, the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis, while the lower-class work for hours on end underground in awful conditions. The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel) and his son is Freder (Gustav Frohlich), who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all. A woman named Maria (Brigitte Helm) brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria. Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers.He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant, Josepha (Theodor Loos), and his assistant is quickly fired. This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character. In fact, very little of the characters are developed in anyway. Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace. Anyways, the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen.My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like 1984 (I'm aware it came out afterwords (and that it's a novel), but still, just an example) but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end. They never really do any decent social commentary at all. If any at all. This wouldn't matter if the film was actually entertaining, but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore.I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell, ever. That doesn't mean it holds up because it doesn't. In fact, it'd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in 1927. I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I would've enjoyed the film. It certainly would've have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting. But, I don't think that changes the fact that this movie doesn't really do anything. It isn't entertaining. It doesn't really have a message. What is this movie? I guess, good special effects for 1927? Whatever. I'm glad I gave this classic a chance, but I highly doubt I'll revisit it anytime soon."
filipemanuelneto,"Jan 23, 2020",10/10,"This is probably one of the greatest silent films ever made and one of the great classics of cinema before the Second World War. It is amazing how, in a sense, it is still up to date and influencing more recent films (""Elysium"" is the name that occurs to me more quickly now because I saw it recently, but there are more). Its futuristic look has influenced most of the sci-fi films, such as ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"", the animated series ""Futurama"" and even the cartoon ""The Jetsons"".Made with great quality, it is a film whose elegant cinematography already reminds us of the look of the first spoken films, in the thirties. There is some academic debate about whether this film belongs to the expressionist movement or not. Personally, I think there are clear expressionist influences on the story told, where paranoia and mistrust towards authority are constant, but visually, they are no longer expressionist.The story told is deeply dystopian and mixes futuristic elements with biblical allusions: Metropolis is a huge futuristic city run by one man: Johann Fredersen, who lives in the New Tower of Babel. However, it is supported by an immense number of workers who, in the depths, operate a series of machines for hours on end, in inhuman conditions. Freder, the son of Johann Fredersen, decides to try to put an end to this injustice.In the film, in addition to the good performances of actors such as Gustav Fröhlich, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge and Brigitte Helm, production values stand out. The music is excellent and matches the film perfectly; the costumes are good and the sets, especially, are great. The special and visual effects are good and work very well. The scene of the creation of the Woman Machine is particularly stunning. Cinematography uses a lot of light and shadow and the film is very visually pleasing, one of the most pleasant in silent cinema, in my opinion."
Hitchcoc,"May 4, 2006",10/10,"I first saw this in a science fiction class in college. It was an actual movie in class. Wow! I had read about Fritz Lange and his contributions to the cinema and I had seen still pictures from this film. I was astonished that it had been made in 1927. The special effects, particularly those within the city, are amazing. The basic premise, the haves and the have nots works very well. Lange turned his people into machines and had them toil darkly for little, reducing them to automatons. This is remindful of ""The City in the Clouds,"" a Star Trek episode where those in power can't fathom what the enslaved miners must do every day. Of course it's about collectivism and socialism and all those other -isms. It's also about people and how they come to see themselves as oppressors. The fun-loving lifestyle is set in the middle of the poverty and pain of those who have nothing. There are wonderful expressions in close ups of faces, both expressing their misery and being empathetic toward it. The film gathers momentum toward revolution. It's the age old story. It's presented in a masterful way. Perhaps this is the best of all the silent films because of its content and its political implications. I wonder what the capitalists of the early 20th century thought of the movie."
SanTropez_Couch,"Apr 11, 2003",10/10,"""Metropolis"" is, if nothing else, one of the most spectacular visual movies I've ever seen. Reportedly the most expensive German movie up to that time, Fritz Lang created an awesome city, totally memorable. I was lucky enough to see the restored version of the film -- listed as being 124 minutes, seeming like less -- in the theater with a group of about 70 people. Everyone seemed to enjoy the 75 year-old beast. (There was some clapping at the end -- a tradition that has always perplexed me. I mean, it's not like Fritz and his crew, or even those responsible for the wonderful restoration, are around to bask in the applause. Although, I guess, the applause was meant more for the theater that opted to bring the film here.)This is definitely one for the big screen.The story is heavy-handed by today's standards, but putting myself in the shoes of what I imagine the average audience of the time would have been like made me appreciate the ideas of the film more. (By no means, however, am I suggesting that a 1927 audience was less educated than we. They just didn't have the extra 75 years of movies we do.)The subterranean workers of the great city threaten to overthrow its rulers, led by Joh Fredersen. Now, Joh's son, Freder, sees an angel of a girl, Maria, who shows him his ""brothers"" and the terrible conditions of his father's workers. Maria captivates Freder, and she preaches the message of love and peace. The film's message, stated through her, is that the mediator of the hand (workers) and the mind (leader) is the heart (Maria and Freder).Freder goes below, to the ""depths,"" where he poses as a worker. He discovers plans for a revolt (more like a strike) where the workers will leave their machines in the hopes of being granted better conditions.But things get more complicated when Joh Fredersen has his scientist, Rotwang, who lives in an old barn-like house that the technical revolutions of the future have forgotten, design something for him. Rotwang has already created a machine man, modeled after Joh Fredersen's dead wife Hel (a sort of ""replacement""), but Joh Fredersen has him affix Maria's face to the machine. Joh plans to use this machine to incite the workers to violence, by having her first get the workers' attention by doing a (not so) sexy gyspy dance. Of course they do, and the city is flooded. The moral at the end of the film is silly, but because the whole film is so unrealistic, so much like a fable, it didn't bother me. (I did, however, lean over to my friend and say in a Fred Rogers voice, ""Won't you be my mediator?"")There really isn't much else you can say about ""Metropolis."" Those images are why you'd see this movie. The way it reflects (or maybe warns against) Nazi totalitarianism is interesting. (One image, in particular, where a machine explodes and turns into a giant devourer, has an unsettling similarity to gas chamber.) I like that Lang was interested both in the ideals of Freder and Maria, but also in a sense of order. With the uprising that does occur, of course, there are repercussions. The dialogues (or title cards) in the film express a protest of the sort of dictating aristocracy of Metropolis, but Lang's own spectacular sets and monumental vision seem to argue with that.The sets and the images (including two memorable camera moves) just can't be overemphasized. Sometimes they look like models or Styrofoam or just plain goofy, but they're incredible and original and influential. Many a homage has been paid to this film, from ""Dr. Strangelove"" to more of a blatant rip-off in ""The Fifth Element.""This is a vastly entertaining movie, made no less enjoyable by its sometimes silly premise. (It's not as if the acting in silent movies isn't wildly exaggerated -- and isn't that the appeal in the first place?) I'm completely ignorant when it comes to Lang -- this is the first movie of his I've seen. Nevertheless, this is a masterwork.****"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Oct 9, 2023",10/10,"This is a film I haven't seen since my media studies days, as a student I always remember being challenged at my opinion that Star Wars was the sci fi movie that defined and changed the genre (an opinion I still have,) but I was presented with Metropolis, it blew me away.How on Earth can a silent movie from the 1920's look so futuristic, and offer something so incredibly unique. My limited exposure to 1920's cinema is pretty much limited to Chaplin, Buster Keaton and host of murder mysteries, this is altogether different.The visuals at the time must have been jaw dropping for viewers, credit to the production team for using whatever resources they had to deliver the various special effects.The underground scenes look remarkable, I just love the uniformity of the way that the workers move, they are dehumanised, merely cogs in the grand machinery of Metropolis.There is a good reason why this film has such a high rating, in spite of being nearly a century old, it's still brilliant, do not miss this film.10/10."
tamenishdragon,"Jul 17, 2014",10/10,"Title: Metropolis Year: 1927Plot: Excellent - makes you want to keep watchingCharacters: Amazing for silent characters with deep emotions and quirks that make you like them. Bonus points for Rotwang and his epic hair.Acting: Appropriate for a silent film and rather enjoyable to watch. Again, Rotwang adds bonus points because the actor playing him, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, had amazing facial expressions.Set/special effects: Mind blowing for 1927 - Metropolis didn't use any computers, just smoke, mirrors and miniatures!Verdict: Watch this movie if you are a bit of a Nerd, like classic sci-fi or just appreciate good acting and excellent films."
austex23,"Feb 4, 2001",6/10,"Metropolis is a troublesome film for me.  I appreciate its vision, the intricacies and prescience of its social commentary, and the sheer beauty of some of its scenes.  The robot is an icon for retro-futurist design.  A film impossible not to admire.  Yet each time I have seen it -- four now I think -- I always find myself bored.   The visionary sequences are too few and the melodrama grows too heavy far too often.  Scenes like Maria's flight from Rotwang become overwrought at once and then drag on long enough to be comical.  My most recent viewing was the Hollywood Classics DvD.  With so many restored versions of Metropolis around, the quality of this release was terribly disappointing.  I love silent German film, but each time I have seen Metropolis, I come away feeling it is an over-rated film."
MovieKen,"Jun 19, 2003",4/10,"I typically don't like silent films, but I decided to watch this one for two reasons.  First, I usually like sci-fi movies, and second, Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldn't pass it up.  However, my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been saying.Kino's digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive.  The sound and picture quality are both excellent.  However, I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia, on the film's influence on future films, and on the incredible visual effects, given its year of release.  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie.  I thought this was a good film, but not a great one.  A rating of 8.3 is much too high, and at #93, there are plenty of better films ranked below it.First, the good parts of the film: 1) The special effects are excellent for a pre-1930s film. 2) The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work, the decisions they make, and in how easily they are led/misled. 3) The main character is well developed throughout the film, and the audience can relate to him well. 4) The film is visually stunning and impressive. 5) The story of the working class, vision of the future, ""machine-men,"" etc. have had a very strong influence on many films which came later.On the other hand, here is a list of what could have been done better: 1) Many scenes dragged on too long and were tedious.  I can't imagine it being any longer than it already was. 2) The differences between the thinking class and the working class were not clear; both seemed to be pretty mindless. 3) The themes and ideas in the film have been explored better in other productions. 4) The set design and special effects are not as good as they are in the 1936 film, Things to Come. 5) Things to Come also has a far more interesting and creative vision of the future. 6) Joh Fredersen is not well developed, and his motives and decisions seem illogical for the leader of the ""thinking"" class. 7) There is no explanation for how the spiritual and motivational leader of the working class became so intelligent, capable, and/or competent.  More background on Maria would have helped develop her character, and improved the film.In its defense, it could be that I was not as impressed by this film simply because so many films which came after it have copied, borrowed, stolen, or re-worked ideas that appeared here first.  Metropolis certainly was a trend-setter.  Like I said before, I don't think this is a bad film.  It's simply overrated, and I've seen plenty of films that are better but are rated lower."
pitatron,"Oct 28, 2014",8/10,"Might I say that I do not watch many classic films, let alone ones from the 1920s. Honestly my expectations were not very high. Although who knew I would find a masterpiece of a movie. This movie is very ambitious, especially considering the time. The sets were brilliantly designed and the miniatures were convincing. Since it is a silent film the facial expressions and gestures added lots to their acting. The story was well written and very interesting. The uses of audio suited the movie extremely well for the specific scenes. My only small gripe with the movie is its length. Sure the movie is an epic and powerful movie, but I overall felt it was a bit too long, and this isn't even technically the full movie since some of it has been lost. Still length is a small issue because of the scale and build up the movie had. Honestly everyone should see this movie if they have not already and this has gone down as one of my favourite movies."
Lumir,"May 7, 1999",10/10,"Alright, the acting is not all that great, but you kinda expect that from a silent movie. The visual effects, however are stunning, not only if you take the year of production into account. The story is good, and most of it I took as an attack on Taylorism. (Which is good, because Taylorism needs attacking) And the visuals from the Metropolis itself is copied, to greater or lesser degree, by Blade Runner, Judge Dread (can't believe I mentioned those in one breath), Star Wars (R2-D2's first performance was in Metropolis, it turns out!) Fifth Element...Those are all I can think of for the moment.If you're a sci-fi fan, or like visual beauty in movies, Metropolis is well worth a peek. Don't know if the coloured versions are good though."
framptonhollis,"Sep 27, 2017",8/10,"Mechanical movements and heavy over exaggerations jump from each and every corner of the constantly moving screen as Lang shows off his revolutionary talents as a filmmaker. Envisioning an over the top and consistently horrifying dystopia, ""Metropolis"" is one of the very greatest science fiction films ever made, but the viewer must keep in mind that it is heavily flawed. Some moments and performances are melodramatic to the point of heavy laughter, it's way overlong, and the story is no where near as compelling as its visuals. That being said, this is still the ultimate German Expressionist classic. Crooked windows, creepy shadows, unforgettable imagery in nearly every frame. This mixture of futurism and Expressionism is what keeps ""Metropolis"" moving along at a perfect pace. There is tons of thrilling action, mind boggling surrealism, and wild editing; enough to keep even the average moviegoer at least mildly entertained. It is likely to inspire headaches or confusion, laughter and tears and shouts and so on.There are constant references to religion and some highly intelligent commentary on both the pros and cons of Marxist theory to allow one's intellect to be entertained (although the religious references are so obvious it gets a little annoying at times). And the visuals...I'm not even sure if I can muster up the energy to comment on them. Even today they're aw inspiring and fantastical, adding to the film's ""fairy tale set in the faraway future"" feel with exuberance and occasional, explosive violence."
Boba_Fett1138,"May 2, 2005",10/10,"This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made. The story is brilliant and the visuals amazing.I have seen the German 147 minutes version of the movie, without subtitles. Yes it's a long watch but it's worth every second of it. Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence. It's kind of dreadful to look at first but once you're used to it, it shouldn't trouble you anymore.In many ways this movie can be regarded as the ""Blade Runner"" of the '20's. ""Metropolis"" is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in ""Blade Runner"". The mix of '20's cars and propeller-planes with futuristic machines, highways, buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at. The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also prophetic.The story is absolutely the best thing of the movie. Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit. The story is tense and has quite some symbolism, layers and storyline's but remains always easy to follow. The ending is truly spectacular and tense. The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was, really surprised me in a positive way.The sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress. Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effects.Man who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel. Wow, what a great actor he was in this movie.An absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
alex_valentina,"Oct 22, 2004",N/A,"MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced. This epic science fiction film is one of Germany's famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in 1927, the period between the two World Wars.This movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age. Lang's creation of a self-destructive society is a protest against the machine age. Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of 2026, is kept 'alive' by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people.The Austrian director of the movie, Fritz Lang, presents the story of a master, John Federsen, who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis. On the other side, his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves. The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution. The city gets flooded and Maria (Freder's love) regains the workers' trust after a robot had stolen her identity, she finds her loved one after saving the city's children, and the workers shake hands with the master.Expressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally, in a subjective way. It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic, violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions.The name 'metropolis' comes from the Greeks and means mother-city. It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city. Nevertheless, referring to the movie name, this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichés.In this story, there are two main characters, Maria and Freder. These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood. John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city, forgetting about the ones who work for him. All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him. This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it; he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creations.On the other hand, Maria is just a symbol of munificence, her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world. Maria convoys the people in a church settling area. She is shown as sanctity, a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles. She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace, unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come. Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene. In general, all she does is for the good of humanity. One thing that she repeats in the movie is 'Between the head and hands there must be a heart. ' This means that she realizes the bad things that the head (John Frederson) does and the good things that the hands (workers) do. But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that, she can be the heart, which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests. Maria, as her name suggests is also a biblical motif. She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel. The workers in the story destroy this tower, which parallels how the movie will end, with the destruction of the machines by the workforce. Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children. She would sacrifice herself and, alike Mother Mary, she has a strong faith in the creator of the world.All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action. However, there is also a bird's eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground. This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is. In addition, the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the right-angled buildings. There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the 'slaves' are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots. When more people are involved in a scene, like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell, the angles are vertical, triangular, but when only one person is focused, there is a close-up to allow us to read that character's expressions and feelings. A good example would be the close-ups on the master Fredersons' eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictator's meditation and frustration. Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria. He is walking up on the roof of a sharp-angled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen. The same scene was notable in Robert Wiene's film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fiancé and the city crowd follows him.Time also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes. Time is evident in Fredersons' office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary. Still only, a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take. On the other hand, a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wall-clock. Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him. There is where he finds out that at 2 pm Maria will have a meeting.But all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix , but for its great historical importance. Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one. After WWI, when Germany had lost a war, people's lives were a disaster. Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on, and maybe there were some influences of the great anti-Semitism that was supposed to follow. But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically. Even if Germany's wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersen's wish of a technological city, the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development."
Dockelektro,"Nov 21, 2000",6/10,"I liked this picture, it's a great example of a visionary mind, and the sets are astonishing. The only thing that keeps me from scoring this movie higher is its futurist message, much identified with fascist ideals of man beneath the machines and the subjugation of people under an automated system, with some elites ruling the world from above in an unfair hierarchy. but this is exciting to watch just for the rules it broke in the time it was made. Oh, for future viewers, please avoid at all costs the 80's version with a score by Giorgio Moroder, since it destroys all the suspense and atmosphere of the movie. I don't know who approved that work, and what took Moroder to do it, but the result is like playing a record of him for 2 hours, disconnecting all the climax from the movie which is to it attributed: for example, a horror scene has the same music as the scene where we see images of the city...horrible to say the least. Whatever problems I find in this picture, I have to take my hat to the way it influenced many pictures till this time, like ""The Fifth Element"", ""Blade Runner"" and even ""Batman"" (the final scene of the cathedral is a perfect pastiche of the one in here). It's a work of vision. Let's praise that!"
christian94,"Aug 30, 2001",8/10,"For years now, I was very excited to see this movie, but somehow never got around to it .  When I heard of the Munich museum of cinema restoration efforts of Enno Patalas and that the film was to play at the Montreal World Film Festival of 2001, I could not prolong anymore the viewing of this sci-fi classic.That night, there were technical problems and the projection was delayed past eleven o'clock.  Being very tired, and knowing that it was going to be an old, silent and slow-paced movie, I greatly feared that all my waiting would have been in vain.  I feared, that in the dark theater, I was going to sleep like a baby...Well, I didn't.Firstly, the music played live by three musicians that came especially from Germany was extraordinary.  It was fresh, captivating and entertaining.  It kept me riveted to the seat and fitted perfectly- no actually it enhanced greatly- the film.  The musicians received a standing ovation with cause.Secondly, the silent acting was necessarily over the top, but very powerful and engaging.  I never thought the wink of a robot could have that effect on me.Thirdly, the visual aspects of the movie were not only ahead of its time, it was in some instance better than what we see 74 years later.  Not because of the special effect, although they were very good, but because of the creative spark behind them.  Lang makes us see dreams like never before. The dance of the ""skeleton with a sickle"" (I will say no name)is a prime example. His visual collage of moving eyes and sexually tense robot dance are hypnotically riveting.  Hitchcock's later attempt at free visual expression (as in Vertigo) greatly lacked this ability to grasp the spectator and swirl him into the movie.  Even the remarkable breakthroughs of Stanley Kubric in `2001: a space odyssey ` are not up to part with Lang's visual wizardry.  As for current director's, they can also watch and learn. Lang's portrayal of crowds, either as ordinate drones or anarchist hoards is also singular in its mastery.  This is what impressed me the most with this spectacular work, straight out of the archives of history.The story, although containing some good scientific elements and trying to examine social and philosophical structures, is not as remarkable.  The pace is slow (which is not always bad, but which does not help much here) and the dramatization typical of older productions reminds us of why this type of languorous ""Greece tragedy"" scenes were replaced by the sharper, subtler, fined-tuned storytelling of today. Characters are a bit on the one to two-dimensional side.  Moral and religious implications are a bit heavy and unrevealing to my liking.All in all, this is an incredible film.  Pioneer, daring and exceptional for its period, it passed the test of time, to stand as a very very good production that lead the way for films to come.  Certain aspects became dated, but at the core, you can appreciate an artistic jewel of a rare kind.Although, apprehensive in the first 20 minutes, once I got accustomed to the silent acting/intertitle thing, I was in for a treat.  I didn't sleep and I didn't regret anything.Be open-minded and be ready to be thrown into this dark world of Metropolis. Enjoy."
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Nov 1, 2006",8/10,"I love silent films and remember seeing a clip of Metropolis in my film appreciation class, I was so excited to pick a five dollar copy of this film from Best Buy and I was just amazed at how disturbing this movie was for not only it's time, but today. Today, 2006, times are just like this movie's plot, everyone is getting so lazy due to technology's quick advancements, that they'll do anything just so they have to work less.This movie is about a boss who is upset with the way his workers are always tired and have to go home. When he brings up to another worker that he has created the perfect worker, a robot who will never get tired, hungry, or have to go home to a family. But soon the worker has a fantasy, or as I'd say a very horrific nightmare, that the robots will turn against these humans and take over the world!Yeah, silent films have always been overacted and very cheesy to look at, but it's amazing to me to see what the times were like and what the mood was. The reason why Metropolis is so well loved and respected is not only because of the mood it captured, but how amazingly psychic it was, I think since the time that electricity was discovered, we've all feared how far we could go with technology, and Metropolis is a haunting picture that captures it so well.8/10"
TheMovieCritic_83,"Jun 26, 2007",10/10,"'Metropolis' is absolutely one of the greatest films ever made. Fritz Lang's vision of an apocalyptic future, is one of the best examples of cinematic art in existence. Time has done nothing to reduce the film's impact. It is probably the most electrifying film to date.The story is set in 2026, in a time where society has split into two classes. The workers, who simply exist below ground level, keeping the city functioning, and the rulers of the city and the upper-class citizens who live in luxury above. The ruler's son, Freder, while indulging at the 'Club of the Sons', is curious when a woman from down below visits, surrounded by a group of young boys. It is at this moment that Freder is moved to visit the worker's environment. He tells his father of the distress that he finds and eventually becomes part of a rebellion that will finally unite both classes.What Fritz Lang created in 1926 is truly incredible. It is mind-boggling at how modern it still is. And as far as art is concerned, this is a film that is bursting at the seams. It is however, ridiculous that the film was labelled as a flop on its release. It is even more outrageous that a good chunk of footage from the original print of the film is now irretrievably lost because the film was re-edited. Although it has been restored as much as possible, it is such a shame that it is incomplete.'Metropolis' is a film that has made more sense and has become more understood as time has passed. It is now greatly praised and has rightly been given the honour as the greatest German film from the silent era."
jeffro517-783-121956,"Sep 14, 2013",10/10,"In 2026 Metropolis is run by the wealthy industrialists who have enslaved the working class in an underground world. When Joh Frederson's (Abel) son Freder (Fröhlich) is lured into the worker's world, he witnesses a horrible accident and begins to have a crisis of conscience. Now he's decided to trade places with one of the workers to better understand their plight. This decision leads to a bigger crisis when he falls in love with a prophetess (Helm) who threatens everything his father has worked for. As his father seeks to destroy the young woman and the people who have followed her, he also threatens the existence of all the working people in Metropolis.Metropolis is a visually stunning film. Fritz Lang (M) essentially created the science-fiction film genre when he co-wrote and directed this epic film. The movie was produced in Germany at cost of five million Reichsmarks, making it the most expensive movie produced up to that point. The result is a large-scale epic that tells a tale of a futuristic world ruined by industry. This would also be a major building block for Lang, a director who made the transition to American films under his contract with MGM.The acting in a silent film is all about body language and facial expressions. This movie displays great acting by all of the people involved. It definitely has a melodramatic feel, but that's something common to most silent films. Brigitte Helm (L'argent), Alfred Abel (Phantom), and Gustav Fröhlich (Asphalt) do a great job as the three main characters. Lang also worked well with the massive number of extras that included over five hundred children.Classic movies are often lost due to age and damage. The film wasn't made to last for 100 years, and unfortunately this has cost us many of the classic films of the early years of movie making. Thankfully, this movie was saved through hard work and a lot of luck. Most recently a copy of this film was located in Argentina and allowed restoration work to be done that brought back a lot of missing footage.If you're a fan of classic movies and you haven't seen this one, I think it's a must-see movie. This puts early innovation on display as Lang stretched the technology and the art of cinema to the breaking point. This isn't a short movie or an easy one to watch. I would recommend this for people who want to see some of the best early feature film-making. I give this one 5 out of 5 stars."
DKosty123,"Feb 14, 2008",10/10,"This is Fritz Lang's silent masterpiece & still worth viewing today. It is really an amazing silent film & a true Science Fiction masterpiece that has influenced many modern filmmakers and not just the Science Fiction ones.It has become somewhat known that while Lang worked on producing this miracle, one of his students was Alfred Hitchcock. Hitch learned well from his teacher because you see Lang's silent influence in a majority of his films. The technique of telling a story with pictures was never done better than this film. Hitchcock at his most brilliant would later do the same thing in his action-suspense films. When you understand this & watch Hitchcocks films again, you realize just what I mean.An amazing testament to Lang's talent is the fact that the rest of the cast in this movie could have been anyone and it didn't really matter. The ultimate film maker made this film, and influenced the rest of film history through the rest of the 20th century & even now some into the 21st."
Vitalijs_Osipenko,"Apr 16, 2019",7/10,"Even though I enjoyed the film and its old-fashion perspective on futurism I am not sure I enjoyed some aspects of the movie. Soundtrack was one of my main points of frustration for me. It is too ""metallic"" (which was the point) and agressive and added very little to story. I enjoyed the unique story though as well as some amazing acting! I give it a 7 purely because of the film's soundtrack."
didi-5,"Nov 28, 2003",6/10,"'Metropolis' was far better than anything Fritz Lang did outside of Germany, although it wasn't quite as powerful as a whole as I thought from previous viewings.The performances in the main can't be faulted, especially Gustav Fröhlich as Freder, Rudolf Klein-Rogge as the crazed inventor Rotwang, Heinrich George as the foreman Grot, and of course the young Brigitte Helm as the two Marias (although I find her bad Maria slightly cringeworthy in places). Teetering on the side of caricature are Alfred Abel as Joh Fredersen and Theodor Loos as Josaphat.The scenes that stay with me are the ones I remembered for years - the transformation of the Machine Man to the false Maria, the Tower of Babel creation and fall, the death of the worker who Freder replaced as he is trying to save him from the mob, the slow moving lines of workers as they change shifts, the large clock, and the children clinging to the monument as their city is flooded.It is a complex film which could be read as a defence of organised thought and mediation, but I think it is so much more.  Some of the shots, of the upper city for example, and of Maria bathed in light as she is pursued by Rotwang, are superb."
Koceny,"Apr 30, 2021",10/10,The title saya it all.Almost 100 years have past since this movie and somehow it feels so modern.
Cloud20,"May 23, 2005",10/10,"Metropolis (1927)Directed by Fritz Lang.One could say that Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" has been cut up and re-edited so many times that the whole point of the original view would be ruined. I have seen three versions of the film: The Kino DVD version, the Hollywood Classics version, and the horribly butchered Giorgio Moroder and 80's rock soundtrack version. While watching the Hollywood Classics version (my first viewing), I was still affected in the end. After seeing the Kino version, I loved it even more. But after making an awful decision by buying the Moroder version for a cheap price, I wonder, why? The color version, re-editing, cutting scenes, and 80's rock soundtrack COMPLETELY kills the vision of Fritz Lang's original classic. It is silly, confusing and nearly unwatchable.The story of ""Metropolis"" is legendary. Metropolis is a dark city in which the population is divided into two. The thinkers, the rulers and the rich of the city, who live in the buildings above. And the workers, the poor and the slaves, who work their whole life underground for the city. When one of the ""thinkers"" witnesses a fatal accident underground, he is horrified by the situation. In seeing this, he joins the beautiful Maria, leader of the workers, in an apocalyptic revolt against the thinkers.What makes ""Metropolis"" such a classic is because of it's influence on other films, such as ""Dark City"", ""Blade Runner"", ""The Matrix"", and even the background story of ""The Terminator"". It was also the first film to show a truly nightmarish look at a futuristic society. With the terms of originality, films usually don't get much better than this. In the end, I do believe that ""Metropolis"" is not only the greatest film from the 20's decade, but also my the greatest Science Fiction film in my opinion. 5 stars out of 5."
SnoopyStyle,"Jul 26, 2014",10/10,"In the futuristic city of Metropolis, wealthy residents live a bright easy life up in the sunshine while the poor suffer down below maintaining the machinery. The workers live in a deep underground city. Freder Fredersen is one of the privileged who live in luxury above. His father Joh Fredersen is the founder of Metropolis. Beautiful Maria leads a group of children up to the surface and is quickly sent back. Freder tries to follow but discovers the horrific working conditions. He goes to the Tower of Babel to speak to his father but he is unmoved. Freder switches place with one of the workers. Joh comes to see old fellow inventor Rotwang to find him still obsessing about their mutual love of Hel, Freder's dead mother. Rotwang has created a robot with a devious plan. There are mysterious maps that have been discovered among the workers. Freder is invited to listen to Maria as she retells the story of Babel and the need for a heart to mediate between the hands and the head. The crowd is restless for change. Freder wants to be the mediator. Joh and Rotwang followed the maps to the meeting. Joh tells Rotwang to make the robot into Maria to sow discontent with her followers. Rotwang has a different idea to destroy the city.This is the height of silent era movie-making. The story is fairly simple. The characters are clear cut icons of good and evil. The acting is definitely silent era. The images are ahead of its time. The fact that they are still influencing films of today says it all. This film will always be one of the cornerstones of silent movie-making."
planktonrules,"Jul 23, 2006",10/10,"I am so happy that I saw this film again recently on Turner Classic Movies. I first saw it many years ago on a cheap public domain videotape and I was not that impressed by the film. The print was of dubious quality and the story itself not overly impressive. BUT, when TCM released a newly restored version, the print was nearly pristine, the new orchestra music was fantastic and actually fit the film and, more importantly, the film was significantly longer--by about 20 minutes! It seems that over the years, so much of this film was cut here and there and the film degraded so much, that anyone watching these inferior versions is strongly recommended to see it again in its better form. Now this better form isn't 100% perfect, as there were a few tiny places where they had to insert stills to complete the scenes (a practice becoming more and more common with restored silent films and even some sound ones like LOST HORIZON).The story, now that I see it in its original form, isn't really just a sci-fi movie per se--and that is what elevates it to greatness. Instead, it's a wonderful allegory about alienation and modern society. It's talk of unions and revolution was very potent stuff in its day and considering what was going on in Germany at the time, the over-blown sci-fi aspect of the film ignores the struggle between Communism and a Fascism. Superb direction, sets and a grandeur few films of the day can come close to equaling. An absolute must-see."
BiologicShow,"Aug 27, 2002",N/A,"I hadn't realized Metropolis wwas a silent film when I went to see it recently at the Castro Theater. I have never seen a silent film before; surprisingly, the lack of dialogue doesn't make a whole lot of difference. There is actually an intensity that a silent film has, a theatricality, due to the large movements and thespian mugging, which gives the movie a different quality than a non-silent film. Silent film was a different animal.I also hadn't realized that a quarter of the original film from Metropolis had been lost. Captions are substituted for missing bits of film, such as, ""The Thin Man confronts Josephat in the apartment."" The missing bits of film, as described, are tantalizing and seem universally to be the most interesting parts. I found being constantly updated on their absence extremely distracting. I would have preferred just seeing what was left of Metroplis and trying to make sense of it myself, rather than having to read a constant series of film-historian ""footnotes"". (The experience couldn't be any worse than wrestling with Donnie Darko or Mulholland Drive, both of which I loved.)I think the ""restored version"" of Metroplis should be consigned to a reference edition for film buffs writing books, or maybe the companion DVD in a two-DVD set. As an actual viewing experience, constantly being told that chunks of film are missing takes one out of the world of the film over and over, sort of like being woken up from a dream every few minutes. The hand of the restorers is too heavy in this version of Metroplis, making one man's restoration another's frustration."
maXSepult,"Apr 29, 2003",10/10,"I had looked for this movie for a while, but after something like 2 moths I just gave up. Then, when I got to college, I had to opportunity to watch it, because I had a classed called Cinema & Civilization and we explored the German expressionism era, which had to be my favorite. So I finally got to see this movie, and I wasn't disappointed at all. And what stuns me the most, and I know this might have been said in previous comments, is that this movie was done in 1927, but it's vision of the future could still, in this day and age, be a vision of the future. All in all, this movie is a must for anyone who likes classic cinema. I give it a 10."
roddekker,"Oct 9, 2016",6/10,"In 10 years time (2026) the silent-era, Sci-Fi, classic, Metropolis will be reaching 100 years - And by sheer coincidence the year 2026 is also the same date in which this film's story is set.If nothing else - I think that it's interesting to see (through the eyes of the film Metropolis) how (100 years into the future) man's world was perceived to be.Over the last 15 years - I have watched this picture 3 times - And I do have to agree with others that without its incredible set designs and the presence of one of the most fantastic robots imaginable, Metropolis would, pretty much, be a very ordinary and, yes, humdrum production.But, with that said - From a purely historical point of view - I do recommend this film to one, and all."
coppercat8888,"May 11, 2011",2/10,"If your looking for an awesome black and white science fiction film with great acting and an excellent story...well keep searching because you will not find it here in Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"". Most people would shun my harsh opinion against this ""classic"" movie but if you are seriously looking for a good film that was made before your time then there are way better choices than this pitiful excuse for a movie.I will began by talking about the techniques in shooting the movie first. Since the sets were so elaborate and they went so overboard with props they expected that to carry the weight of entertaining the audience because it was something nobody had really seen before in a movie this long. Well yeah so what. Star Wars had ground breaking effects but they didn't just say, ""well guys, good job. I think that will do the trick. You can forget about the whole epic story and all that."" No. They combined mind bending science fiction with an awesome story and made a movie series that changed the American culture. Metropolis just films all the shots at these really flat and boring angles with makes the already boring movie a complete snoozer. Its almost like your watching a play thats not live action. And i wouldn't want to see this if it were a play either.The acting is horrible. Once again your watching a play with bad actors. You can't really grow attached to any of the characters because they are so goofy and annoying.The music is tasteless. There really is no main theme even for a movie this long. You would think they would have multiple themes like Lord of the Rings or something. But they don't. The music does't add to the experience.The story? It seemed to be pulled out of the wastebasket and pieced together. It was not interesting at all.In conclusion, don't watch this movie because if you do you will be saying, ""dang I wish this movie would have ended 2 hours ago."" That is, If your not already asleep."
aki-dhar26-780-912938,"Jun 28, 2012",8/10,"Lang's Metropolis, is truly a masterpiece. If you can only give its makers the credit for what they achieved in the era of no CGI or any other modern tech. The sets are huge, the screenplay is good, sometimes really good, the story is engaging, except that this movie doesn't make sense, if we watch it in the era of modern cinema. The normal movie goers, I rather say the people who go to movies, just for fun will not take it. YES, it is outdated, but that doesn't make it bad. The Meta critic rating of above 9 shows that. I rate it at 8 for its pure genius and heart, but it doesn't fit today's cinema and funny thing is that no one has told us to fit it either. I went through many reviews, including that of Sir Roger Ebert. Every one has high praises for the movie, but I personally feel that there were many other greater and better movies than Metropolis at that time. Some of them are ""M"" , ""City Lights"" , ""Modern Times"", ""The General"" that don't have time or era boundary as this movie has. They still are fresh and every normal person can enjoy them. I rate METROPOLIS at 8, but only for what it meant at that time and its message. No wonder if anyone will fall asleep in their sofa now a days."
july24christina,"Sep 9, 2002",10/10,"As I stated, I am not a science fiction person.  Can't stand it.  Except this film, which i love more than any other film i've ever seen.  It's classified as science fiction, but it goes farther beyond the guidelines of sci-fi than any other science fiction film i've ever seen.  it goes into romance, into social and political criticism, into horror, even.  It's an amazing movie.  I've been trying to get my friends to watch it for years, but they all get turned off when they hear the word ""silent""- but silent movies are an art form, and, as the other person said, very few modern directors would be able to accomplish anything even near what fritz lang did with this masterpiece."
alisonmoffat65,"Aug 27, 2014",8/10,"This may be my favourite film ever made. This may be because it had an influence on me as a person, and I would never have got into films, if it were not for this masterpiece. I watched this for the first time a year ago when I was just turning 13, and from that day, I have loved films. I loved this film so much, I have two copies of the film, the CD, and a bobble head of the machine man. Why is it so good, because it has, memorable characters, phenomenal sets, an influential tone, atmosphere and feel and simply because of the effort that went into making this film. That last point really translates on screen. It is not perfect though, and there are those who will not enjoy it, it's main issue is it's contrived and nonsensical plot as well as some cuts of the movie just do not flow very well. If you have not watched this film yet, do."
lee_eisenberg,"Sep 4, 2011",N/A,"One of the all-time masterpieces of cinema, Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" portrays a city that looks like the ultimate utopia, but is only such on the literal surface. Underneath everything, the workers toil all day in brutal conditions to make the conurbation function.Without a doubt, this movie should make anyone stop and think, in much the same way that ""The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum"" does. Everything may look fine and dandy, but how did it get to be like that (and what does it really mean)? It is practically impossible to find a country that has not had slavery at some point. For almost 100 years after the founding of the United States, slavery was the backbone of the economy (and to this day, farm workers work for less than the minimum wage). One of the best modern analogies to ""Metropolis"" is Dubai: touting itself as the most modernized, international city, it was built entirely by slave labor.A strange irony is that in an interview with Peter Bogdanovich, Lang expressed dissatisfaction with the movie, owing in part to the Nazi Party's fascination with it. Indeed, Hitler not only liked ""Metropolis"" but also Lang's earlier masterpiece ""Die Nibelungen"".But either way, this remains one of the greats. True, the acting is a little overdone, but the main thing on which to focus is the indictment of ""civilization"". Rarely have I seen a better indictment than in Fritz Lang's movie. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
jzathajenious,"Dec 14, 2003",6/10,"fritz lang's metropolis would have undoubtedly blown me away in 1927, yet as hard as i try to realise the importance of the film, it is still a boring, overlong film with an average plot. i dont know how much of this has got to do with the version i saw, which was a 139 min version DVD released in 99, with a new score (which was mind numbingly awful BTW) by Peter Osborne, but the movie just DRAGGED. i would love to have seen a shortened 90 min or so version which would have kept my interest. also, the picture quality was shocking as well, i mean, i realise its a very old movie but the dvd picture looked as bad as a VHS after about 1000 viewings. the acting was absolutely crap, but i can accept that for the time it was made, yet it certainly didnt help me want to watch this movie to the end, speaking of which, was pretty poor."
clivemorrow,"Nov 4, 2014",9/10,"This film is a legend and now I know why. I was lucky enough to see it on a big screen last week and was mesmerised by it. Hollywood is the famous American film city but this film is German and that has to be borne in mind at all times. The reason for my title is simple. The film is the greatest silent film I have ever seen and is silent films at their zenith. However, as it was released on 10 January 1927, silent films were coming to their end and when ""The Jazz Singer"" was released on 6 October of that year they were soon rendered obsolete.This film however will never be obsolete because it deals with universal human themes. I don't see it as supporting either Nazism or Communism. Hitler admired it but Fritz Lang made it at the height of the Weimar Republic and some of that republic's famous partying can be seen in the film. I don't think it was Communist either, but rather a plea for simple common human decency in the face of inhumanity.What struck me the most was the Biblical allusions. There was a Tower of Babel, a Great Flood and a not quite human woman being referred to as ""The Whore of Babylon."" That was relevant to me as my own church is studying the book of Revelation right now!! Since the Bible is so little studied in our own time, I wonder how much of those themes would actually be recognised by younger viewers. They might be more likely to see the film's link with Star Wars and other famous science fiction films much more quickly. I would call Metropolis more a work of prophecy than of science fiction. It still has a relevance in its call for people to be treated as more than just labouring machines. It may be 87 years old but its message is as true today as it was on the day of its premiere."
davidburrows89,"Sep 22, 2013",5/10,"I watched this film in A-Level Media Studies because we were studying the Sci-Fi genre. Metropolis (1927) is where the Sci-Fi genre really begins.At the time, Metropolis was the most expensive silent film ever made and its clear to see why. It was clearly well ahead of its time with visionary ideas.The special effects were amazing for there time, but are now obviously very dated.The problem is that the film was quite boring after a while and I only recommend to watch for nostalgic reasons, rather than for excitement and entertainment."
dimbost,"May 17, 2015",9/10,"Watched the 2008 uncut release. First of, I just want to say that the pure epicness and scale of this movie alone was amazing and deserves all the credit it got and then some.I watched this film for the first time on the 17/05/2015... I am huge movie buff and an aspiring movie teller, who loves old movies. Some of my favorite films include 12 angry men, The Seventh Seal, Bridge on the river Kwai, The Wrong man, Dial M for Murder, and much more... However as i have seen only few Silent movies before, i was worried that i was going to judge this film very biased, like many young people today do. That's the honest reason as to why i have put off watching it for a long time... But i have finally watched and was not only impressed but shocked as to the actual quality of the film and the emotion that it bought on the screen without any use of sounds. Not including the amazing score.so lets begin. Story: the story is a very complex one, it has links to religion and social standing behaviors, love story and a revenge/ vengeance conflict running through it. But for most part the story is not to hard to follow even the subtle meaning is clear.Acting: this is what real acting is all about, where actors have to express their emotions not through speech, but through facial expressions and body language. So Acting is for most part great.Set/ Special effects: This part is of the charts. For a film that is coming up on its 90th birthday soon has incredible visual elements. From amazing set decorations to huge and epic street views of the futuristic cities. Not including that in this 1927 film they perceive the future to have video calling ability, Vehicle phones, ability to ""copy"" not transfer BUT copy one's mind into a fully functional A.I Robot. and wireless electricity.Overall This is a brilliant and amazingly incredible accomplishment in the film industry which gave birth to a lot of films in the new category of Sci-fi movies. I Also would like to note, that i can see why the newer generation of film viewers can find this movie boring, or plain, or extremely slow. But that is not the true. This film will stand the test of time, and any possible remake of this will only prove how magnificently amazing this work of art really was.9/10 because we as humans understand that there is no perfection, and that everything has some kind of a flaw."
theognis2,"Mar 21, 2024",8/10,"The dehumanizing nature of capitalism and industrialization is the main topic here. Shortly after Germany followed the Kaiser into a devastating World War and emerged very much worse for the wear, this movie argued for more liberal and kinder relations between those in authority and the masses without it. Its chief and considerable virtue was the astonishingly beautiful sets, costumes, and overall design. Once seen, it will not be forgotten. Its vivid portrait of a dystopian future must have fired the imaginations of many filmmakers who followed this marvel. The story ranges from dull to silly, but matters little."
JaydoDre,"Dec 17, 2014",8/10,"When you have a silent movie from the 1927, it is tempting for a reviewer to lower the bar a little. The effects were not as good back then; there was no colour; the theatre actors are still adjusting to a film set; the directors and producers did not yet have a century of experience to draw from. Let's give it a break. However, it turns out lowering the bar is not necessary.The narrative has its good and its bad moments. It is a sci-fi adventure and has many modern elements like a person's evil double or the final physical fight between the villain and the protagonist. Watching this film, a bunch of other more recent movies flashed in my mind, from Blade Runner to Matrix to Judge Dredd, many of which appear to have been directly or indirectly influenced by this film.The setting is a dystopian future, with extreme difference between the ruling and working classes. It is a theme that countless other movies would later pick, and which eventually developed into the cyberpunk style. Today this theme is worn-out, but back in 1927 this theme may have been closer to reality than it is today and not nearly as worn out yet.Either way, the scenes built using this theme are fascinating, as the main character is sent on an adventure through the futuristic city. The movie uses strong Christian concepts modified to fit the story and the futuristic setting.In the second half of the film the story takes a few unpleasant missteps. At one point, the film decided to skip a whole scene and instead gives the viewer a title card explaining what had happened - a choice that comes out of nowhere and does not repeat itself. Did you guys shoot a scene and then lose it or what? Furthermore, believability issues arise, like during the scene when the enraged masses suddenly forget about their children being in danger. The ending also feels rushed and not very plausible. These strange occurrences come across much better if you take the film as an abstract piece and its events as symbolic, but the movie does not present itself that way. Its characters are real with real motivations.Amongst the notable performances is the leader of the city is played by Alfred Abel and this guy is phenomenal. He does so much with just his eyes alone. But, as is typical for movies of that time, sometimes the style of acting becomes extremely expressive, especially the crazy scientist. Arms are swinging around, and fingers are inventing more extreme ways to bend at the joints, which feels wholly unnecessary.The best thing about Metropolis is probably the way it looks, and I argue that it looks great even by today's standards. It is hard to take your eyes off the art. The sense of scale is stunning. The sets are huge and the creators took full advantage of the available room, making them look even bigger than they are. The movie has special effects, half a century before the first computer generated effects.The fact that the film is in black and white does not even seem like a limitation. If Metropolis was released today, it would probably also be in black and white because it suits this film and its themes very well.The scale, the architecture, the way the lights reflect in the irises of the characters. This movie is must-see even if you do not care for the story. It is amazing that this was made in the Weimar Republic that had only recently come out of an economic black hole.Do some of the things look a bit artificial? Well, yes. Propeller biplanes show up as flying cars and obviously feel a bit outdated. The robot design is archaic. But even the things that look dated still fit perfectly within the artistic style of the film.As for the music, the Germans have not lost touch with their roots. Heavy tubas and big drums give an epic and heavy ambiance to the machine city. Sometimes there is a distinct melody, other times the tune is a bit more generic, but it always remains effective.Metropolis is a film that is truly ahead of its time. Replace some of the older props, add voices and you have yourself a modern sci-fi film. There may be some issues with its narrative, especially in the 2nd half, but overall, it is a fascinating watch."
sc123,"Apr 26, 2003",10/10,"I cannot possibly list here all of the reasons why Metropolis is a fantastic piece of cinema, but I can summarize by saying I've never been more enthralled in a movie in my life.  Metropolis is science fiction, but it's much more than that.  It is passion and obsession, good vs. evil, the weak vs. the powerful.  It challenges the viewer to really consider what the future may be, but what's truly amazing is that the vision of the future in 1927 may still become our future today (in a sense).  This movie transcends stars and quotes, it is simply a work of art that cannot be missed.  The version recently released by Kino is surely the best available, with re-mastered video and the original score in Dolby Digital 5.1, there is truly no better way to experience Metropolis!"
skh1964,"Nov 5, 2002",10/10,"Metropolis is one of those films that even to be as old as it is can still be veiwed time and agian. The robot is one of the most imagianative Ive seen and still is on of my personal favorites next to Robby. The story makes one think of technology and man, where will it take us? I can't wait to get a copy of the new DVD release to add to my collection. The first time I saw it I was totally engrossed untill the end. Who would have thought that in a silent film. Fritz Lang's masterpeice will live long into the next century and continue to spark the imagiantion of everyone who has the chance to see it."
jonathandoe_se7en,"Aug 20, 2001",8/10,"Beautiful, thoughtful, artful, a rare experience... These are just some of the words to describe Fritz Lang's classic of the silent era... It's deals with so much, freedom, equilibrium, science and cultural growth... So much that is relevant to today. It's one of the greatest gestures of cinema of all time; the vision of the future of Metropolis is a vision of now, (these are all things Spielberg was striving for in A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001))... But Lang does it so much better, there's no forced sentimental message in this film, this is poetic picture, a film that will always get better with age... a classic that more people need to experience."
reddman9987,"May 9, 2011",N/A,"This Movie, one of the better ones that I have watched this semester, was the largest budgeted film of its time. This movie reminded me of America and its views on big business. I think about the larger companies and the way that many of them treat their employees. I think about the billions of dollars being made and all of the record profits being made by the fortune five hundred companies. The people on the lower levels of these companies usually never see the benefits of their labor. Walmart for example is a powerful company that makes enormous profits, just like the big business in Metropolis. The people from the movie make me think about the hundreds of workers who work in the store for minimum wages and for long hours. I also think of the conditions of many who work under the minimum wage standard and what they have to endure. The problems are the same as metropolis. Just like when the people were getting flooded in their small ghetto where they were stacked on top of each other, the big business people where having a party, blinded to the hurt, harm, and danger endured by the workers. I think that the people believed that if they couldn't see it then it was not happening. The most intriguing part of watching this movie is realizing that the directors are not trying to portray the owners as bad, but they are just giving an actual depiction of the time. The workers during these periods were treated as worker, people who are here to perform a duty and then leave. The owners are there to be in control and decided what happens, not there to make peoples lives better. I don't personally agree with it, but I do understand that the people with the money make the decisions and that still has not changed today, nor will it change in the future."
IkuharaKunihiko,"Nov 27, 2005",7/10,"The future. In Metropolis people are divided into a working class and a rich class. The working class has to do heavy jobs which last up to 10 hours a day. All that the rich class does is pretty much party all day. Freder, the son of the rich industrialist Joh, falls in love into Maria, the leader of a group of revolutionists. The scientist Rotwang kidnaps Maria and makes a robot twin out of her in order to create chaos inside the revolutionists...Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" from 1927, considered one of the first sci-fi films in the motion picture history, is a classic with a high reputation ( it's no. 81 on IMDb's top 250 films ). Still, despite having many brilliant sequences, the film seems a little dated today. The biggest problem is that it has actually very few sci-fi elements and too much dry drama, while the pace keeps getting slower and slower near the finish. Lang's visual style is impressive ( the sequence where a story about the tower of Babel is told, the hallucination about one of the skeleton death statue's coming to life, the waking of the female robot, the flooding of the town ) as is the composition of the story, but they can't hide all of the flaws. For example, F. W. Murnau's silent fantasy ""Faust"" looks much more spectacular.--------A very good piece of demanding storytelling which criticizes the government's decision of people being divided into working and not working classes, analyzes the nature of capitalism and offers a not so bright vision of the future. And the set design looks even more impressive when you think about it that it was made in Germany in the year 1927 and probably inspired ""Blade Runner"", while Rotwangs black glove probably inspired the looks of the mad scientist in Kubrick's ""Dr. Stragelove"". It's a classic, but a very dry one.Grade: 7/10"
TheLittleSongbird,"Mar 4, 2011",10/10,"What is to say about Metropolis that hasn't been said already? For me, probably very little. Metropolis is an awe-inspiring and influential masterpiece of the sci-fi genre, and one of the best movies I have seen in recent memory.Metropolis perfectly demonstrates the artistic vision of director Fritz Lang. Lang was a fine and intelligent director, and Metropolis shows this loud and clear as Lang's direction is superb. The film is very rarely boring to me, both the pace and length were well-judged in my view, and while the message may seem muddled to some people for others including me perhaps it is relevant and even powerful.The music is haunting, beautiful and evocative, the story really impresses with its originality and the acting is expressive, although silent the facial expressions and gestures speak volumes. The best part about Metropolis and what resonates with me are the visuals, the cinematography is fluid same with the lighting while the costumes and effects are wonderful, but the real revelations are the city landscapes and settings which are gorgeous.All in all, a brilliant film and an influential film not only of the genre but of cinema itself. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Vartiainen,"Feb 10, 2015",6/10,"It's strange and bizarre to find out that some ideas are way older than you originally thought. This film came out decades before science fiction really took off, and yet it contains many of the mainstays of the genre, from rebellious artificial intelligences to robots to mad scientists to a dystopian future ravaged by class divides.And yes, it's a silent film with dialogue cards and everything. And that can turn a lot of people away from it. Yet, if you can deal with subtitles, you can deal with this film, and you in fact should deal with it, because it's well worth a watch, if only because of its revolutionary scope, originality and story.Admittedly, it's not a perfect film. The story, while interesting, captivating and unlike anything seen before, is simplistic in its themes and the characters are rather black-n-white, though perhaps the term archetypical would be more descriptive. But that's only by today's standards. And even by those standards, some things have held up remarkably well. The set designs and all the visual details in general are still amazing, the acting is topnotch and as a whole the film has a phenomenal atmosphere of gloom mixed with triumph and ideals larger than man.Metropolis is heartily recommended for all fans of science fiction. It's one of the originals and its legacy is not going to be forgotten anytime soon."
inic-nemanja,"Aug 31, 2011",10/10,"This movie is a masterpiece. Though a silent movie, it says so much. The editing is perfect, and the first time i saw this film i was shocked at how they did it back in the '20s. There were a few scenes which i watched over and over, just admiring the beauty of them. The director did a perfect work, the scenes, and the frames just being perfect. The storyline is complex, yet simple, tells so much through so little. Prophetic, yes, but a bit exaggerated. The only thing shallow about this movie is the fact that most people nowadays will turn their heads at the first sight of it, being black and white, and being silent."
Mork_the_Borg,"Feb 17, 2018",10/10,"Just upgraded my rating for this movie from a 9/10 to a 10/10. Why? Because the more I think about the total and absolute rubbish released today (2018), the more I start to appreciate the absolute beauty of this master-piece, which in SF terms still happily shares a 1st place with Kubrick's Space Odyssey. This movie - for its time - and to a large extent still today - shows film as an art-form in all its glory, and the power of a great story. Simply cannot believe that people would rate a rubbish series like Supernatural a 10/10, but can't see a real cinematographic jewel not even when it's tattooed on their face! Ah well, let's see what this year has to offer. It's movie trailer-time for this guy!"
crossaneyes,"Jan 16, 2013",10/10,"metropolis is my favourite film of all time,simply because i have never seen a movie quite like this before. the story follows our unlikely hero freder who is the son of joh frederson the master of metropolis,freder lives in luxury above ground and takes his life for granted,but his attitude changes when a woman who lives below in the underground depths of the workers city comes to freder and tries to change his attitudes towards the workers that slave their lives away in the depths ""these are your brothers"" i won't spoil the rest,just watch and find it out for yourselves!!! admittedly i was blown away by the set pieces which really make the whole movie all the sets are breathtaking and even if your not a movie buff and don't usually notice those things in films you will definitely admire the sets in metropolis.props are very advanced and impressive for a 1927 flick,as are the excellent costumes,most notably rotwangs robot,and the use of lighting does a great job on setting the noir tones of the movie. I will let you discover the rest of this incredible movie by yourself,and please PLEASE!!! do not be put off by this movie because its a silent film. p.s for maximum of enjoyment of this film watch the version available on youtube which is completely synchronized to pink floyd's wish you were here,it really does tell the story AMAZINGLY and there are some bits that you will be genuinely shocked at how well the actors movements synchronize with the music and lyrics,you wouldn't believe that the album was written 48 years after,anyways enjoy!!"
devintheinteresting,"Jun 29, 2015",10/10,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis is a film I had heard of, and I knew it's cultural impact, but I had never actually seen it. I decided to download it on my iPad and watched the 2010 restoration. I was expecting a good little sci-fi silent with anti cruel government messages. I did get that, yes, but I got much more. The story follows Freder Frederson (Nice name) who is the son of the mayor of a grand city called Metropolis. Freder encounters a woman named Maria who is the caretaker of the worker's children. Freder learns that all the workers live in their own little underground city and are not allowed into Metropolis. Freder confronts his father about this and gets a negative response. His father then fires his assistant Josaphat. Freder then let's Josaphat live at his house, while he goes off to take the places of workers. Freder learns that Maria also runs an underground church for the workers. She is trying to give them faith that a mediator between brain and hands will come and help them. Freder's father learns of this and has an inventor named Rotwang have his Machine-Man take Maria's form and pose as her to crush their faith in a mediator. For 1927 that is a great plot, even today it works. Fritz Lang really takes advantage of this and gives us some of the best direction I've ever seen. The effects are beautiful and innovative. The use of mirrors and double exposure is just wonderful. The performance are good. Some of the actors over act (The men in the yoshiwara during Maria's dance are just the worst), but some of them give good, non goofy performances. The best performance comes from Brigitte Helm. The way she plays Robot Maria is over the top, but because of that, you have to love it. The ways she moves quickly and talks is just so fun and entertaining. The screenplay is well written, even though the dialogue can be pathetic sometimes. The production design is the most iconic thing about the movie. The way the city of Metropolis looks has influenced a great number of films. It was a vision of the future that does exist today. Look at modern New York City and Metropolis. The resemblance is certainly there. Overall, Metropolis is well directed, interesting, vision of the future with important social commentary. I give a 10/10"
Snow Leopard,"Aug 30, 2001",N/A,"There's no other movie quite like this old classic, which has many memorable images and a distinctive way of telling its story.  The plot is rather outlandish at times, and many interesting or significant details are never explained, but the forcefulness of the rest of the production more than makes up for it.  Once you are drawn into the world of the film, the combination of impressive visuals and strange story makes for a uniquely satisfying movie.The combination of expressionism and science fiction works well, creating the very interesting setting of ""Metropolis"" and an assortment of characters ranging from sympathetic to bizarre.  It often leaves you wanting to know even more about the background of all this, but there is already more than enough to take up a couple of hours of screen time.  You could also spend a long time analyzing the symbolism and themes, and while some of the more obvious themes may be a little less topical today, it's still a thought-provoking collection of ideas.Anyone who enjoys silent films should make sure to see this sometime.  It's also worth watching as one of the icons of classic cinema that has had its influence on later film-makers."
kurosawakira,"Mar 13, 2013",7/10,"Luis Buñuel saw Lang's ""Metropolis"" (1927) as not one but two different films with deeply different spiritual needs: the story is overt romanticism, yet the images are full of great power. This has become a kind of critical paradigm that I tend to side with.I would prefer Lang's ""Die Nibelungen"" (released in two parts, ""Sigfried"" and ""Kriemhilds Rache"", in 1924) if I had to select an an ultra-epic from his filmography, but this is a great ride, nevertheless. It's ultramodern, as well, in its manipulativeness and sense of scope and destruction (very much like the ""modern"" blockbuster), and best works for me if I let the story to fade into the background (which doesn't make that much sense as a story, but makes all the sense in the world as a film) and let the stream of images wash over me.This might sound arrogant, but the story feels just too heavy-handed for me. I think I understand its implications as a modern-day allegory of modern times as a kind of Orwellian counter-reality, but it takes itself so seriously – as any epic will, mind you – it's difficult to make amends with. I don't see it as science fiction, instead as a continuation of the high fantasy of ""Die Nibelungen"" into the modern day, a kind of societal prophecy for their time and place. It's because of this gravitas that the film is so full juxtaposition between cultural heritage and religion and nationalistic idealism, and it's this gravitas that lends the film its rather clumsy narrative, but on the other hand it's this gravitas that lends such potency to the imagery.Whenever I'll revisit the film I'll have to see it with Chaplin's brilliant ""Modern Times"" (1935) that refers to it in divers ways and speaks of the same things. It's rather heavy for Chaplin, but still rather obviously lighter in tone than this."
DanDV,"May 8, 2011",2/10,"If this movie were shot in 2007 instead of 1927, would you still rate it so high, you IMDb clique of ""classic"" movie fans? Here's the thing: it was a great movie for its time, no doubt about that. But time has moved forward. Nowadays acting actually looks real, films have dialog instead of caricaturist intertitles and exaggerated facial expressions, and, like it or not, special effects are done using computers and look much more realistic.Look, we don't wear 1920's clothes any more. We don't decorate our houses as we did 80 years ago. To say nothing of technology - we've moved so much ahead.Please stop rating this movie so high just because it was good 80 years ago. As of today, it's pretty bad."
aarontylernielsen,"Feb 28, 2013",10/10,"Lang gives a dark and terrifying vision of the future that is full of great effects and peer spectacle, great acting and everything that makes a movie great. I enjoyed it when I first watched it and I still enjoy it today. If there was no Metropolis then there would be no Blade Runner or Star Wars. So we all have to thank Metropolis for everything it has done for us. I say you get the Complete Metropolis from Kino International. It will blow you away and the film will make more sense. I recommend to Science-fiction fans or just movie fans in general. It is one Heck of a ride filled with pure entertainment. Some people may dismiss the movie because of the whole point of it being in black in white and silent but that will you use inner imagination to break the silence and fill in the colors. I say you check it out for entertainment. Peace out."
Oxon01002,"Dec 7, 2006",10/10,"Metropolis is so gigantic and important a picture that its impact and genius can't be exaggerated. However, almost from the day filming was completed it has been subject to butchery. As a result, chunks of Fritz Lang's original vision have been lost forever, and the film exists in numerous dodgy, splotchy prints, hacked up and misedited, cut down and supplied with musical soundtracks that range from the completely inappropriate to wonderful modern techno-rock things which, nice though they are, are not what Lang had in mind.Kino came out with a DVD just a few years ago that is a fantastic attempt to restore Lang's original. I am NOT shilling for Kino -- you don't have to buy it, as there are plenty of sources for super-cheap rentals, or you can borrow it from some libraries (or friends!) for free. The point is, if you intend to see this movie, and even if you have seen a videotape version of it before, see this latest version: the picture is super-clear and the lighting restored; every bit of Lang's film that survives is included; Lang's original title cards are restored; the bits that have been lost forever are discreetly replaced with a title card to summarize the action that you should be seeing, in a way that completely unobtrusively, but helpfully, clarifies the film; and the soundtrack is the restored musical score.If your only experience of this movie has been a rocked-up modern club-kid version, or a creaky, shadowy poor print on video with a single cheery piano tune incessantly repeated as the score, see this latest restoration. It will become clear to you what all the excitement and angst was about back in Lang's day."
Quinoa1984,"Jul 18, 2005",10/10,"Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium, and his 1927 opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this. Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format (a fully restored print on the KINO DVD, filled with inter-titles to keep the story complete) that had me appreciate it more, but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music (i.e. Giorgio Moroder's experimental cut), it would still be affecting.At the core of the story, Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou, the sides of good vs. evil, or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak, is set up so strongly that even when it has it's fairy-tale type of heaviness to it, it doesn't seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults. This is the kind of film that should work for anyone, young and old, as it deals with universal themes (i.e. ""The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!"")The story leaves room for the visual style to come through- Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis, Joh Frederson. He feels the sorrow and pain of the people, and goes down to their level to be one of them. He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women, Maria (played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm, in multiple roles she plays without a fault), who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freder's father. Enter the robot, a marvel of a mad scientist, who gets transposed from Maria, and becomes the havoc-wrecker of the part of Metropolis. I won't reveal too much of the story, except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act, as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lap.Amidst in all of this, Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects, camera-tricks, and of course editing (if I wouldn't quite rank Metropolis in my all-time top ten favorites, I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses, which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version). It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam, and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day (cars moving on roads built to the sky, airplanes flying every-which way, and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways. But it's not just the use of the models, or the sets, or the backdrops, or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Lang's shots (which are all spectacular), it's also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film. One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene (it also appears in other scenes I think). It's little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages, the super-impositions of faces and eyes in the dream-like shots.And, of course, Lang's greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story, he goes beyond his time period in stylizing. As I mentioned with the pacing being unique, it was surprising (though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M) that many of the suspense sequences, mob scenes/riots, chases, I knew that this is the same kind of styling that's used today for many of the most modern of science-fiction/action films. In its own way, much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 Space Oddysey, it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling, while not completely abandoning the storytelling form.Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries, and it hasn't been seen in its full form in almost eighty years, what remains doesn't seem at all dated or crude. Quite the opposite, its visual expressiveness, its use of time and character and action, and its deliberate pacing, makes it ahead of its time and influential, and at the same time keeping itself unique. It's a tale we're all familiar with, being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial, cruel world- which I'm sure was even more relevant to post WW1 Germany at the time- filmed with a mix of over-the-top melodrama, mega-budget set-pieces, and designs that confound the senses. Add the appropriate music, and you've got a classic fantasy. A tremendous film to see two, three, a dozen times over- though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words (or by the operatic dramatic side of it all) may become disappointed or frustrated."
frankde-jong,"Oct 12, 2019",9/10,"For a long time the story of ""Metropolis"" was incomprehensible because of lost footage. In 2008 in Buenos Aires parts of the movie that were considered lost were rediscovered and the story made sense again.That the story made sense is not to say that it is a great story. Too many characters are one dimensional or not very realistic. Freder (the son) is totally naive and Maria is too much saint-like. On top of that the motto of the film "" The mediator between head and hands must be the heart"" is a bit sack baked.Nevertheless ""Metropolis"" is one of the great films of all time and a model for science fiction movies up to this day.The elaboration may be too idealistic, but ""Metropolis"" has two themes that are socially very relevant. In the first place the mechanization of work. This theme is illustrated by a choreography of workers that illustrates their subordination to the machines. With respect to this theme ""Metropolis"" is the predecessor of films such as ""A nous la liberte"" (1931, Rene Clair) and ""Modern times"" (1936, Charlie Chaplin). In the second place the dichotomy between the happy few and the poor workers. In this respect ""Metropolis"" is the predecessor of ""Blade runner"" (1982, Ridley Scott) (although in that film the poor were not the workers but the robots / replicants).Apart from relevant themes the film has also a very convincing filmlanguage, in some cases innovative in other instances going back to older movies. I will give a few examples. The machine turning into a savage monster in the fantasy of young Freder (""Cabiria"", 1914, Giovanni Pastrone). The transformation of dead material into living one (""Frankenstein, 1931, James Whale). The mad scientist Rotwang with the hand with a black glove (""Dr Strangelove"" 1964, Stanley Kubrick).Apart from that the architecure in ""Metropolis"" (inspired by the New York skyline) is, combined with the art deco interiors, unsurpassed.All in all ""Metropolis"" is one of the highlights pf German expressionism."
zetes,"Sep 21, 2001",8/10,"Don't get me wrong. I do LIKE this film. I just don't LOVE it. I would never argue with its importance; it's just that I think that it doesn't rank as one of the greatest films ever made. There are at least a dozen silent feature films that I like more, including, but not limited to, The Passion of Joan of Arc (Carl Dreyer, 1928), Batteship Potemkin (Sergei Eisenstein, 1925), Sherlock Jr. (Buster Keaton, 1924), Modern Times (Charlie Chaplin, 1936), Safety Last (Harold Lloyd, 1923), Nanook of the North (Robert Flaherty, 1922), Our Hospitality (Keaton, 1923), and City Lights (Chaplin, 1931).The maxim to which I refer is this: ""Between the head and hands there must be a heart"" (or something to that effect). In the film, Joh Frederson is figuratively the head, Grot the hands, and Freder the heart. In analogizing the film itself with that image, I would count the film's metaphoric and symbolic aspects as the head, its technical aspects the hands. The heart should be the relationship between Freder and Maria. Unfortunately, that whole piece of the film just doesn't work very well. It comes off as merely mechanical.What is left is still amazing. Hardly any film has matched its stunning sets. A few of the set pieces rank as some of the best ever created, for example, Moloch devouring the workers, Freder working the arms of the clock, the Tower of Babel story, the transformation of Rotwang's robot, Mecha-Maria's erotic dance, and a few others. However, there are a lot of segments that move as slow as molasses. There are a lot of scenes where characters stare at each other for so long that it proceeds to become silly.In fact, it can be generally silly. A lot of people were laughing at somewhat inappropriate moments at the screening that I attended tonight. It is very dated, as you probably would expect a silent sci-fi movie to be. I wonder, though, if this is a German phenomenon. All silent films are dated up to a point, but a lot are very enjoyable still in a way different than sound films. The three German UFA silents I've seen, Metropolis, The Last Man, and Nosferatu (the latter two both directed by the famed F.W. Murnau) all seem more dated than usual to me. I know all three of those films have a lot of fans, but they all seem stale to me.Tonight I saw the film in a theater with live music - a great experience if you've never had the chance to do it. The version was a brand new reconstruction which ran at 157 minutes. 157!?!?!?The version that I own is only 120, and I get kind of bored during it. Fortunately, with the live piano music, as opposed to the usual, torturous sythesizer which accompanies most versions of the film on video, it was much easier to endure. Although I haven't seen the 120 minute version for about two years, I can speculate as to what was added in this version. Rotwang's character seemed to be expanded - I had always seen him simply as a mad scientist without any real character. Here, I believe that more of a motive has been supplied. The worker whom Freder substitutes at the clock-like work station, worker 11811, has more of a story, though a lot of its elements have been lost and were told through intertitles. There was also a lot more concerning ""the thin man,"" a spy whom Joh Frederson orders to follow his son. There must have been more, but I don't really feel like watching my VHS tape of it right now. This was the third silent film I ever saw, the first I ever owned, and my rank has always been 8/10, regardless of the version."
Artimidor,"Sep 29, 2012",10/10,"For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered ""Metropolis"" Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable science-fiction trailblazer in motion picture history. What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead. With the new painstaking 2010 restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score - and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away, and this time for real.The technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Lang's oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnau's ingenious approaches on film-making. There's so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype. Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the hero's visions, the Babel tower teeming with utopian life, the enormous sets, elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people, the staggering creation of the first robot, all set against the dominant dichotomy between - literally - those living above and those dying below. There are echoes of communism here, of nazi ideology, of the dangers and abysses of industrialization, technology, and there are also glimpses of humanity. Not perfect in all its components, the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it - and more. Fritz Lang, while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a ""signpost for new destinations"", and that's exactly what it became now that we can look at the great sci-fi pictures of the past century. In them and through them ""Metropolis"" still lives, and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it, miraculously, still points ahead."
Michael_Elliott,"Nov 25, 2010",N/A,"Metropolis (1927)**** (out of 4)This 1927 German film remains one of the most influential movies ever made and while watching it you can't help but just count off the countless films that it left its mark on. With 25-minutes of footage recently restored to the film, it's certainly the most complete we'll ever see the movie and there's no question that it remains one of the most visually impressive films ever made. The story itself is quite simple as in the future the working class folks are pretty much slaves forced to work under the streets of the city to make sure that the metropolis keeps moving. The rich folks on the top of the city, led by Jon Fredersen (Alfred Abel) have no idea what it's really like below but soon Jon's son (Gustav Frohlich) is about to switch sides and help the two sides come together but a crazed inventor (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) has plans of his own.When it was learned that 25-minutes worth of footage had been discovered a lot of people wondered if it would actually hurt the movie. I've heard a few people say that many of Lang's silents ran too long but I personally don't agree with such statements and overall I think the added footage really helps. It certainly helped explain the back story between Jon and the inventor and we get a few more powerful scenes during the flood at the end of the movie. This new footage was taken from a badly damaged 16mm print so even if you're unfamiliar with the movie it's easy to spot the new footage just by the quality. METROPOLIS was always looked at as a masterpiece of the silent cinema and this new footage isn't going to hurt its reputation a bit. The greatness that Lang made of the film is still on full display and the added footage just gives one more to enjoy, although, to be fair, there are a couple shots that probably could have been left off.The main reason METROPOLIS is such a legend is because of its visuals and they're still impressive after all these years. I always tell people that silent movies were the greatest during this era because filmmakers like Lang were trying things that were fresh and original and they accomplished stuff that have still never been topped. From the opening shots of the mammoth city the truly surreal underground segments, there's not one thing here that doesn't look brilliant and jump off the screen. One of the most famous scenes happens when the labor must be used on a clock-like item where the worker must stand for ten hours and match up the arms with the various lights that go on. This creation is still something to marvel at as is the now landmark sequence of the ""creature"" taking form. There are scenes where it's clear hundreds if not thousands of extras were being used and this just adds to the dramatics and proves that this stuff here is much more powerful than anything CGI could create. The performances by the entire cast are all wonderful and serve the film just fine. One could make a strong argument that the story itself isn't all that strong and at times it's certainly over-dramatic but this doesn't hamper the film at all. The futuristic look of the city and the underground are still something truly amazing on the eyes and it's doubtful many films will top METROPOLIS for its overall look and nightmarish nature. I personally wouldn't call it one of the greatest films ever made but it's certainly one of the most impressive and most important."
richardchatten,"Apr 12, 2025",7/10,"Dismissed by H. G. Wells as ""quite the silliest film"" 'Metropolis' belongs in that category of film whose reputation has ironically suffered from its continued availability; since while the stills suggest a masterpiece the film itself comes as something of an anticlimax.Inspired by the sight of Manhattan at night seen from a ship, it's definitely a triumph of production design and created such iconic images as Rotwang's leather glove which anticipates a variety of mad scientists, culminating in Dr Strangelove; while as a robot Brigitte Helm is infinitely more carnal than as the heroine.But Gustav Frohlich's performance makes Rudolf Klein-Rogge look like he's practicing the Method."
siderite,"Jan 14, 2006",8/10,"How weird is to watch and analyze now a movie that was made 80 years ago. I think the best way to describe it is a movie that proves arts evolve to evoke the same feelings about the same problems. People haven't evolved since 100 or 1000 or 10000 years ago, they just evolved new special effects.Metropolis shows a world separated in two great social classes: the thinkers and the workers. Of course, the thinkers don't think nearly as much as they should while the workers do some thinking from time to time. This leads to a conflict in the end of the movie that ends making the point of the movie: you need to guide your actions with responsibility, not only thought or brawn. A powerful idea not only then, when capitalism was showing its ugly side to the world, but also now and in any human epoch.The film looks stunning for that era. Metropolis itself looks like the grandfather of the Total Recall 2070, Blade Runner and Batman cities. The aerial vehicles that move people look like very old The Fifth Element or Star Wars air cars. The script has the corporate villain, the idealistic youth, the mad scientist, all elements copied in movies again and again since then on.I don't think it was particularly entertaining. It is so old (and being black and white and with no sound makes it really hard to watch) that it doesn't really appeal to you the way modern films do. But if you are a movie buff, one that needs to know where it all started from, you just have to see Metropolis, the granddaddy of all cinematography now."
Higher_HIghs,"Mar 9, 2025",7/10,"I would have never thought I would watch a 100-year-old movie by choice, but here we are. It was a unique experience for me - I had never watched a silent movie before. The first thing you notice is how ""bad"" the acting was back then - overacting in certain scenes is mind-boggling. It makes you appreciate the current art of acting much more, as it becomes obvious to you how far the craft has progressed over the last century. On the other had, the acting of the main female lead, while over the top, doesn't look off at all, and if anything, it only enhances the role she's playing. Jokes aside, her creepy and ominous performance deserves a spot in the TOP 5 of the best performances of the 20th century. Another interesting thing and unexpected aspect of watching a century-old movie is that you know for a fact that everyone on your screen - including the children - and everyone behind the camera is undoubtedly already dead. It gives everything happening on your screen a certain flair that is impossible to put into words and that modern movies lack for obvious reasons."
K3nzit,"Jan 3, 2020",9/10,"I must first say that I'm giving the rating to the 2002 restored version of this film. Although many scenes are missing in that version, one can still see the reasons why it is such a great sci-fi classic - The story is totally timeless and still very relevant today. It's visually decades ahead of its time. Films like 'Star Wars' and 'Blade Runner' are only two of many movies that look the way they do because of this masterpiece."
utgard14,"Sep 19, 2014",10/10,"Peerless silent sci-fi masterpiece from Fritz Lang. My favorite film of his and probably my favorite silent film overall. A masterfully crafted epic with striking visuals that will blow your mind, especially given that this was released in 1927. The special effects and sets are remarkable and unlike anything else seen at the time. The style has been copied many times down through the decades. It's still being copied today. There are maybe a handful of films that have been as stylistically influential as Metropolis. The story is intriguing and thought-provoking, although it may not be the cup of tea for sensitive political types. Hopefully even those people will be able to appreciate the remarkable technical and artistic achievements of this film. A lot of people will balk at watching this because it's a silent movie. Well they are missing out on something truly special. Epic, classic, and groundbreaking are words that are often overused with many movies but not this one. This is a true work of art that deserves all the praise it gets."
preppy-3,"Aug 29, 2002",9/10,"Silent German film about a city of the future run by dehumanized workers who are sick of their lot and plan to stage a revolt.  Kind, sweet, lovely Maria (Brigette Helm) stops them saying they should talk through their differences.  However the evil head of the city wants a revolt so he can get rid of them and put in robot workers.  He gets a mad scientist to help him. He kidnaps Maria and (in a stunning sequence) transforms the robot into her image.  However this Maria is pure evil and sets the workers off...and things go barreling out of control.The original version of this was (purportedly) 5 hours long!  It has been cut drastically over the years and much footage was lost.  Finally, 75 years later, we have a version that is complete as possible (it runs a little over 2 hours), looks incredible and has a great reconstruction of the 1927 score.The film still holds up--the special effects are still impressive and quite obviously influenced many sci-fi films of the future (""Blade Runner"" especially).  The movie moves quickly and there is (literally) a cast of hundreds.  Great sets, special effects, a beautiful music score...a definite must-see.Only debit--the acting.  It's VERY overdone especially by Helms.  She's OK as the sweet Maria but is hopeless doing evil Maria.  The audience I saw it with broke out laughing more than a few times at the expressions on her face.  Also the actors must have been freezing doing this--you can see their breath!Also, there's a 1984 reconstruction which cut the film to 80 minutes, added tinting and (briefly) a color sequence and put in a rock score (including Loverboy, Pat Benatar, Lyle Lovett etc etc).  Sounds horrible but it works. It just doesn't make a lot of sense (40 minutes were edited out!).  That's worth seeing, but see this one first.  Again--a must-see!"
webplastic,"Mar 22, 2014",9/10,"There is little to be said about this masterpiece. A movie to define the science fiction cinematography for - at least - the next fifty years, maybe until ""2001 A space odyssey"". To be watched even today with high interest. The photography and stage setting are breathtaking and the atmosphere of the film transport the viewer there, in this fictional society with this robot. It seems Like an ancient statue god which becomes alive. Amazing are indeed the last scenes with the crowd running and the ""panic of the masses"". It feels like Orwell saw this film a thousand times. I say no more, a must see if you want to be called a decent sci-fi fan."
lasttimeisaw,"Nov 19, 2012",8/10,"Out of admiration and reverence, Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS has seized me with its utterly ""mission-impossible"" scale of a dystopian world (weighing against its time), the avant-garde structural grandeur and a stiflingly rigid and consistently overpowering score. What I watched is a 119 min DVD edition out around 2002, surely this revamped version has maximized the completeness of this allegorical chef d'oeuvre, the overt omissions of certain parts have inevitably and massively stunted the narrative arc.It's a gnawing wrestle between my conscience and my criterion on films to finalize the rating as 8 out of 10, but honestly if there will be a complete version, minimally a 9 out of 10 is without any dispute. Personally cinema's silent era is my Achilles' heel, my lack of experience has inflicted ill at ease on me while adjusting myself with the puppet-like performances (excluded the pseudo-zombie marching of the mass of workers, which is a masterly gambit) and the over-dramatic formalism (I'm much more of a methodology cinephile). Among the cast, a fearless Bridgitte Helm shines while strenuously emanating her bent through the grappling between good and evil.Also its heavy-handed political metaphor is too blatant, for example, with the over- elaborated fomentation of the workers, it might suits the ideological reality at that time, but weirdly enough, it may also prompt some irksome jitteriness and fall into a set-up as propaganda cliché (the witch-staking bluff is tiresome, why woman should always be the avatar of all the moral frailties?).So if one must select its most striking merits (historically speaking), my personal pick is the ingenious futuristic design, which miraculously has not been sullied at all by the merciless time passing by, it is still daunting and awe-inspiring to picture how Lang and his team could accomplish their work then without the assistance of CGI technology. In the Sci-Fi genre, METROPOLIS is a bona file trail blazer and keeps being the inspiration of many of its posterity almost one century later."
angus-lamont,"Oct 19, 2017",10/10,"I watched this film for the first time last night (courtesy of the stunning Eureka! Blu- Ray) and was totally blown away. This film was light-years ahead of its time in terms of its filmmaking techniques. I can definitely see how films such as ""Blade Runner"" and ""Star Wars"" were influenced by this masterpiece. Stop whatever you are doing, order the Blu Ray (make sure it has the original score) and dedicate just under 3 hours of your time to this amazing film. You will not be disappointed!"
Jen-4,"Aug 20, 1998",N/A,"This movie is the epitome of a surreal movie. Although it is often referred to as a view of the future, in the beggining a card states the movie is of ""no time or place"".

Atreyu_II,"Apr 7, 2012",7/10,"Considering the good reputation this vintage classic enjoys today, it's a little strange to think that in its heyday its popularity was restrict. I don't think it was because people weren't prepared for such a revolutionary movie. As far as I know, even then few were the ones who weren't marveled with the futuristic and highly stylish visuals. I can't say for sure, but I think it was because it combined futuristic scenarios with still primitive cinema techniques (which were what was available at the time). And quite honestly, the ancient cinema techniques is the aspect which this film is most dated. The stunning futuristic visuals haven't aged at all. I'd dare to say that they wouldn't do ugly now. They are still surprisingly fresh even for today's standards: the ""avant-garde"" mega-city of Metropolis and the fantastic Tower of Babel, all part of the director's vision for the future.The final cost would probably be far from being overly expensive today, but for 1927 this was a very costly film to make, which you can tell from its advanced ideas.Some futurisms aside, this movie is not for everyone because it is very old, silent and in black and white. Adding to all that, it is very long and can be quite repetitive. A movie with these characteristics this long can push some to the limits of their patience. One has to have in mind that ""nobody"" watches movies like this these days.Aside the greatness of the futuristic stuff, the best thing is the sequence of the overflown reservoirs and inundations caused by it, putting many children in danger who are rescued in time before any disgrace.The movie has become unexpectedly famous over time. To prove how much its popularity grew over time, let me just say that musical artists like Queen in the videoclip for the song ""Radio Ga Ga"" and Madonna in the videoclip for the song ""Express Yourself"" payed some homage to it in slight details of inspiration."
tjgoalie13,"Oct 22, 2015",9/10,"In 1927, during one of the harshest times in recent history, German Expressionist director Fritz Lang made Metropolis. Metropolis is one of the most historically important films ever made, because it was an artistic German Expressionist masterpiece, that boldly challenged the Nazi Party, and still has a massive impact on cinema today. It was an angry film pointed at its geographical time and place, but it also offered some major positives for the industry. Lang used several techniques that have become recognized as key elements of German Expressionism, most noticeably lighting. A good example of this was the scene that introduces Maria for the first time, multiple times contrasting lighting techniques were used to highlight particular characters. This technique gave Maria an angelic look, when she spoke, as well as highlighting the reactions of particular characters. Another element of German expressionism was. These lighting techniques were also used often with the presence of the character Rotwang, with this character various lighting techniques were used to make his rooms darker, and give Rotwang large shadows. Just by lighting techniques Lang told the audience how to feel about certain characters, something many filmmakers have since copied. These lighting techniques are great examples of German Expressionism, but they also help shape the narrative, and tone of the film. The narrative of Metropolis leans in the direction of formalist, because it very heavily promotes a thematic point, has a scrambled sense of time, and is occasionally intruded with the director's style. The film's narrative has very clear religious parallels and a clear message, against the Nazi Party, and their regime. At a time when the amount of propaganda films were rising, Metropolis was able to send a message with clever subtlety. The evidence that Lang was angry with the, at the time, new Nazi Party is evident through the religious parallels, especially with Israel. It's no secret how the Nazi's felt about members of the Hebrew religion, and the parallels often connected to the Hebrew religion. The catacomb scene in the film contains the best examples of this as the candles behind Maria resemble a menorah, the iconic candle that the Hebrew religion celebrates Hanukkah with. Maria has a very close association with the woman in Revelation 12, it seems relevant to point out that in the catacomb scene the candles behind Maria, may represent the crown of twelve stars. The religious parallels combined with the well known fact that Fritz Lang didn't like the Nazi Party, most likely because of his Jewish heritage, help reinforce that Metropolis was film with an angry anti-Nazi message. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Metropolis is the powerfully real way that Lang showed us his apocalyptic vision. The world is scary, because it's realistic, and powerful, because it resembled an interpretation of the world the Nazi's preached about creating. The evidence that the world resembled a Nazi vision are, again, in the religious parallels, this time with the story of Exodus. The film is clear that the world has three divisions, the hand (the Egyptian slaves/the poor), the brain (the pharoah/Joh Frederson), and the heart (Freder/Moses), it is noteworthy that the story of Exodus is about Hebrew liberation. The film was powerful, because of it's message, but is also one of the most influential of the classical Science Fiction films, and still has a massive impact on films today. Visually the Metropolis was made to be a beautiful paradox that is magnificent, yet equally hellish, this look has been copied numerous times throughout the years. Examples of this are in Blade Runner, Dark City, Escape From New York, and the Matrix. The dark yet beautiful apocalyptic world would become a staple of futuristic Science Fiction films. Another visual staple of Metropolis was the look of the citizens, specifically the poor, who are a bland, uniform set of people, beaten to submission. This has been used in films like THX 1138, and more recently films like Snowpiercer, and the Hunger Games. Another impactful aspect of the film is Rotwang's metal hand, which has been copied famously in Dr. Strangelove, and Star Wars. There are many more things that Metropolis has inspired over the years, these are many more things that Metropolis has inspired over the years, these examples were just a few examples of the impact of Metropolis. Regardless of one's opinion toward the film itself, it seems self-evident that Metropolis remains one of film's shining moments, as proof that art can reflect and even criticize culture. Metropolis also remains timeless, because it offers viewers the opportunity to enter the mindset of a skeptical German during the rise of Nazi power. Metropolis' footprint still heavily affects films today, that, and considering the message's enduring relevance, make Metropolis one of the most influential films of all time."

Acting is in what I might term an expressionist fashion - in part due to the popular German style and also due to the constraints of lack of today's computer trickery and, of course, the silent aspect.The plot and overt symbolism - while perhaps compelling in historical terms - may seem naif to present viewers; yet this is not a film about politics (although it to some extent tries to be) but a film of great art and beauty.Sadly the original ending is lost and in pieces; the American release ending is what most have seen.

RM851222,"Sep 21, 2016",9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Metropolis"" (1927) is a superbly visionary sci-fi tale about differences between classes with some slight religious undertones involved. It is a great movie.It is nearly impossible to objectively review film made in 1927, because the movie making and the world itself were different. But it is safe to say that ""Metropolis"" is a one great film, because it has some great ideas, which i don't think have aged that significantly. Movie making is brilliant, there some shoots in this movie that i haven't saw before (really), like the one where endless line of people goes to the mountain - how did they did this? The story itself like i said is superbly visionary - how did they even thought to film this story back in 1927? I guess if you are dying to do something in your life passionately, all obstacles are meaningless.Overall, ""Metropolis"" is a must see movie to all who loves movies in general. Great ideas, superb plot, superb craftsmanship (for that period) and just a such a visionary art - this is a great film, which i glad i saw."
SilentType,"Mar 16, 2003",N/A,"`Metropolis' is one of those films whose reputation precedes it, making it difficult to judge objectively. The iconic image of the robot woman is one of the most famous in motion picture history, and countless other films have referenced its distinctive visual style.It's 2026, impoverished workers toil beneath the ground to keep the rich dwellers of the sprawling Metropolis above them in comfort. These two worlds collide when Freder, son of the leader of Metropolis, meets with Maria, a resistance fighter who is inciting the workers to a peaceful revolt against their wealthy captors in order to bring unity to the world. Freder is horrified when he stumbles upon Maria's secret world. His father, upon learning about Maria's quest, commissions the scientist Rotwang to create an evil android Maria who will bring chaos to the workers' plans.The special effects are still striking over eighty years later, from the eerie creation of the robot Maria to the stirring crowd sequences and the Metropolis of the title. Brigitte Helm is both sweet and sinister in her dual role as the good and evil Maria. The narrative is occasionally hard to follow, and the struggle between the rich and the poor is sometimes diluted by the visuals - no surprise given that the film was cut and recut literally from its first release - but it is still more or less coherent. Lang's sophisticated use of montage and his introduction of German Expressionism to the mainstream mean that this is a film more memorable for its individual sequences than the sum of its parts - but those sequences are amongst the most amazing in film history.Is it a great film? In my opinion, it is - but with one caveat: BE SURE TO WATCH A DECENT VERSION OF THIS FILM. I can't emphasise how important this is; for many viewers it's the difference between loving the film and hating it. Many versions circulating today on home video are terrible. The original German cut of the film was 90 minutes long - some versions available today are as much as 157 minutes! This doesn't necessarily mean there's more material - the film's just been transfered at the wrong speed, resulting in a deadly dull film with no pace that seems to go forever. The 1984 restoration, a fairly short but cohesive cut with a modern soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder is your best bet, especially if you aren't familiar with silent film."
cat_ranchero,"Nov 21, 2012",10/10,"All the performances are excellent but I will give particular praise to Brigitte Helm, who actually plays five parts in this film. For me, it was the opposites of Maria that she plays with such skill; at one point she's caring and understanding; the next, inciting a riot! Quite hard to get across without any sound. The look and feel of the film is just outstanding, given when it was made it is a tremendous achievement! The film also proves that special effects are nothing new; just look at the robot transformation scene and tell me that would have been easy to do in 1927! On the down side it does get a little too melodramatic (for my tastes) in places, but that's only a minor glitch in what is without doubt and outstanding piece of work.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 9.6/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

First off, I am not really a fan of science fiction films, but I must say that this movie a must see. Lang did a fabulous job at filming this movie and really had me thinking about the negative views of technology that we fail to see. It is scary how this movie was shot in 1927 because it really captures the haunting effects that technology has over society that we failed to see. Although Fritz Lang is a bit over dramatic on his view of technology doesn't mean he wasn't right about his predictions. The workers through out the film are portrayed as lifeless machines that are forced to work countless hours without breaks. I thought this was interesting because it portrays our society today. With the number of innovations that exist today, we are forced to become available at all times, no matter where we are. The shots and angles that Lang uses are stunning. The machines and special effects are also very effective at portraying technology as a monster. Brigitte Helm did a fantastic job at playing Maria and the robot. The use of light and shadows are also perfectly placed throughout a number of scenes. A perfect example of this use was when Rotwang follows behind Maria. Lang did a fantastic job with this scene. It has me sitting at the edge of my seat. Again, this was one of my favorite science fiction movies by far. I am generally not too fond of silent films either, but Lang did a great job at capturing my attention. I definitely think that Metropolis is a film that everyone must see. I still can't believe it was shot during the 1920's. It is haunting and makes us think twice about technology and its effect on society."
thinbeach,"Dec 6, 2015",2/10,"I saw the extended version, where newfound bits of very grainy footage are inserted into the fine print version most are familiar with. I'm told by those who have seen both it helps to make a film that wasn't always easy to follow, easy to follow. And it's true, I had no difficulty following the story, but so incredibly long winded was it that I felt it was at least half an hour too long, which is the approximate amount of time the new footage accounts for - so my advice would definitely be to see the shorter version, no matter what confusion it brings.Brigitte Helm gives a quality performance, the visuals are of course stunning and creative, while the metaphor of people carrying out remedial, hard working jobs in order to serve the wealthy elite who rule them is very apt still to this day. Countering that, the politics are really thin, the plot is silly, crudely constructed, and with the cheesiest of endings. Even director Fritz Lang didn't like it, which is saying something."
TheUnholyPeanut,"Apr 21, 2023",9/10,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis is a landmark film that not only revolutionized the science fiction genre but also served as a powerful sociopolitical critique of the social and political systems that defined the world in the early 20th century. Drawing from a wide range of philosophical and social theories, Lang created a cinematic masterpiece that is as relevant today as it was upon its release in 1927. With its striking cinematography, intricate set design, and powerful leftist themes, Metropolis stands as a testament to the enduring power of cinema.The film takes place in a dystopian future where the city of Metropolis is divided into two classes: the wealthy ruling class and the oppressed working class who labor in the city's factories. The narrative follows the story of Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), the son of the city's ruler, as he becomes aware of the harsh realities of the working class and the exploitation they face. With the help of Maria (Brigitte Helm), a working-class prophet, Freder seeks to bridge the gap between the two classes and bring about a new social order.Metropolis was heavily influenced by the artistic movement of German Expressionism, which emphasized the use of distorted angles, intricate set design, and contrasting light and shadow to create a sense of unease and disorientation. Lang employed these techniques to great effect in Metropolis, creating a visually stunning film that captures the industrialist and dystopian themes of the narrative. The film's iconic imagery, such as the towering skyscrapers and the haunting robot Maria, has become ingrained in the cultural imagination and remains a testament to Lang's visionary approach to filmmaking.The film's narrative and characters are intricately woven into the social and political context of the time. Lang's Marxist beliefs are evident throughout the film, with the narrative serving as a critique of the capitalist systems that defined the early 20th century. The division between the ruling and working classes is starkly portrayed, with the workers shown as mindless drones whose labor is exploited by the wealthy elite. The character of Maria serves as a revolutionary figure, advocating for a new social order where the workers are not merely cogs in a machine but valued members of society. The characters are incredibly nuanced and well-written, going through character arcs and development and having poignant and complex moral solutions. I love Rotwang, as he is well-written, tragic, and his story is incredibly poignant. Freder's father, Joh, is another great character.Despite the film being silent, you can see how much emotion, heart and soul the characters put into their body and face expressions. These incredibly huge, bold emotions like fear, love, nostalgia, happiness, and the anger of the masses culminate in a greatly acted work. The German Expressionist movement help influenced these incredibly powerful emotions.The film's political and philosophical themes are complex and nuanced, reflecting Lang's deep engagement with Marxist theory and socialist thought. The film explores the tension between individualism and collectivism, highlighting the ways in which the capitalist system values profit over human life and dignity. Lang's vision of a new social order, where the workers are empowered and valued members of society, is a powerful call to action that remains relevant to this day.The film's music, composed by Gottfried Huppertz, is a haunting and evocative score that perfectly complements the film's visual and narrative elements. The music underscores the emotional intensity of the film, emphasizing the characters' struggles and the dystopian landscape of Metropolis. The use of music to convey the film's themes and emotions is a testament to Lang's masterful direction and Huppertz's skill as a composer.The film's influence on science fiction cannot be understated. It popularized the ideas of huge, ""Utopian"" cities which is reflected in other art pieces like Brave New World, 1984, Bioshock, and much more. The special effects Lang uses are timeless to this day, they used miniatures of the city and even a specifically made mirror to create the illusion of actors interacting with these huge sets.In conclusion, Fritz Lang's Metropolis is a cinematic masterpiece that expertly weaves complex social and political themes into its narrative. The film's striking visuals, intricate set design, and powerful leftist themes all contribute to its enduring impact and relevance. Lang's vision of a new social order, where workers are empowered and valued members of society, remains a powerful call to action that resonates to this day. Metropolis is a testament to the enduring power of cinema and a must-see for anyone interested in the history of film and the power of art to inspire social change."
mabean,"Mar 23, 1999",9/10,"That doesn't mean that Godzilla is a good movie (I know this is about Metropolis;not that crap '98 movie) but what I mean is that how can a man make a film almost three quarters of a century ago and still blow a $100 Million movie out of the water in almost every department and not just that ""Epic"" but many other modern films are not a patch on this 20th Century masterpiece. I saw it a few years ago late one night and thought ""that's alright"" but never really apreciated it until I bought the video which I now understand to be one of many edits (84 mins from 1991) but I am very happy with this version of Fritz Langs classic and EVERYONE should see this for the drama, the tension and excitement that is METROPOLIS!"
Red-Barracuda,"Sep 17, 2010",8/10,"Metropolis has just been re-released in a brand new expanded version that includes material just re-discovered in 2008. The new material has been edited into the film and constitutes many new shots and sections, ranging from the very brief to whole new plot strands. This new material is unsurprisingly not in the greatest condition seeing as its been sitting around in a can for eighty years, so it's entirely obvious where it's been added to the final film. It's grainy and old looking, unlike the rest of the film which frankly looks pristine. However, this new material is an excellent find and a fine addition to the final movie and really adds to the film hugely.Seeing the film again on the big screen is always nice. Metropolis remains a towering cinematic achievement. It stands alone in the silent era, as there really isn't anything else like it. It would be another forty years before the science fiction genre had another film of anything like the same scale and ambition (2001: A Space Odyssey). The sheer imagination and artistry are what set it apart and give it its classic status. It's not a movie without faults - it does flag at times due to its long running time – but its vision cannot be denied. From the imaginative model work, the enormous sets, the hundreds of extras, the iconic female android, the delirious dream sequence and the epic destruction scenes at the finale. Metropolis is full of quite incredible moments. It also has a social message of sorts, in it's asking for understanding between the worker class and the rulers of a society. Some of my favourite scenes involve the evil Maria android leading the denizens of Metropolis astray. Of the new material, my favourite addition is the Thin Man, a devilish character who wears a black Panama hat and leather gloves – he can best be described as an evil Man from Del Monte – he's such a great addition to the new expanded version.Metropolis is not always an entertaining watch and some viewers may very well find it a drag. This is perhaps inevitable in a silent film of this length. However, if you are an intrepid cinema-goer then it is well worth your time seeing this Fritz Lang classic. It truly is a monumentally important film."
stressut,"Sep 15, 2006",9/10,"This movie has a very social context that is timeless. There is an above ground city in which people enjoy modern carefree living; the underground city the people do not see daylight and work like slaves for the above ground city. There is no middle-class; there is only wealthy and workers. The classes do not mix. We in America are headed into large separation of the classes which I believe is due to personal debt, and companies that profit from the poor such as ""rent to own"" and ""check into cash"" which charges sometimes in excess of 30% interest rate. I find this movie on the same scale as HG WEll's ""1984"" and Huxley's ""Brave New World""."
Shanewhelan-630-865371,"Jan 26, 2016",10/10,"Easily one of the greatest dystopian films ever made. Metropolis is an inspirational film, and carries such importance for the world today. Fritz Lang is a personal hero of mine, and this film began my love for film and my chosen career path of becoming a writer. I cannot fault this film save for the difficulty in getting an original cut, since there had been some lost footage, re-found and so on. It kind of makes you feel like you've not seen the truest version every time you watch it. Despite this, there is no doubt that Metropolis has inspired a variance of filmmakers and writers in modern times. If you haven't seen this yet, make time for it."
StuOz,"Dec 17, 2004",N/A,"Early science fiction about a wonderful city of the future.The first 30 minutes of this movie is outstanding, the New York look of the city, the workers down below and then the switch to rich father and son up top, and that highly memorable scene where the son goes down below to switch lives with that of a big clock (or whatever it is?) worker. These 30 minutes are all scored with wonderful grand music. It just makes you feel good and it is the birth of screen sci-fi. But then it becomes something else!The female robot (""The Machine Man"") storyline and everything else going on just does not hold my interest, sorry. However, the final frames of the movie return to the greatness of the first 30 minutes.I was born decades after this film was made and this silent genre of film is new to me, I am sure that I have missed out on a lot of the deep meanings of this film. But, still, I really got something out of the early parts."
Leofwine_draca,"Sep 23, 2016",7/10,"METROPOLIS is perhaps the most famous film in German director Fritz Lang's long career and it's certainly an iconic movie. Who can forget the sight of the mad scientist bringing his machine to life and giving it the body of Brigitte Helm? The film as a whole is iconic and hugely influential in its depiction of a dystopian future, but what's most interesting is just how many genres are packed into one film.Don't let the lengthy running time put you off: this is one of those fast-paced epics in which you lose track of time and forget the minutes stretching out. It's a little slow to start off as it carefully depicts a futuristic world with some great surrealist moments - Freder's vision of the terrifying Moloch is straight from Bosch and completely fascinating. Later, the film draws in romance, Frankenstein-style scientific experiments and apparatus, adventure and derring-do against a master villain, and even a disaster film.The special effects are doubtlessly dated but still look absolutely great to this viewer, particularly the futuristic city set and the destructive scenes in the second half. Helm gives a tour de force performance in a dual role. Lang remembers to give his film a human heart, which is the crucial thing about it, making it accessible even to viewers watching some ninety years later."
carolv_brady,"Nov 27, 2020",10/10,"I was put off watching this for ages after hearing that it was boring. I am so glad I decided to see for myself. The cinematography and storytelling, special effects and casting are stunning. This has become one of my favourite films."
filmalamosa,"Nov 22, 2012",1/10,I would have given this movie more stars if it had been appropriately cut and the music eliminated or toned way back. (Probably something akin to what was originally released in 1927.) About 30 minutes into it I muted the sound and started to fast forward on the lower speeds so you could still read the titles. This turned a complete torture into something more enjoyable (it is still boring). It also turned 153 minutes into about 53 minutes. The elaborate sets and choreography were riveting I guess is a good word. As another viewer put it unforgettable visuals.The story = a quasi Frankenstein robot labour rights religious mêlée is a theme that didn't age well to our times. I especially am bored by class struggle dystopias. And that was the central element of this one.9.3 stars... I have to laugh there. Especially if you watched it with the sound blasting and the glacial pace of the action. Must be the kind of people who can sit through all day language classes.I would like now to compare it to other big productions of the time to see how the sets stack up. The ones in this movie were artistic and first class.

nholder93,"Dec 25, 2010",10/10,"In 1927, Lang's Metropolis was released. Despite being the most expensive silent film made up to that point, it was a commercial and critical failure. Now after being partly restored, audiences can finally enjoy this beautiful film. However, this film may be a bit of a challenge for common audiences. It's hard to fully appreciate the significance of the film without having seen movies made before it. For those who love silent films, this one won't disappoint. The movie is set in a futuristic utopia that is powered by underground workers. After the city's founder's son, Freder, stumbles upon the underground city, he is determined to alleviate the worker's plight. This bizarre reworking of Marxist ideology turns into a beautiful story of cooperation and peace between social classes. Yes, it's sentimental and like all silent films the acting is melodramatic but it also has a special relevance to today's audiences. It's majestic score serves as the pulse of the rapidly moving film. For those who haven't seen it, it won't leave you disappointed."
whatamook,"May 8, 2003",N/A,"I saw this movie on TCM a few days ago. It was astounding! Fritz Lang's direction is so great! I really enjoyed it. Although it was a silent movie, it looked like an early talkie. On the print I saw, Robert Osbourne (the host of the network), said that many of the footage was compiled from archives around the world and digitally remastered and restored to what the audience at the world premiere in Germany might have saw way back in 1927. The musical score was also very fresh and beautiful. I truly recommend that you see this movie! 10/10!"
michaelarmer,"Feb 24, 2020",6/10,"You can't judge a film from 1927 against a film from 2017, they are from vastly different era's and vastly different film-making qualities, and this film is nearing its centenary!I have been looking at old movies, some really old, well the better ones anyway, the ones that are rated highly, just to see what all the fuss is about. Some I have rated highly myself but some were a bit of a let down, this one is somewhere between.I think it is Ok, visionary certainly, and the future it depicts is not much different from cities we live in today. But the acting in it is not acting, it is just people doing something being filmed with the special effects they had in those days, the quality of film does not help, the one I watched was a restored version, and its very well done. Fritz Lang certainly had an eye for the image he wanted people to see, so it worked to that extent.But I don't think it is as great as most people seem to think, just good and interesting to see how they made films in that period."
kinsmed,"Jul 22, 2004",7/10,"Set in a faltering Utopia, the governor's son, Freder, is drawn to seek out the underpinnings of his existence. He descends into an abysmal underworld of man-eating machinery that is nearly indistinguishable from his fevered hallucinations.Despite the film's hyper-drama and viciously precise arm movement, it is a riveting study that compellingly mirrors the French Revolution and yet eerily foretells the rise of Fascism. It invokes distinctly Germanic art styles as we see Freder become a black-uniformed living transistor, fully 20 years before transistors were invented.No movement, no lighting change is extemporaneous; in legendary Teutonic vision, every frame is set exactly as it must be. As an example of the film's relentless angst, the governor, Joh Fredersen, beholds his son breathtakingly idolizing a Joan of Arc character, Maria, to the revolutionary strains of La Marseillaise. Maria's gaze is mesmerizing.To regain his son and control a worker's revolt, the governor beseeches an old nemesis to turn the first robot into a Maria automaton, but a Lorelei-type emissary. Joh's desperation is Freder's undoing and, later, his own. As the great city begins to hemorrhage, a fight for the future of the republic ensues.It will be impossible not to see Metropolis' incomparable flavor within dozens of other movies, not the least- George Lucas' entire Star Wars saga.Despite issues inherent to early movies and having lost a large portion of its substance to fledgling Hollywood meddling, Metropolis is the watershed cinematic experience that every dedicated film-maker must acknowledge."
EAT Alex,"Oct 3, 1999",5/10,"It's interesting to analyze what the legendary reputation of Metropolis is based on. Just look at it. What we have here, is a stiff, unintentionally comic and naive picture. The ridiculous gestures of the actors and the stupid texts written by Thea von Harbou would make Metropolis -released in 1927- the camp classic of the century if it weren't visually so damn magnificent. Director Fritz Lang definitely knew the secret of creating unforgettable images. The events of the film take place in the future, somewhere around the year we are living now. Lang tells a story of huge town called Metropolis. The designers of the town live in beautiful skyscrapers, have money and amusements. The ""hands"" of the town live in the heat underground, each man working ten hours a day. Metropolis is as must see, ""because its has inspired directors like Ridley Scott and James Cameron, and films like Blade Runner, The Terminator..."" Just don't expect this silent Lang picture to be something overwhelming -like Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin (1925)."
athleticz20022000,"Jul 26, 2006",9/10,"Fritz Lang's masterpiece, and one of the most influential of all films, ""Metropolis"" is a stunning portrait of a futuristic city. With the look later adopted by ""Minority Report"", ""I, Robot"", and practically everything of the sort, Metropolis is ruled by Joh Fredersen, whose son Freder enjoys the privileged life of the Club of the Sons and the entertainment district, among other things. One day, Freder ventures into the area of the machines, where workers are forced to work grueling ten hour shifts before returning to their small, overpopulated city, which by the way is underground, away from the privileged. The only thing keeping the workers from revolting is Maria, a young woman who preaches a mediator who will serve as the ""heart"" between the head and the hands. Freder becomes this mediator, although it is not without a serious threat to the entire city from Rotwang, a maniacal inventor who plans to destroy Metropolis. Full of biblical allusions such as the Tower of Babel, ""Metropolis"" sets the precedent for all science fiction. The ""Matrix"" trilogy is a perfect example of something that owes its existence to ""Metropolis"". The visuals are absolutely stunning when one considers that this was made 80 years ago. With these visuals and a great story, even someone who doesn't much care for silent cinema will find ""Metropolis"" worth watching."
johnnyboyz,"May 22, 2013",8/10,"At a time when cinema was still growing out of its foundations and into something more resembling an art form, complete with narratives and character depiction, Metropolis strikes us as a proverbial God-send. The attitudes of the time saw cinema attempt to push on from what usually consisted of meagre genres films often limited to ""trick"" or ""chase"" films, a push already synonymous with the desire to move away from early actualities designed to show off off this new invention they call ""moving images"". Both French and American film-makers were putting in the hard yards in this respect, but this silent effort from 1927 distinguished itself even further. Descending from Germany, and made by a director who was already turning heads in his ability to combine adventure with spectacle, here was somebody building on what had preceded the project only to end up combining character and story with genre on top of visual appeal and a socio-political undertone. The result is Metropolis.The film is a drama depicting form of class distinction, but told through the means of expressionist horror; a film with an agenda to depict the rich and the poor living less so in harmony as much as they do entirely ignorant of one another. It's a film about the perils of dividing a population based on their class and income; a film about how redundancy can lead to suicide and how those at the top really are, at the worst of times, fatuous capitalist-infused businesspersons who don't at all mind if a few hundred suffer if it means they themselves grow richer. What the film is about is the belief that two very specific, very segregated groups of people can live in such close proximity with another without tension or non-harmony - what it depicts is the bubbling up of an anger felt by one of these groups, the 'lesser' of the two, to an extent whereby it explodes. Tossed in for good measure is a young man from the 'right' side of the tracks whose love for a young woman based where he may not tread is depicted. Where Lang tackles class way back in the 1920s, it is not difficult to substitute said item for race and translate it to the modern day; a pseudo-belief that racial pockets of whites and various others can congregate in peace with one another as those at the very top grow rich off a lot of suffering. Certain Internet sources speak of remakes and such that have always been in the pipeline – perhaps, thematically, the race card at such a time is the ticket in.Gustav Fröhlich plays Freder, the closest we have to a kind of protagonist. A young man, Freder lives on the surface of planet Earth in a futuristic city at some point in the then-distant future. Freder is handsome and athletic, a sprinter who has a wide circle of fellow athletes whom he calls friends. Running around the track so as to keep in shape, living out days in lush gardens and enjoying the company of equally attractive young woman to an upbeat and radiant visual sensibility, young Freder has it made. All of this is of course possible through the enormous wealth of his father Joh (Abel), the very man responsible for cutting a divide between those on the surface and those who live and work below and getting rich as a result of it. Then there are those people below, a disconsolate bunch who wade on into a workplace everyday charged with pumping the pistons and hitting all the right buttons at all the right times less the titular Metropolis above lose all its flash and power.Below in this Hellish zone is Maria (Helm), a woman who snuck above to the surface on the one day Freder was in the vicinity; immediately captured by her good looks, on top of the fact she seems to slink back below to whence she came, Freder follows her down and the reality of why he's been living so well with his father pulling the strings hits him. In terms of basic set up, anything in the early portions of Metropolis is able to rival the best of what has been made in a post-Classical; post-sound era of cinema that transcends nations and languages. There is a distinction between lead role, supporting act and everybody else; character traits are established and a world for the characters within which the adventure may play out is constructed. At a time when, a mere eight years earlier, the likes of D.W. Griffith was producing Broken Blossoms with a keenness to blend the old guard of superfluous actuality in his montages of market places and public streets with grittier and harder content that involved fictional characters, Metropolis is a concentrated and elegant depiction of what needs to be established.However, the film is not necessarily committed to depicting a love story as much as it is a tale of what eventually cascades into full-on warfare between the divided masses. Opening theory gives way to a middle game built on spectacle and relationship dramas tangled up between Joh and his assistants; Freder with Maria and a whole lot of both industrial guilt and fury involving the many beneath the surface whose conditions push them to revolt. The spectacle underground is ugly and cragged, that of above the surface polished and uncanny; machines work, but they do so with a behavioural repetition designed to have us feel uneasy. Later on, both the sex and curiosity that dominated the opening in Freder's following of Maria will combine into a living entity; this will be a robotic incarnation of Maria that is introduced. Historically, one cannot deny the film its standing; as a piece of standalone cinema, we are captured by its plot and the people therein – as something which begs the question as to whether it should be seen, the answer is ""of course""."
bojleng_utomo,"Sep 27, 2012",8/10,"The purpose of development should be none other than to the betterment of people. So it must be strange if mankind look up to civilization as something higher than themselves. If (physical) progress is superlative, and men are mere contributory factors of production--and a very expendable factor, for that matter (brought to existence to be used up as fuels so that some divine machine can keep running).This movie proposes a critical look at the ever ironical industrialized society's attitude toward the so-called modern life: Developed as we might be, our world is constrained--delusional, no matter what social class we are in. That no matter how industrious we are, without compassion and spontaneity, we're just like an army of robots--humanoids without will that incapable of sensing happiness.There are a bunch of reasons why this movie deserves respect. Like, the idea is so insightful as well as foresighted, way beyond its time (released in 1927--a couple of years before the Black Tuesday of 1929, many people consider this movie silly). Or, its daring approach in combining the common visual language with drastic symbolic images (this time, two years preceding the destructive style of Buñuel's ""Un Chien Andalou""). And surely, its elegant and ingenious futuristic visualizations that strengthen the points yet never strays from the substance.One of the most important film ever made."
fredrikgunerius,"May 17, 2023",10/10,"One of film history's earliest triumphs in visual effects and production design, Metropolis still looks and feels magnificent even after a century of ageing. Fritz Lang deployed a record-breaking budget and avant-garde use of miniatures and special effects, most notably the Schüfftan process, in order to create the illusory, dreamlike sci-fi world of Metropolis - a futuristic city in which the division between the lowly workers and the sophisticated upper class has grown to dangerous, tyrannical proportions. We follow the young and idealistic Freder (Gustav Frölich), son of the city's oppressive master, in his search for the truth about his father's reign - and a more substantial meaning to life than idling away at various sheltered past-times. The clash between the privileged and the poor is inevitable in this epic. Still, Lang's depiction of it, and of the film's dystopian society, remains multifaceted, relevant and remarkably universal. The fact that Metropolis was so prophetic for what was to happen in Germany about a decade later is more a confirmation of the timeless validity of Lang and his screenwriter Thea von Harbou's story; a reminder that a totalitarian rule is only ever a complacent society away. Despite this, there is a sentimental optimism to Metropolis which infuses the silent moments and makes it a remarkably satisfying watch in addition to all the impressive extravaganza. One of the most influential, monumental and aesthetically flawless pictures of all time."
funsterdad,"Nov 7, 2017",10/10,"On so many levels, this film is truly brilliant! An early achievement in SF, an epic of epic length prior to the days before sound, ""Metropolis"" must have been found by its German viewers as provocative, to say the least. Now it can be viewed for that in historical terms, given a subplot with its communist overtones and its religious symbolism. The special effects used in this magnificent piece of cinema were way ahead of their time, as was the prophetic message. ""Metropolis"" is an absolute must-see for the student of film and for anyone else interested in film history and culture!"
yj20022002,"Jul 24, 2011",10/10,"I have never been a fan of silent films. But when I heard about the 2010 Kino restoration and read the plot, I became intrigued. This is one the best films I have ever seen, in the silent or any film genre. It is groundbreaking, and is the precursor to Star Wars, Blade Runner, 2001, The Fifth Element, etc. The world's only epic silent film. The story is really good- the uber-rich planners and the dirt-poor workers and the city leader's son who seeks to end the tyranny. The film is gripping, and even moving. The film's message resonates with viewers of all ages, and it's prophetic view of the potential of unchecked future societies is one we must all be aware of. Especially when you consider that Adolf Hitler used this film as inspiration for his horrific attempt at a global dictatorship and racial sterilization. The effects are ahead of their time. No one got more out of what was available to him than Lang in this film. I can not imagine how anyone enjoyed this film in any of it's previous versions. It is a timeless classic that will continue to be relevant for decades to come. Any future remake will be spectacular visually, but it will look typical for our time. Simply magnificent."
roxie_blues,"Jan 16, 2003",6/10,"Don't get me wrong, I love films and all that, and I can understand completely how this movie would be great to the older people who were around during the time this came out.  We watched this is my film studies class yesterday and I felt like I was being punished for something (like in A Clockwork Orange).  Maybe I feel this way because I'm young or because I'm not used to two hour films with no sound.  It's great that there is a movie that so many people like.  I've never seen a list of comments for any movie that didn't have at least ONE negative comment, until I looked up this one! I'm not being negative or criticizing anyone..I just thought it was the most boring thing I've ever had to watch.  This is a movie that would be great for a collection or something but I doubt I would or could ever watch it again."
gbill-74877,"May 9, 2016",9/10,"'Metropolis' grabs you from the start, with highly stylized visions of the future and a brilliant score. It is very artistic, well ahead of its time in its filmmaking, and as is the case with a lot of science fiction, was also making commentary about life in the present.In the future, Lang says, despite many advances in technology, there are still people who subjugate and rule over others, and there is still a working class which may turn into an unruly mob. It's hard not to see the issues of today and the growing income gap in these groups! Those who control Metropolis live in a lofty utopia, while those who operate its machines live in its depths. Who can forget Lang's images of their dehumanization as they go to work, and then, almost as machines themselves, control the elaborate system of dials? Those are some truly wonderful scenes, and Lang also gives us a fantastic robot (a ""machine-man""), shots of air and car traffic in the future, and a skeleton representing death playing the flute, waiving a scythe, and causing the statues of the seven deadly sin to slowly advance. He also effectively uses large numbers of people to swarm the set at times to emphasize the grand scale of it all.Alfred Abel is very good as the cool, calculating, and cruel Joh Fredersen, one of the rulers, and Gustav Fröhlich is reasonably good as his son, who empathizes with the workers. Those who rule are the 'head' of humanity, those who are ruled are the 'hands', and Lang's point is that both sides must remember kindness, and be mediated by the 'heart'. Indeed.The acting is beyond over-the-top in places (particularly Brigitte Helm), the middle of the film drags a bit and could have been pared down, and Lang hits us over the head with his final message – and yet the film's ambition and artistry really stand out, particularly for the period in which it was made, and it is well worthy of its reputation as a classic."
felixokelly1,"Dec 3, 2012",10/10,"This film is delightful. Fritz Lang may have disliked this, possibly due to Nazi love of the film, but in the present day it truly is one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. The film has one of the most famous robots in all sci-fi, who has become one of the most famous images of the film. Much of the film may have been lost and there have been problems with restoration, but even though I saw the film years ago when much was still missing I still loved it. The ideas of class division may still be relevant in 2026, there can still be great inequality even in the most powerful nations and there are attempts to bring them together. If you think the film is a cliché, remember this established many of the clichés, such as the mad scientist with wild hair and the robot hand. There is basis in H.G Wells and older works, but the way this film is brought together makes it a still enjoyable work out of its own century."
Chaves7777,"Dec 20, 2006",10/10,"I just have watched two movies of Fritz Lang. The wonderful ""M"" and "" Metropolis"". I think, ""Metropolis"" is one of the best movies about the love and hate of the human being. With one of the most futuristic views that influences much of our view of future, ""Metropolis"" are powerful. The plot is good combination of science fiction, romance and suspense.Much people think that the silent films are boring. But i know that people can be surprised with this film. Well, after all, you have to see the time where the movies was realized... this is incredible. I love this film for many reasons, first: the cast, second: the music (i don't know you, but the score that i hear in the version i see was of another world), three: the plot is magnificent, a thing that much of those famous films of today don't have: a good message. The movie, in a futuristic way, talk us about how we worry for things without importance like the people we love. The movie has thrills, scare moments and good performances. Without a doubt, ""Metropolis"" is a film that you never forget, because is in your heart. Until those beautiful symptoms it can cause you that movie.*Sorry for the mistake... well, if there any"
Kubris,"Feb 28, 2012",9/10,"IMDb Top 250: 94It's difficult to glow about a silent film because no matter what anyone says about them, they are outdated. That being said Metropolis is an absolute gem, a masterpiece of the era, and in my opinion the best silent film ever made.Everything ties together really tightly. The plot, genre and themes go hand in hand and it's hard to break discuss them separately without touching on the other aspects. I'll start with the plot- it's genius. In a society where the rich live in luxury and the poor are their slaves, the son of the mastermind falls in love with a worker and drama ensures, centering around the idea that the two classes must be united. There's more to it than that but that summary tells you enough. While great in concept, the film isn't as strong in execution. The first half is really drawn out, and after a very serious opening the film slows dramatically. However, about midway as the Machine Man is taking its human appearance, there seems to be a dramatic change, and from then to the end is a near perfect film. The film gets tighter and tenser right to the end, with a great big finale. There are three acts, and the last one, 'Furioso' is some of the best film ever, silent or not.Now onto genre: sci-fi. By spending 5 minutes on the Internet you can see that everyone glows about how Metropolis is 'the greatest sci-fi ever'. As I said in my summary, Lang wins the sci-fi guessing game. His 2000 is incredibly close to what actually happened, his vision is what we live in now, and today we have even more. And this was all thought up in 1927! It's a very fair statement to call this the father of science fiction films. The city has planes, highways and skyscrapers. There are even small things you may not notice because of how common they are today, living in Lang's envisioned utopia, like picture phones. I totally missed that.But a great concept needs to look convincing, and for what was available Metropolis is really believable. The sets are grand, the buildings very realistic. It looks like a real city! There are effects that seem inexplicable. One really cool part involves flooding and destruction, and with a mix of models, grand sets and movie magic, it's scarily plausible.Metropolis is more than a futuristic story: it carries some heavy messages, relevant then and still today. Lang said the message was to unite Communist and Socialist movements in Germany at the time, through the metaphor of the societies. (This justifies the ending, because showing what happened after the action wasn't important). That message can be carried to modern... everything. There has to be a middle, or at least communication between those who think and those who do. It can even be applied to the film industry. Most films can be understood by the masses, but this isn't one. It's layered and symbolic, and I can't explain some of the symbols like Death and the Seven Sins,with the book.A point of discussion is Lang's handling of each class. With the message of unity, he couldn't let the workers be totally oppressed and the rich being tyrants. So a compromise seemed to have been made: it can be assumed that the rich are ignorant to the workers' plight, and the workers have a mob mentality: their emotions overrule common sense, shown by their restless action and the leaving of their children- something the surface dwellers wouldn't do. Lang's point must've been that despite a joined society being important. neither side was especially favourable. It's amazing how this is all under the facade of a sci-fi film.I don't believe in overacting in silent films, because emotions need to be conveyed without sound. With this belief, Freder is played exceptionally well: being subtle is not in his repertoire. He is smitten by love and torn by the discovery of the rift in society. He jumps from extreme to extreme, and has really strange dreams. What is Moloch? Maria is the star though- on one hand she is wholesome and peaceful, but also plays a sensual and chaotic being. She's shockingly diverse, and delivers the most nudity I've seen in a silent film. Joh is good, but not as fleshed out as could be. A few answers about his character could've made the film even more morally grey. Rothway is really creepy.Here's something I learned from the IMDb: The Nazi party loved this film so much, Hitler included, that Fritz Lang, a Jewish man, was given a 'pass' when they gained power, and fled to America. A different source had Lang meeting Joseph Goebbels, who was impressed by Metropolis, and offered Lang a job, but Lang escaped anyway. I just found this fascinating.Time has been good to Metropolis; today you can see a remarkably high quality version, nearly in its original form. This is a deserving treatment for one of the most important and influential films ever. Echoes of Metropolis can be seen everywhere, even in something like Fight Club. Here is a perfect mash of artistic, technical and creativity that will have an exceptionally rewarding second viewing to try and piece together the recurring elements. With its brilliant predictions, concept and messages, Metropolis is a must see silent film. 9.0/10"
fraew,"Aug 21, 2002",9/10,"What an epic classic! - everything that has been said about this film is true! An absolute visual masterpiece, completely original and thoroughly stunning considering its 1927 release date. Bridgette Helm is fabulous as Maria. Bit of a plodding pace though (theres a great amount of time between each moment of the limited, printed dialogue), and the print I've seen had a TERRIBLE, inappropriate soundtrack - which I subsequently replaced with Kraftwerk's 'Trans-Europe Express', 'Man Machine' and the Flaming Lips 'Soft Bulletin' for some compelling audio-accompaniment."
marconocera,"Mar 31, 2024",8/10,"It's very impressive how a centenary film looks forward for society damages... it kicks so hard!I always watch this movie and its referenced new works, but noone still be able to replicate this masterpiece in the same way.It's necessary to think realistic and and take inspiration from ""Metropolis"" for a great work, without any strange effect, but only essential narration with a raw sincerity (and maybe hurting truth) that only ""ancient"" movies have been able to do, with few and poor technologies, but vivid imagination and genious brains, with real studies about life and no algorithmic statistics.So, ""Metropolis"" deserves to be carried forward as a successful cinematic reference for our lives."
futures-1,"Mar 21, 2006",N/A,"""Metropolis"" (1926): I've seen this version twice in the last year. This is the newest (2002), further restored (by the Murnau Foundation, 124 minutes!), silent version of the once-lost masterpiece by Fritz Lang, and my first viewing. There have been TWO major restorations: the Giorgio Moroder version (listed above), which I really enjoy, including it's 80's rock-n-roll (!) music tracks and occasional ""hand"" coloring in small areas, and, this newer one which extends the movie length (although approximately 25% is still missing from Lang's original work). NOW the missing parts, due to script discoveries, are indicated in black-frame text descriptions, and, since the original orchestral score is now known, it has been recreated, recorded, and fit to the film as well. Fritz MUST HAVE belonged to either the Socialist or Communist Party at the time. The film is a hardly disguised propaganda piece for the Heads (wealthy bosses), and Hands (anonymous workers), to come together with the aid of the Hearts (union mediators). You MUST approach this film with an attitude different than that which you use for contemporary films: the acting is way over the top, as silent films took their queues from the theater; the music is heavy and dramatic (Germanic); the symbolism straight from the Bible, ultra-Moderne fashions, and political thinking of 1920's Europe; not to mention bits and pieces of ""Frankenstein"" (pun intended), ""Nosferatu"", ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"", a harbinger of ""King Kong"", plus many influences by German Expressionist visual art of the period. The more you know about German history of that time, the more you see how significant ""Metropolis"" would have been to that viewing public (not to mention sexy, cutting edge, and prophetic). Hitler was still a small time crook in 1926, but the old German empire was crumbling under it's own weight, and Fate awaited Adolph. The Time was Ripe, indeed. I ADORE Brigitte Helm, the actress who plays both a Madonna-like, inspirational spokeswoman for the masses, AND the evil temptress robot, programmed to infiltrate the masses - for the purpose of destabilizing the union movement. Her body and facial movements are SO enjoyable in their exaggerated, Art Deco/Expressionist way, and, at least for ME, somehow V V VEEERRRRY seductive... She also loves to grab her breasts during emotional moments. Watch her one eyelid drop, when she's the robot woman. Watch her eyes become like Bambi's Mom, when she's the Madonna. The sets are so modern, so hip and stylish, I can barely stand it. Within the context of IT'S time, perhaps only ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" matches its vast inspiration for depicting the future. Remember: ""Metropolis"" was made BEFORE skyscrapers  and that includes the Chrysler and Empire State buildings in N.Y.C.. There were NO multi-layered overpasses, air transports within cities, etc.. Are the characters simplistic? Yes. Is the story fairly obvious? I think so. Does that detract? No! It IS a Masterpiece, and WILL impress you, unless you have no sense of historical perspective...THAT you probably need, or you might think the entire film just ""hokey"". Your loss."
Quicksand,"Dec 24, 2002",10/10,"I recently experienced the divine pleasure of watching the restored print of this film, on the big screen.  It is simply without equal.The imagery is beautiful.  The choice of actors is spot-on.  The production design, the cinematography... all spectacular, even by today's standards. To be able to tell a story without relying on dialogue is something truly magnificent indeed... you don't believe that, try watching MTV for any music video with a story to it.  And if you manage to find one, it's still only 4 minutes long.This is Lang's masterpiece, I think I even like it better than ""M,"" which is also, by the way, flawless.  For me, it still tells the story of the society in which I live, even 75 years after its first release.Hopefully, we can all learn something from Lang's vision.  Hopefully, this film will never be forgotten again.  11/10, really."
Rotwang-4,"Sep 9, 1998",7/10,"If today, the 1926 futuristic vision does appear a bit dated, it's still staggering.Often criticized because of it's ""stupid"" plot, the original plot was censored and butchered to make it more acceptable for audiences.I still marvel at the impressive art-deco lines of the robot, still unsurpassed in sheer elegance, the gigantic buildings and the geometric choreography of the masses ...And is the ending really false ? Don't we live in age where cold reasoning and the pursuit of pure profit has won over the common decency and compassion that we could call the heart ?"
marxsarx,"Feb 5, 2004",5/10,"I saw a restored version at a theater when it was released recently.  I also have seen the longer Madacy DVD version.  Both times I viewed this film, I was dreadfully bored.  It has some glimmers of greatness.  Mostly, it is just dull.  I would like to see the Kino version of Metropolis.  As it stands, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but film historians."
colinrgeorge,"Jul 29, 2010",8/10,"Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" was the first film I ever rented from Netflix. The (then) two-hour German expressionist science fiction masterpiece carried an immediate appeal for me I know not many will share. Nevertheless, I was excited at the prospect of seeing the film again, and on the big screen this summer, now 'complete' with 25 minutes of newly integrated footage uncovered in Buenos Aires in 2008.Other than that the experience was marred by a crummy digital projection, the new cut of the film is nothing short of revelatory for fans and cinephiles. The restored scenes, which were cut in 1927 following early criticism, expand the scope and breadth of the narrative, rounding out a much more human film.It's a shame so little could be done to spruce up the supplemental material. I was initially put off by just how starkly it contrasted with the clean, relatively well-preserved 35mm whole; the 16mm additions are matted along the top and left of the frame, and are so scratched that the scenes appear to exist amidst an omnipresent rainstorm. But bad as they look, their benefit to the film is undeniable. My only real objection to their inclusion is in two to three second insert or reaction shots, where splicing in the new content seems more distracting than it is productive. Largely, however, the aesthetic unpleasantries are worth the emotional payoff of a more satisfying story.The other issue is that ""Metropolis"" was already a long film, and one that isn't always easy to appreciate in a modern context. Fortunately, its narrative backbone is a simple but timeless 'workers vs. social elite' fable, and the sincere, if unchallenging, plot makes plenty of room for contemplation. It's easy to just slip into Lang's world, and though the pacing and running-time hardly render it accessible, what's really incredible about the film is how well its visuals still hold up.The towering, angular cityscapes, oppressive walls of machinery, and the now iconic ""machine man"" are stylistic triumphs that look great today and have had obvious influence on more recent science fiction/fantasy classics, from the dark metropolis of Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" to character design for ""Star Wars."" The fact that it was even possible in 1927 is as incredible as Kubrick's half-centennial ""Space Odyssey"" was for 1968. Maybe more so.It's rare and awesome that a piece of art is as ahead of its time as ""2001"" or ""Metropolis"" were. Fritz Lang's film may not be a 2010 audience-pleaser, but in its flawless realization of its world, it's every bit on par with something like ""Inception."" Lang's vision of the future is in many ways still our own, which helps account for its long shelf life. The forward-thinking design and fantastic visuals make it easy to forget that it saw release twenty years before Isaac Asimov published his compilation, ""I, Robot.""""The Complete Metropolis,"" though not completely complete, is absolutely the best way to see the film. Despite the fact that certain scenes are still (and likely always will be) missing, this is the closest its come to a definitive version. Those with a vested interest in the history of film, particularly science-fiction film, absolutely need to seek it out if they haven't already —The new cut is even worth reanalysis for those underwhelmed by the previously available version. It's a real treasure, however, for longtime fans, who'll be glad to hear the 25 extra minutes, while not pretty, substantially benefit the story. For the first time, ""Metropolis"" really breathes.However, if my unfortunate theater presentation has taught me anything, it's that Kino's home video release later this year will be the real attraction. I'll be picking up the blu-ray come November, no rental required."
mosimann,"Jul 29, 2004",10/10,"I have just recently looked at a pristine DVD remastered version of Metropolis from F. Lang. Without doubt, Mr Lang is one of the greatest directors ever. But also, what a team he had: what entrepreneurship, what wizardry and what imagination. However the plot may be a little simple, the way the film is filmed, directed, acted, edited is splendid. Furthermore, I thought the film music one of the best ""classical"" film music I have ever listened to: richness of themes, various leitmotives and a sense of drama that is exhilarating. Finaly, this film is still so potent in it's modernity. Just look how masses can be driven to their one end - even forgetting their children! Just look our the spy is everywhere: big brother is watching. Just look how the few rule the mass. Just look how religion can be so strong and powerful. And is man really man or machine? And it's not hollow or vain to believe that love can transcend anything as the mediator. I just loved it and recommend it to anyone, especially those who think that cinema is just SFX or Computer Programms. Refreshingly modern! Gave it 10!"
staticmissile,"Dec 15, 2005",10/10,"You might get bored watching this, yes I gave it a 10 but I live in ""the future"" full of bright pictures and quickly cutting images. This movie is awesome though. I think most people can appreciate the 1920s black and white film look as a unique treatment to our current full-color film stock standards.Listen, this movie is interesting and a little spooky especially through the lens of 80 years. It's a vision of the future that became typical with movies like ""1984"" or ""Brazil"" and a look that inspired 12 Monkeys and a hundred other cool modern day sci-fi films.It's standard sci-fi...the machines are taking over and making life crappy for everyone. People are their own worst enemy. I love some of the crazy industrial revolution jobs you see our workers performing, like the guy who has to point these giant clock hands at different flashing lights.If you like sci-fi, you'll probably enjoy this, at the very least you have to appreciate that this creepy art-deco 1920s vision inspired a lot of what you see today."
gftbiloxi,"Apr 10, 2005",10/10,"Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS was very successful with both critics and audiences when it debuted in 1927 Berlin--but it was thereafter edited for distribution by Channing Pollock, who disliked it and removed great chunks of the film and substantially altered the storyline. The resulting film was admired for its visual style, but it proved a critical and box office disappointment. Neglected in the wake of sound, surviving prints of the film were left to corrode and decay--and when it began to reach the home market via VHS and DVD the results were very hit or miss; Blackhawk released a fairly credible version of the truncated film to home video, but for the most part the quality of these releases varied from barely mediocre to downright unwatchable.Until now.A great chunk of METROPOLIS--perhaps as much a quarter of more--has been forever lost, but Kino Video DVD release offers the single best version of the film available. The previously cut footage that still exists has been restored; gaps in the film have been bridged by the occasional use of stills and explanatory title cards; the film itself has been painstakingly and digitally restored; and the soundtrack is the Gottfried Huppertz original created for the film's 1927 Berlin debut. In seeing this version of METROPOLIS, I was struck by how very differently it reads from the previously available truncated version. The visual style and the story itself are much more exciting and cohesive, and in the wake of this restoration it becomes impossible to deny the film status as landmark of international cinema.In many respects the story is simplistic, but the film's visual style and connotations are anything but. Deeply influenced by such art movements as Expressionism, Objectivism, Art Deco, and Bauhaus, the film is visually fascinating--not only in its scenic designs, but in director Lang's famous skill at creating the powerful crowd scenes that dominate the film and building the pace and tension of the film as it moves toward an intense climax. But while one can--and many do--admire the film purely at this level, there is quite a lot going on in terms of philosophical content as well: while it offers few viable solutions, the film raises such issues as the relationship between capital and labor, the place of religion in modern society, human reaction to overwhelming technology, and (perhaps most interestingly) the drift of government into a class-conscious corporate entity. And religious motifs abound in the film: a largely deserted cathedral; Moloch; the Tower of Babel; and crosses--intriguingly juxtaposed with a repeating motif of the pentagram-like designs associated with the robot. It is fascinating stuff.There has been complaint that this restoration runs at incorrect speed and the performances are therefore unnecessarily jerky. I did not find this to be the case. In certain instances the movement is deliberately jerky and mechanical--the workers are a case in point--but beyond this there is nothing for which the difference between silent acting and modern acting techniques cannot account. There has also been some complaint that the title cards should have been left in their original German and translated via subtitle. There is a certain validity to this, but it seems a minor quibble; title cards were typically translated in the silent era itself.The DVD includes a number of extras, including still photographs, biographies of the major figures involved in the film, and two documentaries-one on the restoration process and one on the creation of the film itself. Both are interesting; the audio commentary track by film historian Enno Patalas, however, is mildly disappointing. But when all is said and done, it is the film that counts. And this restoration is a remarkable achievement, to say the least, a project which brings a great landmark of world cinema back from the edge of the abyss. Indispensible; a must-own.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
Martrese-Beck,"Jul 18, 2002",N/A,"I was fortunate enough to get a ticket during the two-week run of the restored Metropolis at The Film Forum here in NYC. What a treat! I had never seen this film and feel lucky to have this version, which is closer to Lang's original vision than any of the others, be my first viewing (especially on the big screen). Thanks to four years of painstaking work by a German film preservationist, and a Munich company specializing in digital restoration, we can now enjoy a beautiful 35-millimeter print with a new recording of Huppertz's score along with 1,300 feet of film that had been cut. Some scenes are still missing and are indicated by title cards in a different font than the original dialogue cards. Though we've become accustomed to viewing movies of an entirely different (and faster and colorful) style, this film is not to be missed for its importance in groundbreaking cinematic history. Many unintentional giggles will be had (Freder Fredersen's grand, dramatic gestures and the evil Maria's gyrations & twisted faces). Pray that this version will be available on dvd for those who are unable to see it on the big screen."
lostintwinpeaks,"Mar 1, 2003",6/10,"Overlong but worth seeing the restored version - for sheer curiosity value itself, if nothing else. That's not to say it's not a good movie - but it is overrated. The new version looks and sounds great. And this is certainly a movie well ahead of its time, that was obviously the seed that has led to the modern sci-fi movie. Typical of the silent film era, also expect lots of swashbucklng, men saving women, etc."
o_cedar,"Apr 24, 2003",5/10,"I just watched the 137 minutes version and frankly it was far too long, and I got bored... the 90 minutes is probably a treat. This was my first impression of a silent movie, and not one I'll forget soon, even if I'm not going to watch silent movies everyday now. Nonetheless, even if the pace was too slow (I'm not an action junkie but still....), I couldn't help being awestruck by Fritz Lang's work and imagination, the plot is quite good, the visuals must have been stunning at the time the movie came out (I didn't imagine seeing special FX in 1925!!!)... Artistic value: 4/4 Entertainment value (for the 137min version): 2/6"
fjhuerta-2,"Mar 14, 2001",10/10,"First, let me get this out of my chest: I can barely think of a movie more terrifying than this one and ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"".Yes, I think it's even more scary than ""The Exorcist"". Why?""The Cabinet"" is the portrait of the world as seen through the eyes of a madman. The film itself won't reveal this until the ending (legend says, this is because the film was not meant to be this way; it was an allegory of impending Nazism, according to some authors). So you get distorted camera angles, expressionist design, and excellent acting along with what can be considered the first modern horror movie.""Metropolis"" builds upon the foundation of German expressionism, and takes it to a whole new level. While ""Cabinet"" has small sets with matte paintings, Metropolis has huge sets, which give it a tremendous sense of space. The sets themselves convey the power some humans have over other, less fortunate beings. The symbolism is apparent everywhere. And the storyline is fixated on what social inequalities could bring in the near future.Fritz Lang's vision was definitely flawed, though. He thought the ruling class of the future would ascend due to industrial prowess and mass production. Since the movie was made in the late 20's, this error was understandable. He didn't foresee that the real revolution was taking place in his home country, Germany. When Dejamark (IBM Germany) was tabulating the citizens of the nation, giving Hitler the information needed to kill every non-arian in the nation. The revolution of the Information Technology.Even so, one can watch this movie and argue that Lang hits the spot more than once on a lot of social issues. Truth is, the social conflicts he attacks are older than Lang himself (dating to the industrial revolution). But don't let this detract from watching this amazing film. It is powerful, moving, endearing and, ultimately, may be the best film ever to come out from the expressionist Germany."
alice liddell,"Oct 11, 1999",10/10,"I have always had more respect than love for this film.  For a start, I prefer Lang's American films in general, because the German ones, outstanding as they are, can be so heavy, and more depressing than even I can take.  Secondly, I felt that despite METROPOLIS' remarkable imagery, there was something simplistic and trite about the film's 'message', and that its politics were more than a little dodgy.  Thirdly, on a television, the overpowering visuals seemed more like a clever trainset.  But mostly, I was put off by Georgio Moroder's horrendous vandalism of the film, with his infantile tinting, and his vile music, where his previously impeccable disco pedigree was replaced by a hideous, grating, fingers-on-blackboard monstrosity of a tinny, tin-eared, tinnitus-inducing 'score'.  Rather than face that, I've always turned the sound down and played Bruckner, which is more than a little unsatisfactory.Last night I saw METROPOLIS in the cinema, and the experience was astonishing and revelatory.  I can see now why it is revered by so many, a judgement that had puzzled me previously.  It IS German, and heavy and depressing, but it has a remarkable playfulness absent from much of Lang's work - the fatuous Arcadian idyll juxtaposed with the constructivist catacombs of the workers; the introduction of John Frederson, master of the Metropolis, with his impeccably attired toadies; the mad inventor, Rotwang; any scene with the wonderful, disruptive robot-Maria, so preferable to her pious progenitor - a jerky, proto-Bride of Frankenstein - witness especially the jawdropping scene where Frederson reveals her to his cronies, belly-dancing.  These scenes, and many more, do much to leaven and ironise the film's considerable gloom, without ever undermining it.As for the film's simplistic plea, Lang does everything in his awesome power to destabilise his wife (and future Nazi)'s schematic script.  The film is not simply futuristic science fiction, but exists or refers to three temporal levels - the future-present in which the film takes place; the vast Egyptian/Biblical images this present is contrasted with, showing that history is not a straight line of progress, but a perpetual repetition of greed, power, repression and destruction; and the medieval, religious world Maria leads the workers to as a site of hope and peace.  All three involve the repression or subservience of the workers.  The medieval realm, which, with its heavy incense and gloom, is quite literally intoxicating, filmed in the style of Danteesque engravings, mirroring the Inferno and the circles of hell of the workplace at the beginning, thoroughly negating the redemption offered by Maria.This God/boss-believer/worker dichotomy is mirrored in the father/son crisis that structures the film.  This parent/child relationship pervades METROPOLIS (e.g. Maria and the children; the inventor and the robot), but rather than assert tradition and order, they spiral into chaos and destruction.  The sex-drive is linked to death and corruption for the son's hallucinations, as he revivifies (like the inventor) the seven deadly sins in one extraordinary sequence after discovering Maria's 'betrayal'.  The whole film is a well of repressed urges bursting to the surface, literally so when the very phallic gas tanks burst open.  Sexual repression and political repression are intimately linked, and their rising to the surface provide some of the film's most compelling images.And yet the politics, to me, remain very very suspect.  METROPOLIS begins as a scathing critique of totalitarianism, and its links with modern capitalism (especially in the US), but ends upholding it, trying to make it work. Although Lang undermines the obscene reconciliation at the end, by showing the sheer destructive glee of revolution, and making the workers as unthinking and robotlike as ever, following the foreman, it is not hard to see why this was Hitler's favorite film.Lang has not found a way of giving 'the mass' an individual voice without demonising it, and the clearly Semitic mad inventor (he has stars of David on both his door and in his lab; his Frankenstein narrative of creation and destruction draws on the Jewish myth of the Golem; his bug-eyed insanity is very similar to contemporary caricatures) is shown to be the root of all the problems in the film, from the creation of the robot, to the flaws in the city's infrastructure.  Once he has been disposed of, order can be restored, the Master can repress to his heart's content, while seeming to befriend the workers.I am running out of time, and I've so much more to say.  On the big screen, the true majesty of the set design blooms, but it is not the fully developed, peopled world of, say, BLADE RUNNER.  Rather, this is a dream space - appropriate to a nightmare vision of modern society - barely populated.  When a crowd walks somnambulistically, or a car suddenly drives by, it is like a dream figure in a vast oneiric landscape, not a regular feature of everyday life.  The social rupture of the film's subject matter is figured in the apparently unassailable inhumanity of the buildings - they are unstable and distorted, waiting to collapse.  The faded image of the video is replaced by an extraordinary, beautiful, clear, sharp picture, a triumph of geometry; an inhuman grid over humanity that finally bursts in the son's remarkable Expressionist frenzy.Lastly is the score.  The print I saw was provided by the British Film Institute, and the music was amazing, a victory of understanding, eclecticism, and invention over Moroder's idiocies.  Jazz alternates with industrial noise or mystical, medieval chanting; sound effects are used with unerring, evocative precision; every scene was enriched by a meta-score that actually commented on each image, providing an interpretation or insight we may have missed.  I wish I hadn't forgotten the composer's name - Kasper something, I think - but I urge you to see this BFI version, because with anything else you really needn't bother; you're cheating Lang, and you're cheating yourself.  Genius."
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Jun 27, 2009",8/10,"Begun in 1925, Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" is probably the most ambitious film ever made. Science-Fiction ""dystopia"" films are still challenging to do in the modern era of computer generated images, let alone telling a good one in 1920s Germany. To think that the producers of this film spent the equivalent of a $200 M summer blockbuster in today's terms in a tattered post-WWI Germany makes a powerful statement about film as an art form.""Metropolis"" is a silent film set in the future about a city divided between the wealthy, elite city planners and the underground working masses that make the city operate. A hopeful but potentially dangerous link forms between the two when the son of the city leader notices a young and optimistic religious figure named Maria from the underground and his curiosity about her people heightens.The film operates from a mantra: ""there can be no understanding between the hand and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator."" It's goal is then to show us why this is true and it certainly does. It's a commentary on social class that disapproves of the disconnect between the wealthy and the newly emerged working/middle class of the time period.Lang brings us some impressive images for 1927. From a modern perspective, it's hard to call it riveting, but especially toward the end it keeps your attention. To think of what this film achieved in that time period helps keep ""Metropolis"" in perspective. It would make for an intriguing modern remake or other sort of adaptation, that's for sure."
kergillian,"May 23, 2002",10/10,"This film is simply state-of-the-art. Timeless - I don't think it would be possible for this film to become dated, it deals with issues that humanity has had to focus on since the beginnings of history.This film cost 5 million marks to make and flopped financially simply because the American market thought silent films were passe. This film is NOT passe. The cinematography is astounding, and the set design is simply unparalleled. Even by today's standards I'm hard pressed to think of a film that looks as impressive considering the technology they had available in 1925, when this was made.The 2 hour run time for a silent film gets a bit slow at times, but I blame that on my impatience as a contemporary film watcher. The sad truth is that society today just can't appreciate slower films as much any more, and I'm at times no exception. That aside, I was never bored, and when this film started cooking, it was *cooking*!This film is the quintessential science fiction film, the film that everything from Frankenstein to Blade Runner borrowed from. It has many firsts, and quite a few of them will never be repeated. Fritz Lang's genius shines through here, solidly placing him on the pedestal next to Mirnau and Fassbinder in the elite of German film-making.What more can I say? Everyone should see this film, if not for the pioneering aspect, then simply because it's a beautiful film from beginning to end. It's a shame that the original prints were lost and that some scenes are missing. I'd love to see an original cut of the German release. Simply one of the all time best, a definite 10/10!!"
commandercool88,"Jul 27, 2008",9/10,"To sum up 'Metropolis' in the best way I know how, it was years ahead of its time. A visually stunning film with a haunting vision of the future, Fritz Lang's silent masterpiece is still a fascinating and thought-provoking motion picture more than 80 years after its release. It is when those faced with the limitations of cinema did the best creative minds emerge, and Lang was certainly able to channel German Expressionism to create a beautiful and expertly crafted work of art.Released in 1926 and set 100 years in the future, 'Metropolis' paints a dark picture where the privileged live above ground in a bustling city filled with gorgeous skyscrapers. But it is those who helped build the city and continue to operate it who live in an underground city absent of the wealth and abundant extravagance. A cataclysmic revolution threatens when a young man, son of the city's leader, ventures below ground in search of a woman and instead witnesses the oppression that smothers the workers.'Metropolis' warns us of a society where science and technology becomes the reigning rule of thumb, when the distinctions between man and machine are practically indistinguishable. A cautionary tale we've heard many times before, but perhaps never with such compelling originality and emotional impact. A machine that systematically devours its overworked and exhausted crew, a powerful retelling of Babel, an angry mob that put's the city's future at stake. Profound moments in an influential and mesmerizing film, 'Metropolis' intoxicates the imagination and makes for a viewing experience like none other.In an age without CGI and green screens, you'd be amazed by all that 'Metropolis' is able to accomplish with simple tricks of the camera and a little artistic flair. Outdated by today's standards, but truly evocative and breathtaking. And with the recent discovery of missing footage (more than an hour's footage was lost, making 'Metropolis' unfortunately fragmented), the world will soon have the chance to see Lang's completed masterwork for the first time since its original release. But as it stands, it's difficult to deny the influence 'Metropolis' has had on film today. A futuristic nightmare that so convincingly blurs the lines between truth and fable.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
k844140,"Jun 19, 2021",9/10,"Metropolis released 94 years ago, and unlike many long silent films of that time it still makes you enjoy every second of it. A legendary film which influenced generations of film makers and references to which we can see either in old movies and in the ones released just recently. It is flawless in any respect, especially because of its age. Metropolis demonstrates us a city created by the true genuises with vivid imagination. It is really unbelievable how they thought up and created such a beautiful and futuristic scenery 94 years ago. Seeing all this alone worth watching the film. Script and the story itself are unique and original for its time. Although we have seen it many times since, but Metropolis was the first. Actors and their characters stand out from many characters of that time, though German directors and screenwriters were always quite ingenious. Each separate character, whether it is a human or not, is memorable and outstanding, as well as the actors who performed them. Visual effects of Metropolis are really one of the best I've ever seen in films older than Star Wars (which is partially influenced by this film) and are the best of their time. The other crew member who made his job perfectly is the director. Fritz Lang is really the one who can show and make us understand the story perfectly without tons of dialoges.So, this movie is really still worth watching in 2021. It does not bore even for a second all throughout its 2,5 hours timing. Even those who don't prefer old movies should acquaint themselves with this masterpiece."
John O,"Jul 5, 1999",N/A,"I could babble on about how great this movie is, but maybe I can help everyone with a lot of details.Robert Bloch (author of ""Psycho"") once met Fritz Lang and raved on about ""Metropolis"".  Lang's reply, ""Why are you carrying on about a movie which does not exist?""  (He had rather strong views on the butchering.)The best version is the 138 minute (at 20 frames /second) or 153 minute (at 18 f/s- there even a debate here) restoration/ reconstruction by Enno Patalas for the Filmmuseum, Munich, using the 1936 FPA negative at the MOMA archive in NY, found by Morodor, and the basis for his version, and adding newly found scenes, and reconstructing others from stills.  I'm not sure what the musical track is; the original score Lang commissioned for 1926 still exists, but is owned by a musician in Germany.The US rights to this print are owned by a company called Transit Films, which wants ""a lot"" for them.The Morodor version is still owned by Vestron Video (Santa Monica, Ca. 90405) which issued it on VHS and Laser.  It's 80 minutes (a ""shorter"" version it seems) because he put all the titles on the bottom of the screen, and not as separate title cards, and it runs faster (He's a music producer, and that may be to sync the music better. Mebbe if everyone wrote Vestron... (Morodor found a 1st or 2nd gen. nitrate negative from FPA at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC, and financed the striking of copies on ""safety"" film.)(Nitrate film stock is notoriously unstable.)  It contains the important stadium scene missing on most other prints, showing the elite of Metropolis playing in contrast to the workers.And then there's a version, still shown on German TV, of a restoration done in East Germany in the sixties, with some additional scenes with Rotwag and Hel, also found in the Filmmuseum copy.The Kino version has the best print quality of currently available ones, but is missing the stadium scene, and has a mediocre, at best, music score.  The Kino International version, for whatever reason, is 7 minutes longer than the US Kino."
hitchcockkelly,"Jan 27, 2023",6/10,"You have to give credit to Fritz Lange for attempting this ambitious and visually stunning film. Compared to films of the day, it was ""Cleopatra"" and ""Star Wars"" combined, but viewing it candidly, I have to say that it doesn't hold up. It's far too long, overwrought and simplistic. The operatic, Biblical symbolism is stifling. The characters are underdeveloped. But the worst part of the film is Gustav Frolich's performance as the hero, Feder. It's terrible, even by the standards of the day. Feder is supposed to be a standard, handsome, movie hero (Kevin Costner, Bruce Willis), but Frolich plays him like Hamlet on speed and estrogen. Klein-Rogge is over-the-top as Rotwang, but he is the mad scientist. Brigitte Helm is possessed as the fake Maria, but she's good enough as the real Maria to make you think she's doing it with a twinkle in her eye. (At times her wild-eyed rants make her look like a twin of Gene Wilder's Dr. Frahnkenstein.) The music is wonderful, and the visuals are incredible, but respect for Lange's vision is the only reason I'm giving this six stars."
Cristiano-A,"Mar 2, 2007",8/10,"One of the greatest works of German Expressionism. In the near future, the world is divided in two: the thinkers, those that do the planning and know nothing about the real functioning of things; and the workers, who reach objectives, but do not have global understanding and know nothing about planning. Alone they are nothing but together they make a strong ensemble. This super-production for the time, with scenarios of an entrancing architectonic grandeur, Metropolis is a pessimistic utopia on the future, that only love can redeem. It's a metaphor on the struggle of classes, a renewed vision of the parabola of Babel, Metropolis is smashing in its scenarios but in the same way, is dramatically emotional and human. The excellent restored copy I saw, allowed me to see the brilliant cinematography, all the games of light, the dark - bright fluctuations. I think that the limitations imposed to filmmakers by the nonexistence of sound and color, sharpened its ability to take the maximum from light effects and from the facial expressions of the actors. Seeing Metropolis today is not the same of seeing it at that time, because the technique evolved immensely. But for that time, it was brilliant. And the movie became a eternal and the android female figure of Metropolis, Maria, is now a symbol of science fiction cinema. While some criticize Fritz Lang , saying that the film is an apology of capitalism and even Nazism, he said: ""I was convoked by Goebbels (...) to know, for my great surprise, that the Minister of the Propaganda of the III Reich had been charged by Hitler to offer me the direction of all the German cinema. The Fuhrer saw Metropolis and said that this was the man who will create national-socialist cinema. In that same night I left Germany""."
general-melchett,"Jan 27, 2007",7/10,"Metropolis could have been even better had it been released the following year, in 1928. The first film with sound in it was released the same year it was made - and a film of its type would need sound to be even better. But it is by no means bad. Who cares about words when you've got a good idea for a film? And Metropolis is a good idea - two societies in a city - one hell-like, one heaven-like. The film is great for its day - the scope is massive for a film nearly 80 years old - possibly the biggest ever at that time. And in terms of quality, it probably beat most films in the 50s and 60s. But Fritz Lang had a huge budget to play with - at that time, two million dollars was enough to send a film corporation into bankruptcy, nowadays being s*d-all. And though the budget is used well and every penny is put up on the screen, you just can't help feeling that this film needed words, and that it would just be taken the p**s out of by stupid young idiots in schools today. Though the odd title card every 30 seconds or so does do a good job of keeping everything on track and the musical score throughout the film does kind of substitute for words and sound, this film, I believe, would have been better if dialogue had been used. But b*lls to that - this film is something that should be respected, and an early realisation of a future society. This film is, in every sense, an epic. 7/10"
drqshadow-reviews,"Jul 28, 2020",5/10,"Fritz Lang's sci-fi godfather has been through several levels of re-cut hell over the past hundred years. Slashed by nearly an hour for its original western release, trimmed further by Nazi censors in 1936, color tinted and re-edited in the '80s (with a modern rock soundtrack) by Giorgio Moroder, then painstakingly restored for Blu-Ray in 2010, using lost footage from an old print in Buenos Aires. Up until now, my entire memory of the film comes from the Moroder version, which didn't make much sense from a story perspective but always wowed me with its wild, futuristic visions, ambitious special effects and expansive set designs.The restored version offers improvement in both respects. Now cast in gorgeous monochrome, as intended, the art direction is even more stunning. New scenes and high-resolution scans give us new chances to admire the sprawling city, to really soak up the vast scale of Lang's concept. And the plot, naive and airy as it may be, actually moves in sensible directions now. It's incredibly slow moving and drawn-out, sure, overloaded with long shots of talking heads (which seems unnecessary for a silent picture) but at least it's headed somewhere.As a long-time fan of the film, I'm glad to have finally seen the full thing. It's an iconic marvel, an artistic triumph that's, somehow, just as hypnotic now as it must've been in post-WWI Germany. That said, actually wading through the scenes without some sort of huge, dazzling art deco set piece, well, it can feel like work. I needed four sittings to get through this two-and-a-half hour behemoth, and I was personally invested before it hit my media shelf. First-timers will, no doubt, find it smothering. Deeply influential as a production, astounding as a purely visual showpiece, but critically flawed as a whole. Now excuse me while I revisit a few tunes from the 1984 release."
Cyke,"Aug 6, 2006",9/10,"018: Metropolis (1927) - released 1/10/1927, viewed 8/15/05.A hurricane kills 650 in Cuba. Serial killer Earle Nelson, the Gorilla Man, is on the loose.

The first transatlantic telephone call is made, from New York to London.BIRTHS: Chuck Berry, Richard Crenna, Johnnie Ray. DEATHS: Harry Houdini.KEVIN: Okay, we've seen Lubitsch and we've seen Murnau, now it's time for the one and only Fritz Lang. This movie was very cool. The creators were really breaking new ground with the look of this film. I really liked Brigitte Helm's performance both as Maria and in her over-the-top turn as the evil Machine. I was extremely impressed with the visual effects, mostly regarding the Machine. I've seen films made in the '50s with crappier effects than in this film. One of the more regrettable things about this film were the missing scenes. I tried really hard to visualize the lost scenes based on the descriptions given. I hope one day they recover the missing footage.DOUG: In Germany in early '27, Austrian filmmaker extraordinaire Fritz Lang released his silent science fiction extravaganza Metropolis. This is a film that I'd really been looking forward to. It's tragic that a quarter of this movie is lost; those text cards describing the missing scenes during the movie sounded exciting. I must say, I was impressed, although a little confused at times. The plot is kind of weird and confusing. Metropolis was the most expensive silent film of its day, and looks it. There's a lot of special effects, groundbreaking at the time, including futuristic cityscapes (probably matte paintings), visual overlays (done the old-fashioned way), and of course the famous ""machine man"" played in human form by Brigitte Helm. Helm does an excellent job of playing the evil robot lady and the good-hearted Maria; you can tell instantly who she is just by the way her head is cocked. Rudolph Klein-Rogge pretty much steals the show as the demented scientist Rotwang. I didn't quite get how the movie illustrated its theme/tagline about hands/brain/heart. All the extravagant effects and sets kind of distract from it.Last film: Faust (1926). Next film viewed: The General (1927). Next film chronologically: The Kid Brother (1927).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise."
dwpollar,"Dec 6, 2003",8/10,"8 out of 10(Dir-Fritz Lang): Excellent groundbreaking silent movie from Germany portraying two classes(the elite & the workers) under one world in the future, fighting for their own rights but in the end losing much more due to their tendency towards following the sinful dark side that leads to hatred & violence. Yes, that was a mouthful!! But trying to summarize this deep, intense, thought-provoking classic movie in a single sentence is ""extremely"" difficult.  It's sad that the original showing of the film will never be complete again but it has been restored to its full understanding with the most recent DVD release by Kino Video by filling in captions to bring the missing plot elements together.  Bravo to the original makers of this film and this group for the wonderful restoration.  This movie is truly one of a kind."
sweetkness,"May 26, 2005",10/10,"Taking into account when this film was made, and what Fritz Lang had to work with, this film has to be easily be considered one of the best silent films ever made and certainly one of the best sci-fi films ever. The set designs and absolutely amazing, so good that many sci-fi films can't compare to them 80 years later. The story is also very good for a silent film, building up enough suspense and drama to easily keep my attention for the entire two hours, something which much shorter silent films have not been able to do for me.Fritz Lang was so far ahead of his time with this film, it just had me totally amazed. I found it quite ironic that this film, made 80 years ago, paints a good picture of the path our world may be taking. Maybe its just the pessimistic side of me, but we continue to become more and more dependent on technology yet we are depleting more and more of out energy sources. There also appears to be a larger gap forming between classes and the power the upper class is able to enforce. Could this lead to a future quite similar to the one Fritz Lang pictured? Maybe, maybe not, but thats the beauty of this film, it can get you thinking about larger issues such as that, unlike many silent films where the world is portrayed as all hunky dory, and everything ends happily."
shinkone,"Sep 19, 2006",10/10,"The view of the future, the new world. The German filmmaker Fritz Lang have given us a link to the past.I personally believe that this was why people wanted to become Communists. If you have nothing, won't ever get nothing. And somebody offers you the whole power, would you turn it down? This film is about the perfect society, the great city the Metropolis, where everybody knows their own place, they all go to the same work, they all eat the same food.But then, the workers learns the meaning of the word Revulotion. The word that makes them the leaders and not the followers.And this was made only a few years before the War. Unbelievable.Movies will never, ever be this good ever again."

cherold,"Dec 31, 2023",7/10,"This cinematic classic has come out in many forms. Last time I watched it, it was the version with the pop soundtrack. This time I saw what is supposed to be very close to the complete original. And of those two versions I would say the same thing: this is entertaining and visually striking but what's up with the story?Like a lot of silent films shots get held too long so the pre MTV people can register what's going on. I feel even for the time they didn't need to be helped as long as they were but I wasn't alive back then so what do i know?The story is an absolute mess. One of the main things is that the father has a plan that makes no sense and when that plan goes exactly the way one would expect it to he seems confused and shocked. And it is completely unclear what exactly he thought was going to happen.The protagonist is poorly acted but his love interest is good in a very verid performance and the guy who plays his father is quite good.The politics are a weird mix of Labor rights, religion, anti-capitalism and can't we all get along ism. There is a strong message empty striking visuals of men forced to live like machines, but it's hard to know what this movie is really intended to do.There are some really strong scenes in this. A woman chased by a flashlight. A crazy orgiastic performance. The desperate run to safety.In the end the visuals characters through a lot of very iffy stuff. It's not ultimately a great movie, but it is a hugely important one and a reasonably entertaining one. Recommended."
atleverton,"Sep 7, 2022",2/10,"There are only two reasons to watch this film. The first is that it is the first sci-fi film ever. The second is that it does have some shots that are brilliant, and it is a marvel they were created almost 100 hundred years ago. The film is more like a ballet than a movie. The story barely makes sense, the message of the film is confusing (the head and the hands need the heart to mediate?) and it is about two hours too long. If you are interested in the great shots from the film, they can be found on Youtube. It's not worth your time watching this. H. G. Wells gave it the most honest review when he said it was a 'silly film'."
lespike,"Nov 17, 2003",10/10,"Metropolis. Ah a film which has possibly the highest amount of different versions avaiable through the years. Not only did they manage to lose half of the footage from the original cut (Thanks to US distributers), a good dozen copies have been released on various VHS and DVD releases, with only one of them actually being any good (the 1984 release by Giorgio Moroder) despite the ultra 80s soundtrack, colour tinting etc.I think you need to see several versions of the movie to see all the various 'discovered' parts which every new version of the film seems to include in order to see the 'whole' movie (whats left of it), anyway, however you see it - it's basically a story about a group of workers revolting against the cream of the society, the rich, who built a new huge city and banished the workers to the undergroud, to work back breaking shifts in order to keep the creme de la creme's lifestyle going.A startingly well thought out movie when you take into consideration it's based 100 years from the year the movie was made (2027, as in when the movie is based, not when it was made! :), and I think Fritz Lang must have been a man of some considerable vision, who was quite frankly well ahead of his time, and situation (Germany, mid 20s, Hitler etc).Also see Queen's Radio Ga Ga vision to see Metropolis in another (yes, another!) light!Stu"
EdgarST,"Dec 14, 2011",10/10,"I recently saw the 2010 version of ""Metropolis"", with the additional 25 minutes found in a film museum of Buenos Aires. I have a long relationship with this Fritz Lang's film. I think that I have seen it more than 30 times. In the early 1980s, while working for public television in Panamá, I had to adjust its soundtrack (with a non-symphonic version of its original score by Gottfried Huppertz), and later I had to add Spanish subtitles. This edition guided by Enno Patalas, was the official version then, although it was known that there was lost footage. Then I saw the ""Paramount version"" (1928), a mutilation based on Channing Pollock's prosaic and simplistic reinterpretation of its story. After this I saw Giorgio Moroder's ""rock and roll version"" (1984), which I found only interesting for the inclusion of a few lost images. Then I had to study the film for a book published in 1995, for which I read about the lost scenes related to Hel, the mother of Freder, the young protagonist of ""Metropolis"". The reading of this subplot shed light to what I already knew about the story, making it more coherent: loved by the owner of Metropolis, Joh Fredersen, and by the scientist Rotwang, Hel died when she gave birth to Freder. This originated Rotwang's hatred for Fredersen, and his betrayal. When he creates the robot with Maria's face, Rotwang gives her orders contrary to those by Joh Fredersen: instead of encouraging discord among the workers, the robot makes them revolt against Fredersen and destroy the machines. This subplot –as well as the complicity between Freder and Josaphat, the worker his father fires, and the destiny of worker 11811 in the hands of the Thin Man, after being replaced by Freder in the machines room- was incorporated in the 2001 version, by using stills and intertitles, until 2008 when Argentinean archivists found a complete version of the film, containing moving images of those lost elements of the story, all shot by Lang. Although this version also confirmed that there were shots different in scale, angle or acting from one version to another, there was no existing footage to compare these new 25 minutes to. With the surviving intertitle lists that the distributor in Norway had submitted to the censors in late 1920s, the correct translation of the Argentinean titles could be made, and so the 2010 version appeared, which is a must for any film specialist. However the new material was in such a bad condition, that it was not possible to make a satisfactory restoration, from which we could derive complete visual or intellectual pleasure: after watching long sections of material in optimal conditions, when the ""new"", opaque and severely scratched shots are added, the hypnotic effect is lost and we are distracted from the story being told. Instead of being a cinematic trip with ideas, or a science-fiction drama, the experience is turning more and more into a freak show of the film that was, that is no longer there, full of stills and explanatory title cards, and now the dull and scratched Buenos Aires material. It is obvious that this was not the idea of any of the talents involved in this magnum opus, but as Martin Koerber (head specialist of this restoration) declares, it is important to incorporate this material (for now, hoping a better copy appears someday), because it is part of the story of ""Metropolis"", part of the vicissitudes in the history of Art, of the history of the Seventh Art, of the history of cinema in capitalist societies, where a work of art can be destroyed to make a few millions. In the end, it was registered by Unesco in the Memory of the World catalog, and the original message that was scorned and ridiculed by leftists, is still valid: the heart is the mediator between the brain and the hands. In spite of all the efforts, until all the footage of ""Metropolis"" has a minimum of visual quality, these intents to restore it will only have archival and cinéphile value, since they generate only a portion of the fluid and full cinematic pleasure sought by the original version."
robert-temple-1,"Sep 13, 2010",10/10,"The occasion of my 500th review for IMDb seems a good time to review one of the greatest masterpieces of the history of the cinema. At last! The DVD is out with the restoration which took 12 years and the combined efforts of many people and organisations, putting Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS back together again for the first time since 1927, adding half an hour of recovered footage to the length, digitally enhancing every frame, improving the titles, and with the wonderful bonus of the restoration of the original 1927 orchestral score. This may be the greatest cinematic restoration and recovery effort in history, and it gives back to us a version of one of the world's major films as last seen in Berlin in 1927, and never seen anywhere outside Berlin even then. The monstrous mutilation of this masterpiece commenced almost as soon as the premiere was over. The recovered footage was found a few years ago in Argentina, no copy having survived in Europe. Now that we can see Lang's true conception of the film, which is wholly different from the mutilated versions which have been shown for the past 83 years, the story at last makes sense. Every time we saw METROPOLIS before, it was not really METROPOLIS at all, and was not even remotely authentic. The footage had been re-edited in such a horribly distorted way that sometimes scenes were used to mean precisely the opposite of what they were originally intended to signify. The DVD contains important interviews, demonstrations, and information about all of this. What happened to this film was as if someone had taken a Rembrandt self-portrait and over-painted it as the portrait of a young girl; the over-painting has now been stripped off entirely, and we see revealed the film which Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou, the joint script writers, originally envisioned. This film was enthusiastically adopted by Goebbels and other Nazis, and von Harbou herself became a fanatical Nazi, so Lang divorced her and famously fled to America after Hitler showed too much interest in him. But that is a long story and one which is well known. One of the most unforgettable aspects of this film are the scenes where the workers march in gangs with their heads lowered in submission, and their simultaneous tread is a monotonous machine-like dragging of their exhausted bodies towards their labour. Doubtless these scenes of the masses dominated by an elite excited the Nazis, as did the visions of a future technological wonderland where speed, power, and efficiency are portrayed with rapturous awe. Of course, there are the dark forces, and there is the unspeakably evil 'Mechanical Man', who is actually female in form, having been given the likeness of the saintly Maria (who had been trying to give hope to the downtrodden workers by addressing secret mass meetings in the catacombs far below Metropolis). Both roles are played by the amazing Brigitte Helm, one of the most brilliant German film actresses ever. Helm quit the film business and moved to Switzerland in 1935 in disgust at Hitler. She must have been as scared as Lang at the combined menace of Hitler, Goebbels, and Thea von Harbou, all of whom must have had their eye on her just as they did Lang. Helm's real surname, by the way, was Schittenhelm, and it is just as well she shortened it! She lived to be 90. Alas, I was in Ascona while she was still alive, and did visit one grand dame who lived there in retirement, but had no idea Helm was there, or I would have tried to meet her as well. Anyone who has seen Helm in one of her films can never forget her. In METROPOLIS she is scintillatingly brilliant both as Jekyll and as Hyde, and she had eyes like road-drills. Alfred Abel is particularly good in this film as the oligarch Joh Fredersen. He exudes an air of such self-assured calm, the very mannered tranquility of the truly rich which drove F. Scott Fitzgerald so wild with excitement and made him think of the rich as a different species, so that he could never stop writing about them with the enthusiasm of a groupie. Rudolf Klein-Rogge is the mad inventor Rotwang, with wild hair and wilder eyes. He is slightly over-the-top, but then, METROPOLIS is as well. The budget for METROPOLIS was gigantic, and I believe the film was made over a period of 13 months. It was a true epic in both senses, its production and its result. However, it was deemed 'too long' for audiences, so like Erich von Stroheim's GREED (1924), both films being too brilliant and too disturbing, the length was used as a pretext for mediocrities to slash, cut, tear, and rend, like a pack of mad warthogs, as mediocrities above all else enjoy attacking and destroying works of genius. (The reason why mediocrities hate genius is because they are incapable of it themselves, and its very existence rubs their noses in their own inadequacy. Their only defense is to destroy that which brings their own inferiority to notice, so that they can live comfortably in their boring bubble as nonentities, undisturbed by reminders that there is anything higher or better than themselves.) The science fiction effects of this production are so far ahead of their time that their successful achievement was itself a kind of science fiction-made-reality. The 'extras' on the DVD give fascinating insights into how these effects were achieved, and anyone interested in the mechanics of illusion will be spellbound at the revelations which are given as to how Lang achieved his visions on screen. Since METROPOLIS was an attempt to envisage the future, it is highly ironical that it required the future's own arrival 83 years later before we were allowed to see what it was that Lang had actually predicted and envisaged."
katdakay,"Mar 8, 2008",10/10,"Probably the second best silent movie I've ever seen, (Frank Capra's The Matinée Idol still rules), but that's saying something. Its a futuristic dystopian masterpiece about a world in which the rich live in beautiful glass palaces, ignorant or otherwise indifferent to the plight of the majority of the population, impoverished and overworked manual laborers who are relegated to living in a subterranean inner city. Note the Marxist undertones, which are not at all subtle. The political commentary of the bourgeoise vs. the proletariat, and the classic David vs. Goliath theme are well conveyed. It was beautiful, and totally lives up to its praise as a ""visionary masterpiece."" Fritz Lang is a cinematic genius, and the emotion flows beautifully from darkly comedic to hysterical to somber. A true epic."
earlytalkie,"Jun 6, 2011",10/10,"This landmark film has just undergone it's second restoration and now has just about all the footage that can be found for it. The futuristic tale of a repressed working class rebelling against the privileged few has been released many times on VHS and DVD. The newly restored version, with footage found in Argentina adds nuances and subplots that have not been seen in any other version. The relationship between Rotwang, the inventor and Freder, the boss of Metropolis takes a surprising twist that has been edited out of the unrestored version that I have previously seen. The musical score, from 1927 is exquisite, and the quality of the print is as good as can be found. If you have never seen this landmark film, by all means, see it in the restored version."
macsroyal,"Oct 21, 2002",N/A,"I had the extraordinary opportunity to view the 75th anniversary of Fritz Lang's stunning Metropolis at the fully restored historic Normal Theater in Normal, Illinois.Metropolis is one of the sci-fi movies that is always referenced in a Discovery Channel or TLC documentary on the history of films and/or science fiction.  The only 'clip' of Metropolis shown is the huge sky scrapers nearly blocking out the sun and high level roads and airplanes streaming the sky.  My impression was that this was the only film footage that remained of the 1927 classic. However, to my surprise, I saw 'Metropolis' on the marquee of the Normal Theater.  Before viewing the film, I had to get more information.  What I found regarding Metropolis was both stunning and depressing.The total accuracy of the information is questionable.  However, my understanding is that the original film ran over 3 hours long.  Through the ravages of time and disrespect, the film had been cut down to versions less than 90 minutes long.  I also learned that the most recent release of Metropolis was more that of a 'rock opera' worthy of MTV than that of a classic movie house.To my stunning pleasure, Normal Theater would have nothing of this disrespect.  The 123 minute version I viewed was the most accurate, fully restored, full length version of the legendary classic.  This includes the original 1927 orchestral score!  Yes, the ravages of time have caused the loss of nearly 1/4 of the original film.  However, in this stunning re-release, effort is taken to 'fill in the blanks' with story cards at the precise moments where the missing film occur.  The plot flows with all of the gaps filled.The story of Metropolis is a freighting one.  It reflects the political arguments we have today - the alleged growing gap between rich and poor and the elimination of the 'middle class.'  Workers who keep the city running live below and work in sweat shops while those with power live high atop penthouses above the city.  When the son of the city 'leader' discovers how the working class is treated, he heads to the 'machine' factory to be with the workers.  In the process he finds a beautiful woman deep below the city who takes care of the worker's children while the workers are slaving over their labor. The 'leader' soon learns of his son's exploits and hires a mad scientist to create a robot in the woman's likeness to head to the factories below to destroy any hint of rebellion.This movie is considered one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. It is so hard and unfair to attempt to compare Metropolis to the bloated budget special effect blockbusters of today.  After all, how many full length SILENT movies have people seen?  This was my first, and most likely my last (not by choice but by availability).  With this in mind, I cleared my mind and attempted to vision the reaction of the crowds of 1927.In this light I can say that Metropolis was an awesome movie!  It's fun to see the actors 'over react' to things so the audience can follow the plot. The obsession of make-up on the faces of the cast is a hoot.  But I was surprised how few story cards were really necessary to follow the plot. For 123 minutes I sat their riveted to the characters as if I had full sound. I was fully concerned about the plight of the characters involved.The most stunning thing about Fritz Lang's Metropolis is the painstaking detail and special effects.  There are thousands of extras, huge sets, flooding water, and crumbling buildings.  The mad scientist scene where the robot comes to life is fantastic.  I can honestly now say I know exactly where all of the future sci-fi movies obtained their influence. Hollywood's Frankenstein was born of this movie.  More recently, Blade Runner, the Metropolis of Batman, Dark City, and The Fifth Element.To see this 'historic' movie in it's closest to the original form was a wonderful experience.  I now have a sense of history and the evolution of classic film making.  I encourage everyone to see this film (the original version - and music) if given the opportunity.Metropolis is truly fascinating."
mieriks,"Feb 7, 2024",7/10,"This movie, about the son of the city's mastermind who falls in love with a working-class prophet who predicts the coming of a savior to mediate their differences, is a good drama movie!The downsides to me are that the story feels a bit like a mess and I didn't get that wanted connection to the characters. The first act is also way too long, in my opinion. Anyway, the strongest elements are definitely the visuals. The movie has incredible sets with a unique style and a lot of extras, props, and practical effects. And since it's a silent movie, it obviously depends on its visuals, which it masterfully makes sure of. In addition, I think the third act stands out as the best act. So overall, the movie sometimes drags and feels messy, but it's still a good watch.Despite this movie's extended first act and confusing story that hinders immersion, and that it stumbles on narrative clarity and emotional connection, it boasts stunning visuals and a compelling third act."
bobsgrock,"Nov 24, 2008",8/10,"Fritz Lang's epic 1927 science fiction film is a classic not just of the silent era, or the German Expressionism movement of the time. It is a timeless story filled with wondrous images and visual effects that are decades ahead of its time and thoroughly challenging.The story is that of two separate groups of people living in the futuristic city of Metropolis. The workers live underground and keep the city running, while the thinkers or upper-class live above ground and enjoy the sweet things of life. One day, one of the upper-class finds his way to the workers' world and is shocked at what he sees. What follows is an extraordinary tale of love, lust, revenge, anger, social injustice and the desire to be free and happy. It is a tale that has been done many times since and may have lost some of its original gusto, but to see it be done in its original state, Metropolis succeeds as a great film and compelling drama that shows you don't need words to convey emotion. In the cinema, all it takes is an image."
Zooha-47207,"Sep 2, 2024",3/10,"Metropolis is a silent film from 1927 that is considered a landmark in cinema history. It attempts to portray a dystopian future where society is divided between the wealthy elite and the oppressed workers. While it's an impressive achievement for its time, particularly in terms of its visuals and production design, I found the vision of the future presented to be rather unsettling and even disturbing.The film has a grand scope and is filled with symbolism and social commentary, but the heavy-handed approach can feel overwhelming. While it's interesting to see how people in the 1920s imagined the future, some of the ideas and imagery come across as off-putting and bleak.Overall, metropolis is a film that is more fascinating as a historical piece than as an enjoyable watch. I give it a 3/10 for its groundbreaking achievements but found it a challenging film to sit through."
thepropmistress,"Mar 30, 2006",10/10,"I first saw this film in my art class over the course of several days. When I heard we were to be watching a silent film, I was fairly skeptical. I'd seen ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"", which I did not like, as well as ""Nosferatu"" which I didn't like all that much either. I was incredibly surprised to enjoy the film so thoroughly.The acting was absolutely amazing. There were distinct changes in the cast throughout the film, particularly Brigitte Helm's portrayal of the Machine Man versus Maria. Every time I saw her on stage as the Machine Man I was absolutely chilled to the bone. She conveyed both of the characters so uniquely and seamlessly that I can now only envy her amazing talent.The direction was superb, every scene, every cut, was so utterly perfect. You could stop the film at any time and have a perfectly composed picture. The balance of lights and darks were perfect, especially when Maria was running through the catacombs. The shots were hard, being in such limited light, but they were pulled off and looked amazingly natural.As to the plot line, very very unique- if simple. However, simple plot lines are often the ones that influence the watcher the most. At no time did I find myself bored or listless. However- for those who cannot seem to appreciate the beauty of simplicity and need an action sequence blaring in your face every five minutes- this is not the film for you.Now as to the sets, music, and ensemble. The sets were amazing, following the visions of German Impressionists of that time- one of my favorite facets of old German films. The sheer scale of the sets, and variety of them, was stunning. I also believe that the music, contrary to popular belief, was very well suited to the film and moved me through the movie as fluidly as the acting and editing. The ensemble cast was amazing as well, not to mention the huge size of it- impressive even by today's standards. The choices of characterization, particularly the workers, were spot on. The workers' hobbled walk was perfect and gave me chills every time I saw it.All in all, an remarkable film that I could watch over and over again and see new things every time. For those of you who don't like the film because of its simplicity, its length, its lack of color, and its lack of talking- I beg you to reconsider. 10 out of 10"
A-Clockwork-Bobbin,"Jan 19, 2009",9/10,"What can I say about Metropolis? The words: Amazing, genius, thrilling, captivating, wonderful, purely excellent, and imitable come to mind.Metropolis was a very early sci-fi film, by that master of filming, Fritz Lang. It was made in 1927; so if you had even seen a few seconds of the film, you would be surprised at how advanced it was, even then. No CGI or 'special effects' like we get nowadays; Metropolis is absolutely magical. And it has such a storyline that is absolutely unique... there is not a film like Metropolis. It mixes Sci-Fi, dystopia, romance, and thriller, along with other genres, so there's something for everyone.The most unfortunate thing about Metropolis is that it is incomplete. Or, at least, the versions of the film you can get now is of the incomplete versions. Due to it being a lengthy film (Fritz Lang had a habit of showing every meticulous detail that may be relevant to the storyline), it was cut severely, so that the audience would receive it better. Unfortunately, this made the plot confusing; what seemed like bit-parts were in fact originally key characters, important events were missed out... Generally, the copies of the film you can get now on DVD are of the most 'restored' version, but there are still some parts missed out.Fortunately - the parts of the film which had been cut have just recently be found. I would love to see the film when Metropolis has been reunited with the 'lost' footage! Even so, Metropolis is highly recommendable. There are still some minor flaws, I find, but if you appreciate good films, with good story lines, with revolutionary filming techniques... Then Metropolis is for you."
akkoziol,"Jul 2, 2008",10/10,"Expecting a lot out a 1927 movie is a bit much except when you see teleconferencing screens and futuristic nods to what may come. For silent era film, this was WAY above the heads of what most folks in the 20s could have conceived the future to look like. Metropolis is a slightly incomplete film due to some of the footage having been lost but a few years back, some lost footage was found to complete more of this fantastic film. Not only that, if you saw the grainy version years ago on VHS, the Kino version is digitally restored and *razor* sharp. So good in fact, you'll see detail you've never seen with the low-res VHS version. The additional footage and supplemental material is great. Give the restored version a try as it has had new life breathed into it. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how much you're missing out. (UPDATE: Apparently someone recently unearthed a nearly complete version, albeit scratched, in South America so hopefully we'll finally see all the good missing stuff!

dundaswest,"Jan 12, 2007",10/10,"Directed by great German director Fritz Lang in 1927.Metropolis is considered one of the best science fiction movie ever made, it is a masterpiece and great example of the German Expressionism.In the film, director Fritz Lang created two different world .The world of the workers who live in underground factory and the upper class society who control the city and the workers .In the underground world, slavery workers use their hands the control the machines and work 10 hours with inhuman conditions. In surface, people enjoy the life of the mega city with flying ships, beautiful gardens and extremely modern facilities.Film begins showing workers when changing their shifts and their mechanical movements which represent their slavery positions in the society. However, the story of Metropolis is about the young guy called freder .His father, Joh Federesen, is in charge of the city and owner of the factory. One day, when Freder is looking for true happiness he sees Maria with children of the workers .Maria is a school teacher and mediator between two worlds. Because of her, Freder decides to discover the workers world and witnesses their terrible conditions. To prevent the rebellion, he hires a mad scientist to create a robot like Maria.Considering the special effects conditions in 1920's, effects, decorations and details in the movie is magnificent. Huge sets, the machine man, flying ships, skyscrapers are very convincing and effective.Biblical imagery of the movie is also primary key for the story. Good Maria as Virgin Mary which represents pureness, Jesus like freder, the son, who tries to save people and the city and heartless father rules his own world in the skyscraper and he has a power to destroy everything which represents apocalypse.Actor performances in the Metropolis are almost same as the other expressionist silent movies. Over-dramatic scenes, exaggerated emotions and body movements fairly express the characters situation.Sound effect and classical music in the Metropolis give enough excitement to audienceAs a part of the German expressionism, director Fritz Lang has made deep shadows and lights which creates very cold and disturbing ambiance.In a cinematic perspective, I believe that Metropolis has started to science fiction genre and influenced many other movies such as Blade Runner, Dark City, Star wars, artificial intelligence, fifth element etc. In a social perspective, unfortunately, we can still see the struggle between rich and poor and the gap between them which is getting wider day by day"
vovazhd,"Mar 17, 2008",10/10,"I had been itching to see Metropolis for a very long time. I finally did it; it was everything I hoped for and more. Its now my favorite silent film (ahead of other classics like The General and Battleship Potemkin). Its a shame that several parts have been lost, but the newest restoration is still very coherent.The special effects and set designs are the most obvious strength. They are still impressive today. There is not a single moment of unconvincing or misplaced special effects. Many of the scenes left me in awe. The city models are incredible: huge skyscrapers, a complex network of streets, grueling machinery. Everything was well thought out. To imagine that these designs were conceived 80 years ago and remain realistic is mind blowing.I also found the characters to be a strong point. Each one had a distinct personality and beliefs. Freder makes a good hero, Rotwang makes a good villain, Joh Frederson makes a believable city head, and Maria is a perfect woman. I grew attached to each of the characters, even the minor ones.The plot is also strong, even though the message seems disconnected from today's society. It still has a timeless theme that should be remembered. The story has many twists and turns, but manages to develop smoothly.Metropolis is the ultimate silent science fiction movie. Practically anyone will be impressed by the special effects and theme, if nothing else."
jbalough,"May 28, 2008",9/10,"Metropolis is the oldest movie I have seen; therefore I do not feel it is fair to compare with recent science fiction films. I think the film is phenomenal and creative for the era in which it was made. The use of scenery to create the skyline for the mega-city is brilliant. I thought the special effects used throughout the movie were innovative, especially the laboratory scene when Rotwang creates the 'Maria' robot. Although the movie was in black and white, I noticed the color of the character's clothing was part of their role. For instance, Freder was dressed in white to portray a good guy. The acting was a bit dramatic compared to today's actors, but considering it is a silent film it was tolerable. I enjoyed the movie and place it on my list of 'Must See' movies."
MdnightRadio7L,"Apr 19, 2001",N/A,"German expressionism is my personal favorite time in film history, and Lang was a master of it. In a chilling vision of a future distopia, the workers in a hellish factory world rise up against everything the city stands for, pulling the son of the factory owner into a whirlwind. The young man sees the horror his father refuses to... Although the plot is by this time and age rather conventional, the film is excellent. Many of the landscape shots became a forerunner for Blade Runner, and directors such as David Lynch were heavily influenced by Lang's wonderful work. A great film. Also, take a look at Lang's M-- another terrific piece of work with fear of human nature at its core."
redrawn,"Jan 17, 2013",7/10,"Metropolis features huge, wonderfully designed sets, a cast of thousands, and great visual design. The story details a collision between classes, the poor working class, consigned to the depths, and the industrious living in the bright city above. The city is beautifully realised given the effects of the day, lights, automobiles, aeroplanes, and vast crowds living and breathing in the city, machines are superimposed on top of another in a series of endless work, the workers move in a tired trance, synchronised as if in a slow dance to the death.The move is a little too long and dawdles, instead of justifying its entire two and a half hour length. Despite this the images are captivating, the social commentary is justified, well reasoned and well presented. The references to the Tower of Babel are welcome, if a little obvious, and completely unnecessary to actually detail. Fritz Lang has particular skill at telling a story with just images, and directing his actors to give well considered performances. His visual metaphors, as workers struggle with giant clocks, or are sacrificed to the hunger of the machine, are particularly evocative.The acting is expressive, as the actors struggle to say so much, without saying anything at all. The editing and effects are good, obviously dated, but in sync with the film as not to be awkward or distracting. The costumes are designed well, and Maria the robot is superbly designed."
pwoods1,"May 25, 2004",10/10,"Ah! I have your attention and uberwoman gets a mention later.However, Lang's meisterpiece is about the lumpen proletariat and their fight against capitalism in ALL its dreadful forms. It is at once a manifesto for Marxism and a sensitive film-maker's prescience regarding the National Socialist (NAZI) horrors to come. Regardless of the technical innovations (forced-perspective being the most important), each scene in the Hell which is the factory, reeks of pointlessness and despair.The Daliesque spreadeagled workers moving clock hands backward and forward in a dance of futility become an exemplar for the pointless exploitation of unskilled workers in a factory - BUT we never know whether they are indeed unskilled or just misused - or does it matter in a capitalist system? The maw of the insatiable greed of the monied is dreadfully (in the true sense of the word) presented by Lang's ""face of the machine"": it has eyes, an avid expression, and a gaping insatiable need.So. The saintly figure of the ""saving grace"", the gentle nurse/link who exists between the haves-and-have-nots is displaced by what is, probably, the most striking visual interpretation of capitalist evil in its most scientifically-produced, unfeeling and machinistic form: the robot. At the time Metropolis was created, this amazing result of laboratory ""tinkering"" wasn't that much older than Shelley's monster and yet, in hindsight, is more realistic. It seems to all of us much easier to create an android/cyborg than to reconstitute/create a person out of left-over parts. Or is this the case?Lang is a sum of his movies' parts (look them up: he produced/directed many more than this one) and, perhaps, one of the most influential film-makers of all time. But what means more to us - his cinematic fluency or his cinematic expertise? Or is there a case for both?Metropolis remains one of the most striking and influential films of its time - on a par with Eisenstein's classics. They both filmed amazing women in amazing circumstances, but had different ways of portraying same. In these days of cynical denial, in some ways Lang offers hope. All we have to do is revisit his work and find it.Well, regardless: the drowning of the workers is symbolic as is their attempted saving by the reconstituted heroine. She is, perhaps, a sigil: a pointer toward the notion that, in the midst of destruction, humanity will find another St Joan. Someone who, when the emergency is over, we can burn at the stake. Or at least blame upon science and/or mysticism. Or a ""have"" with a misplaced sense of fairness.live long and prosper,Paul  :-)"
mchl88,"Mar 18, 2024",7/10,"My thoughts on this 97 year old movie.1- I don't know much about the special effects for movies but I know in 1927 the technology was rudimentary at best. So it's incredible watching this film and seeing some pretty amazing scenes.2- It's a silent movie so expect overacting. It's just how it is.3- That said, the dancing scene is comical (and I don't think it was intented to be)4- there are religious inferences in the plot (the son going down to the underworld to save the workers, the underworld destroyed by a flood, etc) but I'm not sure what the messages are. Other than the blatant one at the end that ""the mediator between the head and hands must be the heart.""5- it's scary that Hitler liked this movie so much he offered to make director Fritz Lang (who was Jewish) and ""honorary Arian (whatever the hell that means). To his credit, Lang fled to Paris soon after."
clivy,"Jul 22, 2011",10/10,"Metropolis is legendary as THE pioneering Science Fiction movie. The mechanical man of the film is clearly recognizable in CP30. Its scenes of the future city are still hugely influential and are referenced in Blade Runner, The Fifth Element, and many other films. Metropolis inspired a whole generation of cartoonists and artists. The creators of Superman named his city after the film, in its honor.Metropolis did an amazing job of forecasting the future. It suggested machines taking the place of people. The mechanical man is not far off: today we have computerized artificial limbs, mechanical hearts, plastic hips, lenses for helping people see, and electrical devices for helping people hear.But Metropolis is much more than a sci fi movie predicting heavily populated cities and robots. It dramatizes issues that greatly concerned the world at the time of its making in 1927: labor relations, the rise of machines, machines taking the place of human workers, the isolation of life in the city, the rise of consumerism.Many of its themes are reflected in Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World, written a few years later in 1931. I thought of Brave New World when I watched the restored version of the film last night. I also thought of H. G. Wells and how he showed workers living underground, enslaved to an intellectual ruling class living in the sunlight.I was surprised to see the vision of Moloch and the workers fed to the demon machines. In Allan Ginsberg's ""Howl"" Moloch is the symbol of consumerised modern culture in the America of the 1950s that crushes the spirit. The end of the poem celebrates freedom of the individual.While technology has advanced greatly since the 1920s the film still echoes fears of technology and business oppressing the spirits of citizens, and fear of losing long held cultural values. It calls out for heart, heart not just as a mediator between head and hands, but for people not to worship Moloch and technology, to remember that they are human and the people around them are human too, even if they belong to a different class, worker or billionaire. It's a message that still calls out to the audience nearly a century later.I appreciate the work of the people around the world who collaborated to restore Metropolis to Lang's original vision. The film is a classic, not just of the science fiction genre. It is as timeless as the legend of the tower of Babel, and is just as much a warning for humanity while praising the glory of man's achievements to remember the glory of God as well."
BB-15,"Feb 3, 2012",9/10,"Over the years I have been watching increasingly longer versions of Metropolis as new footage has been found and put together in different releases. Finally, in 2010 almost the entire movie was released on DVD or Blu-Ray by KINO. And now that I've seen the complete film, I feel I'm able to do an accurate review.* The complete Metropolis is one of the greatest movies ever made, silent or sound. Metropolis has a spectacular use of miniatures, impressive sets and special effects for its time. The original music score (in a new recording by KINO) is one of the best I've heard, fitting every mood. The complete story is interesting with its focus on class, the danger of oppression and anarchy. This complete version now has a back story which explains many of the motivations of the characters. There is also plenty of interesting symbolism in Metropolis including from the Bible and about the structure of society.* But while the restoration of the movie has taken a tremendous leap forward, the new footage has only been partially restored. So, some sections have lots of lines from scratches. It is still watchable though. Hopefully more money will eventually be found to digitally improve the new images. (This kind of digital restoration costs over a million dollars per film so, it's going to take time.)* But my review is about the movie itself. Now that Metropolis is almost complete, we clearly have a brilliant landmark in the history of film."
Steffi_P,"Apr 27, 2008",10/10,"Metropolis  one of cinema's many casualties to cuts, lost footage and general neglect, and yet today it has still become one of the most popular and iconic films of the silent era. Years ago, when I first saw this film in a reduced and very badly put together restoration from the 80s (with the Razzie-nominated Giorgio Moroder score!), I thought it was one of the worst silent pictures I had ever seen. Today (ironically in the then-distant 21st century when the film is supposed to be set) we at last have an adequate reconstruction, with a cleaned up negative, explanations of missing scenes and the original Gottfried Huppertz score, and we can see Metropolis for the masterpiece it is.The first thing that hits you when watching Metropolis is the powerful sense of rhythm, with an attention grabbing montage of industrial machinery. From here on the dynamic, kinetic flow of images is continuous  creating an exciting and extreme form of visual storytelling comparable to the work Eisenstein and Abel Gance. In his previous few films you can see Lang trying to perfect the rhythm and structure of the whole and here he finally manages it. The drama is even structured and labelled like a work of classical music. The ""prelude"" establishes themes and characters and is full of impressive and grandiose imagery, yet never gets too frantic in pace. The ""intermezzo"" begins slowly before building up to the frenzy of the erotic dance/nightmare sequence. Finally, the ""furioso"" section is a tour-de-force of non-stop action. Thanks to the Nibelungen films, Lang had learned by this point to direct crowds and action convincingly.The other strand in Lang's work that reached maturity with Metropolis was his architect's approach to shots and sets. He'd been using geometric patterns and massive interiors since the early 20s, but now you can tell he knows exactly what he's doing. One of the ""rules"" of cinema is the so-called line of action, which means you are supposed to keep the camera on one side only of two opposing actors, so that one is always screen-left and the other always screen-right. Lang completely ignores this rule, freely placing his camera at whichever angle he deems necessary. This technique would become harder for Lang when he moved to Hollywood, where sets were like rooms in a doll's house with three sides only. Here however, every set is a genuine space with four walls, and Lang shows these off to achieve a feeling of reality. This use of space is not just some aesthetic gimmick  it is really used to enhance the film experience. Take for example the scene in which Rotwang captures Maria in the catacombs. Lang cannot exploit fear of the unknown because we, the audience, already know what is happening. Instead, he creates a real sense of enclosure and entrapment with his 360-degree coverage of the cave.The science-fiction setting of Metropolis makes acceptable the over-the-top visual effects of German expressionist cinema (such as double-exposures and animated titles) and, fortunately Lang knew where to draw the line on these flashy techniques. The unreality of the genre also allows for more stylised acting, and the Germans really were the masters of ham. Rudolph Klein-Rogge makes a typically crazed villain. Brigitte Helm also does a good job in several contrasting roles.So long as you can ignore the occasionally daft ideas of screenwriter Thea von Harbou, Metropolis in its current restored version is Fritz Lang's best film. He would make plenty of other classics, and he would always have some level of quality even in the worst of his Hollywood potboilers, but this is his highest peak."
grantss,"Nov 11, 2019",8/10,"Great movie, decades ahead of its time. Even though it was made in 1927, the plot is still original and fresh today. The story, and moral and philosophical depth, is timeless.Truly a classic."
alekspredator87,"Oct 8, 2023",6/10,"Metropolis is a German film by Fritz Lang, a picture that was released almost a hundred years ago. This project is without a doubt an ambitious creation, which is rightfully considered one of the best representatives in the genre of silent cinema, a film that undertakes to convey to the viewer a difficult story in a futuristic world of people where there is a kind of heaven and hell, where some live richly and carefree, while others are amazed in their rights and continue to struggle for existence. And, as in many similar projects that occur before and after in cinema and literature, the world does not remain the same. He's changing. And it changes irrevocably.The film is remembered primarily for its scale. Today, in the age of computer technology and unprecedented special effects, it is difficult to surprise the modern viewer with a luxurious picture. Successful special effects have long been not an end in itself, but rather a narrative tool. But when you contemplate the majestic buildings of the Metropolis, its verified frames that border on unreality, you constantly wonder how the creators achieved such a colossal realism of the frame in those distant years.But, probably, this is the only thing in this project that I really liked. Otherwise, the film seemed ordinary and incredibly long. The original version lasts almost two and a half hours. And although I call it ""original"", it should be noted that it became such only after the Berlin Film Festival in 2010, where a found and restored copy was shown. One was found in Buenos Aires in 2008. Previously, the world knew a picture lasting almost half as long. The ""short"" version was mounted in 1927 and played for decades. I have a feeling that maybe the film was cut for a reason. I quite admit that they left everything they needed. The ""original"" version of 2.5 hours seemed to me wildly long.The actors' acting also causes distrust. I understand that this is the era of silent cinema, where the emotions of the characters were just conveyed by facial expressions and body language, but I saw many films of those years, and the acting was much more convincing there, and the characters were more realistic. Diverse antics and obvious overplaying in the ""Metropolis"" did not benefit the project.After all, Metropolis is an important milestone in the development of world cinema. This project was clearly ahead of its time in its large-scale paintings. A huge city of the future is the fantasy of the creators of the picture, where majestic buildings made of concrete and steel seem to rise above the world itself, giant mechanisms provide life for the population, two different societies that exist in different conditions - all this is a product of its time. And the relevance of what is shown always takes place, even after a hundred years. The viewer will be able to find something that will catch him alive, because the social problems of society do not go away, but only transform. And it is important not to forget the obvious thing that the heroes of the picture convey ""The heart should be the mediator between the head and the hands."" Such a point of view has a right to exist.6 out of 10."
OttoVonB,"Feb 17, 2006",10/10,"From master visualist and storyteller Fritz Lang came this most influential of films. One might say that along with King Kong (1933), M (1931) and Griffith's work it is an essential pillar of cinema, having very obviously inspired 2001 and Blade Runner among classics.In the futuristic (and visually alluring) city Metropolis: workers feed machines as slaves while the rich live decadently in new gardens of Eden. A loving prophet calls for peaceful revolt. An artificial being is created to sew discord between the rebelling slaves. A young prince discovers the suffering his kingdom is built on...Metropolis mostly works as a metaphor, both story-wise and visually (an early shot of a machine spliced with the hungry antique god Moloch, stunning in its own right, only serves to drive home the timelessness of Lang's subject). Today, a lot of it seems dated, yet a lot that stuns wouldn't work in a modern film (where such visual language would disturb or just wring false). Metropolis looked very futuristic at the time, and the design's appeal has only grown with time, becoming a marvelous retro-futuristic beauty.Metropolis was a colossus at the time and remains one to this day, truncated though it is (nevertheless, the Kino DVD released in 2002 restores all the meaning and coherence and is an essential buy).Unmissable, on every conceivable level!"
wsteinhauer,"Mar 9, 2010",3/10,"I know this is a classic, and I appreciate what an effort this was in 1927. But watching it now is only for its historical value. We have come a long way in movie making, and this was one of the first baby steps. As entertainment this film is pretty bad, like a Plan 9 from Outer Space bad. I watched it on Netflix and the print quality was very poor. I am not a fan of silent films, the overly dramatic acting is painful. I will admit that it must have blown away audiences in 1927, but this is not 1927. And now I remember why I do not submit comments to IMDb, the ridiculous 10 line requirement drives me nuts! I'm sorry, I can't drag my review out to that many lines."
FlickeringLight,"Jul 6, 2004",10/10,"Like Terrance Malick's The Thin Red Line, it is a grievous loss to those who love cinema that we will never see the complete film. If we could, Metropolis may well be considered the greatest of the silent films, if it is not already. Fritz Lang's courage for taking on a task such as this was far ahead of his time, and his imagery in this film has proven immortal as it has been used time and again by other directors throughout the history of cinema.Many have commented so eloquently and insightfully here that I have nothing more to offer than what has already been said. Thank you all for augmenting my enjoyment of this great film."
hondaboy,"Sep 13, 2002",8/10,"""What? It's black-and-white? From 1927? And German? Well, I'll never watch that.""Such would be the average response from the average person regarding Metropolis, Fritz Lang's masterwork. Be assured, it is not the average film.As with most older films, we must first remember that what you see on screen had never been visualized in such a way before. Thus, the sheer thought of such stunning ideas as airborne walkways between buildings, entire cities underground, or even the ability to use TV cameras and ""see"" into other rooms (TV didn't hit the big time until the 1940s), was absolutely incredible.And it's shocking that Lang's vision of our modern world would prove so accurate, 70-odd years hence. You will recall that skywalks are fairly common in large cities, airplanes have become far too prevalent, places like Walt Disney World actually do have ""workers' cities"" underground and TV - well, I won't go into TV. And the fact that all of the incredible effects still have the power to awe viewers today, without the use of complex animation or computer graphics, makes the film a treat to watch.The plot is fairly formulaic by modern standards, though it was stirring stuff for the poor and disadvantaged majority of Germany's inhabitants in 1927. Young Freder Fredersen, privileged son of city leader John Fredersen, has an epiphany of sorts when he finds out about the subhuman treatment of the underground workers who keep the city of Metropolis alive. Disillusioned by his father's uncaring attitude toward them, Freder leaves his comfortable surroundings and decides to live underground. To his surprise, the young man discovers a small but influential resistance movement led by the beautiful and mysterious Maria.Maria turns out to be the central point of the story once properly introduced, embodying obvious references to religion (as a way to appease the monotony of daily life). But, later on, she also embodies the problem of centralized power when under her (?) control, the workers finally revolt with perhaps an unintended result.Freder, of course, represents the transformation of man into man-as-machine by uprooting himself from a palatial garden of Eden (literally) and descending into the workings of the massive power plant that keeps Metropolis running. Lang's concept of such a transformation is brilliantly realized in the towering control room where exhausted workmen robotically transfer back and forth along a series of dials and switches, acting only as a ""human valvetrain"" of sorts in an effort to appease the machine. Another device, the ""clock-wheel"", forces Freder to continually keep up with time as each second must be marked by the pull of a lever. Though implausible in design, the wheel is a visible indication of man's futile struggle to beat the clock and work harder.If nothing else, Lang managed to promote the cause of the laborer, though the ending (as well as certain plot points leading to it) is fairly hard to believe given the apparently hopeless situation of the workers and the chilling indifference of the elite.Metropolis is definitely worthwhile, not just for its groundbreaking technical achievements but also for its (sadly) historical impact. It must be mentioned that this was reported to have been Adolf Hitler's favorite film. And while his own plot to free Germany's workers from oppression perhaps began with a noble goal, Hitler's own maniacal and misguided views on race relations and political conduct proved to be horribly destructive for the world as a whole.It would be unfair to say that Lang's impressive achievement managed to cause World War II all on its own, because such a murderous outcome was probably not what the director hoped would result. Like all films, Metropolis must be seen with an eye toward the times in which it was created. It was a fabulous commentary on an overly-technological society back then, and it remains so - perhaps being even more relevant today.Four stars - a classic, and for good reason."

poco-57840,"Mar 31, 2015",N/A,"groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema. How can a movie that'll soon turn 80 years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages. The world has been divided into two main categories: thinkers & workers! If you belong to the first category, you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if you're a worker, your life isn't worth a penny, and you're doomed to perilous labor underground. The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil, so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself. It's essential viewing, anyway! ""Metropolis"" is a very demanding film- experience and definitely not always entertaining. But, as it is often the case with silent-cinema classics, the respect and admiration you'll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoyment-aspect. Fritz' brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to re-create a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines. Many supposedly 'restored' versions have been released over the years (in 1984 and 2002, for example) but the 1926-version is still the finest in my opinion, even though that one already isn't as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it. ""Metropolis"" perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Blade Runner"""
faraaj-1,"Nov 10, 2006",10/10,"Metropolis transcends being a work of genius to being a piece of art that inspired genius. Take for example Dr.Strangelove's gloved hand, Blade Runner's futuristic vision, 2001's uncontrollable machine that is set to destroy man, Frankstein's mad scientist and more recently Gattaca's class-divided society. The vision for all these classics partly derives from this silent German classic which was probably the most expensive made till that time. It holds the honor of being the first film on the UNESCO ""Memory of the World-Register"" list. Metropolis is stunning whether viewed as a great step in cinematic history and achievement, an inspirational sci-fi movie, an epic battle of good and evil, an expressionist masterpiece, a visual tour-de-force or a religious allegory. Unfortunately, despite great care in restoration, the best version available, in fact the only one that does justice to Fritz Lang's original vision, is the 2002 version now available on DVD. Entire chunks of the film have been lost forever and even this most complete of versions is barely 3/4ths of the original release. However, narrative text helps in bridging the gaps.A brief synopsis of the basic setting and central characters of Metropolis: The setting is a futuristic world built on several levels. The lower levels are inhabited by The Hands - workers who use their hands to run the machines. There is no joy in their lives and their depressing setting is accentuated by their dull drab clothing and a horrific sequence where the furnace turns into a monstrous idol's head and they become his sacrificial victims. This is contrasted with the higher levels, open spaces, light clothing, women of pleasure, joy and cheer and the great Tower of Babel. The Tower is home to The Brain - chiefly manifested in Joh Fredersen, an oligarch, businessman and dictator rolled into one. Joh is portrayed brilliantly by Alfred Abel - a man without compassion for the workers, who have been put where they belong! Sitting in his Tower of Babel, he does not know how to communicate with his workers or with mad scientist Rotwang. To mediate between head and heart are born two heroes of the time. There is the virginal Maria who inspires the workers to love and feel compassion. Her angelic visage is used to create a robot that can lead the workers in following Rotwang's destructive agenda. She protects and leads the children during the Great Flood. Joh's son, The Heart falls in love with Maria and is the one destined to either mediate between The Hands and The Brain or die trying.The basic themes and class struggle of Metropolis is given epic form not just by complex themes and heroes and villains. The wonderful expressionist sets - built on a grand scale give it a grandeur that few films even of the digital age can boast. The cinematography and lighting are perfect and there are moments of breath-taking beauty. My favorite is when Maria first addresses the workers - the messianic biblical overtones set a standard for future ""sword and sandal"" epics. The entire sequence where The Heart Freder gets lost in Rotwang's insane house is one of the first great horror scenes. Metropolis is above all a work of great beauty that can be viewed repeatedly to seek new meaning. Just one of many modern parallels would be the Middle Eastern City-State of Dubai with its Babel-like Ivory Towers and the teeming millions of ""remittance-workers"" who are The Hands that built that city."
KnightsofNi11,"Oct 24, 2010",8/10,"Metropolis was a science fiction film made before Star Wars, Star Trek, the moon landing, and even before classic staples like Flash Gordon and Dick Tracy. It's one of the first science fiction films ever made and it marks the beginning of a trend of using the sci-fi genre as a medium for social commentary. Metropolis is set in a futuristic city of the same name as the film. In this city there is a significant divide between the working and upper class. The working class labors endlessly underground, keeping the flourishing city above ground running for all the prosperous and wealthy. These two factions of society see themselves being forced closer when the son of the city's mastermind falls in love with a prophet like woman of the working class. This societal unrest leads to chaos and Metropolis begins to fall apart. The film is ripe with socio-political commentary and all takes place in an immaculate setting that absolutely mystifies.Metropolis is a fascinating film to watch, thinking about it in relation to its time period. The film displays incredibly groundbreaking originality and this film deserves all the credit it gets in setting up the genre of science fiction for the years to come. It is much like Fritz Lang's film he made four years after Metropolis called M. M was the first serial killer film ever made and will always be the root of the lengths at which the genre has traveled since. Metropolis does the same for the sci-fi genre.It is also incredible to see just how much this movie is able to do with what little it is given. 1927 was still the early beginnings of film. The first annual Academy Awards wouldn't be till the following year. And, obviously, Metropolis is a silent film. And yet with such heavy limits on what it can do, the film accomplishes so much more than a lot of films today. The film is fueled by a fascinating story and characters, yet visually it is amazing as well. Fritz Lang was revolutionary in his direction style and Metropolis emphasized this style beautifully. Even in shoddy black and white film, the architecture of this futuristic world is mind boggling and exemplified incredibly by lighting and camera work. There are some incredible moments in this film where you forget you're watching something that was made over eighty years ago. Most surprisingly, however, is that this film actually has special effects. There is one stunning and immaculate scene set in a laboratory where a robot is transformed into the form of a human girl. The scene is equipped with whirring lights and lightning bolts. Of course it is backed only by an orchestral score, which does suit the entire movie very well, heightening the grandeur and drama. For 1927, the visual aspect of Metropolis is astounding.Any time you think of timeless classic, Metropolis is one of the first films that should come to mind. Who knows where the science fiction genre would be, or if it would be at all, today if not for this film. Whether you enjoy the film itself or not, you can't deny that it's influence will always be one of the most important and significant in cinema history."
Brigitte-5,"May 8, 1999",9/10,"Metropolis is a fantastic movie; the best sci-fi movie of its time, and one of the best of all time.  I've seen reviews of Metropolis describe its plot as hopelessly dated, but that isn't accurate at all.  If this movie had been made seventy years later, that might be true, but the fact is that Metropolis was the movie that set the stereotype for distopian-utopian society movies.  It is the original story of how the machines that run a futuristic utopia are oiled with the sweat and blood of the unseen workers. The images in this film are stunning, and the original score for the movie is pretty good too.  Director Fritz Lang did not give himself enough credit for providing the movie with an effective soundtrack.  Rent the version with the original score if you can. The movie is full of symbolism and imagery surrounding society and religion; you could spend a year analyzing hidden meanings within the film -- I would recommend watching this movie 3-4 times to really understand it."
zakthomasnz,"Jan 12, 2019",10/10,"Not only is this film a brilliant genre piece, being the ancestor to many of our modern science fiction. Metropolis stands out as one of the greatest pieces of cinema. Whether you view the original version, or any of its rereleases or reimaginings (personal favourite being Georgio's) this film will forever remain as one of the all time greats. It is grand in scale, and its ambition is only rivalled by its sense of wonder. For any moviegoer this is a must-see."
JLee-2,"Nov 22, 1998",10/10,"Metropolis shows how artful film could be before everyone viewed it as ""mere entertainment.""  The power of the images in this movie is amazing, not just for 1926, but for any time.  This film will never become outdated, anymore than ""David"" or the ""Mona Lisa"" will lose their charm.  It is not simply an ""early film,"" it is a piece of art fashioned with the media of moving images, fixed text, and Desartre pose acting.  These media are no more limited than paint, stone, or prose, and no less effective in the hands of an artist.  It makes me want to quit ignoring old b&w flicks and give them another chance."
wes-connors,"Mar 21, 2008",9/10,"The Future City of Metropolis has two classes of people. The ""Brains"" are the rich and powerful elite class; they enjoy sports, dances and gardening. The ""Hands"" are the throngs of lowly workers; they work 10-hour days, like slaves, and live underground. Leader of the brainy Upper Class is Alfred Abel (as Joh Fredersen). Mr. Abel's son Gustav Fröhlich (as Freder) is, initially, unaware of any discrepancy between the two classes. Lower Class lass Brigitte Helm (as Maria) catches his eye; and, Mr. Fröhlich peruses her to the bowels of the City. Fröhlich is horrified at the treatment of ""Maria"" and the workers; and, he joins their underground revolution. His father, learning of the resistance, enlists the help of scientist Rudolf Klein-Rogge (as Rotwang). Mr. Klein-Rogge is building a ""Machine-Man"" (Robot), which (rather inexplicably) winds up looking just like Ms. Helm.Can the Mechanical ""Maria"" dupe the underground workers into abandoning their plan to destroy Metropolis?While the story and performances are sometimes lacking, the superb look of ""Metropolis"" makes it a city worth seeing.

dataconflossmoor,"Dec 1, 2007",10/10,"This will be the first non-American film that I have posted a comment about!! ""Metropolis"" is an all time classic which induces creative imagery and a dehumanizing montage of robotics into an eerie genre of sensationalism!! This dismal drama is accompanied with lingering classical music theatrics!! The finalization with what we associate with the effervescence of the human spirit has assertively besieged all of society, and heartfelt emotions have become reduced to the precarious improvements of biological progress!! This German film which was made in 1927, perpetuated the trepidations of many people who feared the social pitfalls of mankind!! On the horizon for Germany, was the ubiquitous monster of triple digit inflation, hence, it would stand to reason that they would just engage in a pejorative dissertation concerning the total demise of man's world altogether.. Start with the fact, that in this computerized citadel of negative Utopia, the prevailing moral debasement which afflicted everyone, merely compounded man's insatiable lust!! The perplexities of day to day living evoked a desensitizing callousness with Homo Sapien interaction!! Such cynical speculation delves into a rudimentary exploitation of fear, this is so often times an effective tool for preying on the skepticism of human nature!! I thought this film had a particularly astute message concerning the demise of the individual's resolve and resilience!! ""Metropolis"" was a major indictment of our yearning as a society to unabashedly categorize individuals, stigmatize them, and label them as uniform vermin meat!! This disconcerting generalization of the human race ultimately makes the population very uncivilized!! As a result, all of them would functionally cease and desist as people, and become nothing significantly more than generic chattel!! It is man's greatest fear that women will seek vengeance on man, because women perceive men to be the creatures who relegated them to the plight of submissive automatons!! So what if the shoe were put on the other foot? This would be an in-veritable misogynist's's nightmare!! This movie is an utterly scathing jeremiad against our society's hegemony!! I felt that ""Metroplois"" was very well made, and it was WAY!! ahead of it's time!! Given that this film was made in 1927, the cinematography was spectacular!! ""Metropolis"" ""Battleship Potemkin"" and ""Intolerance"" are considered to be the three best silent pictures ever made!! I thought ""Metropolis"" was an absolutely fantastic film!! See this film as an uplifting outlet for intellectual intrigue!!"
dbdumonteil,"Aug 28, 2001",10/10,"""Metropolis"" is one of the very very few of silent movies which still finds an audience,which means a lot.But which version?The problem is that we will never be able to see ""Metropolis"" as Lang has conceived it. I saw the movie for the first time in 1968,and I remember a scene in which Maria, Rotwang's prisoner,is released by Joh Fredersen.In the versions displayed in the nineties,this scene seems to have vanished in the air.The running time is never the same,some more recent versions include hints at Rotwang's love for Freder Fredersen's mother Hel.But this character,Hel ,never appears in the restored versions:only photographs show this subplot,actually very important:before we thought that Rotwang urges his robot to destruct the machines because ...because..he was crazy:that did not satisfy us.In Thea Von Harbou's original screenplay,he did it out of jealousy,because he used to love his master's wife.For Fredersen ,the robot is first a way to replace working men,tireless slaves ;then,when it takes Maria's face,and the men go crazy and violent,it allows the boss to use violence and repression against them.In Metropolis ,two worlds coexist:the subterranean one,where human beings are in bondage (see Maria's hints at the Bible),the Yoshiwara,the Rich's paradise.Is it really a paradise anyway?It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth ,this paradise for the elite(remember Maria showing it to a group of children)Joh Fredersen,a member of the privileged understands his happiness is a fake one,when he sees first the young girl,then the terrifying underworld,this subcity where the poor sweat ,suffer and die for the sake of an idle aristocracy.The screen play has been often criticized because of its naive political ideology:Heart must be the mediator of work and capital.It has not worn well admittedly,but outside this moral,everything is great,as impressive today as it was in 1927!Do you think that,say,""close encounters of the third kinds"" will stand the test of time as good as Lang's magnum opus,and remain a classic in 2050?Dubious isn't it?The architectural genius of the German Master explodes everywhere,his masterful using of the crowds leaves us in rapture,his dreamlike sequence is at least 20 or 30 years ahead of its time.The characters (Fredersen father and son,Rotwang and Maria) are convincing and the plot is more complex that it seems to be .(the flaws are caused by missing parts of the movie,as I said before)Fritz Lang said:""I do not like Metropolis,its conclusion is wrong.I did not accept it even when I was making the movie""A black legend surrounds ""Metropolis"":Hitler enjoyed it and asked Lang to become the ""official"" director of the Third Reich;he refused,left Germany and it was Leni Riefenstahl who filmed such nazi manifestos as ""Triumph des Willems"".Besides,Hitler might have thought of concentration camps because of ""Metropolis"".Even more bewildering:building in Mauthausen a huge stair,the prisoners said:""it looks like ""Metropolis""""Metropolis is a must,see it at any cost!"
ID_alreadytaken,"Aug 28, 2006",8/10,"OK, first of all. I'm not some kind of action-junkie who thinks that the Rambo-trilogy is the best movies of all time. I am a person who think that other silents like Nosferatu and The Battleship Potemkin are entertaining.Although I loved the previous movies referred to, I thought this was one of the most dull movies ever. As entertainment this movie can't go very far. On a scale rating it's abilities to entertain, it gets a 2/10 from me.As a milestone in the history of movies, it goes all the way to the top. The special effects were great to have been made almost 80 years ago. The editing was great. It must have been one of the most expensive movie made to that date. On the scale of how important a chapter in the cinematic history this is, I will rate it a 10/10.That means a total 6/10. This also means that you should rather check out really good silents like Chaplin's Modern Times, Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin and Murnau's Nosferatu."
TooKakkoiiforYou_321,"Sep 24, 2020",7/10,"The influences this movie had on modern sci-fi and imagery as well as worldwide culture in general are nearly impossible to list, with Star Wars being the first coming to mind.

bjornet,"Feb 7, 2001",7/10,"I must admit that I saw this movie mostly because I thought it would be cool to see an old movie. Although visual effects and sound are areas that have improved a lot since the early years of film-making, I thought that the plot, the directing and the acting of an old movie might be as good as it is in films made today. But unlike other areas of art, like photography or literature, the art of film has really changed to the better over the years.Although Fritz Lang's movie is worth seeing, it is not nearly as well-produced or well-directed as many movies are today. In fact, Metropolis is somewhat of a disappointment. The acting is almost non-existent and the movie focuses far too much on the big scenes, missing out important details.I should say, however, that the political message of the film never gets out of date. If the scenes of Metropolis are considered being symbolic, the futuristic vision of Lang's movie has in some ways become reality."
oldschoolassassin,"May 22, 2008",10/10,"Has slavery truly been abolished? Men and women go to work every day in the world. Some never return. Many work long hours, some even twenty-four hours straight. Many of these jobs are grueling, dangerous and people even die while at work due to overexertion, accidents or negligence. For as hard as these people work many are paid minimum wage; some even less than that. With all of this mind, I believe one can soundly argue that slavery does still exist.I feel the 1927 film Metropolis conveys this. In my opinion, this film is an early political vehicle to persuade its audience to embrace Marxism. I say this because it shows the workers (or proletariat) being exploited, basically worked to death, by the rich (or capitalist bourgeoisie).I also think the Maria character is symbolic of the Christian church. Marx described organized religion as ""the opiate of the masses."" I feel Maria is supposed to be this opiate because: for one, her name is Maria (or Mary) like the mother of Jesus; two, she wears white and is beautiful similar to man's concept of an angel; and three she speaks of mediator (or messiah) who will come and deliver the workers from their plight. This fits with Marx again for he believed religion was used to keep the proletariat subjugated, extolling virtues such as submitting to authority, pay taxes, turn the other cheek, be happy that you are a slave, you will be rich in heaven. This is what Maria said, be patient.I don't feel the film made it completely clear as to why the rich man wanted to use violence against the workers. I wasn't sure if this was to set an example that if they ever tried to rise up and overthrow the powers that be, they would be swiftly punished and perhaps even killed. This seemed a bit strange to me because if all of the workers were killed, who would do the work? I feel this film probably did reach many of its viewers because many probably have similar exploitative jobs. People probably do feel challenged when seeing something like this. However, I feel the problem with this film (as with most other political movies) is that they bring up a problem, complain about it, but propose no practical solution or policy alternative. At the end of the film the ""mediator"" or ""heart"" is uniting the rich man with the worker, or uniting the ""brains"" with the ""hands."" Perhaps Fritz Lang then felt that the audience would be inspired to launch myriad political reforms. I honestly don't know.I honestly feel, for it's time, this was an extraordinary film. I feel the politics of it were expressed explicitly, implicitly, and creatively. And most importantly, this film was very entertaining. The actors were excellent and the directing was phenomenal. I do think the whole purpose of the robot/agent provocateur should have been developed more. I also didn't understand if the scientist was somehow supposed to also represent the church since his robe looked much like that worn by a monk."
A_FORTY_SEVEN,"May 25, 2019",10/10,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠A silent movie. Is it dull because it is important? Not one bit.I watched the Kino restored version by the way and it is the most coherent and intended copy to watch.'Metropolis' is a science fiction motion picture of massive proportions and a visceral mixture of fantasy, apocalypse, class politics and religion.A deep, philosophical masterwork of 20th Century Cinema. An Absolute Must-See Classic."
DerSongsurfer,"Nov 23, 2007",10/10,"There are movies that are good because they are entertaining, there are movies that are good because tell interesting stories, there are movies that are good because of the beauty of then images they contain and there are movies that are good because of being innovative. But only the best ones come up with all of those qualities.Fritz Lang's groundbreaking and breathtaking sci-fi epic Metropolis is certainly one of those movies and without doubt it can not only be regarded as the mother of all science fiction films.Metropolis is an amazing piece of art that unfortunately has been meddled with in the past. Yet the restored version with the original soundtrack gives a good impression of how stunning the film originally must have been.A must-see for everybody that is interested in film."
Lionel M.,"Jun 1, 2000",10/10,"""Metropolis"" is by far one of the greatest films ever made. It is not only entertaining, but deeply true.The sets of this masterpiece were large, cold, and formidable. And the black-and-white film accentuated that aspect, giving the feeling to the audience member the environment of a cold and heartless future.The beginning scene (which is quite famous) where the shift change takes place really spells out (to me) what working-class life can be (just me, I come from one). The scene also made me think that our educational system is set up like that on ""Metropolis"". The students are the workers and the faculty are the ""Super Trustee"".As the film continued, I continued liking it more so. I liked Freder the best because he felt sympathy for the workers, unlike his father, John Fredersen (who ran Metropolis). He (Freder) even offered to work one of the machines for a tired worker. That shows great sympathy I think.Also, I liked how they introduced a staple of modern sci-fi films, the robot. I was amazed on how odd the robot looked, blocky but strangely human.Another thing that caught my eye in this film was all the machines. Scads and scads of them every where. That was one thing my friend told me about before I watched this film was the amount of machines in the movie. I guess that was to hammer in the idea that this was supposed to be the future.""Metropolis"" definitely inspired many films and film-makers. It inspires me to say the least. Few movies can do what this can."
johnnysugar,"Sep 13, 2002",10/10,"This is, without a doubt, one of the finest movies ever made and definitely one of the very best in science fiction.  The newly restored version of the movie is a film lover's dream.  Do not see any other version, especially the desecration that is the Georgio Moroder disaster.For those of you not in the know, ""Metropolis"" is a classic 1927 film about the division between the rich, upper class rulers of Metropolis and the oppressed working class.  A young agitator named Maria encourages the workers to wait for a mediator that will bring the two societies together. Meanwhile, a scientist creates a robot to replace his lost love.  The robot becomes a tool of instigation, of riot, and of revolution.This film was decades ahead of its time, and the imagery in it rivals even the most visionary directors of the modern era.  The use of special effects is extremely impressive for its age, as is the make-up and costuming (most effectively in the cathedral with Death and the Seven Deadly Sins).  I can't remember a more visually engrossing film...and all without the use of sound!My only complaint about the new version is that since about 40 minutes of the movie are permanently lost, simple title cards list the plot points that occurred in the movie where the scenes were lost.  The lost footage sounds amazing...I will forever be haunted by scenes I've imagined in my head.This film is a must-see for anybody who even considers themselves a casual movie-goer.  Yes, it's a little long for people weaned on the crash-boom-bang of Hollywood action films, and yes, it's a little symbolic for people who's idea of a movie star is Freddie Prinze, Jr.  But you owe it to yourself to witness the first true merging of mind and hands.Ten out of 10."
davidslicer,"Mar 27, 2005",10/10,"Being born in the 70s,I was subjected to films in which movies with special effects were done with miniatures,rear projection and front projection,blue screen and model designs.These were normal for films that were released in the 70s and 80s before films went into computers in the 90s.These days a lot of the visuals we see are done through CGI and we are shown worlds that look spectacular and that amaze us.""Metropolis"" is a different story.The film doesn't rely on giving us spectacular ""Matrix"" or ""Fifth Element"" like effects.The film actually gives us a world without being spectacular but imaginary.""Metropolis"" may have been a spectacular vision for its time.But now the film seems more imaginary and more creative.The genius in ""Metropolis"" is not in how the futuristic society is presented to us.Its how the filmmakers came up with the visions.""Metropolis"" which was made in 1926 gave us a world in which we the viewer are not dazzled by the look of the effects,but we are astonished by the creativity.Films like ""Star Wars"" and ""The Matrix"" are different than ""Metroplis"".It's not just the evolution of movie making that pulls these films apart but it's the imagination.When I saw ""Metroplis"",I was more astonished the beauty of the film rather than the effects.The film is not about effects but it's about the imagination that these filmmakers had in making the film.""Metroplis"" is one of the most imaginative and one of the most creative films that I've seen."
andy-227,"Apr 30, 1999",N/A,"This has got to be the greatest science fiction film ever made.  I watched this years ago, and was fairly impressed with it.  That was mainly because the music was dull.  Years later, my opinion changed when the Detroit Institute of Arts reissued the Giorgio Moroder version with the Alloy Orchestra giving a live performance of the soundtrack.  I was blown away! I'll never have an experience as riveting, frightening, exciting, and exhilarating as I did with ""Metropolis"", ever again.  Ever!  It outdoes what many moviemakers have tried to do today.  And that's telling a story and overwhelming the audience with thrills and chills.  This is a classic piece of filmmaking, and I will cherish that experience for the rest of my life. It's rare that I ever feel that way about a movie.  But the way I saw ""Metropolis"" was a one time deal, that I can't relive on video.  It's amazing how powerful a film can be, if only it is backed up with the right music.  Unfortunately, all that exists are $10 copies available on tape and DVD.  Even DVD can't make up for the losses and neglect made to this film.  I pray that this film receives more attention.  Thank God for Giorgio Moroder, or else this film would have been lost forever.It is said that the original film ran 3 hours.  I wonder if it did, or if we'll ever get to see what lurked in those other two hours.  They say it is lost forever, but maybe it's somewhere.  I hope it is.  That would be neat to see the extended canvas to Fritz Lang's great film!"
ArtVandelayImporterExporter,"Dec 9, 2025",6/10,"One could argue Metropolis is the most visually remarkable movies of all time, even a century after it was made. Its futurism obviously influenced the creators of Brazil and Blade Runner. On my third viewing, I even picked up on scenes that frankly looked like they informed Busby Berkely's work.On that level, it is a must-see movie.It's even a darn-good disastere movie in the third act.But here's the problem. It takes nearly TWO hours to get to the action-packed, harrowing climax. There are too many drawn-out shots of people emoting that could have been edited into an hour for Acts 1 and 2 (combined).And all that emoting is in service of what, exactly? Some kind of eco-political message? If you dare to dive into online discussions of Metropolis, people see it (variously) as an allegory of: Christianity, atheism, class warfare, marxism, communism, fascism, capitalism, I probably missed a bunch. In reality, the narrative is mostly a bunch of mumbo-jumbo that weakens the effect of the stunning visuals.Many critics have a particular problem with the ending. By the end I barely cared about the story.But man, the visuals will stick with you, probably for the rest of your life."
Banquo13,"Dec 29, 2002",9/10,"For being 75 years old, this film holds up remarkably well.  The restored version(the most complete to date) gives us a glimpse of what Lang had really intended. The countless cut-up and blurry copies of the past should be thrown out (my ""cheap"" version I bought for $5 has entire scenes that are out of focus!). I was anxious about seeing this version since I had seen the Moroder version back in the 80's and was so turned on by the color-tinting and now-unbearable synth-pop music! However, I must give Moroder credit for getting me interested in this film in the first place.The original score for the film gives the remarkable visuals a solid companion piece and is extremely moving at times.  The film is a visual spectacular; the sets and special effects are quite remarkable for their time. Froelich and Helm are solid as the two driving forces behind the story; although I really had to distance myself from the fact that the excessive gesturing (Helm repeatedly touches her breast in her surprise/amazement in one scene) nearly all the actors engaged in was simply commonplace in silent films. Helm as the ""Machine Maria"" and ""Human Maria"" is simply amazing...her body language tells us exactly which character she is playing; it is a wonder that her career was not as noteworthy after ""Metropolis.""I am eager to see this restored print on DVD and would love to see how therestoration process was carried out--the work here is nothing short of remarkable. I was saddened every time I had to read a ""descriptor"" screen for the scenes that were not recovered and are now most certainly lost forever. Another sad reminder of the legacy of lost movies from an almost-forgotten era."
gavin6942,"May 25, 2011",9/10,"In a futuristic city sharply divided between the working class and the city planners, the son of the city's mastermind falls in love with a working class prophet who predicts the coming of a savior to mediate their differences.Wow. Fritz Lang with history's greatest cameraman, Karl Freund, creates a world of the future that is all too present-day. The pro-labor, pro-union message is blatantly obvious, but presented in a compelling way. Almost in a socialist way, though not quite.I do not even want to write a review of this one because anything I say will not do it justice. I do want to point out the need to watch the ""complete"" version from Kino. I once tried to watch a public domain version, and it was awful. I do not think I made it twenty minutes. Kino knows what they are doing -- the picture is sharp, clear and the score is excellent. And if you are going to watch a film, you must watch it with the footage restored. Sadly, the additional footage has not been cleaned up, but as no negative exists you have to be impressed.With regard to the Giorgio Moroder version (also available from Kino), this is excellent and perhaps a good introduction for those who may not be interested in silent films. Moroder essentially created an 80-minute music video, which may not be strictly faithful to Lang's intent, but makes the film interesting to watch for the MTV generation."
davebrown_boeray,"Nov 10, 2018",10/10,"I saw Metropolis as a kid and was amazed by it. When the new soundtrack version came out it totally blew me away. It's still in my top 5 movies after all these years.It's a story of the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"", filmed extremely well and strongly boosted with the modern soundtrack. There is much treachery and deceit."
jldmp1,"Oct 11, 2006",10/10,"While this is a template for so many later science fiction works, this is not science fiction -- this very clearly is German expressionism, in a line from ""Der Golem"", ""Nosferatu"", etc.The key is that none of this is about 'plot' or 'story'; those things we normally associate with narrative films are products and afterthoughts here. The point of the departure of this movie is -vision-, yes, even cinematic vision, I would argue, much more than mere imagery.This is all about thinking big, having big vision. Remember that this was made at a point in time when very big opposing political and cultural ideas were coalescing and on their way to full frontal impact with each other, most obviously capitalism v. socialism.It's all about pushing limits: pushing the limits of imagination, of plausibility, of perspective, of architecture, of logic and of emotion. And...the entire -way- this is filmed, edited and intertitled pushes the limits in an astonishing synchrony with the actual visual content.Many have tried and most have failed to better this...the smartest successors to this found their own groove: ""Bladerunner""...""Brazil""... those come to mind.The best silent film ever made? Top three, no question."
rosscinema,"Dec 8, 2002",8/10,"I just saw this restored version in the theater and I have to be honest that I didn't love this film and I've run into a lot of people who feel the same way. I do think its great on certain levels like the sets are incredible and I think the visual effects stand up pretty well over the course of time but the one thing that obviously stands out is Langs vision. He was definitely ahead of his time and nobody else had stories like Lang. Some of the scenes in this restored version are still so clear that they look like they were filmed recently. At least on the big screen they did. I don't think this is Lang's best film by a long shot. My favorite is one that doesn't get mentioned enough, ""M"" with Peter Lorre. But this is still a visual treat from a great visionary director. I think it is a little long and certain scenes drag but this is definitely a film that should be viewed by all. Especially film historians and buffs. One of those interesting films that can be discussed at great lengths when its over. That in itself is a compliment."
artzau,"Jan 8, 2002",9/10,"Set aside the stylized acting, the seamy effects, the ham-laden posturing and the improbable depictions of the future, and consider these in terms of 1927 when Fritz Lang released this amazing film.  It works.  The elements of a class struggle taking place a scant 100 years from the time of great upheaval in Germany, must likewise be considered within the context of the times of this film.  Lang was right on cue.  While this film lacks much of the modernity of his later ""M,"" it nevertheless is a marvelous piece of work.  The Georgio Moroder version which adds a daring sound track to this dark prophetic film gives it a soft sparkle which stays in the mind, long after the film has been seen. It is just simply amazing.  The controversy over the emergence of the saying, ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" which was used over the gates of Auschwitz, was not of Lang's doing.  Lang was a refugee in the US during WW2 and was reportedly horrified at hearing how this motto was (ab)used.  For a long time,  the film was tacitly censured for this small scene and interestingly enough, it is omitted not only from the Moroder version but from several versions.  I was fortunate enough to see an uncut version many years ago in Berkeley and remember it well. I'm delighted that the Moroder version is coming out in DVD.  If you are a serious buff of early 20th century films, this is a definitely must-see."

Without this, I truly doubt that cinema would be the same.Skip all versions of this movie but the digitally restored 2002 version (it is by far the most complete version).  It also contains the music that was played at the premier, which I thought was superb.

rogierr,"Nov 20, 2001",N/A,"On January tenth 2002, Metropolis will be 75 years old, so I'm taking this opportunity to write the 75th comment 8-)Metropolis artistically is one of the best examples of the glory days of the German cinema (besides Caligari and Nosferatu), although it wasn't initially a big hit and unfortunately one of the biggest fans of the movie was A.H. who was especially charmed by the huge and institutional sets. Cinematographers Karl Freund (Key Largo '48, der Letzte Man '24) and Gunther Rittau (Nibelungen '24) accompanied by set designer Edgar G. Ulmer (Detour '45, the Man from planet X '51) could not have feared bigger disillusion than that admiration of the aspirant dictator.  Lang was asked to make propaganda films and decided to leave the country not long after 'M' (1931). Fortunately (witness their filmographies), Lang and Freund and Ulmer continued their careers fairly succesful in the U.S.  Correct me if I'm wrong.So far for the trivia.  Metropolis is full of messages that have become quite obvious for todays audiences.  Director Fritz Lang (M '31, Nibelungen '24) ventilates his scepticism about technological and industrial progression, in a way Chaplin could only wish for with his mockery in Modern Times (1936), and was a further inspiration for many others (like George Orwell, Terry Gilliam, and some people who probably didn't even know it, like in 'the Fifth Element') with the concept of a love story set in a mechanical and grotesque surrounding: definitely hostile with the extremely two-sided society.  George #11811 falls in love with a workers' daughter, while the dehumanized workers have become some sort of slaves for a few rich people, who are born rich and stay rich.  Most of the time the film feels like some sort of opera.  The story is not constantly enjoyable and the film will be a disappointment for many people who are expecting something outrageously jaw-dropping.  It's not and that's not the point.  The point is something like Gilliam's point in 'Brazil' (1985) where dreams fight against a dystopic system.However there ARE some really awesome specialFX.  Like those you can see in that video clip 'Radio Gaga' by Queen.  Some of the sets probably stood model for Blade Runner (Scott, 1982) and the video-phone idea was used by Kubrick in '2001 a space odyssey' 42 years later.  Todays filmmakers who want to make impressive movies still could learn a lot from Metropolis' appropriateness.  But that suggestion may come much too late, because most big SF disaster movies were already released in the late nineties (Deep Impact, Armageddon, Independence Day, Godzilla and the disaster itself Star Wars Ep. 1) and are box-office successes but artistically inferior.  But anyhow, it is an understatement that this film inspired others...  See for yourself; my favourite examples are given above.  I hope some restored version will be released in January 2002.  Edited by Terry Gilliam and with an authentic-like score.  Something like that fine new score of 'the Wind' (Sjöström, 1928).The choice of soundtrack is of extreme importance in this film: there are several different scores from the past fifty years (all pushing forward their own futile perception of the film) from which none has come close to something acceptable (check before you buy).  I haven't heared the Queen-score, but I was lucky enough to see Metropolis on a big screen with very pleasing live music that gave the film an impressive and authentic feel.  Some scenes that focused on the love story in the film weren't interesting, but still crucial for the story I think.  Classic amongst classics or not, 75 years or not, there are pointless and tedious parts. But I have no choice but to give it the highest vote.10 points out of 10 :-)"
dkncd,"Nov 24, 2007",8/10,"""Metropolis"" is Fritz Lang's early entry into the science-fiction genre. For me the premise recalls H.G. Wells' novel ""The Time Machine"", where the division between managers and laborers has become so strong that the laborers are sent to live underground. The dystopian city setting is a forerunner to similar settings in films such as ""Blade Runner"" (1982). The visuals are certainly impressive and an amazing achievement for a 1927 film.The actors wear far too much makeup and the acting is especially blunt at points, but overall the performances are decent and the characterizations interesting. Particularly of note is Brigitte Helm in her dual role as Maria and the ""Robot"". She is a convincing advocate for peace and it was effective how she used facial expressions to make the distinction between her two characters.The distinctions between managers and laborers are well-developed. Depictions of downtrodden workers marching in unison were becoming to show the sharp distinctions between the classes of Metropolis. In the first half of the movie the story and characterizations are well-developed and interesting, but the second half was not as consistent. The latter half has a solid story and notable scenes, but a number of the scenes linger too long, such as the catacomb chase. Many write that restoring more footage to this film would make it better, but for me judicious editing in the later portions of the film would be more beneficial. None the less, ""Metropolis"" is a notable early entry into the science-fiction film genre."
room102,"Oct 10, 2015",7/10,"Haven't seen it in ages. I'm trying to watch the 2010 version. I'm watching it in parts and watched 1.5 hours (out of 2.5 hours). This version is WAY too long. Really hard for me to rate/judge this movie. It's classical, it has some great achievements and visuals - and obviously it influenced a lot of movies afterwards - but I can't say I enjoy watching it. The movie doesn't ""flow"", the editing (especially in the 2010 version) is way too slow with shots that are way too long and the entire structure of the movie seems to be problematic.The acting is very ""expressionistic"" and highly unnatural. I know it's the genre and the fact of it being silent, but it's still weird. There are a lot of silent movies (e.g. Chaplin, etc.) that aren't acted so unnatural. I don't think even ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (which came out 7 years earlier) is that unnatural in acting (only watched it once, years ago, so I really can't remember).Rating this movie is very difficult. Based on its achievements and influence it should get a very high rating. But based on enjoyment from today's point of view, I can't give it a high rating.BTW, ""Star Wars"" reference - Obviously, the robot is a direct influence, but I was surprised to listen to the (original) score of Metropolis - parts of it reminded me of John Williams' score to ""Star Wars"". Is that a coincidence? Was the original score available before 2010? Could Williams have heard it when writing the score to ""Star Wars""?"

When those workers just walk like robots, when the machine grins like a wild animal and of course when the worker cheats on The boss's son, they are all reflecting the truth which lies just around us, but we just can't see it, yet it governs all the thing about us.I found this movie way interesting, but the most interesting thing about the movie is the simplicity of each scene and the direct message of it."

There is reference to a Babel and a very high tower which is constructed and more about moral living like the Bible teaches and the possible establishment of everyone coming to a mutual understanding that the working class of people and the rich must join hands, hearts and souls and all work together. This is truly a great masterpiece from 1927 which was way beyond its years."
rbverhoef,"Jun 15, 2003",10/10,"This is the first great science fiction film and great it is. A lot of things in this movie we have seen over the decades in other movies. The scientist, the city, the hero who discovers things he didn't knew. Considering its time the movie looks incredible. The city and the special effects are great.The story is about Freder (Gustav Fröhlich), a son of the dictator of Metropolis, who discovers how things work in the city. A woman Maria (Brigitte Helm) from the Workers' City, below the surface of the earth, shows him how the workers live. Freder goes down to help the workers. Their leader is Maria who is taken after a meeting by the scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). He keeps her imprisoned in his home. He was creating a robot and now he makes the robot like Maria. Now the workers who will follow Maria can be controlled by the dictator John Fredersen (Alfred Abel).There are so many great scenes in the movie, you have to see that for yourself. The performances are terrific, especially the performance of Brigitte Helm who was Maria and the robot who looks like her. The direction is great as well, but the thing you will remember from the movie are the single images. See for yourself what I mean."

Shakespeare-2,"Feb 11, 2003",N/A,"Last night, I saw the most recently restored version of ""Metropolis"" at an art-house/repertory cinema. I am 46 going on 47. The demographic in the theater, on the contrary, was heavily stacked in favor of the college crowd. I assumed the majority were young film students coming to see one of the all-time classics.To my great sorrow, I distinctly heard snickering around me during the film. No doubt, the object of their ridicule was the exaggerated facial expressions and gestures of the actors in Fritz Lang's masterpiece. That I grant you. Perhaps, too, a decade after the fall of communism, the young people could afford to look down their noses at the naivete of Lang's message of understanding and cooperation between capital and labor. (""The mediator between the head and the hands must be the heart!"")I dare say, too, the young people of today are not conversant with the many biblical references and images that Lang uses to tell his tale. For instance, he compares machinery to Moloch, the pagan god to whom parents sacrificed their children in Old Testament times. Lang also reappropriates the Tower of Babel myth, combining it with images of Hebrew slavery in Egypt before Moses the deliverer came along. Maria's sermon preaches a messianic hope, against a backdrop of crosses and candles, in the catacombs, no less.But surely the college crowd cannot have been mocking the technical brilliance of ""Metropolis"". Filmed 75 years ago, long before the special-effects wizardry of our own era, Lang's film is breathtaking in its visual impact, its architectural vision of the future, its depiction of a world where man is dominated by machines.At times, Lang's art-deco inspired Metropolis is uncannily prophetic (and, for us, reminiscent) of the Nazi and Fascist milieus of the 1930s. It is precisely this vision of the future -- and not only the distant future, but (even more eerily) the future only a few years away -- that is Lang's greatest achievement.I defy any director of our time to adapt and retell the story of ""Metropolis"", and do it half as well as Fritz Lang did.One final note: I saw this latest version of ""Metropolis"" mainly to hear the original score. I must admit I liked the ""Metropolis"" theme best of all. There was one piece (I forget where in the film) that seemed to me somewhat inappropriate and out of place. On the whole, it was fine music. Still, I remain fond of the more modern Giorgio Moroder score (plus songs by various artists, such as Freddie Mercury) in the partially colorized version of ""Metropolis""."
artpf,"Sep 27, 2013",6/10,"Extraordinarily long movie -- especially for a silent film. Nearly 2.5 hours.Reviewers here talk about the futuristic look of the film, and that's true. And it is impressive, but there are also reference to other ages - - the Pharaohs of Egypt...the Tower of Babel, etc. In the end, it's the art deco artistry that makes it still appear fresh.The story is sort of dumb. Have and have nots. Same theme Obama plays day in and day out and the agenda has really gotten long in the tooth.The acting is rather wooden to be quite frank, and surprising considering this was made in 1927, not 1917. By the time of the beginning of the sound era, silent film acting learned to be natural, not stagy. But stagy this is for the most part and it really detracts from the power of the film.For example the make lead over acts so badly that it's actually hard to watch him when he's on the screen. The make up used is also over done and surprising for the year. Once again, it takes away from the power of the film.In the end, the film's message is dated. Capitalism won, get over it.Still, the look of the film is what brings you back. Not the acting and certainly not the story line. It's all about the artistry of the sets and back drops. But 2.5 hours? Is there a Cliff Notes version?And just an aside. In these types of films, -- the ones that take an overtly leftist point of view, why are the male protagonists always so effeminate? The guy in this film should be wearing a dress.If the acting was better, the characters more interesting than cardboard cutouts, and the story not so heavy handed in the way it was told, I would have given an additional 2 stars, but I just couldn't. It gets a six."
StrictlyConfidential,"Mar 27, 2020",6/10,"1927's ""Metropolis"" is a silent-era SyFy film whose story of a world ruled by a tyrannical technocracy is set 100 years into the future (in the year 2026).I think that it's quite interesting to note that even back 90 years ago, man's future certainly looked pretty bleak and not very hopeful, at all.For its time - ""Metropolis"" definitely had some really impressive visuals to boast about to its credit. It was especially the robot in this film that certainly grabbed my attention."
ritesh2k,"Jan 3, 2018",5/10,I was excited about the movie after reading the reviews but I have to say the this movie just not makes sense in 2018. It must have been a master piece in 20's but after almost 90 years it has lost all its relevance.
billycaseus,"Oct 2, 2002",10/10,"There are so many innovative scenes and so much brilliant cinematic essence in this movie that words would not nearly express what the actual viewing of the film will do to a human soul. If you are a fan of science fiction then you should know this is the birthmother (or father) of your fetish.  If you are not a fan of science fiction you will still enjoy the movie- considering you appreciate the film for its time.  You can see the love and passion that was put to this film just oozing from the screen. Take a look at it once for its story, then again for its effects, and yet once again for its effects."
JohnHowardReid,"Dec 7, 2006",10/10,"There are quite a few versions of Metropolis extant in this year 2006. There never was, as might be imagined, a master print from which the various versions have been cut. At least two negatives were originally prepared because every scene was shot with two cameras, one operated by Freund, the other by Rittau. This was not an uncommon practice in silent days, the theory behind the exercise being that one negative would make prints for home consumption, the other for overseas. What usually happened, however, was that the director made a combined master cut of the best footage from whatever source for the home print, while the second-rate shots were assembled into the export negative.In this particular case, the export negative was sent to Paramount where it was re-edited by Channing Pollock. Over the years, the original Ufa negative wore out and the Paramount negative was shortened again and again. Ufa assembled another negative from off-cuts in 1934. Although one had a shorter running time than the other, it yet contained scenes and sequences not represented in the longer version.Thanks to the enterprise of the F.W. Murnau Foundation, a concerted effort was initiated to assemble as complete a version as possible. This rescue operation got underway in 1986 and has resulted in the superb print (complete with the glorious original music score by Gottfried Huppertz) now marketed by Kino Video. This version runs 124 minutes and is likely to remain the best Metropolis for all time. True, there is a rival ""restored"" version that runs 147 minutes, but this contains no extra motion picture footage (in fact, slightly less) but makes extensive use of stills and sub-titles to substitute for missing scenes. In my view, this makes Metropolis somewhat of a chore to sit through, as it breaks the viewer's attention and feeling of continuity. In the Murnau Foundation/Kino restoration, missing sequences are very briefly and succinctly summarized. They are not intrusive, but can easily be accepted simply as descriptive titles. In fact, this version is gripping, fascinating, bizarre, over-the-topeverything that will delight the sci-fi fan. True, some of the acting seems a bit exaggerated (Alfred Abel is always admirably restrained, as is Fritz Rasp, but Frolich and Klein-Rogge are inclined to let their emotions run away with them, while Miss Helm, alas, often seems to be giving a bad Lillian Gish imitation in her goody-goody role. Fortunately, she's just wonderful as the sensuously wicked robot)."
spacemonkey_fg,"Jan 31, 2006",10/10,"Title: Metropolis (1927Director: Friz LangCast: Alfred Abel, Gustav Fröhlich, Brigitte Helm, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Fritz Rasp, Theodor LoosReview:The era of silent German expresionism films ushered in a lot of horror/sci fi/fantasy movie. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Faust, Destiny, Nosferatu and Metropolis are just some of the most commonly known examples of this time. As I continue to discover films of this era, I continue to be blown away by the imagination and hard work that went into making these films in a time of limited technology.Metropolis takes place in 2026, the future. The people who live in the city of Metropolis are devided into two different groups. The poor who live in the underground catacombs and the rich who live in the ultramodern facilities above ground. The owner of the city called Joh Fredersen is in charge of the whole city. When his son decides to wonder to the depth of the city in search of his newest love interest...he discovers the horrendous conditions under which the working class work and live, and he soon decides that he will help the thinkers above ground and the workers below to unite as one.The movie has a very idealistic storyline that some people are not to fond of. For me, I thought it was great because I thought that maybe to us right now the story might not seem to relevant (though I'm sure some people will relate to it) but to the people living in the era of the great depression, with many people being jobless and hungry, well, I'm sure the themes touched upon in this flick were very very relevant in those days.Thing is maybe todays working class don't suffer as much as they did in the past, but I'm sure to some degree people who work in a factory or in an office will find a degree of interest in these themes. Same themes were touched upon in Charlie Chaplins Modern Times which I think is the only other movie that can be compared to Metropolis in terms of themes.Also the film is filled with many religious allegories. The girl called Maria, The son of the owner of Metropolis acts as a mediator between the rich and the poor sort of like a Jesus Christ figure. There's many more religious references all through out the film, so be on the look out for that.Anyhows, enough about themes and story...lets get to one of the best things about this movie. Its visual flare! I was truly amazed to see the level of detail that Friz Lang and his crew achieved with this movie. Towering skyscrapers in a city filled with lights and extravagant arquitecture. Gigantic sets depicting humongous machines twisting and turning, it all blew my mind. One of the machines the workers labor on..""The Moloch Machine"", wow, it just has to be seen to be believed. The sets and visual effects on this movie were some of the best for its time, and still look amazing to this day.The iconic ""Machine Man"" that the Rotwang the scientist creates in the film, is the grand daddy of C-3PO and The Terminators exo-skeleton or any other robot on any film. The sequences in which they are putting skin on the robot look amazing from a special effects point of view, specially considering that this movie was made 80 years ago! There's many visual delights that await whoever sees this movie. I know I was blown away when I saw the evil Maria doing some erotic dancing over at Rotwangs place. Its just visual eye candy. And speaking of the character Maria, I think that the actress who portrayed Maria (Brigitte Helm) really showed she could do her thing. Her facial expressions and contorted body gestures when she was evil really sold me on her. Plus her scenes dancing in the nightclub were really something.Of course there's some getting used to while seeing a silent film. I got used to filling in the blanks as they spoke in my mind. This helped me a great deal to follow the story. Also every single body expression and facial movement counts, so don't take your eyes off the actors.The movie is long, its original running time was well more then two hours long. But right now since 25% of the film is considered completely lost, well, this is the most complete version of the film available. (The KINO version) It clocks in at two hours. The visual clarity is superb. They really did an incredible job in digitally restoring this film. I'm sure that this is the best treatment that this film is going to get, so if your a fan of German Expressionism, and you like your movies to look pristine and not like they were picked up from the bottom of a rusty garbage can, then this is the version to get.So if you want to see what a true sci-fi masterpiece looks like, a true visual tour de force, and one of the most important German Expressionism films ever made, then look no further then Friz Langs Metropolis.Rating: 5 out of 5"
chrisgomez_01,"Sep 20, 2011",9/10,"Having missed the epic 2010 restoration (which added about 25 minutes of material back from a newly-discovered, low-quality 16mm print) upon its release, I was pleased to be able to catch it a year later at a local cinema as part of a science fiction series.What I liked most about the film was Gottfried Huppertz's exquisite score, which has strong themes, and is richly orchestrated and very prominent. The love theme between Freder and Maria is particularly lovely, and the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra's sometimes audible page-turns add greatly to the atmosphere.This is the first silent film I've seen (other than Christmas Charlie Chaplin fare as a kid), and it was intriguing to see how much could be expressed with only body language and the sparing use of intertitles. Brigitte Helm in particular did a remarkable job of playing both Maria and the robot - two very different roles - especially now that I discover that she would only have been about 20 at the time.The central opinion that the film promotes, repeatedly and pretty forcefully, is that ""There can be no understanding between the hands (the workers) and the brain (the ruling class) unless the heart (a third party) acts as mediator."" I'm not sure that I go along with the idea that using a mediator will solve the problems of workers being oppressed by their bosses, as if it were all just a misunderstanding. But it's a start, and watching the argument play out for two and a half hours is a lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon."
nebula-13,"Jan 21, 2000",N/A,"I like SciFi. Sophisticated, hardcore SciFi. Starships and Lightsabers aren't SciFi. Metropolis is, it still looks planted deep in the future despite the funny looking 20's clothings, cars and biplanes, much more than Starwars... Made over 70 years ago, Metropolis is still one of the best pictures ever made. Lang's masterpiece inspired many other filmmakers (See ""Bladerunner""). He used Special effects and camera tricks to create magnificent metaphors in a way few filmmakers can or dare to do. If you like good SciFi, or if you just in for a good film, go see ""Metropolis""."

fairy_tale_princess,"Mar 4, 2005",1/10,"This film has to be one of THE most boring films I have watched in a while... It is in black and white for a start, which I personally find really annoying, and the music that has been put on it really does NOT suit it, without the cheesy music, it might have been alright... I guess that I also don't like the film because I have had to watch the beginning of it sooo many times (coursework on the opening sequence). The opening of the film is enough to put anyone off the film, as it is so tedious and it just drags on for what feels like forever... A lot of the shots at the start o the film all look the same, and it is very, very repetitive."
FerdinandVonGalitzien,"Feb 26, 2010",8/10,"At this time of the new millennium it is a miracle that even today some lost silent footage from the last century can turn up, emerging from the darkness and allowing a new generation of silent fans to take a look again at those old and forgotten images. Miracle of miracles, some of that rediscovered silent footage belongs to one of the icons of the film history, Herr Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" (1927)""Metropolis"" is one of those few silent films well-known to everybody in these modern days, from aristocrats to commoners, so it is not necessary to say too much about the story of the film, a fascinating futuristic picture that in the background has elements of social criticism influenced by the troubled old Weimar days, a film that through the times suffered many mutilations and revisions, from abridged versions to even a modern pop music version. In 2008 a 16 mm. negative was found in Buenos Aires so finally there was the chance for silent fans, 80 years later after its premiere ( obviously this Herr Graff attended the original premiere in Berlin ) to watch a version of ""Metropolis"" very close to its original condition thanks to an additional thirty minutes.The film was recently restored by the ""Murnau Foundation"" and was screened at the ""Berlinale"" film festival where elegant Teutonic people enjoyed the restoration in a warm theatre while interested commoners watched the film at the Brandenburg Gate on a freezing night. Ah, the social class struggle continues even after 80 years, just as it happens in the film.""Continuity"" is the best word to sum up what this new ""Metropolis"" restoration brings to the story. Now the pace of the film becomes more rapid, especially at the thrilling climax. Some narrative gaps, admittedly not very important ones, are filled; we see more of the character of the thin man ( Herr Fritz Rasp ) Herr Joh Fredersen's spy and there are also interesting scenes of the vice at ""Yoshiwara"" district.Certainly ""Metropolis"" has been enjoyed by generations of silent film admirers who appreciated its futuristic setting, the incredible decors, special effects and technique, the different performers acting and overacting , and the social dimension of the story. In spite of suffering many mutilations through the years, the power of the film was undiminished, as one would expect of a masterpiece. It even survived the pop adaptation done by the longhaired generation; this was a dubious approach to a silent but effective as a way of getting youngsters acquainted with this great film. Finally though, after all these years, the film can be seen at its best, much like the way Herr Graf remembers it at the premiere at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo cinema in Berlin. We can appreciate the film fully now, not to mention that we are finally living now in the early XXI century, the time ""Metropolis"" is set in!And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must decide who he should invite for tea, Maria or the robot.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com"
Hey_Sweden,"Jul 29, 2018",9/10,"The impressionable Freder (Gustav Fröhlich) is the son of an industrialist in a world of the future. In this world, all the upper class members live among the clouds, in luxury, while the blue collar workers who maintain the numerous machines live dreary existences. Freder, entranced by the outspoken Maria (Brigitte Helm), decides that the workers are his friends, and rebels against his tyrannical father (Alfred Abel). Meanwhile, a mad scientist / inventor (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) assists the father in his schemes by giving his robotic creation ""the machine man"" (also played by Helm) Maria's likeness, and having this fake Maria incite the workers to violence so that the dad can use violence against them.Considering that this early Fritz Lang masterpieces is over 90 years old, it's quite the stylish accomplishment. The sets, the photography, and the special effects are amazing, especially when you see how Lang is doing all of this on a grand, epic scale, leading to a destructive finale that works as an ancestor to the ""disaster film cycle"" that came along almost half a century later. The provocative screenplay (written by Thea von Harbou, based on her novel) makes one think about such things as the advent of unions, unsafe working practices, mistreatment of the lower class, and, of course, the way that people would come to rely so much on machines and technology for their continued existence. Since the film is now available in an almost-complete version (about 25 minutes worth of footage were discovered not that long ago in Brazil), it's a very long and deliberately paced fable, one that wouldn't suit viewers with shorter attention spans. It also bears the mark of many silent films, with some VERY enthusiastic acting from some of the principals.Still, it's hard to deny the absolute passion brought to this project by the filmmakers and cast. It has wonderful atmosphere, carrying a feeling of despair that ultimately climaxes with a sense of hope for the future. The big set piece of Metropolis being flooded is some genuinely exciting stuff, and will have even modern audiences marvelling at how Lang and company pulled this off.Lastly, it's a superb melding of memorable images (such as the look of The Machine Man) with the excellent music composed by Gottfried Huppertz. (Various other composers have taken a stab at writing for this classic over the years.)Future noted genre writer Curt Siodmak (""The Wolf Man"", etc.) has an uncredited bit as one of the working men.Nine out of 10."
